                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      All shut down and powerless
  - Popular destinations shrouded in smokescreen        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              The authorities of Peter Cat (top) and Music World and Flurys (above) are unsure when they would be able to open doors again.

	Stephen Court for most Calcuttans means Flurys or Music World or Peter Cat. They are all housed on the ground floor but they remain shrouded in the smokescreen of the devastating blaze.        
	A meeting was held with the owners of the commercial establishments on the ground and first floors. The only problem in allowing them to reopen is restoring power supply, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, member, mayor-in-council, Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The power supply can be restored only after the wiring system of the building is checked by the West Bengal Power Development Corporation officials. It will take some time, he added.        
	Metro runs a check on how some of the popular destinations are coping.        
	Flurys: We cannot say when we will be allowed to reopen, said Anirban Simlai, the unit head of The Park hotel. As a stop-gap measure the signature beans on toast and rumballs will be available at The Street in The Park hotel from Friday. We have decided to make most of the Flurys counter items available at The Street, while some of the breakfast bites will be incorporated in the sit-down menu, added Simlai.        
	Music World: We dont have any idea when we can reopen the store, since there is no communication from the civic body or police yet. We also dont know when the regular services like power and water would be resumed, said Chetan Arora, the business head (east) of Music World Retail Ltd.        
	Music World Park Street employs around 50 people and many of them have been relocated temporarily to the other stores in Forum mall, Dhakuria, South City and Rashbehari Avenue. Since merchandising and warehousing are done out of the Park Street premises, a lengthy shutdown might affect business in all outlets.        
	Peter Cat: Honestly, I have no clue about when we can reopen, since no information is forthcoming from the authorities. In fact, we still havent been allowed into the premises and dont know if there has been any water seepage or not, said Nitin Kothari, the owner of the eatery most popular for Cello Kebab.        
	Jet Airways: The regional headquarters has been shifted to Rawdon Chambers at 11A Rawdon Street, which is the office of Jet Air, a subsidiary company. The authorities have not been able to tell us when we can reopen the office. Power has not been restored yet, said a Jet Airways official, adding that the relevant phone numbers now would be: 22901743/44; call centre: 39893333.

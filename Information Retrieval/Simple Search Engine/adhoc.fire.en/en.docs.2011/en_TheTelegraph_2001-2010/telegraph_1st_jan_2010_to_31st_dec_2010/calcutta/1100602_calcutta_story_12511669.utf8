The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Panic on train in tunnel of chaos
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Panic on train in tunnel of chaos
  - Shouts of fire, fear of fleeing feet and the wait for word from Metro          POULOMI BANERJEE                                    
	Around 2.45pm, minutes after I had boarded the Chandni Chowk-bound Metro from Sovabazar, the train came to a sudden halt. Girish Park, the next station, was some distance away. What was wrong? Just then, a man came running, followed by a stream of passengers, all headed towards the rear of the train. Fire, fire, someone shouted.        
	Panic. I joined the jump up-and-run queue making its way away from the fire, apparently in the second coach from the front. I heard an explosion and smoke filled the compartment. I couldnt breathe, claimed a passenger.        
	Chaos. At one point, squashed near the vestibule, I felt I was going to fall and be trampled by fleeing feet. Where are the Metro officials? Isnt there anyone on the train? wailed a woman. My mind was playing tricks. I remembered standing on Park Street and watching people screaming from the top floors of a blazing Stephen Court. Form a line and move on, two people at a time. Dont panic, shouted some passengers who were thinking straight. We all obeyed, thankful that someone had taken charge.        
	Wait. With everyone squeezed into the last couple of coaches, and the train still stuck in the tunnel, we waited. If it had been something serious, the lights would have gone out, right? a girl asked me. I tried to smile reassuringly, but failed. Then, an alarm went off. And finally, the announcement. The train will start soon. There is a technical problem. Stay calm, barked a man. The train started moving, inching towards Girish Park. The smell of smoke hit us.        
	Relief. As soon as the doors opened at the platform  after being stuck in the tunnel for around 20 minutes  all passengers poured out. Many ran towards the exits. I joined the angry crowd outside the control room. The least you could have done is announce what the problem is. Do you know how panic-stricken we were? shouted a fellow passenger. We were told that the rake was unsafe and so the few who remained were put on another train.        
	Officialspeak. Later, when I called up Metro Railway for official word on the incident, the drone was: Around 2.46pm, after the train left Sovabazar, the MR pipe, which controls the brakes under a coach, burst and the train came to a halt. The smoke and the sound came from that. The train was somehow dragged to Girish Park, where all the passengers were asked to get down and the train was sent to Tollygunge.        
	As a reporter, I guess the explanation was enough. As a passenger on that train, I knew it wasnt.

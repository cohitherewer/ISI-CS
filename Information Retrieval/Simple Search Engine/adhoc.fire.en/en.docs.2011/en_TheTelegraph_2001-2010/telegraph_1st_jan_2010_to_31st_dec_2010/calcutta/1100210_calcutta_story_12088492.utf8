The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A private eye on Eden
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A private eye on Eden
          SUBHRO SAHA AND ZEESHAN JAWED                                            
	Lalbazar says it does not want to do it all. The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) says it cannot do anything at all.        
	So who can and would want to help Lalbazar and the CAB provide full security cover to the Eden?        
	Private security agencies, of course.        
	If  or maybe when  Calcutta police do manage to curtail its role at the Eden, and the CAB has to outsource part of the security arrangements, what can private security agencies possibly do?        
	Metro prepares a checklist.        
	Cant do        
	There are obvious constraints, not the least being the fact that only military and para-military personnel are allowed to carry automatic weapons.        
	Under the Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act, security guards are licensed to carry only side-arms like pistols, revolvers and shotguns. They can only open fire in extreme circumstances which are defined as a) when under attack, b) when their lives are in danger (in self-defence).        
	In case of any law-and-order situation like arson or any other crime, the private agency must take a backseat. Only police can open fire in such a situation.        
	Traffic management outside the stadium is another area where the private agency can do nothing; that is a police show.        
	Can do        
	The primary responsibility is to watch and ward off.        
	Ashit Luthra, the director of GI Security, whose Canadian partner, Canpro Global Services, is a leading risk-mitigation outfit in the world now working with the Vancouver Winter Olympics, goes step by step:              
	 The security drill will start from when the players and officials arrive at the Calcutta airport. Trained security guards will escort them to the bus, which will have specially-drilled observers on it, plus police escort.        
	 The team hotel will be sanitised and a protocol created to control entry, in tandem with the police. There will be three layers of security  the propertys in-built security system, the private agencys security and bodyguards for individual players.        
	 To take the team buses from the hotel to Eden Gardens and back, a pre-determined route will be chalked out, with three or four alternatives to fall back on. Trained observers, who will be on the buses to look out for unusual activity, will do dry runs for weeks together ahead of the match.        
	 Crowd entry points to be manned, with thorough frisking of spectators and vendors, with the help of the police. Sensitive screening of VIP pass-holders to avoid friction. The motto of the security drill is to suspect everybody.        
	 Watertight security at the players dressing rooms and inside-fencing entry to the ground, with multi-layered access control. Plainclothes observers in the crowd, one for every 1,000 spectators, ballpark, trained to watch out for the slightest hint of trouble. The key is to be proactive, not reactive.        
	 A special control room, 24x7 in touch with Lalbazar, will coordinate the entire security exercise, which must be approved by the commissioner of police.        
	 A special security manager from a risk-mitigation company will analyse the risk factors way in advance for an Eden match and work out a structured mitigation system.        
	 An emergency evacuation plan will be put in place, with two or three alternative routes, including one by helicopter.        
	Cost        
	 The agency would have to deploy between 600 and 800 private personnel, with over 400 inside the ground (if the crowd count is around 40,000). The cost of this security cover could run into crores, but Luthra feels the CAB can recover most of the burden from sponsors and pass just a small amount on to the spectator by way of ticket price hike.

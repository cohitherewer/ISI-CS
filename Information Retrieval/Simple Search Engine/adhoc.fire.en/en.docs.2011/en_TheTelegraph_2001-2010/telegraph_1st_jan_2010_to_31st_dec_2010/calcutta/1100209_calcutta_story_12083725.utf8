	If you visited Victoria Square, off Camac Street, before June last year, you would have been greeted with rotting garbage, a foul stench and a large water tank filled with weeds. Now, thanks to the efforts of nearly 250 students from the Nature clubs of five city schools, the 15,000-sq-ft compound has green benches along a newly-made joggers track, freshly- painted walls and saplings lining the way. The students have also cleaned up the tank around which the compound is constructed.         
	The park was in a rundown state and was not frequented by local residents. Our objective was to make the park usable again, said Shreya Jhawar of Modern High School for Girls, one of the schools involved in the project. The revamped park was inaugurated on Saturday by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Saturday.         
	Public has been associated with schools since 1990. This is one of our many projects. We hope that this park will serve as a role model for the maintenance of parks in the city, said Bonani Kakkar, the founding member of Public.         
	The students, from schools like La Martiniere for Boys and Girls, Loreto House, Pratt Memorial and Frank Anthony Public School, began work on the Albert Road address on June 5 (World Environment Day) last year.         
	When we started, the compound was a dumping ground for local residents. Trees uprooted after Aila added to the mess. We cleaned the park, removed the trees and even used some of the wood to construct four benches in the park. We replanted some of the plants too, said Nandan Bugalia of La Martiniere for Boys. The students removed the weeds choking the lake and have also introduced various kinds of fish.        
	Open from 6am to 6pm, the park now has displays asking people not to enter with cycles or vehicles, forbidding washing or bathing in the water body and hawking.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will render infrastructure support in maintaining the park and the water body, said the mayor. The students efforts to involve the local residents seem to have worked too. The people no longer dump waste in the park, said Nandan.         
	There are other plans in the offing. We plan to have an anglers corner where people will be able to fish. We will also label the trees and redesign the layout, said Kakkar.

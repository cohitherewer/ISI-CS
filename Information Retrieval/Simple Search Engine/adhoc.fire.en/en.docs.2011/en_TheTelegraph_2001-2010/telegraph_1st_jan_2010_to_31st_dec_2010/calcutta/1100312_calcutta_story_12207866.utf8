                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blueprint for biz park trio

	The city is set to get over seven lakh square feet of commercial space in the next three to four years, an indication of the economy in Calcutta getting back on track after the downturn.        
	Ambuja Realty on Thursday announced plans to develop two business parks in Salt Lake Sector V and one near City Centre 2 in Rajarhat.        
	The business response to Ecospace has been good even after the Nano fiasco. We are happy with the response and will come up with three more business parks in Calcutta, Ambuja Realty chairman Harshavardhan Neotia said on Thursday at the launch of the second phase of Ecospace, a state-of-the-art business park in New Town with 45 lakh sq ft of space.        
	The company is looking at an investment of around Rs 300 crore in the three projects.        
	We had the land but we were waiting to see how Ecospace takes off. The projects are in the planning and designing stage, said Neotia.        
	The Rajarhat project will offer 1.2 lakh sq ft of space and will call for an investment of around Rs 35 crore.         
	One of the Sector V projects will require an investment of Rs 200 crore to provide 5 lakh sq ft of space and the other, to be set up at a cost of Rs 70 crore, will be spread across 1.5 lakh sq ft.        
	Around 4.5 lakh sq ft of space in the first phase of Ecospace  which was inaugurated in September 2009  has been leased out or sold, despite the downturn-induced initial slow response from clients.        
	Companies such as Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Bank and Voith have taken up space in the project, which has received LEED certification for following green building norms, such as using energy-efficient tools like solar panels and wind.        
	The second phase of the business park, the developers claimed, focuses on work-life balance.         
	Ecohub, The Unwind Zone, was also inaugurated during the day. Spread across 30,000sq ft, the zone offers relaxation and fitness options for the executives working in Ecospace.        
	People spend 70 per cent of their time at office and work-life balance takes a beating. We created Ecohub to foster the much-needed balance, said Neotia.        
	Ecohub has fine dining space in the form of The Village, multi-cuisine food court Hangout Express, sports lounge Xebra, a state-of-the-art gymnasium, a roof-top swimming pool and a rooftop tennis court, among other things.        
	We will open the facilities to in-house as well as select outside members from Poila Baisakh, Ecohub head Rahul Bose said.        
	The upcoming business parks will also provide similar green office space and a work-plus environment.        
	Ambuja Realty also announced projects in Siliguri, Haldia, Patna and Raipur.

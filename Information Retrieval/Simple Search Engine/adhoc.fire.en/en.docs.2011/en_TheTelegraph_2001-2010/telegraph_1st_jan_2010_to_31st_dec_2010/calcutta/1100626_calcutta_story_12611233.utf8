	The fuel price hike has given the ruling Left in Bengal  fast resembling a wrestler losing his weak grip  a chance to flex its muscles by bringing the city to a halt on Saturday through a transport strike.        
	The CPMs labour arm Citu called a 24-hour state-wide transport strike from 6am on Saturday, within hours of the fuel hike being announced, signalling the halt of public transport, excluding Metro and trains.        
	Most educational institutions and many offices would be shut on Saturday but nearly 12,000 buses (private and public), 35,000 taxis and more than 30,000 autos going off the road would cripple Calcutta.        
	After the first fuel price hike since February 15, petrol in Calcutta would cost Rs 51.65, up by Rs 2.70, and diesel Rs 37.99, dearer by Rs 4.07.        
	Citu state president Shyamal Chakraborty announced on Friday afternoon that all goods and passenger vehicles would observe a state-wide strike for 24 hours to protest the Centres decision.        
	Trains will run and essential services will be kept outside the purview of the strike, assured Chakraborty.        
	With Citu gearing up to paralyse the city yet again, state transport minister Ranjit Kundu pleaded helplessness. What can the state government do if drivers, conductors and others involved in running the vehicles decide to go on a strike? asked the minister, even hinting at an impending fare hike.        
	With such a fuel price hike, there would be demands for an upward revision of fares. We will consider them when they come our way, Kundu told Metro.        
	Trinamul MLA Swarnakamal Saha, a key leader of the transport lobby, said the weekend would be spent in meetings to decide on the quantum of fare hike to be demanded.        
	The Trinamul Congress sneered at the Citu strike but endorsed the demand for a rollback of the fuel price hike.

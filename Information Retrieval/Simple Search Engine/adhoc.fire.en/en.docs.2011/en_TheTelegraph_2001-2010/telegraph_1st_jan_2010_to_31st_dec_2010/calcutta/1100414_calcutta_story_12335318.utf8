          A STAFF REPORTER                                        Stephen Court on March 23      
	Occupants of Stephen Court have not shown any initiative in implementing the safety measures suggested by various agencies after the March 23 inferno, officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said on Tuesday.         
	Over two weeks have passed since the residents had, on March 29, agreed to follow the short-term and long-term guidelines suggested by the police, civic body, CESC and the fire department.         
	A few families had been allowed to move into the unaffected blocks on the condition that they would fulfil the short-term guidelines by June 30.         
	But on Tuesday, Debasish Kar, the director-general (building) II, said: They havent shown any interest in implementing the guidelines, they havent even formed a residents association to implement the changes.         
	A flat-owner said the residents had met informally twice in the past couple of weeks but nothing concrete came out of the meetings.         
	The short-term guidelines include no use of electric generators, inverters or lifts. Also, no air-conditioners are to be used in any part of the building without CESCs permission. All the residents are supposed to get the wiring in their flats checked.         
	The long term measures include shifting electrical meters from below the staircases and building four staircases and four emergency staircases. A residents committee has to be formed to look after the building and the doors to the roof have to be made easily accessible, said a civic official.         
	Commercial establishments on the ground floor have also been handed out three conditions that they have to comply with before opening doors again.         
	They have been asked to install fire alarm systems, obtain clearance certificates from CESC and the fire department and furnish security bonds, said the civic official. He added that none of the commercial establishments had taken any steps towards fulfilling the conditions.         
	If the residents dont fulfil the conditions in three months, we will decide what action to take at a meeting with the CMC, CESC and the fire department, said Supratim Sarkar, the deputy commissioner of police (south).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eden starts silent, ends with roar   Crowd claims a win, but only just
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Eden starts silent, ends with roar     Crowd claims a win, but only just
  - UNITED COLOURS OF EUPHORIA          SUDESHNA BANERJEE AND RITH BASU                          A cop in khaki celebrates the fall of Ashwell Prince with a fan in Team India blue at the Eden Gardens. (Amit Datta)                                              
	For Block G at the Eden Gardens, Ganapati Raju was the man of the match.        
	The Burrabazar trader, 31, had become a hero on Day III by catching the second six that Mahendra Singh Dhoni slammed off J.P. Duminy 20 rows back into the crowd. And on Day V, Raju led the shouting brigade that powered Team India to a nail-biting victory.        
	It was like a dream sequence. I saw the ball sailing towards me and I caught it without a fumble, Raju told Metro, describing the moment that made the Test even more memorable for Block G.        
	The block opposite the club house had another Dhoni connection. A 34-year-old who cheered the loudest when the captain was called to collect the winners cheque.        
	We were colleagues in the South Eastern Railway (for which Dhoni was a ticket collector at Kharagpur till 2003). I used to play in the SER team which he later represented. I met him for the last time in 2003 when he came to submit his resignation, said the man who did not wish to be named.        
	It feels so great to see one of us make it so big. Not only his batting, even the way he talks and carries himself has undergone a massive change. Perhaps this is what great success and great responsibility do to you, he smiled.        
	The smiles on the Eden crowd at the end of the day must have acted like a balm for Pradip Kumar Das, who had begun the day with a bruised heart at the Mohammedan Sporting Ground. Why are there no takers for tickets on such a big day? wondered Das, who has been selling Eden tickets for 35 years.        
	The first over of the day was bowled by Virender Sehwag with just a handful of spectators. I have never seen such a small turnout at the Eden on the last morning of a Test with India in a winning position. Its a shame, grumbled Das.        
	In the lower tier of the club house, the strangely silent Eden was giving die-hard fans the jitters. At the Eden on big days, some rival wickets are always claimed by the roar of the crowd. Today, how will we give our boys the vocal tonic needed to bowl South Africa out? said an Eden veteran.        
	With the Indian bowlers struggling and the crowd count growing in slow motion, the Eden had to entertain itself.        
	So, Hashim Amla was translated from Bengali and christened Hashim Bureaucrat. Orey, ei bureaucrat retire korbe na (This bureaucrat wont retire), was a cry.         
	Ishant, Amla kha. Its good for health, shouted film-maker Anindita Sarbadhicari.        
	When Team India walked out after lunch, little Pavnit Singh was right atop them, leaning over the Indian dressing room from the club house front row. Dhoni and Co. may not have seen him but they sure must have heard his mighty paper horn.        
	He is the Prime Ministers grandson, declared his father, about the boy from the family of Manmohan Singhs sister. When Harbhajan Singh picked up J.P. Duminy, the father snatched the horn and blew it loud and clear.        
	With the ground filling up and the decibel level rising, the Eden was back in business. Enough for it to claim Morkels wicket. 50 per cent Bhajji, 50 per cent the Eden roar, laughed a veteran.        
	Puro thriller holo, summed up Anindya, the Chandrabindoo singer who stayed glued to his club house seat from post-lunch to post-win.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The investigation into the death of the three young men whose bodies were found along railway tracks near Dum Dum on Monday morning has drawn a blank.         
	The additional director-general of railway police, Dilip Mitra, led a team of officers to the spot on Tuesday. The team collected blood-stained stones, a portion of a shirt and a shoe from the spot where Ankur Sengupta, Ratan Saha and Tridib Das were found lying dead. The three friends and colleagues were residents of Rajabagan in Sinthee.        
	Train drivers and railway employees did not report seeing the bodies, which bore multiple injuries, beside the tracks.        
	We collected articles from the spot where the bodies were found and experts are examining them. We have filed an unnatural death case since no one from the victims families turned up to lodge a complaint. We are waiting for the post-mortem report. If it suggests that the deaths were homicidal in nature, we would start a murder case, said Mitra.        
	On Tuesday, the cops questioned a girl with whom Ankur allegedly had an affair. She is a singer in a bar and restaurant. We are trying to find out whether she knew Ankurs friends and his relations with them, said an officer.        
	According to the police, the girl said that she was unaware of any rivalry that could have led to Ankurs murder.        
	Ankurs father Arun said he would lodge a complaint in a day or two after consulting lawyers.        
	The three might have died after being hit by a train. Doctors would be able to confirm whether the injuries were sustained in a mishap. If someone hit the youths with a weapon, forensic experts would be able to detect that too, said a government railway police officer.        
	The reasons behind the deaths will be cleared once the post-mortem report reaches us, said an officer.         
	Fatal mishap: An unidentified man in his mid-20s was run over by a truck on Monday night in Chitpur.

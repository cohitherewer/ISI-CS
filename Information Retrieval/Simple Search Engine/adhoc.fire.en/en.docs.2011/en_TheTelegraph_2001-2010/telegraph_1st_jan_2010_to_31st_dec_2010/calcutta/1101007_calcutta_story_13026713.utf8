The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vigil ends in no-show
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Vigil ends in no-show
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Students and flowers await the vice-chancellor on Wednesday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	All dressed up but nobody to welcome  newly anointed Presidency University put its best face forward for its first vice-chancellor on Wednesday, only to learn at the end of the day that she wouldnt be coming.        
	Change is here but we would need to wait a little longer to welcome our vice-chancellor, said a disappointed student at the end of a long vigil for vice-chancellor Amita Chatterjee.        
	The day had begun with a buzz about Chatterjees impending arrival to take charge, though nobody seemed to know when.         
	Narayan Ghosh, the caretaker of the principals room for the past seven years, wore a new T-shirt. This is my Puja buy but I thought today was a better occasion to wear it, he smiled.         
	Narayan and colleague Nirmal Singh had just finished polishing the teak tables in the principals room. The desks and benches were neatly arranged, the plants wore a freshly watered look and the corridor looked spick-and-span. Students and staff members lined the portico holding bouquets and looking towards the gate.        
	As the day wore on without any official confirmation of Chatterjees visit, Kokhon ashbe (when will she come)? turned into Ashbe to (will she come)? on everyones lips.        
	It wasnt until 3.30pm that someone announced that Chatterjee, an alumnus of Presidency who retired from the philosophy department of Jadavpur University on September 30, had cancelled her visit.        
	We are so disappointed. Today was the last day of college before the Puja vacation and we wont be here to greet her if she comes in between. Our classes are scheduled to resume in mid-November, rued Dora Dey Hazra, a third-year student of philosophy.         
	Principal Amitava Chatterjee and his staff waited till 5pm, but the majority of students left by 4pm. Nirmal Singh stared at the bouquets placed on a table in front of the principals room and wondered what to do with them. We had got them from Marcus Square in the morning, he said.        
	Colleague Narayan picked up one and said he would preserve it.  It will be a small memento of a happy occasion that unfortunately didnt happen.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tricky test ends in smooth ride

	South City International School played host to the citys final leg of the Limca Book of Records Quiz, 2010, on October 8. Of the 30 participating schools, six  Apeejay, Birla High for Boys, Don Bosco Park Circus, La Martiniere for Boys, National Gems High School and The Heritage  made it to the finals.         
	This time, the quiz was more challenging, said Siddhant Agarwal, who represented the winning team of Birla High School for Boys.        
	Six quick rounds kept the participants on tenterhooks, with every team trying to come up with the right answer in seconds.         
	I enjoyed the round on Calcutta. That round gave us an advantage over others, said Chayon Mondal from National Gems High School.         
	While Birla High got off to a good start and stayed consistently ahead of the other teams, it was a close run between National Gems High School and Don Bosco Park Circus.         
	We just got lucky, thanks to a couple of questions, claimed a modest Mondal, after qualifying as the first runner-up, along with team-mate Subhodeep Sarkar.         
	Quizmaster Andrew Scolt kept the audience looped in by throwing questions to the floor and tossing a succession of goodies to the ones who got it right. The Facebook round and the gaming round were a special hit with the audience.         
	I thought the choice of questions was excellent. I knew answers to quite a few that the participants didnt, smiled Aditya Kompella, a student of St Thomas Boys School and an enthusiastic member of the audience.        
	At the end, it was sweet victory for Birla Highs Siddhant Agarwal and Kartikeyi Desai. They will be known as the city champions.         
	It feels really good to have won the quiz and be up for nomination in the national leg, said 17-year-old Agarwal.         
	The winning team qualified to sit for a written preliminary round to be selected for the National Limca Book of Records Quiz, to be held later this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chill here, winter follows
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chill here, winter follows
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Winter has set up a Wednesday date with Calcutta, just over a week behind schedule, but the city started feeling the chill from Monday evening.        
	If the cold breeze blowing through the city was an indication of the weather to come, official confirmation about the advent of the citys most-awaited season arrived from the Met office.        
	Its finally here. Winter will set in on Wednesday with the Celsius expected to drop by a few notches over the next 48 hours, Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, told Metro.        
	The only instance in the last decade of winter being delayed by more than eight days was in 2008, when it was 11 days behind schedule.        
	Last year, winter had hit town more than a fortnight ahead of time  on November 22  with the hottest first half of November in five decades making way for the coldest second half of November in a decade.        
	This year, the weather anomaly that took meteorologists by surprise was not so much the delayed arrival of winter as the warm spell in November, followed by cloudy skies and five days of scattered rain at the start of December. The rain and the cloud cover had resulted in Celsius disparities like maximum temperatures five degrees below normal and minimum readings five notches above normal.        
	The good news is that all things remaining the same, the city would enjoy a normal winter from Wednesday. The wintry feel has been around through December, despite higher-than-normal minimum temperatures. From now on, the weather would be cold and crisp, the way it should be, Debnath said.        
	Although the Celsius is likely to dip on Tuesday itself, the weatherman says it will take another day for the winter cycle to fully set in.        
	The minimum temperature first needs to hit the normal level, said a Met official.        
	The series of atmospheric formations over the Bay pushing up moisture levels in the air over south Bengal since the end of October has finally relented, but the minimum was still four notches above normal at 18.3 degrees Celsius on Monday because of relatively high humidity.        
	The main reason for the higher-than-normal minimum temperatures till now was the high minimum humidity (50 per cent on Monday), which should ideally be around the 30-40 per cent mark at this time of the year, said a weather scientist.        
	The humidity-induced cloud cover had also blocked out the cold, dry North Wind, which brings winter to the city.        
	The northerlies and northwesterlies will get free passage from Tuesday. Thats when the Celsius will drop, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.        
	Meteorologists, however, warned against expecting winter to make up for its late arrival this year with a higher chill quotient.        
	It will be cold with minimum temperatures being normal or slightly lower for the remaining half of the month. But sub-10 readings are ruled out for now, said a scientist of the Noida-based National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting.         
	Winter officially departs the city around February 20.

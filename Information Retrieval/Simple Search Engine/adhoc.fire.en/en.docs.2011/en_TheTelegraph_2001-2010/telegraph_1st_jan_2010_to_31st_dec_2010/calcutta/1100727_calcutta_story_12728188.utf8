                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Students help the cops, bag a prize
										      SAFETY ON THE STREET                        
	Driving faster causes disaster. The slogan was coined by 11-year-old Shubham Kumar Gupta at a competition during Road Safety Week, organised by Calcutta police in January this year.         
	On July 3, he was awarded the second prize for his effort at a programme held at Mahajati Sadan.         
	Besides Shubham and other winners of various contests, Calcutta police also felicitated many students and NCC cadets who had assisted them in managing the traffic during the Road Safety Week as well as for last years Durga puja. Transport minister Ranjit Kundu was the chief guest at the event.         
	Around 1,370 students and NCC cadets had helped man the traffic at various crossings during Durga puja. The Road Safety Week, held from January 4 to 10, had around 900 participants. The event was organised to make pedestrians more cautious on the road, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	To encourage students participation, various competitions like sit-and-draw, essay-writing and slogan-writing were held in different schools. Students were also employed at major crossings in Beleghata, Gariahat, Mudiali and near the Howrah bridge, where they helped pedestrians cross the right way.         
	Abhishek Mishra, a Class IX student of Digambar Jain Vidyalaya, was awarded for volunteering during the Road Safety Week. It was great fun controlling the teeming millions on the street and I would love to do it again, he gushed after winning the prize. His school also won the overall third prize for participation in the event.         
	NCC cadet Ram Kumar was equally thrilled to be awarded a prize for his work during Durga puja. My work has made my team proud, he added.         
	A performance by Jolly Das, of Indian Idol 4 fame, followed the prize distribution.       VV

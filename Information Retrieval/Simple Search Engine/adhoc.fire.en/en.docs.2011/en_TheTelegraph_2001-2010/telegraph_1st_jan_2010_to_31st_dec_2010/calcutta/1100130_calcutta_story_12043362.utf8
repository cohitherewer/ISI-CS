                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court scan on garden party
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Green activist Subhash Dutta on Friday drew the high courts attention to an private function held illegally at the 300-year-old Shibpur botanical garden, officially known as Indian Botanic Garden, last Sunday.        
	After hearing the complaint, the division bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice B. Bhattacharya asked Dutta to issue a notice to the garden authorities asking them to take part in the case. The bench will hear the matter on February 5.        
	Dutta submitted before the court that on January 24, Shibpur resident Sumantra Bagchi, a real-estate player with alleged political links, had organised his wedding reception on the garden premises, where plastic was used and food cooked on open chulhas. Empty liquor bottles were found on the campus the next day, Dutta added.        
	Dutta produced the invitation card of the wedding, saying: According to an earlier order of the court, the garden authorities had introduced an entry fee. But the invite mentioned that the guests would not have to pay the fee. How can an individual use the garden for his personal purpose?        
	Dutta also produced photographs to show how some trees were affected because of the flames. It is not possible for an outsider to hold any function at the garden without the knowledge of the garden authorities, Dutta pointed out.        
	The day after the reception, Dutta and several other residents of Shibpur visited the garden to find empty water bottles and other plastic waste on the greens.

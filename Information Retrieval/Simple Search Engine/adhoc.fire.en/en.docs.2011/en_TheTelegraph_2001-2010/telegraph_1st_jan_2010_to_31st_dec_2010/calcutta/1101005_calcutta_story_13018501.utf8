The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crackdown on pool cars
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Crackdown on pool cars
  - Cases slapped on 13 owners of unregistered vehicles          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The public vehicles department on Monday launched a crackdown on illegal pool cars and slapped cases on 13 owners who were operating without registering their vehicles as commercial carriers.        
	Rattled by the drive, several pool car owners lined up at the PVD office in Beltala for forms to apply for conversion into commercial vehicles.        
	The government deadline for filing such applications lapsed on February 15 but the owners of more than half of the 2,500-odd pool cars in the city and its suburbs are yet to fall in line.        
	Officials from the PVDs enforcement wing fanned out from the morning, targeting roads leading to some prominent schools. The teams stopped cars and checked documents while they were returning after dropping children at schools.        
	Of the several cars stopped and checked in and around Gariahat, none was found to have valid papers, said PVD secretary Ujjal Sengupta.         
	We will continue with the drive to send a message to all pool car owners that they would not be allowed to play with the lives of children.        
	Metro had on Monday reported that the transport department had decided to crack the whip on operators who havent yet bothered to apply for the mandatory permit.        
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu had warned that the owners who refuse to abide by the law would be shunted out.        
	A recent survey by the transport department revealed that unregistered pool car operators were getting away by cramming more children into the cars than the stipulated limit.        
	We are not expecting any sea change overnight. The drive would serve its purpose if it prompts errant operators to apply for the mandatory conversion into commercial vehicles and adhere to the other rules aimed at ensuring the safety of the children, said a PVD official.        
	Some among unregistered operators said they had not yet applied for the conversion because of the difficulties in getting bank loans, which they claimed they needed to get commercial permits.        
	The handful of those who have applied, however, want the crackdown to continue for the sake of their credibility.        
	We have always demanded that there be a regular drive against illegal operators. Unfortunately, it only happens in spurts, said Abir Roy, the general secretary of the Pool Car Owners Welfare Association.

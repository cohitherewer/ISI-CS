	For 10-year-old Sagnik Bhattacharya, a Class V student of Birla High School for Boys and a die-hard Harry Potter fan, writing short stories is a favourite pastime. Now, his short story has found a place in the July 5 issue of TTIS (The Telegraph in Schools), after it was selected as one of the winning entries in a story-writing competition organised by TTIS.         
	Sagniks story is one of 18 short-listed entries selected from more than 200 across West Bengal. On Saturday, some of the 18 winners from schools like Don Bosco, Park Circus, DPS Megacity and South Point High School, read out their stories at a session chaired by educationist Barry OBrien at Oxford Bookstore, Park Street.         
	The topic for the contest, targeted at children from Class V to XII, was for every minute you are angry, you lose 60 seconds of happiness.                   One of the winners of the TTIS story-writing contest reads out her piece. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray       
	OBrien asked the participants to be realistic about their talent and write from the heart.Reading as much as you can will help you pick up writing techniques as well, he added.         
	The plots of the stories ranged from the short-tempered king who learnt to restrain his anger by Sagnik to Chandra Mohan Roys tale of a boy who was fed up with his cousins mischievous ways.         
	Said Chandra, a Class VII student of St Xaviers Collegiate School: We often lose our temper with our siblings, forgetting that it is love that allows a person to take such liberties. My character repents when he realises his mistake.         
	Chandras story was much appreciated by the audience, comprising students, parents and teachers. The selected stories were published in the June 28 and July 5 issues of TTIS.        
	Such contests encourage children to read and write more. We should have more of them, said Khettra Mohan Roy, Chandras father.

	It was a festival of plays by the children for children. A two-decade old theatre group, Subham, celebrated its 10th anniversary by staging nine plays dedicated to Tagore from June 25 to 27 at Chaitanya Library, off Beadon Street.         
	Some of the actors were as young as six, while their directors were not more than 13 years old. The children had taken all the initiative in organising the festival, from selecting the plays  taken from Tagores collection of riddle plays Hasya Kautuk  to arranging for the costumes, props and music.        
	There was a special reason behind selecting the venue. Tagore was an occasional visitor to Chaitanya Library. Besides, it is here that the kids rehearse regularly on Saturdays and Sundays.         
	Its central courtyard was covered with tarpaulin and the children cleverly used some of the windows and balconies as their stage props. Like the miserly lawyer Dukori appeared at a second-floor window to talk to the donation hunters in Khyatir Birambona (directed by Swagata Chatterjee). Again, the kitchen that supplied the pithey (sweet dish) for Petey O Pithey (directed by Subhankar Malakar) seemed to be just beyond a ground-floor window.         
	The other plays included Chhatrer Porikha, directed by Sudip Dhara, Chintasheel, directed by Souradeep Banerjee, Antishti Satkar by Rai Ganguly, Roger Chikitsha by Subhajit Chakraborty, Sukkho Bichar by Ashmita Khan, Abhyarthana by Pallabi Ganguly and Bhav o Obhav by Jyoti Das.         
	The kids had been rehearsing for three months. The plays did have their share of glitches, but the chief guest, poet Sankho Ghosh, felt they made the evening more enjoyable.        
	The young actors of Subham will again be seen in Aal Izz Well, a play on juvenile delinquents, directed by Raja Bhattacharya. It is set to premier on July 9 at Minerva theatre at 6.30pm .

	Twenty-four students got a chance to spend a day with India cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Mumbai last month, as part of the Immune India campaign organised across nine states.         
	 Taniya Chakraborty from Durgapur, Tiash Patra from Calcutta and Abdul Habib Sheikh from Hooghly were among them.        
	 Organised in West Bengal by TTIS and Dabur Chyawanprash, the campaign reached out to 110 schools in the state through workshops on ways to boost immunity and quiz contests.        
	 The 24, selected as Immunity Ambassadors for Dabur Chyawanprash, were shortlisted on the basis of a questionnaire, extra-curricular activities and a slogan-writing contest. Dhoni gave them tips on health management, and fighting fatigue.

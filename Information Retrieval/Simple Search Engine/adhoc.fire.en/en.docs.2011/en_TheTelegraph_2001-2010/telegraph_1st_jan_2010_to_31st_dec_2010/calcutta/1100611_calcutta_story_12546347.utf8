The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ceasework at Barasat court
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ceasework at Barasat court
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Lawyers have stayed away from the Barasat district court for over three weeks now, keeping all legal proceedings suspended during the period.        
	The members of the two major lawyers associations in the court are pressing for the appointment of more lower judicial magistrates and improvement of the court infrastructure.        
	We have been forced to extend our ceasework till June 14 in the larger interest, said Satyabrata Sen, the president of the district bar association of North 24-Parganas.        
	Common people are bearing the brunt of the protest. More than 3,000 litigants who visit the district court every day for hearing of their cases and bail pleas are returning disappointed.        
	Rajarhat resident Nemai Paul, who has appealed for an anticipatory bail, said he had been coming to the court almost daily for the past fortnight. My appeal has lapsed as it hasnt come up for hearing within 15 days of it being filed. I have to file a fresh plea, he said.        
	Court officials admitted that the number of judges was inadequate but said they were helpless in solving the problem. The higher authorities have been alerted, said an official.

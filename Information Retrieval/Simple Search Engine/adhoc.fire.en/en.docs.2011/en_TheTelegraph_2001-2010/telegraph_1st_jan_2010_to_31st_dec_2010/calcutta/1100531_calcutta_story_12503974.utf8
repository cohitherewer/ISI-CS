	The day the city poured out in numbers to elect its next civic board, one of its landmarks went under the axe.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has started pulling down the unsafe parts of Strand Warehouse, a major part of which collapsed on Saturday evening, killing three men.        
	The demolition started on Saturday night. The unsafe parts of the building will be pulled down, said Debashish Kar, the director general (building) of the CMC.        
	Work had to be briefly suspended as a crane got damaged while the facade of the Strand Road edifice, a heritage structure owned by Calcutta Port Trust and let out to several tenants, was being razed.        
	A fire department skylift, two pay-loaders and five civic dumpers were pressed into service to demolish the building and remove the debris. The part of Strand Road, between Millennium Park and Howrah bridge, was closed to traffic for the demolition.        
	An officer at Lalbazar said it would take a few days to pull down the unsafe parts. Till then traffic on Strand Road is likely to be diverted.        
	The civic authorities had declared the warehouse unsafe in 2004. The building caught fire on February 14, after which the CMC tagged the building hazardous.        
	Port trust officials claimed on Saturday that they could not pull down the building even after it being labelled hazardous because the tenants had obtained a stay from the high court.        
	Asked how the building could be demolished despite the stay order, Kar said: Its for the port trust to look into the legal issues. People are dying... we cannot risk further accidents.        
	Of the three who died in the collapse, the identity of two was established on Sunday. Sources at North Port police station said the two were Vinod Kumar Benia, 45, and Ajit Gupta, 25. Benia, who worked for a courier firm, was a Howrah resident, while Gupta lived in Liluah.         
	The third victim, Subhas Chandra Roy, 52, was identified on Saturday.        
	The condition of the injured was stable. Abhijit Kundu, who was bleeding from the nose, is better. Hafiz Ansari, his wife Amdurnissa and their 10-year-old son Ezaz have suffered fractures in their legs and will take at least a month to get well, said a doctor at Calcutta Medical College.

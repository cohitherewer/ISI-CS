The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Green cases await court hearing
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Green cases await court hearing
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Green activist Subhash Dutta alleged on Monday that cases related to environment issues were not being heard by the high court for a long time.        
	Dutta has written to Chief Justice M.S. Shah, requesting him to take measures for early hearing of at least 10 important public interest cases lying pending for years. The cases include phasing out of old vehicles, drinking water quality of Howrah and Calcutta and pollution in the Hooghly.        
	At least three crore people are directly involved in these cases. So I request you to release these matters from your court so that they could be heard by any other division bench, Dutta prayed.        
	All environment-related cases are heard by the green bench headed by the chief justice. He said the Supreme Court had in 1995 directed the high court to appoint a special bench for hearing environment and public interest matters at least twice a week.        
	The high court created a bench but it isnt getting enough time to hear the cases, Dutta claimed.

                      Night of the long knives                    The tragic epic, Meghnadbadh Kabya, is the most famous and outstanding work of Michael Madhusudan Dutt. Dutt ventured into unknown territory as he unfolded the story in chaste Sanskritised Bengali and innovated the amitrakshar chhanda (blank verse) in this ballad. More importantly, he portrayed the characters of Ram, Lakshman, Ravan and Meghnad in an unconventional way. His brilliance and originality remain unparalleled in the annals of Bengali literature and has ensured his place in the history of world literature. The story is told in several layers and he followed the Western grammar of epics, specially Virgil. Contemporary theatre icon Goutam Halder has dared to present the entire epic on stage, performing solo. No easy task this! In fact, the group, Naye Natua, heralded its arrival with the staging of this epic. Though written way back in 1861, its theme is as contemporary and holds true as it did two centuries ago. Ravan and Meghnad are victims of destiny (Bidhi). The powers that be (the Gods, in this case) conspired against the great warrior. The honest, fearless and invincible Meghnad was surreptitiously deceived and assassinated by the politically ambitious usurper, Ram. Times have changed, but hunger for power and political supremacy drive the ambitious to take the narrow and dark path of deception and cunning. Real heroes die tragically, all victims of intrigues and lowly plans of conspirators. Halder has used the classical elements of Natyashastra and amalgamated elements of folk dance movements, martial arts, song, narration, et al superbly in his performance. Music plays a vital role in the play and musicians share the stage with the performer and like the Chorus, help the movement of the play.                  Event: Play in Bengali, Meghnadbadh Kabya, produced by Naye Natua When: Today at 3 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

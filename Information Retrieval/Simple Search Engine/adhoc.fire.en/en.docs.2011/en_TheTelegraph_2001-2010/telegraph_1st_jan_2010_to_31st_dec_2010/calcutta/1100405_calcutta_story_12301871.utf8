The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal floors   rise from rubble
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Illegal floors   rise from rubble
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                    
	Two illegal floors of a residential building barely 500 metres from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Palm Avenue residence have sprung back to stand tall in defiance after being demolished twice in three years.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had first demolished the top two floors of 5F Palm Avenue in April 2007 after Metro ran a campaign against illegal constructions in the chief ministers para. The building was, however, back to its original height within a few months of the demolition.         
	A second demolition drive was carried out in November 2008  again after Metro brought the illegal reconstruction to light  but the two floors were rebuilt in quick time.        
	The promoter bribed officials of the civic body as well as the local police station to reconstruct the demolished portions. This illegal building is living proof of the promoter-CMC-police nexus, said a resident who met mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya following the Stephen Court tragedy to lodge a complaint.         
	If there is a fire, there is no way the residents can get out of here unscathed. Even fire tenders cannot enter the lane because of the narrow approach to the building, he added.         
	Mayor Bhattacharyya, who had promised to increase surveillance and initiate action against promoters, landlords and civic officials involved in illegal constructions, expressed surprise at the rebirth of the two illegal floors.         
	It is strange that these two illegal floors came up again. We will demolish the illegal portion of the building again, Bhattacharyya, himself under the scanner for carrying out his law practice from a tinderbox building at 6 Old Post Office Street, said on Sunday.         
	Sources said the five tenants occupying the illegal floors of the building paid over Rs 12 lakh each as salaami (earnest money)to the promoter before moving in.         
	Its a prime area and the margin of profit is huge. A section of policemen and civic officials pocket a large share of the money in return for allowing the builders lobby to thrive, a source said.        
	Almost half the six lakh-odd highrise buildings in the city have illegal extensions, according to CMC records.        
	Palm Avenue and its adjacent areas, which have witnessed a realty boom over the past few years, have several such illegal buildings built by small-time promoters who may lack construction expertise but enjoy the blessings of political leaders.        
	These promoters operate in connivance with a section of policemen in this high-security area. Officials of the CMC also get a cut and turn a blind eye, said a resident.        
	Sources said the top two floors of 5F Palm Avenue were not only illegal but also unsafe, having been constructed in a hurry without adherence to building norms.        
	On both occasions when the top floors were demolished, the promoter covered the house with polythene sheets and reconstructed the illegal portions at night. We informed the local police station and the building department of the CMC about the floors being rebuilt but no official bothered checking the veracity of our complaints even once, said a resident living close by.

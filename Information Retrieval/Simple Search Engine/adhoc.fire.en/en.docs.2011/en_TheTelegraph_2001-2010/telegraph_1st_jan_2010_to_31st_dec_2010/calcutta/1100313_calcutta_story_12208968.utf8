  - Royal snub amp; green mantra          CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA                          Prince Andrew at the CII meet on Friday. (Amit Datta)                                        
	The last time a British Royal, Princess Diana, visited Calcutta 18 years ago, it was a great occasion. Crowds had gathered in Moulali, close to the Missionaries of Charity office where Diana had gone, to catch a glimpse of the beautiful princess. She was a vision in pale pink as she zoomed past them in her tall vehicle. She was princessy enough.        
	When Prince Andrew, second son of the Queen and brother-in-law to the deceased Princess Diana, was visiting the city on Thursday and Friday, there was no upheaval. There was no fairy tale; he was addressing businessmen in a packed hotel room. The prince looked like a successful middle-aged gentleman who would not make unnecessary eye-contact. In a dark business-suit, Andrew was as dour as the British weather.        
	But earnest. As the UKs special representative for international trade and investment, he spoke on UK-India trade ties and the importance of low-carbon businesses at a meet organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).        
	Or did the Indian warmth get too hot for him?         
	He did not look too keen to carry on conversations sotto voce with those on the dais as other speakers addressed the audience. And after British deputy high commissioner Sanjay Wadvani, the diplomat from the UK with Calcutta roots, eulogised him as a high-functioning CEO of no company, but the UK, Andrew, or the Duke of York, his official title, snapped that it was a strange introduction. Unfortunately I am not the CEO of the UK, it is someone elses responsibility. I would not like to take it away from him or her, he said.        
	The royal snub delivered, he got down straight to business. It was quite clear that he was to be taken seriously as UKs ambassador for the right kind of business. Reading from a written speech, he underlined what these were.                    
	As the global recession begins to recover, climate change will be a serious challenge to the sustainability of the development.        
	India is particularly vulnerabledue to its economy being closely tied to agriculture, and its 7,500-km long coastline, which is both low-lying and densely populated. This threat will obviously resonate strongly in this part of India in particular, with the low-lying Sunderbans delta, he said.        
	But while this is so, there is an increased demand for businesses that are green. The global market for low carbon and environmental goods and services was already worth 3 trillion in 2008.        
	India and the UK can work with greater collaboration in certain sectors, he said: wind, wave and solar energy, for example.        
	Andrew added that British expertise could help the Indian coal industry with sustainable mining solutions. Low-carbon, low-resource manufacturing, use of alternative energy in the steel industry and low-carbon automobile technologies were other areas.         
	Having said that, the royal personage marched out of the room. The other guests had to remain in their seats till he had left. Then they had lunch, wondering where the prince had his.              
	Adda         
	The cultural adda session with Prince Andrew at Bengal Club later in the afternoon went on for close to two hours and was apparently a big hit.        
	We spoke about everything from films to theatre to music to art, said filmmaker Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury. Also present were Amitav Bhattacharya, Roopen Roy, Nandita Palchoudhury and Manish Goenka.        
	It seemed like the start of a relationship-building process for him, said Bhattacharya, who runs the NGO banglanatak.com. The prince is an extremely well-read guy with a great sense of humour. He listened carefully about our respective fields even as his men took notes.        
	Roy Chowdhury, the maker of Anuranan and Antaheen, added: He was amused to know that an entire Bengali film could be made with just 100,000 pounds. He promised full support and I wouldnt be surprised if something big comes out of this adda.        
	A princely sum for Tollywood or the Bengali stage, maybe?

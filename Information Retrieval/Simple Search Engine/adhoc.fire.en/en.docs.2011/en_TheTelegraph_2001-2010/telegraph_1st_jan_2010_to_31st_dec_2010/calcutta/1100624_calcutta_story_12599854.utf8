The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CM slams Mamata 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CM slams Mamata 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday criticised Mamata Banerjee for not expressing regret or seeking an apology for calling CPM cadre Arabinda (Bapi) Dhar a notorious criminal. Dhar died after being shot during the civic polls on June 30. Bhattacharjee, instead of naming Banerjee, referred to her as the leader of the Opposition party at a meeting to mourne Dhars death.        
	Protest: Around 300 nursing students kept the vice-chancellor and some other senior officials of West Bengal Health University confined in the Salt Lake campus for over 10 hours on Wednesday to protest the decision to strip the four-year nursing course of the honours tag. The officials could leave the campus at 10pm after a police team arrived.        
	Registrar Santanu Banerjee later said: The existing students will be given an honours degree. But those who will join the course in 2010 or thereafter, will be awarded a general degree.        
	Lightning: A 13-year-old student died and another 32 were injured after lightning struck Joergori Satyapriya Madhyamik Siksha Kendra in Howrah on Wednesday.        
	Fire: A fire broke out in a shop in Dum Dum and spread to two warehouses around 5.30pm on Wednesday. Twelve fire tenders brought the fire under control.

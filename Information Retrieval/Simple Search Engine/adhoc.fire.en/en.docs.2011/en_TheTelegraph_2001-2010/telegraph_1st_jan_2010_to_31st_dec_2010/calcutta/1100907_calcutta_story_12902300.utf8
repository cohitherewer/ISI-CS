The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Creative milieu to stretch horizons
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Creative milieu to stretch horizons
  - Different strokes of passion amp; pursuit        ARKA DAS                          Syed Taufik Riyaz at the Studio21 talk. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	Studio21 on Saturday evening offered Syed Taufik Riyazs illustrated presentation To Stretch The Horizons Of My Cage: Santiniketan Performances 1996-2010.        
	The presentation was all about the collective instead of showcasing individual creativity. Taufik a postgraduate from Kala Bhavan  took his audience through an informed journey of his years at Santiniketan, interspersed with historic accounts and anecdotes, all underscored with a sense of humour.        
	A presentation on installation practices at Santiniketan, Taufik emphasised, needs the ambience to be imagined, much of these being site-specific works in close contact with nature. He added that the role of photography for this presentation is not for the purpose of documentation; it offers us memories.        
	Not surprisingly, much of the art  both visual and performance  touched upon in the presentation has never been part of mainstream shows or journals, he explained, as these arose out of non-art practices, showcased in open-air spaces. The other facet of the creative milieu at Kala Bhavan is its secular identity: with roots in place, its about expressions.        
	With this foreword, Taufik moved on to state how the collective has always played a crucial role in art practices at Kala Bhavan. The performance history at Santiniketan has always been about a connect with nature and involvement of the mass. In theatre, for example, performances have more to do with anusthan than abhinay, thus giving rise to utsav.        
	Taufik cited Ramkinkar Baijs production of William Shakespeares plays at open-air spaces in Kala Bhavan. Enacted in Shakespearean language, the primary audience for these productions, apart from the institutes students and faculty, were local Santhal villagers. It didnt matter whether the local villagers understood Shakespeares language, or even English: what mattered was the transfer of energy in performance.        
	Indigenous technical practices, improvised performances and most importantly, freedom of artist and audience characterised this experimental milieu.        
	Fellow artists Sanchayan Ghosh, Satyanarayan Hembram and Samudra Saikias works were offered as visual references to this period, along with Bangla frontman Shayan Arnab Chowdhurys familiar voice flitting in and out of the background score to the experimental films Bulbuli and Invisible Children of Love.        
	Saikia gave rise to what is now called disposable theatre, a form neither mainstream nor alternative but offering an interface between the two. This form never asks the audience to switch off their mobile phones, said Taufik.

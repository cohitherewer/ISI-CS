          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Nursing homes and private hospitals can no longer hold back bodies for non-payment of dues, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said on Thursday.        
	The Clinical Establishments (Amendment) Bill, which was passed by the Assembly during the day, says hospitals denied their dues can approach the government, which has promised to pay the unrealised bills if they are found legitimate.        
	The bill also has provisions which state hospitals cannot turn away patients requiring admission. Current rules state that only emergency patients cant be denied admission.        
	Surjya Kanta Mishra, who tabled the bill in the Assembly, said the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Act, 1950, had become archaic.        
	New rules and provisions are needed to keep pace with developments in the health sector. We have been getting reports that bodies are not being handed over to family members because the bill has not been paid entirely. The amendment seeks to prevent nursing homes and private hospitals from doing that.        
	If the families fail to pay the bill, the hospital can get in touch with the government. If the claim is found legitimate, we will pay the bill. The practice is followed in government hospitals.        
	Private hospitals in town feel the law could be misused. The provision will encourage the families of some patients to purposely not pay the bill, said S.B. Purakayastha, the chief executive officer of Ruby General Hospital.        
	He also pointed at the lack of modality for the government to make good its promise of clearing unpaid bills.        
	Rupak Barua, the chief operating officer of CMRI, said it was the governments responsibility to ensure the law was not misused. There should be a forum where hospitals can appeal if they feel a patients relatives are intentionally refusing to pay up.        
	On July 5, 2010, Bally police station had to step in when a nursing home in Uttarpara refused to release the body of a 73-year-old till the family cleared the entire bill of Rs 60,000. The dues, which the family claimed had been inflated, were slashed following the police intervention.        
	Minister Mishra also said the bill had provisions that would prevent private hospitals from turning away patients, as they often do on flimsy grounds.        
	A poor man has the right to quality and timely treatment. How can a private hospital deny that? The amendment bill has a no-refusal clause. Besides, nursing homes must have emergency units, too, the minister said.        
	He also informed the House that the new rules would enable patients to scan their medical records and decide for themselves whether they had been subjected to the right treatment or not.        
	There cannot be any hide and seek. Patients and their families will have the right to check medical records, Mishra asserted. The bill also seeks to make it mandatory for doctors engaged in private practice to get their chambers registered and display their registration numbers and degrees.        
	Registration of private chambers is a must in this bill. There are people claiming to be doctors of alternative medicine. There are people saying that your weight can be reduced in three days. I wonder whether that can lead to a heart attack. The patients should know the doctors credentials, Mishra said.

	Students must be controlled without punishing them physically was the consensus at a meeting of teachers of Anglo-Indian schools at the Assembly of God Church School on Tuesday.        
	The discussion on The teacher and the taught: yesterday and today, organised by the Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools, was attended by teachers from the two La Martinieres, Loretos, St James, St Xaviers, St Thomas, Calcutta Boys, Calcutta Girls, Don Bosco, Julien Day, Frank Anthony, Assembly of God Church, Welland Gouldsmith and other schools.        
	Instead of using force to correct a child, teachers should imbibe in students qualities like sense of logic, conviction and courage so that they can deal with any situation in life, said Barry OBrien, the MLA representing the Anglo-Indian community.        
	We will adopt the suggestions emerging from the meeting as much as possible, said Richard Gomes, the association general secretary.

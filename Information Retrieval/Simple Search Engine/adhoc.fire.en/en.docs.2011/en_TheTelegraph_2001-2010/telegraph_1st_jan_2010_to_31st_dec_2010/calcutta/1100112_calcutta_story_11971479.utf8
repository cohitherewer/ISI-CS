The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roadblock over LPG stations
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Roadblock over LPG stations
          OUR BUREAU                          LPG autos on VIP Road                                  
	Around 70 autorickshaw drivers blocked the Sealdah flyover for over 45 minutes on Monday morning demanding more LPG filling stations in Calcutta and its neighbourhood.        
	The transport minister later admitted that there were not enough LPG stations in the city.        
	The drivers claimed that they had to spend hours for a refill as there were not enough stations. According to an official in the transport department, there are 20 LPG stations in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.        
	Officials said at least 60 stations were required for the 12,000-odd green autos plying in the city and its neighbouring areas.        
	We are losing out on business every day waiting for a refill in serpentine queues outside the handful of LPG stations. How long we will have to suffer like this? asked a protester.        
	The blockade continued from 10.45am to 11.30am, throwing the rush-hour traffic on the busy stretch out of gear. Vehicles were stranded for several hundred metres at both ends. A large police contingent was sent to the spot to bring the situation under control.        
	The protesters were sitting in the middle of the road, shouting slogans. The blockade was withdrawn following persuasion by the police, said an officer of Entally police station.        
	In the evening, transport minister Ranjit Kundu admitted that there were not enough LPG stations in the city and its adjacent areas.        
	Given the situation, auto drivers are justified in holding protest rallies. Our department is looking into the matter. We will take some action soon, Kundu told reporters at Writers Buildings on Monday afternoon.        
	The minister blamed oil companies for not opening adequate LPG stations. There are plans to open another 21 stations over the next few months. That will solve problem to a large extent, he added.

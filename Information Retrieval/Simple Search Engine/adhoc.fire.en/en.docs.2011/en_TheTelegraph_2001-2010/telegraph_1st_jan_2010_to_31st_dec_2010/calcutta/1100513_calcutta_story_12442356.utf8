The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City wilts under twin blows
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City wilts under twin blows
  - Day of sweat, night of thieves          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	The city suffered from the combined onslaught of swelter and power cuts on Wednesday with the Met office almost ruling out any chance of relief in the next 48 hours.        
	The maximum temperature, which was recorded in the afternoon, was normal but the humidity ranged between 64 and 81 per cent, driving up the discomfort index 11 degrees above the normal mark of 66 degrees Celsius.        
	The high humidity is responsible for the swelter. The minimum humidity, which should have been 40-50 per cent during this time of the year, was abnormally high, said a Met official.        
	G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, said the weather was likely to stay sultry and uncomfortable at least till Friday. There is little chance of rain in the next 48 hours.        
	Meteorologists attributed the high humidity to abundant flow of moisture from the Bay of Bengal under the influence of a trough of low pressure to the west of the city and its neighbourhood.        
	Had the humidity resulted in cloud formation in the upper levels of the atmosphere, there would have been rain or thundershowers. Over the past few days, cloud formation has been restricted to the lower levels. Relief in the form of rain is unlikely in such a situation, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private agency.        
	The days maximum temperature  36.1 degrees Celsius  was normal but the minimum shot up four degrees above normal to 29.9.        
	The difference between the maximum and the minimum was only around six degrees. The daytime will remain uncomfortable so long the minimum remains so high, said an official of the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	The uncomfortable weather pushed up the demand for power, with the CESC areas wilting under a deficit of 100MW during peak hours and an hours power cut. In the rest of the state, the shortfall was around 550MW as the demand crossed 3,800MW.        
	We have been sending out over 1,100MW every day. To meet Wednesdays peak hour demand of around 1,600MW, we needed to import 500MW. But the state grid could not supply that much power because of its own deficit, said a CESC official.

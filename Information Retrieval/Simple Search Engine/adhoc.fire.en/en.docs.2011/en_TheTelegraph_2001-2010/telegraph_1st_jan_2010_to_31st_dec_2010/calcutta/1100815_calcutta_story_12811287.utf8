The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The writer, his lover and her boyfriend 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The writer, his lover and her boyfriend 
                              Rajorshi Chakraborti at the book launch                             
	The author was facing his teacher and answering a barrage of questions at the Oxford Bookstore on August 6. The tall, lanky Rajorshi Chakraborti, who could still pass off as an English Literature student but in reality is a teacher himself at the University of Edinburgh, UK, was in conversation with Supriya Choudhuri, who teaches at Jadavpur University. It was the launch of Rajorshis wacky novel, Balloonists, published by Tranquebar.         
	Chaudhuri, while acknowledging that it was always a pleasure to meet ones student as an established author, admitted that she had not read Rajorshis first two novels, or the Day Seizes You, which was shortlisted for the Hutch-Crossword Book Award, 2006, and Derangements, which was being published in the US as Shadow Play.         
	Saying that Balloonists was a very down to earth novel with none of the magic realism, Chaudhuri asked the author about the fragmented, disconnected social life that he portrayed. In the novel, the protagonist Dev doesnt think twice about landing up at his former girlfriends aunts house, a 90-year-old who readily gives him bed and breakfast, yet there is a distance between them, agrees Rajorshi.         
	Dev, a British-Asian author, on being informed by his current live-in that she is pregnant, dumps everything to go in search of his ex-girlfriend in Munich. En route he encounters the man for whom she had dumped him. Together, the two go in search of the girl, squabbling and fumbling all the way.         
	The characters, Chaudhuri said, were lost and cocooned in self-concern, almost condemning the author for the kind of life you are representing.         
	The author tried to explain: The Dev I wanted to explore was the Dev who had lost someone and was inconsolable. When you have been sad for a long time, the sadness is the truest part of your identity. So even when life gives you a chance, you dont take it, as sadness is so familiar. I also wanted to write a comic novel, full of characters and incidents that were funny.                     ANASUYA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Last mission landed Gudda in custody
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Last mission landed Gudda in custody
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Gudda at a city court                                  
	Zaffar Siddiqui, alias Gudda, was planning to leave the state with friend Shabnam Begum but police got the better of him on Sunday evening, said officers at Lalbazar.        
	A revolver tucked in his waist, Gudda had just walked into Gulshan International, off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, with Shabnam when police pounced on him.        
	The duo have been remanded in police custody for a fortnight.        
	An officer said Gudda had made close to Rs 25 lakh in ransom within a fortnight of being released on bail and visited several places, including Asansol and Darjeeling, in the past week in search of a safe haven. He had finally decided to leave Bengal. Before that he wanted to extort another trader.        
	But Guddas last mission landed him in custody yet again.        
	Gudda had earned a ransom of Rs 20 lakh by abducting Topsia trader Sheikh Aslam. The trader was released near the Bypass, on the southern fringes, on September 5, after which Gudda went to his hideout in Sonarpur, said a senior officer. Armed with cash, Gudda went around a few places before coming to the hotel to plan his next strike.        
	The police got a hint of Guddas whereabouts when they traced a widow in Sonarpur who had initially given shelter to the extortionist at her home for a few days before arranging for a rented house where Gudda stayed with Uttam, an alleged criminal from Phoolbagan.        
	Gudda never carried any cellphone. He gave the widow a phone to receive calls from his men and pass on information to him. With this he ensured that we couldnt keep a tab on him through the cellphone network, said an officer. The widow, whom Gudda met during her visits to a relative in jail, gave us crucial leads.        
	Cops said Gudda was smart even while making ransom calls. Soon after abducting Sheikh Aslam from his Topsia home, Gudda took him to his Sonarpur hideout. The next day, he went to Howrah to make a ransom call to Aslams relatives. As the police kept searching for his Howrah hideout, Gudda was hatching a plan sitting at Sonarpur to leave the city.         
	When Gudda checked into the hotel and was waiting for his bait to turn up, we barged into his room and caught hold of him. In another few days, he would have gone far beyond our reach, an officer said.        
	We have learnt about two recent extortion cases masterminded by Gudda but there could be more, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.

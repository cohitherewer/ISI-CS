The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Women robbed on tracks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Women robbed on tracks
  - Security step-up after acid attack in unguarded bogie          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A youth robbed eight women on a suburban train on Thursday afternoon, barely 15 hours after two men threw acid at women on another local train, injuring at least 10.         
	Both groups of victims were travelling in womens compartments without any security personnel.        
	The robber boarded the Diamond Harbour-Sealdah train near Park Circus station around 12.30pm. Brandishing a razor, he took six cellphones, a set of earrings and other jewellery from eight women, said G.A. Srinivasan, the superintendent of railway police (Sealdah). The youth jumped off the train when it slowed down at a signal before entering Sealdah station. The women raised an alarm but to no avail.         
	My daughter Moumita had boarded the train at Sonarpur station to go to Sealdah, where she was to attend journalism classes at an institute. The robber threatened her with a razor and took away her cellphone, said homemaker Sumitra Roy.        
	We protested the moment the youth boarded the compartment but he didnt pay any heed and there was no cop to take him to task. He soon brought out a razor from his pocket and asked us to hand over valuables, said another woman who was robbed.         
	The women lodged a complaint with Sealdah GRP.         
	The latest proof of the lack of security in womens compartments of suburban trains came with three women still struggling to recover at BR Singh Hospital following Wednesdays acid attack.         
	The condition of Arati Pandit and Kanchan Haldar is stable. But Mamata Panja, who sustained 40 per cent burns, is still in a critical state, said a senior official of the hospital.        
	She is not being able to speak and her right eye has been affected, said one of Panjas relatives.         
	Railway police have not been able to track down the two culprits. The injured women told us what the men looked like. From their accounts, it seems the men did not target anyone in particular, said Dilip Mitra, the additional director general of police, railways.        
	The incident prompted railways to announce security upgrades.        
	RPF personnel, including women constables, will be present in womens compartments of local trains in both Sealdah and Howrah divisions after 6pm, said S.C. Sahu, the chief security commissioner of Eastern Railway.        
	Each coach of the suburban trains will have phone numbers that can be dialled in an emergency, said Mitra.        
	Women who commute by local trains were not satisfied with the measures. There have been many such announcements in the past, said Ankhi Barui, a regular commuter in the Sealdah south section.        
	The emergency numbers will not be of much use as all the stations do not have GRP outposts. If something happens at Dhakuria, which doesnt have any security outpost, security personnel have to reach there from either Jadavpur or Ballygunge, she added.

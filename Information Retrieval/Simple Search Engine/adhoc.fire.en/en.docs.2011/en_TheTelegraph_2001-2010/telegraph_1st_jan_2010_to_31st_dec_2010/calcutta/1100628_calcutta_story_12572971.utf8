The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land lock for zoo project
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Land lock for zoo project
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          The site of the proposed zoo. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	The zoo at Bhagabanpur in Sonarpur may not come up in the near future because of land and infrastructure hurdles.        
	The state government first has to convince residents of the area to part with about 500 acres of land.        
	Nearly 300 families in Kharki, Kantipota, Jagadishpota and Chamurati, about 5km from the Ruby crossing on the EM Bypass, were handed over the bheris and the marshy plots in the early-1990s.        
	Fish cultivation has been my only source of income. I will be jobless if the land is taken away. We had heard that the government would pay Rs 7 lakh to each family as compensation. But recently I heard that the government would pay Rs 4 lakh per family as compensation, said Rohit Sardar, a resident of Kharki.        
	Not everyone is as resigned as Sardar. We wont part with our land. We had chased away government officials when they came to measure the land, said a trader at Kharki.        
	The tilt of power in local politics may pose a problem. The Trinamul Congress, which had led the Singur agitation, now enjoys clout in an area that was a CPM stronghold a few years back.        
	We dont mind giving up our land but proper compensation has to be offered, said Trinamuls Shashanka Mondal, a panchayat representative from Goalbati, opposite the proposed zoo site.        
	The chief minister may have prodded forest minister Ananta Roy to speed up the project but residents have not heard from the government yet. Roy said talks with the people regarding compensation would start soon.        
	Creating infrastructure will be another challenge. Buses ply till Anandapur. Autos are the only transport option, said Mondal. The 14ft-wide road built nearly a decade back with central funds is in a poor condition. The road has to be re-laid and widened for more vehicles to ply on it regularly, said Mondal. Roy said infrastructure work would be taken up after the land issue is sorted out.

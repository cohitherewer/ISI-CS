The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sovan, not Sobhandeb
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sovan, not Sobhandeb
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sovan Chatterjee and (right) Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay                                  
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee saw red on Monday afternoon after receiving a Calcutta University (CU) convocation invite that mistakenly names him Sovan Deb Chattopadhyay.        
	I am Sovan, the mayor asserted and claimed his name had deliberately been confused with that of his party colleague Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, a leader of auto drivers.        
	The mistake is more political than official, Chatterjee told Metro and vowed not to attend the convocation on Tuesday.         
	The mayors office detected the mistake in the invite around 3pm. Around 5pm, CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das called up Chatterjee, regretted the error and requested him to be present at the Centenary Hall for the convocation.        
	There cant be a private apology for a public error. Before inviting me, the university authorities did not find out whether I will be available. I will be busy attending a number of important meetings, said Chatterjee.         
	If the vice-chancellor was really sorry, he could have sent a new card properly addressing the mayor. But it has not been done. Hence, we think the mistake was deliberate and politically motivated, mayoral council member Firhad Hakim said in the evening.         
	The alleged trigger was the mayors refusal to attend a programme along with municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya on the occasion of World Habitat Day 2010 at Sisir Mancha on Monday morning.         
	The minister had apparently called up Chatterjee from the venue but the mayor still refused to attend the programme.        
	Sources said the mayor would have anyway avoided the convocation since CU is a state university and the Trinamul policy is to skip state government programmes.        
	Trinamul leader and railway minister Mamata Banerjee had not bothered to invite chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to the foundation stone-laying ceremony for a Metro line attended by the President on September 22.

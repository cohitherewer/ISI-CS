                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A quiet wedding for Konkona
  - Tolly-Bolly star picks privacy amp; Arya Samaj method to marry Ranvir          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    MIXED DOUBLES: Konkona Sen Sharma and Ranvir Shorey      
	Konkona Sen Sharma married Ranvir Shorey on Friday afternoon at their Versova apartment. The private affair was attended only by immediate family and closest friends.        
	Konkonas mother Aparna Sen (with her husband Kalyan Roy) and father Mukul (with his wife Vinita) were among those present. Elder sister Kamalini was down from Cincinnati to attend the closed-door wedding in Mumbai.        
	She, a thinking mans screen heartthrob, and he, one of Bollywoods natural born talents, had scrapped a big fat filmi wedding planned in Calcutta last winter and opted for a hush-hush Arya Samaj wedding instead. The venue was not a star hotel but the Versova address where they have been living together for close to two years.        
	Konkona, 30, and Ranvir, 38, met and fell in love on the sets of Mixed Doubles in 2006. They got engaged without any fanfare in June 2008 and from then on have kept even their families guessing about their marriage plans.        
	They both wanted a discreet and intimate affair and thats how it was, said a family friend, adding that a party for around 100 guests was slated for the evening.        
	Aparna Sen was busy in Mumbai for a week with the re-recording and final mix for Iti Mrinalini  a film that stars both Konkona and Ranvir  and the only hint she had given of the wedding was to tell her team that she would not be available from September 2 to 4.        
	Kalyan Ray joined her on Wednesday, with his Facebook status on Tuesday reading ... off to mumbai to see coco-ma (Konkona) and reena (Aparna). The presence of Mukul Sharma  who had starred in Aparna Sens Paroma  was no surprise. Konkona is very close to her father and spends time with him whenever she visits Delhi, said a friend.        
	Konkona started out in Tollywood with Subrata Sens Ek Je Achhe Kanya in 2000, shot into national limelight with her mothers Mr amp; Mrs Iyer and achieved Bollywood stardom with Madhur Bhandarkars Page 3, playing a journalist (always her second career choice). Ranvir started out as a VJ on Channel V, before making his mark in Bollywood.        
	Konkona and Ranvir also starred in Madhurs Traffic Signal. No wonder a common friend quipped: Their signal has finally turned green. All the best, guys.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blaze razes 400 shanties

	About 250 shanties and 150 godowns on facing banks of a narrow canal behind Science City were reduced to ashes on Friday, leaving about 1,200 people without a home and livelihood.         
	Twenty tenders took nearly three hours to control the fire at Mazdoor Para bustee, off Topsia Road (East) and the EM Bypass. No one was injured. The extent of damage could not be estimated.         
	According to residents, the fire started in a shanty close to the EM Bypass around 11.15am. A girl, about 10 years old, accidentally set ablaze her shanty, while cooking. She was too scared to sound an alarm. If she had, the fire could perhaps have been contained, said Soni Khatun, a resident whose home was gutted.        
	Strong winds blew burning fragments of the shanties across the 6ft-wide Topsia Moila Khal, setting makeshift godowns on the other bank on fire. The flames spread rapidly since items made of combustible material like plastic, polythene and bamboo were stocked in the illegal structures, many of them owned by residents of the shanties.         
	As the flames spread, residents ran out of their homes in panic. About 200 children, attending classes in an informal school run by an NGO, were forced to flee the shanty, said teacher Basabi Bhattacharya.         
	We could not even carry a single utensil out of our home. And the tea stall that I used to run, my only source of income, has also been gutted. I dont know how to feed my eight family members, said Sheikh Daulat, in his late-50s. The family took refuge in a marble factory in the area.        
	The director of fire services, Gopal Bhattacharya, said the blaze would not have caused such damage had the residents not stocked inflammable materials in their homes and godowns. Everything stored in the shanties  leather items, plastic products, chemicals  are highly combustible. The shanties were made of polythene sacks, which are also inflammable. Ideally, shanties should be made of tin, said Bhattacharya.        
	The two fires in January [at Basanti Colony and on DC Dey Road] in which over 600 shanties were gutted would not have spread either had combustible materials not been stocked there, he added.        
	A fireman questioned why the local administration and the police did not stop residents of Mazdoor Para from stocking inflammable materials.         
	The mayor and civic Opposition leader Javed Ahmed Khan visited the area in the afternoon. The land belongs to the irrigation department. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will build homes for those who lost theirs with money from the mayors relief fund. The godowns would not be rebuilt, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

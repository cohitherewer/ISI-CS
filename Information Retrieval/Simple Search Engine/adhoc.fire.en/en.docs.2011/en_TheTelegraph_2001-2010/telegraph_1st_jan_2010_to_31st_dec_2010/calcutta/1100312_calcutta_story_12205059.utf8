The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Coach spoof starring Shah Rukh   Buddy, help KKR! 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Coach spoof starring Shah Rukh     - City boy directs KKR boss in ads mocking multiple-captain theory          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Bauddhayan Mukherji (left) directs Shah Rukh Khan for the Nokia ad                                        
	Shah Rukh Khan has fallen back on a Calcuttan to call the shots not only on the field but also on the sets.        
	City boy Bauddhayan Mukherji earned King Khans vote of confidence to wield the megaphone in a series of Nokia commercials starring him along with Team Knight Riders, and spoofing sacked coach John Buchanans multiple-captain theory.        
	The former student of South Point and St Xaviers had directed Shah Rukh in a Nokia ad before but it was apparently different this time because of the KKR link.        
	This time it was the owner of KKR meeting one of his teams biggest fans, smiled Bauddhayan, better known as Buddy in advertising circles and feted internationally for his Bell Bajao campaign against domestic violence.         
	Viewers may connect quicker with his cheeky Amul Macho twaing hai ad, though.        
	Buddys Little Lamb Films has produced three ad films for Nokia. Given KKRs sterling performance last year, there is a lot of talk about the teams showing, said Viral Oza, the head of activation, media and online marketing at Nokia India, tongue firmly in cheek.        
	We, Indians, have a point of view on everything, from running a country to a cricket team. So we thought of reaching out to them for advice, he added.                                                        
	Nokias brief to Buddy was KKR needs everyones help.        
	The Main Bhi Coach campaign shows the fan on the street instructing Team KKR based on his or her core competence  with disastrous consequences, of course. In the end, the beaten cricketers wonder: Isko coach kisne banaya re? (Who made him the coach?)        
	Then in walks Shah Rukh, declaring:Maine, kyunki mujhe chahiye purey India ki expert advice (I did, because I want entire Indias expert advice).        
	 Shah Rukh was the butt of the jokes, but he took it sportingly. He is an amazing team man in the way he contributes to the shot and helps his co-actors, recalled Bauddhayan.        
	Actor and director even sat down for a heart-to-heart on KKR. We agreed not to be bothered about the results, though we shouldnt go down without a fight. Last years 95 all out mustnt happen again.         
	If Buddy has one regret, its Dadas absence on the sets, thanks to the Vijay Hazare final.

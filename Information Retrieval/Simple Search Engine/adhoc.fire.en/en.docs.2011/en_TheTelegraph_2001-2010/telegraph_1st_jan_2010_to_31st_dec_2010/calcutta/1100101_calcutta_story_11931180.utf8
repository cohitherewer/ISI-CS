The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Calcutta 2010
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Calcutta 2010
										      The year that began with a rare blue moon eclipse promises to be an action-packed one for a city hurtling closer to a momentous election. Metro takes a peek into 2010, from flyover to festivity                        Aamir Khan, who ushered in 2010 in Calcutta with his 3 Idiots team, said he loved the emotional key of the people here. Wife Kiran Rao could not accompany him in a last-minute change of plan. So my midnight moment will be on the phone with her, Aamir told Metro.

	'Have a lovely New Year. Enjoy yourself but be responsible'
  mdash; AAMIR KHAN rsquo;S MESSAGE TO CALCUTTA  
	EDEN GARDENS  
	The revamp of Eden Gardens  bucket seats in all blocks, snazzy VIP boxes, two giant screens and, of course, a lighting system that doesnt blink  is scheduled to be completed by November. Also coming up at the stadium are a museum, a multi-gym, a dormitory for junior players, new dressing rooms and food courts. Tickets for IPL 3 in March-April could, however, be in short supply with the stadiums capacity down to almost half because of the renovation.              
	INFRASTRUCTURE         
	A four-lane flyover connecting Karunamoyee with Sector V will be commissioned in January. Work on the tech towns underground water supply and sewage network will also be completed in the first half of the year. The Writers Buildings parking lot, with space for 700 wheels, is slated for a March launch.         
	The VIP Road-EM Bypass flyover is set to be opened in April, making journeys to and from the airport smoother. But there will be no escaping the snarls caused by work on the Parama Island-Park Circus and the Vivekananda Road flyovers. Construction of ramps on the AJC Bose Road flyover could also disrupt traffic.         
	Metro Railway will go north with work likely to start on the Dum Dum-Baranagar and the airport link. At the airport, a new taxiway will reduce take-off time by eight minutes.         
	Old conveyor belts in the international arrival lounge will be replaced with new ones.               
	EDUCATION        
	Presidency College is set to become Presidency University this year, while exams will be less intimidating with Calcutta University deciding not to detain students in BA, BSc and BCom Part I and Part II. Students will get additional time to clear subject backlogs after Part III. Marksheets of CBSE Class X students will show only grades from now on.        
	On January 16, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will be the chief guest at the closing ceremony of the 150th year celebrations of St Xaviers, Calcutta. La Martiniere for Girls and Boys will kick off their 175th anniversary celebrations.               
	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY        
	A 200,000sq ft IT complex, a joint venture of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Webel, is set to come up behind Science City.              
	REAL ESTATE        
	Real estates recovery from the downturn-induced slump began after Puja 2009, and the New Year promises to add momentum to the sector. A clutch of large-format housing projects are scheduled to be ready in phases over the next 12 months. The retail real estate segment is, however, set to lie low during the year. Lake Mall, or Lake Markets modern avatar, and Forum Courtyard, an annexe of Forum on Elgin Road, are among the few likely to open over the next 12 months.              
	HOSPITALITY        
	The Taj Gateway at the Ruby connector and Tristar (serviced apartments at Terminus, New Town) could become operational by the year-end.                 
	HEALTHCARE         
	The Tata Cancer Research Hospital in New Town is expected to be ready along with the Fortis Groups 414-bed multi-speciality hospital at Anandapur, off the EM Bypass. The Medica Synergie Hospital will also open off the Bypass. The AMRI groups 300-bed woman and childcare hospital will be commissioned at Mukundapur, while Apollo Gleneagles will start a 50-bed cancer hospital with robotic radiotherapy.         
	Of the state-run hospitals, SSKM Hospital and RG Kar Medical College and Hospital are set to start work on the first government trauma care centres in the city. SSKM will also add 200 beds and set up nephrology and urology units.         
	NRS Medical College and Hospital will install equipment for diagnosis and treatment of cancer at one-third the cost of private centres.                 
	ASTRONOMY        
	2010 could be a once-in-a-blue-moon year  literally  for astronomy enthusiasts. The 12.22-1.22am partial eclipse on blue-moon New Year (called so because of the second full moon in a month) will be followed by a solar eclipse on January 15, to be partially visible from Calcutta and its neighbourhood.        
	On January 29, stargazers can catch a glimpse of an unusually bright Mars as the red planet inches closer to the Earth while orbiting the sun. Soon after, its Saturns turn to shine brighter as it comes in opposition  when the sun is on one side of earth and another planet is on the opposite side  with the earth on March 22, followed by Jupiter on September 21.         
	On June 26, Calcutta will witness the last phase of a partial lunar eclipse that will be visible across eastern Asia, Australia and the western Americas.        
	But the city will miss out on two big celestial events  a total solar eclipse on July 11 and a total lunar eclipse on December 21.              
	PUJA        
	Durga puja returns to October in 2010 after a September date in 2009. According to the almanacs, Sashthi falls on October 13. Kali puja is on November 5.        
	PLEX        
	The producer-plex row in mid-2009 hit the film business hard but the year ended with a bang with Avatar and 3 Idiots. 2010 could be the year of 3D entertainment with INOX and Fame set to screen Hollywood blockbusters in that format. A new Cinemax property in Salt Lake and INOX properties at Jessore Road and Howrah are on the anvil. Fame also has plans to add screens in mid-2010. But the biggie will be Bioscope at Axis Mall, Rajarhat, which is poised for a January launch. The six-screen multiplex from Priya Entertainment will have an auditorium dedicated to children.              
	CABLE        
	National broadcasters will launch regional channels in 2010, improving the quality of content. More channels will force a switch to digital signals. Set-top boxes will become mandatory but they might even come free of cost with competition among service providers heating up.        
	The big multi-system operators (MSOs) are likely to introduce broadband through cable this year. Interactive services like movie on demand and video on demand will be big.        
	Direct-to-home (DTH) services will grab a greater share of the cable pie.              
	GREEN        
	Green is unlikely to be a poll plank for future city planners contesting the 2010 Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections but citizens can hope to see more old, polluting vehicles being replaced with new, environment-friendly ones. The gains could yet be nullified by the rise in the number of diesel-driven vehicles on the road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ground beneath city crumbles 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ground beneath city crumbles 
  - Weak spots in Raj-era sewers         DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                                  
	Almost 40 per cent of the motorable roads in the city are prone to subsidence with the British-era brick sewers running underneath them creaking under the burden of age and apathy.        
	Although the kingsize Calcutta crater created by the cave-in opposite the western gate of Raj Bhavan on Tuesday didnt swallow anyone, the incident did set alarm bells ringing in a city where weak spots on thoroughfares abound.        
	The heavier the load of traffic, greater the possibility of a cave-in at the weakest point of the sewer roof. This is exactly what happened at Government Place West, said mayor Sovan Chatterjee, bearing the brunt of inherited civic decay.         
	It was the second cave-in on that road in as many years. That site was filled up with hot mix, recalled the mayor.        
	According to experts, therein lies the problem  fill the crater and forget it, leaving the crux of the problem unsolved.         
	The city has an underground brick-sewer network spanning around 200km, out of which only around 9km has been reinforced. Unless all weak points in the network are strengthened, incidents like these could occur at regular intervals, warned a former engineer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.         
	Fortunately for motorists passing by, the cave-in occurred before the rush hour. Sources said a traffic constable on duty near the west gate of Raj Bhavan spotted the subsidence at 8am and informed the police control room, which alerted the civic body.         
	 The moment the constable tapped the surface of the road, a row of bricks underneath collapsed in a heap, recalled a traffic sergeant.        
	At 13ft, the resultant crater was deep enough to dwarf two Amitabh Bachchans.         
	With traffic being restricted to the eastern flank, even Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy was forced to make a detour from its usual route to Writers Buildings.         
	If our thoroughfares start caving in like this, I am afraid a tragedy will strike soon, said insurance agent Arnab Ganguly, stopping his motorcycle to take a look at the gaping hole.        
	Former mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had initiated a Rs 97-crore scheme to bolster some of the weak brick sewers under busy roads with reinforced cement concrete casting. The project covered Free School Street, Wood Street, Short Street, Kidderpore and Watgunje.        
	Amit Roy, the chief engineer of drainage and sewerage in the CMC, said the same technique would be used at Government Place West. The roof of the sewer is not concrete, it is a brick arch. We will excavate the site to take out the bricks, remove the silt and then lay reinforced concrete slabs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | YA, Mowgli son is on! 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      YA, Mowgli son is on!

	The 30-something author, who published his first book eight years ago, is now a veteran of a three-book fantasy series, some cool comics, a couple of screenplays and now a new series of Young Adult fiction, called YA. The YA list of Scholastic has kicked off with Basus Morningstar Agency adventure series with the first title Terror on the Titanic just out on the shelf.         
	The book, launched at the South City Mall Starmark on Thursday, is about Nathaniel Brown, a Morningstar agent, who is on the Titanic to prevent a jewel from reaching America. He is Mowglis son.         
	Samit spoke on Indian publishing opening up to young readers and the may genres. The world over it has been a golden age for childrens literature since 2001 with Harry Potter, Lisbeth Salander, the Percy Jackson series and so on. But in India, there were only RK Narayan and Ruskin Bond, nothing contemporary. Kalpana Swaminathan was appreciated abroad but not in India, feels Samit.         
	The reason is not far to seek. With poor marketing budgets, books werent getting visibility. Except a Vikram Seth or someone with a million-pound advance. Samit was interested in writing a book for children. But I write to make a living. I wouldnt really be interested in something that wouldnt sell. Besides, publishers didnt want to touch anything unless they were sure of numbers.         
	But in the last five years Indian publishing grew by leaps and bounds. Today, 5,000 copies of a book sell quickly and sales are touching the one lakh figure, said the author of the English fantasy series, the GameWorld. The first title of this series, Simoquin Prophecies, was published in 2004. About the same time Sarnath Banerjee, Rana Dasgupta and Chetan Bhagat too emerged. Suddenly a lot of different kinds of writing were happening.         
	There are now 10 new books a year in childrens publishing. The younger editors are more clued in. Books published abroad are available instantly. In my childhood I was stuck with Enid Blyton when she was passe in the West. Now you get to read the latest Percy Jackson as soon as it is out in the West.         
	Comics too, Basu feels, has an exciting future in India. I was thoroughly privileged to be working with Shekhar Kapur, who launched a new company to produce Virgin Comics, and my co-writer Siddharth Kotian, artist Mukesh Singh and Nanjan J. But he was disappointed that the comic series was marketed more in the US than in India. Samit is also keen about the graphic novel genre. Its growing very fast.         
	He is into more adult stuff also. His new book Turbulent from Hachette India will be out this October. Its a superhero book set in India, Pakistan and England.                          ANASUYA BASU

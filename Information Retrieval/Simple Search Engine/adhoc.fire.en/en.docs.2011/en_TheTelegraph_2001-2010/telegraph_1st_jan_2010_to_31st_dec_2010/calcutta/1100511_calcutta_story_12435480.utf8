The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro vs railway slows East-West
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro vs railway slows East-West
  - Ministry accused of terminal tangle        SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	Mamata Banerjees railway ministry has thrown the East-West Metro off track by failing to hand over land for underground passenger interchange terminals at Howrah and Sealdah.        
	Sources in the Calcutta Metro Rail Corporation blamed red tape in the ministry for the impasse while railway officials cited a proposed design change for Howrah station as the cause of delay.        
	We have paid an advance of Rs 5 crore for land at Howrah and Sealdah but the relevant files just arent moving in the railway ministry, said a senior official of the corporation, a joint venture of the state and central governments.        
	The corporation needs around 15,000sq m of land each at both places to set up the underground stations. It has agreed to pay Rs 30 crore  Rs 26 crore for Howrah and Rs 4 crore for Sealdah  as land price and the cost of shifting some railway facilities.        
	The Rs 4,874 crore East-West Metro, covering 14.5km from Sector V to Howrah Maidan, is meant to be partly commissioned by 2012 and fully operational by 2014. But officials said the deadline would be impossible to meet if work was stalled in Howrah and Sealdah.        
	Two years ago, the railways had agreed in principle to provide the land required to build the two underground Metro stations. The land was to be transferred to us latest by April this year but we havent even received the formal approval, said a senior official of the corporation.        
	The two sides had met earlier this month but railway officials allegedly declined to make any commitment. They said the proposal was pending with the ministry, revealed a source.        
	Eastern Railway had started shifting some of its utilities between platform numbers 16 and 17 of Howrah station as part of the deal with the corporation but suspended work a couple of months back.        
	We were to start construction in September. The tunnel-boring machine for the underground section covering Sealdah is set to arrive by then while equipment for the stretch that includes Howrah station will be available in January 2011, the corporation official said.        
	A senior Eastern Railway official said talks would be held with the corporation over the next few weeks to avoid a clash of priorities.        
	Its a complicated issue. Howrah station needs a complete overhaul to be upgraded to a world-class station. The process of appointing a global consultant for the project is almost over. The architectural design and traffic layout for the next 40 years will be drawn up soon, said Md Jamshed, the divisional railway manager in Howrah.        
	So does it mean more than just a delay for the East-West Metro?        
	The corporations technical team would need to modify the East-West Metros design in accordance with our plan for Howrah. The design would depend on how many platforms, satellite terminals, underground subways and other facilities Howrah will ultimately have, said Jamshed.        
	A recent survey by the Metro corporation showed that 1.1 lakh local train passengers arrive at Howrah and another 1.3 lakh at Sealdah between 9.30am and 10.30am on a weekday. Around 20 per cent of these passengers are expected to avail of the East-West Metro to reach various parts of the city.        
	The survey proves that Howrah and Sealdah stations would be key passenger interfaces, and we cannot afford to compromise on space at both locations, said an engineer of the corporation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Residents turn to private protection
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Residents turn to private protection
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                              
	The Rs 2-lakh heist at Subimal Chandra and Basanti Gangulys Salt Lake home on Saturday has prompted the visibly shaken elderly couple to employ private security guards.         
	I am too scared to sleep peacefully. I am losing faith in the police and have sought the help of a private security firm, said Basanti, 64.         
	The Gangulys have joined a growing band of residents who are turning to private agencies for security at home in the wake of a string of thefts in the township over the past few months.        
	According to police registers, at least seven incidents of burglary and theft occurred in Salt Lake since December.        
	More than 20 security agencies have set up shop in the township in the past few years. Their owners said enquiries about deployment of private guards at houses has increased over the past one-and-a-half years.        
	The monthly rate ranges from Rs 4,000 to Rs 7,500 for an eight-hour shift.         
	These days, we receive at least 120 enquiries per month. Apart from offices and apartments buildings, we are also getting calls from houses, which was hardly the case even a year and a half back, said Kartik Ghosh, an official at Group 4 Securitys Salt Lake office. Some even enquire about armed guards, he added.        
	Office-bearers of residents associations said house owners had been forced to take such steps as they were frustrated with the township police. The cops have been a total failure in checking crime in the area. Whenever we seek an explanation, they parrot their hackneyed excuse of limited manpower. How long are we going to buy this excuse? grumbled Uma Shankar Sadhu, the secretary of the Salt Lake Welfare association.        
	Sadhu alleged that cops show little interest in attending block general meetings or community policing.         
	Police officers pointed out there were just 32 cops each for the three police stations in the 33.5sq km township, which has 80 residential blocks and 20 exit and entry points, including eight footbridges.        
	Senior officers, however, refused to admit the rise in the number of thefts. There is nothing to panic about. Thefts have occurred even in houses protected by private guards, said the additional superintendent of police, Debabrata Das.

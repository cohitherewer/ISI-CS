The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Finger at cane rule on campus
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Finger at cane rule on campus
  - Probe proves punishment,   sleuths take up boy case        OUR BUREAU                                                            
	The probe team of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights revealed on Thursday that corporal punishment was a common practice at La Martiniere for Boys even as the detective department took up the abetment-to-suicide case against four teachers and the schools principal.        
	From what we have heard from the students, caning by the principal is a regular affair, Ashok Agarwal, head of the probe panel, told Metro after meeting Bishop Ashok Biswas.        
	Agarwal and his team came to this conclusion after meeting the batchmates of Rouvanjit Rawla  who was found hanging in his Alipore home on February 12, four days after being caned by principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi  as well as students of other classes and even ex-students.        
	When the principal admitted to the schools board of governors that he had caned the boy, it was left to the bishop (the chairman of the board) to decide what action should be taken. The bishop just gave the principal a warning. It is shocking, added Agarwal.        
	Ratnaboli Roy, who was added to the committee in Calcutta, told Metro the probe had revealed caning, slapping and boxing of ears did take place regularly on the 11 Loudon Street campus.        
	Principal Chakravarthi did not respond to calls or text messages for the fourth day in a row, while sources in the Bishops office rubbished the probe panels claim that corporal punishment was a regular affair in the boys school.        
	The punishment suffered by Rouvanjit and its alleged link to his suicide will now be investigated by the detective department, which took over the case from Shakespeare Sarani police station on Thursday.        
	Considering the serious allegation against some teachers of a leading school, we have started investigation. Our main objective is to ascertain whether the boy was driven by the accused to commit suicide, said a senior officer.        
	In his complaint to Shakespeare Sarani police station on Monday, Ajay Rawla had accused five teachers of the school, including the principal, of torturing his son, a student of Class VIII, and driving him to his death.        
	We will speak to the family members, the boys friends in school and also the accused teachers and their colleagues, said the officer of the detective department.        
	The controversy over corporal punishment at La Martiniere for Boys came to light when Metro reported on May 21 how Neil OBrien and K.S. David had been dropped from the school board after they demanded appropriate action against the principal for caning Rouvanjit.        
	OBrien and David had also demanded immediate action against Sanjay Smart, the teacher accused of demanding a laptop as bribe for promoting Class IV student Srijan Banerjee. The school took no action against Smart, who was arrested on May 17 and is now in judicial custody till June 14.        
	The team from the national commission on Thursday recommended to the bishop that strong action be taken against Smart.        
	All is not well in the school. There are many grey areas and some radical reforms are required, said Agarwal, who will be submitting the report to the commission in two or three days.        
	The predilection for punishment apart, the team will highlight the need for democratisation of the administrative process. There is no written policy on admission, detention and transfer certificate, and students cant voice their concerns, claimed Roy.

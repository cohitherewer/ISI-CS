          A STAFF REPORTER                          Indrani                                  
	A BlackBerry phone and some documents belonging to actress Indrani Halder were allegedly stolen from Technicians Studio on Friday afternoon. Indrani said the items were stolen from a make-up room while she was shooting for the TV serial Samay.         
	Its my personal make-up room and my assistant had locked the door when I left for the set. A little later, my assistant found the lock of the door broken. My purse, which contained my PAN card and several bank cards, was missing, along with my new BlackBerry, said Indrani. She lodged a complaint with Regent Park police station and the cops started a case of theft.         
	Mall blackout: Power supply was snapped at Hiland Park mall for almost 24 hours on Thursday evening because of alleged non-payment of dues of around Rs 32 lakh. Power returned on Friday evening after the arrears were cleared, said a mall official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tolly ho! Bolly takes a beating
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tolly ho! Bolly takes a beating
  - Feluda and Chapal Bhaduri bigger draws than Akshay and Katrina          PRIYANKA ROY                          CROWD-PULLERS: Gorosthanay Sabdhaan (top) and Aarekti Premer Galpo                                                  
	Prosenjit the fakir has edged past Akshay Kumar the con man. The queues are longer for Rituparno Ghosh the gay filmmaker-cum-cross dressing jatra artiste than for Katrina Kaif the item girl. Tolly is ending 2010 on a rare high: beating Bolly at the box office.        
	In a first, Christmas Eve release Aarekti Premer Galpo, the latest Feluda adventure Gorosthanay Sabdhaan and Prosenjit starrers Moner Manush and Autograph are top draws at multiplexes, even as big, bad Bollywood (read Tees Maar Khan) hits a low.        
	All the Bengali films are doing remarkably well. While Aarekti Premer Galpo has found favour with the mature audience, the crowd count for Gorosthanay Sabdhaan continues to swell in Week 3, says Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX.        
	Elgin Road to Rajarhat, Salt Lake to Prince Anwar Shah Road, the Tolly flag is flying high, thanks to jatra veteran Chapal Bhaduri and super sleuth Feluda. The occupancy figures for these films are in the range of 50 to 90 per cent while Tees Maar Khan has barely managed to notch up 20 per cent on weekdays, says a Fame Cinemas official.        
	The much-touted Farah Khan film had a record-breaking weekend, but crashed Monday onwards, despite Sheila ki jawaani. From Monday, business fell sharply, making Tees Maar Khan one of the biggest disappointments of the year, says Mumbai-based trade analyst Taran Adarsh.        
	So, its left to the Tolly brigade to bail out the box office. Buoyed by critical acclaim, Kaushik Gangulys Aarekti Premer Galpo has brought in the discerning viewer while Sandip Rays Gorosthanay Sabdhaan is the GenX favourite.              
	Aarekti Premer Galpo isnt just a gay love story. The box-office collections are very good and from next week the film will run in more single screen halls, says producer Tapan Biswas.        
	Moner Manush has found a fan even in Mamata Banerjee. Prosenjits performance as Lalan Fakir coupled with Goutam Ghoses direction and the cinematography has taken the film to a different level. The film is into the fourth week at the plexes and we are hoping for a six-seven week run, says producer Gautam Kundu.        
	And then there is the two-month old Autograph. With a lone show at Fame South City recording footfalls in excess of 50 per cent, the Prosenjit-starrer with a superhit soundtrack shows no signs of slowing down. The collection till now is about Rs 2 crore, says Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films, that produced the film on a budget of Rs 1.25 crore.        
	Multiplexes have always banked on Bolly for footfalls, but now we have a viable alternative in Tolly. Its a heartening trend, says exhibitor-distributor Arijit Dutta.        
	With Tees Maar Khan nose-diving and no big Bolly release this Friday, plexes are looking at increasing Tolly shows.        
	I have discovered Tollywood and I am hooked, declares Bolly buff Sharmistha Adhikari, who watched Gorosthanay Sabdhaan last weekend and will catch Aarekti Premer Galpo this week.

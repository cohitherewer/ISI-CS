The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crossroad curse: If the potholes dont get you, the procession will   Dunlop deadlock
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Crossroad curse: If the potholes dont get you, the procession will     -  Dunlop deadlock
                                The Dunlop deadlock on Thursday morning caused to a large extent by (above) the poor condition of the road surface (Sanat Kr Sinha)                          
	Dunlop, the gateway of Calcutta from the north, sums up the citys plight this monsoon  potholes, perilous roads, pile-ups, pent-up rage and the unconcerned powers that be.        
	A flyover under construction has made the Dunlop deadlock more dreaded. Metro takes a bumpy ride.        
	Problems        
	A flank of BT Road under Dunlop bridge is closed since mid-July.        
	A flank of PWD Road, connecting the Vivekananda bridge to BT Road at Dunlop, is shut from Sunday.        
	The rest of PWD Road, chock-a-block with trucks  round the clock, flouting all rules  is in a mess with the flyover under construction.        
	Peeves        
	The part of BT Road now closed is a trouble spot for decades because leaking underground water pipes that feed Calcutta proper ruin the road and result in cave-ins.        
	Mere patchwork repairs are done every now and then.        
	How busy is the stretch        
	Around 15,000 vehicles cross the area every hour and 75 per cent of them are heavy trucks.        
	How bad is the situation         
	It takes over 45 minutes to cover 1km during peak periods.        
	Traffic snarls stretch over 3km.        
	Adjoining lanes and bylanes like RN Tagore Road and Gopal Lal Tagore Road remain clogged, at times past midnight.        
	Who is to blame        
	PWD authorities blame the leaking 62-inch diameter CMC water pipes that run under BT Road.        
	For the PWD Road mess, the blame is on CMDA water pipes.        
	Buck stops with        
	The PWD is the custodian of both the stretches, but its officials are deft in passing the buck.        
	PWD says: There are leaks in the CMC pipeline under Dunlop bridge and thats decaying the road. The CMC has repaired a part of the leaked pipes and we are working on that stretch of the road. More leaks are surfacing every day, said an engineer. We had repaired PWD Road early this year. Two pipes run under it. It is the CMDAs job to maintain them but they dont.        
	CMDA says: There is no leak now. The PWD fails to maintain the road and blames us. However, we have started work and, weather permitting, the stretch will be restored within a week, said an engineer.

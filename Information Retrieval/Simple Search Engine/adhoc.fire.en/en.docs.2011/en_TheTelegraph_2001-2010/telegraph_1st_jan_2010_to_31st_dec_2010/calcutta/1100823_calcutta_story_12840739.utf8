          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sharmila Tagore                                  
	Music and film stars, a bouquet of eight plays and an exhibition celebrating 100 years of Tagores play Raja are the top draws of city-based group Purba Paschims second theatre festival, which starts on Tuesday.         
	The curtains go up at Rabindra Sadan with a sarod recital by Ayaan Ali Khan. Mohan Agashe, Rudraprasad Sengupta and others will be felicitated at the programme.        
	Ayaan along with his brother Amaan have composed the music for Purba Paschims latest production Raktakarabi, directed by film-maker Gautam Halder, which will premiere on August 28. Sharmila Tagore and Sunil Gangopadhyay will be the guests of honour at the first show at Madhusudan Mancha.        
	Every year we invite special guests. Last year, we had Shabana Azmi. This year, since our festival is dedicated to Tagore, we thought of Rinkudi, who belongs to the Tagore family, said Soumitra Mitra of Purba Paschim.        
	Potolbabu Filmstar, to be staged on August 25, is the only non-Tagore play in the festival. It will be preceded by a recording of Satyajit Ray interpreting Tagores works. Actor Soumitra Chatterjee will present the audio clip while Srikanta Acharya will sing some Tagore songs that Ray had used in his films.        
	Amol Palekar will be present when Purba Paschim stages Chaturanga, directed by Bratya Basu, on August 26.         
	Apart from Rabindra Sadan and Madhusudan Mancha, Academy of Fine Arts, Minerva, Purbasree and Girish Mancha are the other venues of the nine-day festival.        
	Poet Sankha Ghosh and filmmaker Mrinal Sen will inaugurate the exhibition on Raja at Gaganendra Pradarshasala.

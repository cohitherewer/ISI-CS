The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | When shall we meet again
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      When shall we meet again
										      AUTUMN FLASH                        A family reunion				                           
	With pleasant weather ahead, our thoughts turn to reunions. I think of the church at my old school where its centenary was celebrated with many old girls when I was barely halfway through it 54 years ago. In 2011, I shall have completed 50 years of college friendships.         
	One loses touch and one finds it again. It works like magic: one becomes a bubbly young adult without a moments hesitation. After felt regret at what time has made of your physical appearance and the sorrows etched in all those wrinkles, you move on to a state of contented being and joyous retrieval. You cheerfully bitch as before, giggle uncontrollably.        
	Re-unions of the department where I last worked have been rollicking affairs with nostalgic music, imaginative sports competitions, tattoos, memorabilia, mimicry of teachers and just chat and laughter all over the campus.         
	In my case meeting up with students and colleagues from 40 years of teaching and seeing youthful faces peeping out from the more mature ones before me now is a thrill like no other. A and B have married each other, and brought along a kid or two, while C and D look with a peculiar sort of attachment at each other, caught up again in the enchanted ambience of first love.         
	Less structured mini-reunions happen everywhere: as swallows escape colder climes, friends who live away from Calcutta come visiting and we cook, get in touch with local friends and organise glorious little events to celebrate 40-, 50-, or even 60- year friendships. One recalls the novelty of first meetings, true novelty that never grows old.         
	I have a bunch of friends from my first job and we do a lot of get-togethers whenever an absent one (NRI or even NRC) comes home. Other groups of friends and colleagues live in Calcutta and we meet a little more regularly.        
	The level of comfort with either group has the quality of vintage wine. It is like a pair of shoes, well-worn but still smart, like the golden oldies songs I have already prattled to you about. These meetings are often raucous: we shout at each other and argue and call each other names.         
	Old hostilities about books, politics and sports are as sharp as ever. We yell in disbelief at new touches in the old stories that have accrued since earlier tellings: of the time for instance, when X ran away from home as a teenager, and his adventures between Calcutta and the north-east. Most recently an encounter he had with a bear has been added to that story! But there is also a stillness at the heart of these meetings which comes from security in the knowledge that this bunch is always there for you, just a local call away.         
	As you read this, I shall be away attending the wedding of a much-loved nephew. His parents, aunts and uncles, dozens of cousins, spouses, kids and friends will congregate from different parts of the country and world. The bride and groom will sign the register on a beach near Mumbai. The rest will fly kites, swim, sing with the bridegrooms own amateur band, eat, drink, dance if we wish to, in two days of togetherness. We shall also celebrate a centenary, an 80th birthday, a 40th anniversary and a golden jubilee, all events of 2010. Wheelchairs, walkers and walking sticks will make sure no one is left out.         
	Reunions are layered like old stones. I love them because they signpost the ongoing process of my becoming who and what I am. Do you?

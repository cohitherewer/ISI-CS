The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Moms at school gate to man the traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Moms at school gate to man the traffic
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          DO IT YOURSELF: Mothers of Modern High girls ensure smooth and safe traffic flow. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Rachna Sonthalia spends half-an-hour every week in front of Modern High School for Girls escorting pre-primary children from their cars to the school gate. The rest of the time, this mother of a Class IV student is busy being an intensive-care specialist at a city nursing home.        
	Parents or chauffeurs need not come to the gate. Rather we escort the children, said Rachna, who along with 30-odd volunteer parents from the primary section of Modern High follows a weekly roster at the school gate from 8 to 8.30 every morning to help ease the traffic and ensure safety for the kids.        
	The idea is to decongest the area, said Devi Kar, the principal of Modern High School for Girls.        
	What is witnessed outside the Syed Amir Ali Avenue campus gates is a throwback to the lollipop ladies in the UK. That refers to ladies, carrying large signs resembling lollipops, who help kids cross the road safely near a school.        
	The first one was appointed in Bath in 1937, with London following in the 1940s. They were officially recognised in 1953 and titled School Crossing Patrol Officers. The star among them was Doris Wilson, 80, who safely guided schoolchildren across East Yorkshires roads for four decades.        
	Now, Calcutta is set to get its own share of Doris Wilsons. Parents dropping off children to school listen more to other parents than to us. On many occasions they pay no heed to the traffic constables instructions, admitted a senior officer of the East Traffic Guard, with 20 schools under its jurisdiction.        
	At Modern High, five parents are posted near the gate every morning, over a distance of 100m, in addition to two constables deployed by the traffic department. It is a joint effort. But seeing the parents on duty cops also play a pro-active role and register cases against defaulters, said A. Prasad, a senior teacher of the school.        
	The good news for commuters (and cops) is that Modern High is not an isolated instance. Teachers and students of a growing number of institutions are joining hands with traffic cops to form safety patrol teams and ensure smoother  and safer  traffic movement at the school gates.        
	Traffic management in front of big schools like Modern High, St James, Ashok Hall, Don Bosco Park Circus, and Apeejay School Park Street is a real nightmare. Nearly 500 cars ply within a span of 30 minutes in addition to the usual morning rush-hour traffic, said the East Traffic Guard officer.        
	That is where the parents or the children in uniform have a role to play. We do not let cars to be parked in front of the school. We instruct two- and four-wheelers to park on separate sides of the road, said Aditya Gupta, a Class XI student of St James. Boys at the gate definitely means extra hands for us, said a constable on duty on AJC Bose Road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The longest 17 minutes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The longest 17 minutes
                              Burning bright: Environment activist Joydip Kundu (right) recently received the Carl Zeiss Wildlife Conservation Award for his contribution to tiger conservation                            
	A young woman who had jumped on to the train at the Tollygunge Metro station finally settled down and begun to flip through the latest edition of Sports Illustrated. It had M.S Dhoni on the cover. But her moment with the skipper would soon be interrupted rudely.         
	The intruder boarded the train a couple of stations later. He looked emaciated and sported what looked like a two-day-old stubble. Seconds later, he slipped a huge bag right under the young womans seat. Her fear was compounded when he walked over to the other end of the compartment. He knew that her eyes were following him.                   
	So, there she sat with a bag that seemed abandoned, right under her seat, probably containing something she dared not think about. She freaked out. What to do? Her mind began to race. Should she jump out at the next station? Should she hop over to the opposite row? But would that ensure safety in any way? She didnt want to die so soon.         
	She decided to alert the other commuters. And then one very brave man opened the bag. Her heart skipped a beat. The bag was empty save for an empty plastic packet. The man was not to be found when she got down at Chandni Chowk, after having undertaken a journey spanning the longest 17 minutes of her life.         
	Geetanjali 100        
	As the world is busy ushering in Tagores 150th birth anniversary in 2011, Geetanjali has turned 100. Singer Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta is paying a tribute to the milestone by releasing an album containing the whole of Geetanjali  both its English and Bengali versions.        
	The album includes 157 songs from the Bengali Geetanjali, released in 1910, as well as 103 poems, largely translations, in the English version released in 1912, which won Tagore the Nobel Prize. About 53 poems were common to both versions. She has also recited the poems that were not put to tune.                  Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta      
	Swagatalakshmi seems given to epic tasks. In 2006, she had released Ekla Geetabitan, recording all 2,023 songs over three and half months.        
	It was a coincidence that 2006 was Geetabitans 75th anniversary. This time though I had planned the release to mark the Geetanjali centenary, she says. It helped that the songs were already recorded for the earlier album and had only to be transferred. I just had the poems to recite.

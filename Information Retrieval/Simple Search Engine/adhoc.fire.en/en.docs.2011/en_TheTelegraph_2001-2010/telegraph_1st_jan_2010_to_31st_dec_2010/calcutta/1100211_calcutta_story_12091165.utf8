The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Forest team gheraoed over langur attacks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Forest team gheraoed over langur attacks
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Thirteen-year-old Abubakkar Mandal received 15 stitches after he was attacked by a langur in Garfa. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Residents of Unsani Majherpara and Garfa in Howrah gheraoed the district forest officer, Gautam Chakraborty, and other forest officials on Wednesday demanding a langur that has attacked 15 people over the past three weeks be shot dead immediately.         
	Police said trouble erupted in the area on Tuesday after the langur attacked a 13-year old boy as he stepped out of a mosque. Abubakkar Mandal, a Class VII student, was rushed to a nearby nursing home, where he received 15 stitches on his hands, left foot and back.         
	A forest office team arrived in Garfa with a cage and bait after being informed of the attack on Tuesday but failed to trap the langur, which angered the residents.         
	A forest officer said: Local residents surrounded us and demanded that we shoot the langur immediately. But we cannot kill any wild animal as they are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act.        
	Sensing the anger and panic among the residents, Chakraborty visited the area on Wednesday along with wildlife expert Subrata Pal Chaudhury to trap the langur.         
	But they again failed to spot it. So far we have not been able to spot the langur. Even the villagers failed to locate it. We will tranquillise and trap the langur as soon as we spot it. At this moment I cannot say whether the langur is a rogue, said Chakraborty.         
	Local residents, however, alleged that though they had alerted the forest office repeatedly in the past three weeks about the attacks, they had done precious little to help the people.         
	Abbasuddin Khan, 37, a resident of Unsani Majherpara who was the first victim, said he was attacked while returning home from his tailoring shop. The langur attacked me without any provocation and bit me on my legs. I was bleeding profusely and received 14 stitches, he said. Khan alleged that the menace was continuing as the forest department had failed to act promptly.

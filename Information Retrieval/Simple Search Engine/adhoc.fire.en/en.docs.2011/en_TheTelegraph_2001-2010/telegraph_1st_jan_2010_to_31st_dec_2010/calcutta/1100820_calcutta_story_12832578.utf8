                      Eclectic euphony                    Ethno-electronic band Ashram hosts its maiden live performance tonight. The show presents the home-grown band and a visual jockey working together. A four-member band, Ashram performs and showcases tracks that are inspired by miscellaneous sounds of contemporary central Asia, as well as elements of folk, sufi, musafir, baul, fishermens and even semi-classical music. Their music can, perhaps, be best defined as a heterogeneous blend of quaint, mystic and spiritual music with trails of breakbeat, dub, house and trance; a soundscape that appropriately defines their time. Featuring Ritoban on percussion and drums, Kaniska on keyboards and electronic sound-effects, Sukanti on guitar and Anushree on traditional Indian vocals.                  Event: Live performance by Ashram, an ethno-electronic band When: Today at 9 pm Where: Roxy, The Park

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain amp; sun as Giri casts a cloud
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rain amp; sun as Giri casts a cloud
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Thursday afternoon brought dark clouds and sudden showers to many parts of the city, while others remained dry, sunny and hot even as the weatherman kept an eye on Giri, the storm.         
	The Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore recorded only traces of rainfall till 5.30pm on Thursday though the southern parts of the city and Salt Lake received spells of moderate to heavy rainfall between 11am and 3pm. Central and north Calcutta saw little or no rain through the day.        
	The thundershowers in parts of the city and its neighbourhood were because of localised thunderclouds that have formed as a result of incursion of abundant moisture from the Bay of Bengal into the atmosphere over south Bengal, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).        
	The spells of rain did not, however, help lower the temperatures, which stayed above normal. While the maximum was two degrees above normal at 33.6 degrees Celsius, the minimum was three notches above normal at 26.4 degrees Celsius. The high humidity range of 64 to 98 per cent made Calcuttans sweat most of the day.        
	The IMD said the moisture incursion was under the influence of a cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal, which will continue to have an indirect impact on the weather in south Bengal for another couple of days.        
	The deep depression over east-central Bay of Bengal intensified into a cyclonic storm, Giri, on Thursday. It is likely to intensify further and make landfall within the next 24 hours, a Met official told Metro.        
	As of 2.30pm on Thursday, the storm was 505km south-west of Chittagong in Bangladesh, packing winds up to 88km per hour.        
	Intensifying steadily, Giri will initially move northwards and then north-north-eastwards. The system is likely to make landfall between Teknaf in Bangladesh and Kyaukpyu in Myanmar by Friday evening, said the IMD official.        
	The storm, IMD officials said, would only have an indirect impact on the eastern coast of India.        
	Parts of coastal Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Bengal are expected to be influenced by the system. The impact will be indirect, but it could be enough to bring a substantial amount of rain to parts of the region over the next 48 hours, said a Met official.        
	If Giri does not dissipate soon after landfall, or if it alters course, could south Bengal face a stronger impact?        
	If the dissipation does not start within a few hours after landfall, the weather in the region could be affected for some more time. If the storm alters course to steer towards the Bengal coast, the impact would be severe. But the chances of that appear slim, as of Thursday evening, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.

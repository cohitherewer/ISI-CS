	Students of St James School organised a festival night for underprivileged children of their evening school  Ekta  on campus last month. The guest list was 250-odd.        
	The event was organised by the Class XI students of the schools Interact Club. We wanted the kids of Ekta to have a good time. So we planned a magic show especially for them, said Class XI student Siddhartha Kochar. We spent about a week planning the evening, he added.         
	The event has become a fixture in the schools social calendar for the last eight years. It is good for the chaps to do something fruitful for society, said T.H. Ireland, the principal.         
	The magic show was conducted by ex-student David Nobo. The evening included a live band by Tony Khosla and a dance show by a funky group called Full Stop. Some spectacular fireworks rounded off the events.         
	David kept the group mesmerised with his vanishing tricks. When balloons turned into pigeons, they clapped in delight. But what took their breath away was when he tied himself in a gunny sack and set it ablaze, only to emerge unscathed.         
	Chief guest of the evening actress Churni Ganguly spoke of her childhood in Darjeeling. Events like these teach children to grow with the rest.        
	Class VI student Suman Singh was all smiles. I loved the magic show and also enjoyed dancing with my friends, she beamed.                    JM

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shop stop goes north
          A STAFF REPORTER                          City Centre in New Town. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Bolstered by the success of the two City Centre malls in the city, Ambuja Realty is now heading north  to Siliguri. The company will throw open a City Centre mall in the heart of the north Bengal town in December.         
	Siliguri has tremendous potential as a retail hub that has remained virtually untapped. Not only is Siliguri a major trading zone, it is also a gateway to the hills of Darjeeling, Sikkim and the Northeast, said Harsh Neotia, the chairman of Ambuja Realty.         
	Located in Uttarayon at the citys Darjeeling More, City Centre Siliguri, at 8 lakh sq ft, will be bigger than the properties at Salt Lake and New Town, which are 3 lakh sq ft and 3.52 lakh sq ft, respectively.         
	Spread over 10.5 acres, City Centre Siliguri will comprise the mall, office space and a five-star hotel. While a large part of the mall will be opened in December, it will take another 12 months for the rest of the mall, the hotel and the office space to be fully functional, said Neotia.         
	The newest City Centre will be architecturally similar to the Salt Lake and New Town ones. That means both AC and non-AC spaces, seamless connectivity and a hangout zone called Celebration Square inspired by the popular kund area.        
	The structure may vary, but the philosophy of being a family destination providing wholesome entertainment remains the same, said Neotia.        
	With an investment of Rs 200 crore, Ambuja Realty is eyeing an annual turnover of more than Rs 300 crore from City Centre Siliguri.        
	The mall is likely to bring a number of international and national brands to the parched Siliguri shopper. With Shoppers Stop to Subway, KFC to Big Cinemas set to open doors at City Centre Siliguri, it is positioning itself as the one-stop retail and entertainment destination for the Siliguri resident.        
	We want both residents as well as tourists on their way to the hills to spend a few hours at City Centre Siliguri, eating, shopping and watching films, said Neotia. Next up from Ambuja Realty: City Centre malls at Haldia, Raipur and Patna.

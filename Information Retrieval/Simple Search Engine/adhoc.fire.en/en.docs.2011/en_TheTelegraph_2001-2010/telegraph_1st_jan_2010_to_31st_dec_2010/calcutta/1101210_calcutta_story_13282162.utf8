The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dream big against odds
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Dream big against odds
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                    Governor M. K. Narayanan hands over the Udayan Shalini Fellowship to a student               
	It was a moment of pride for Class XI student Priyanka Singh as she walked up to the stage to receive her scholarship from governor M.K. Narayanan.         
	The money will help me buy books. Otherwise, it would have been difficult for me to pursue higher studies, especially science, said the student of Muralidhar Girls School.         
	Priyankas family earns not more than Rs 3,000 a month. She shares a one-room home with five family members.        
	Despite the odds, she managed to score 588 (on 700) in Madhyamik.         
	A hundred students like Priyanka assembled at Kala Mandir on November 28 to receive the Udayan Shalini Fellowship.        
	The scholarship renders financial support to needy but meritorious girls. They are screened on the basis of their need, ambition and talent, explained Parimal Chandra Das, the joint convener of Udayan Cares West Bengal chapter.        
	The NGO sends applications to government schools and colleges across the state. Only those who score 60 per cent and above in their board exams and whose family income is not more than Rs 6,000 a month are eligible.        
	The candidates then have to clear a written exam. Their parents are also interviewed.        
	The governor lauded the effort to encourage education among girl children. Statistics indicate that only one in every 100 girls makes it to college. Only 16 per cent of women in India study up to Class X, while only 4.5 per cent are graduates, he added.        
	But there are some who refuse to give up hope. I scored 90.6 per cent in my Higher Secondary exam. I always believed that if I did well, my studies would not be affected. The scholarship just proved me right, beamed 18-year-old Sreetama Das, now doing her graduation in physics from Jadavpur University. We will also be given vocational and spoken English training. That will help me get better jobs, she added.        
	Kusum Bhandari, the convener of Udayan Cares West Bengal chapter, summed it up: When you educate a woman, you educate a family and eventually, the whole nation. It is amazing how much these girls have achieved in a short span of time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sniffer probe   for murder
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sniffer probe   for murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Police on Thursday took a sniffer dog to the Oxytown house where homemaker Mausumi Ghosh and her maid Parul were found murdered on Monday evening.        
	The dog was in P19A Oxytown for over 30 minutes, sniffing around cupboards, clothes and beds.        
	No one has been arrested in the three days since the twin murders. Key suspect Avik Ghosh, Mausumis husband, spent Thursday in a friends house after being grilled by the police for nearly two days.        
	The only breakthrough in the probe is Aviks motorcycle, which has been recovered in Haridevpur, said an officer of Thakurpukur police station.        
	The South 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police, S.K. Chowdhury, said sleuths were working on vital clues.        
	Avik will not dare come to the locality. The people here are so angry that they might attack him, said Anjan Basu, a neighbour of the Ghosh family.

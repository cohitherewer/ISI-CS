The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | AC Metro sets monsoon date
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      AC Metro sets monsoon date

	The slo-mo race for the air-conditioned rakes of the citys swiftest mode of transport has finally entered its last lap.        
	 Metro Railway will get its first cool rakes by the end of June, a full nine months after the promised date of Puja 2009. And the Calcutta commuter can expect the first comfort ride around end-July or early-August as the city hurtles towards Poll 2011.        
	The first rake will be delivered by the Perambur-based Integral Coach Factory (ICF). Officials there have assured us that it will be delivered by end-June, a senior official of the railway told Metro on Tuesday.        
	A series of trial runs will be conducted and the chief safety commissioners clearance will be taken before the rake is pressed into service, the official added, eyeing a monsoon debut.        
	The other 12 rakes are set to be delivered in phases by the end of this year. Each costs Rs 37 crore to build.        
	Senior Metro Railway officials had recently visited the Perambur factory. The fitting of doors and the colouring of the rake along with some minor work remains, which we expect to complete by end-June, said an ICF official.        
	The first two AC rakes of a proposed 13-strong fleet were originally scheduled to arrive in October 2009. The revised deadline of March 31, 2010, was also missed.        
	One of the causes for the repeated deadline misses was a modification in design. There was initial confusion on whether the rakes would be air-conditioned or not. The original design had to be modified once it was finalised that the rakes would indeed have air-conditioning. A standard coach cannot be fitted with a cooling system as that leaves little headroom for passengers while standing. Then, some components of the air-conditioning system procured from Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd also took time to come.        
	All those problems have been sorted out and the AC machines have been fitted to allow passengers a comfortable ride, said an ICF official.        
	Just what Samadrita Sengupta has been waiting to hear for weeks.         
	Metro rides these days are extremely uncomfortable. My friends and I have been really waiting for the AC coaches, said the second-year student of Presidency College, who takes the Metro from Kalighat and dreads the 20-minute swelter.        
	Following the 5.88km extension from Tollygunge to Garia Bazar, the utilisation of rakes has increased by more than 40 per cent with nearly 80,000 additional passengers. The new rakes are required urgently to maintain operations without compromising on maintenance, said a Metro official.        
	Metro Railway now operates 18 rakes, 11 of which are old and need to be phased out. The remaining seven would be overhauled at the midlife rehabilitation factory being set up in Noapara.        
	Air-conditioning apart, the new coaches will make less noise and be dust-free, said an official.         
	They will also have an improved jerk-absorption mechanism and an advanced passenger information system.

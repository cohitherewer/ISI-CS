										      JHINUK MAZUMDAR                            Children take part in an interactive session after a film screening at the Cancer Centre Welfare Home and Research Institute in Thakurpukur				               
	A pleasant surprise was in store for Niladri Sarkar on November 27. The nine-year-old was given a break from chemotherapy and the usual rounds of check-up and shown a film.         
	Niladri is being treated for brain tumour at the Cancer Centre Welfare Home and Research Institute in Thakurpukur since August. The hospital had organised the screening of Anokha Moti (The Magic Pearl), directed by Tapan Sinha, for the 100-odd children of its paediatric cancer care unit.         
	The film revolves round a pink pearl that a fisherman finds in the middle of the sea. He gifts it to his eight-year-old daughter. Soon, goons start eyeing the precious pearl and kidnap the little girl to snatch it from her.         
	Eventually, the culprits are punished but the much-shaken fisherman coaxes his daughter to throw the pearl back into the sea. Finally, the sea returns it to her and the girl gets to keep the pearl.         
	We tried to pep up the mood of our young patients by showing them a film. The film was both educative and entertaining for them, said Arnab Gupta, the director of the institute.         
	The idea of screening the film was proposed by actor Arjun Chakraborty, who had visited the Thakurpukur hospital on Childrens Day.         
	I wanted to inspire these children in small ways. Anokha Moti was our gift to them, said the actor, who also stars in the film.         
	The moral of the story was not lost on the children, either. One should not be greedy, else it leads to ones fall, said Niladri after watching the film.        
	The screening was organised by Gaurang Films, who have also shown it in schools like La Martiniere for Girls and St Stephens, Bowbazar.    
	chitchat  Road rules and safety guide  nStudents of Delhi Public School, New Town, observed road safety week in the first week of December. The event culminated in a special assembly on December 9. The aim was to create awareness about traffic rules.  Retired cop Swapan Chakraborty was the guest at the assembly. He regaled his young audience with jokes and anecdotes while emphasising the need for being cautious on the road. The children were told the difference between a kerb, carriageway and footway and also the right way of crossing the road and the need for speed limits.   An interactive quiz on road safety followed the discussion.  Past, present amp; sport  Calcutta Boys rsquo; School (CBS) held their annual sports meet on December 10. Utpal Chatterjee, the   sheriff of Calcutta, was the guest of honour. The event started with a march past, followed by a colourful drill display. The floats were the main   attraction of the day. They showcased diverse themes from Mother Teresa, Rabindranath Tagore to the Fifa World Cup 2010.   Another fun event was a relay between the past and present students. Warne House was adjudged ldquo;Best House rdquo;.

	THE   DIARY   
	Mother rsquo;s love   How would you feel if you never had a mother?. 
  If there were none   to take care of you?
  I knew a girl who had such a fate
  Alone she was on earth, without a mate.   An orphan she was, as if a stray,
  Despite that, she strived to be gay.
  Ignored by all and loved by none,
  The poor girl knew no fun.  One day, a lonely woman saw the girl on the street,
  Taking pity, she took the child in,
  Both had sorrows to share,
  They needed someone to love and care.   The girl decided to stay on with her new friend,
  Each considered the other Godsent,
  The two created their own world of peace,
  Full of laughter and bliss.

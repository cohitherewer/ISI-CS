	Apropos the report Deserted by husband amp; burdened by kids, she becomes lifeline for abandoned boy (May 1), I dont know whether God exists in heaven or not; but to me, Sunita Biswas (picture left) is none other than God. In an age when the so-called enlightened and educated folk do not hesitate to dump their parents in old-age homes or move to foreign shores by leaving them to their fate, the unlettered, husband-forsaken poor food vendor fought (and is still fighting) against all odds possible to nurture and educate six-year old Akash, right from the age of six months when he was abandoned by his mother. The hapless baby who could have died due to lack of care or could have turned to petty crime due to the societys apathy, has received motherly refuge in Sunita, who is also educating him to grow up to be a responsible citizen.           
	Sunita has proved that if ones heart is in the right place, then neither poverty nor disapproval from family members can prevent a person from lending a helping hand to others.           
	I pay my humble tribute to Sunita Biswas, the living deity residing in the real temple  the foodstall of Salt Lake.

  Peerless Nagar, Sodepur                                       Crossing swords: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee addresses party councillors contesting the upcoming civic polls at the Hazra crossing on Friday. (Above) Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee addresses a press conference at Alimuddin Street on Sunday.

	Apropos the question How would you rate the two on a scale of 10? dated May 17, I would give -10 to both Mamata Banerjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Neither does anything except malign the other, each tomtoming the others incompetence in governance. Had they been true politicians they would have stressed on work, not words.             
	Both leaders only increase noise pollution in the city through blaring of mikes and traffic-choking rallies. Mamata sees herself as the next chief minister of West Bengal and constantly promises action after coming to power. But why cant she act now  providing smooth passage on roads and clean environment? She has kept bandhs on hold till the Assembly elections. Does that mean if she comes to power, she will resort to shutdowns again?           
	Our chief minister cannot even speak without making gaffes, forget about taking action! The politicians are ruining the citys walls with graffiti and polluting the environment with their flags, posters and hoardings and taking out one procession after another to woo the voter. Sadly, they dont realise that the best way to win votes is through action.           
	With Mamata and Buddha busy playing the slimy game of politics and fighting over capturing power, even a -10 rating seems high!           
	Amrita Mallik,

	lI would give Mamata Banerjee 8.5 out of 10 and Buddhadeb 4.5.           
	Nidhi Tripathi, 
  Address not given                     
	I wish the article contained some more details about the two leaders to help us rate them better. Anyhow, I am sorry for the people of Calcutta that they have been saddled with such leaders. No wonder Calcutta is no longer an international city. All South Indian cities have better international connection than Calcutta.

	lMamata Banerjee is trying to draw the public in her favour by making various promises ahead of the municipal election. However, the last experience with a Trinamul Congress-led municipality with Subrata Mukherjee as mayor was not good. Also, the Trinamul are not even part of any alliance this time. There is no difference between the Trinamul and the Left when it comes to running the CMC.           
	S.S. Almal, 
  Lower Rawdon Street           
	As Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee go on feeding the electorate with promises regardless of their feasibility of implementation, sensible citizens would exercise their discretion trying to sift the chaff from the grain.           
	Both have formally announced their manifesto  each in his/her own style. Based on that, my rating on a scale of 10 would be 7 in the CMs favour.           
	Mamata has reasons to be buoyed about her serial electoral successes since 2008. But her increasing arrogance and fulmination against her sworn enemy, the CPM, have set at naught all her advantages. None but she herself is to be blamed for this. She doesnt spare the Congress either, though the party initiated her into politics. Can she carry on with her ekla chalo policy? But the Congressmen feel slighted by her.           
	Her use of abusive language coupled with her mismanagement of whatever she has laid her hands on after assuming charge of the railway ministry has exposed her.           
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, on the other hand, has called upon the people to fight against Mamatas negative politics by voting the Left Front back to power to nip destabilising efforts in the bud. At the same time he hasnt stopped short of admitting to manifest shortcomings in the Left Fronts performance which he says he would try to solve with the co-operation from all political parties on a consensual basis. Whats Mamatas stance? She wouldnt like to see Buddhas face in any political enclave.           
	Considering the above, as far as rating is concerned, I wont like to credit her with more than 3 out of 10.           
	P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake                   
	Apropos the report Asok rebuff on water waiver, May 15, I contradict urban development minister Asok Bhattacharyas remark that the Trinamul Congresss promise of waiving the water charge is a ploy to hoodwink people. It is an agreed Trinamul policy and Mamata has always opposed the imposition of water tax. In fact, she thwarted the attempt of Subrata Mukherjee, the then mayor of Calcutta, to enforce the tax. She also instructed the municipalities run by Trinamul not to levy water charges. But unfortunately the Siliguri civic body was under the Left bastion and consequently Bhattacharya has to pay Rs 45 per month for drinking water.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Robber with toy pistol
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A homemaker who pounced on a robber holding a pistol against her four-year-old daughters head in their Lake Town flat on Thursday afternoon discovered to her surprise that the gun was made of plastic.        
	Rajni Kochar, 35, immediately raised an alarm, alerting neighbours, who caught 22-year-old Aditya Burman as he was trying to run away from the flat.         
	The youth had grabbed four-year-old Krittika after walking into the flat through its open door around 2pm, pointed the toy pistol at the childs head and demanded the keys to the almirahs and whatever cash was in the house, said Rajni.         
	Her 74-year-old mother-in-law was the only other person in the flat then. Rajnis husband Amit was in his Kalakar Street office.        
	They were questioning Burman for more information, said an officer of Lake Town police station.

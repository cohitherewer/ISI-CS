                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Contempt plea hearing deferred
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday adjourned the hearing on a contempt petition against La Martiniere for Boys, filed by the father of a Class IV student who had been denied promotion despite a court order.        
	The division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice M.K. Chowdhury, however, observed that the school should have taken up the matter as a humanitarian issue.        
	Srijan Banerjees father Partha has alleged that his son was not being promoted because he had refused to gift a laptop to the class teacher.        
	Opposing Parthas contempt plea, the schools lawyer submitted that his client had moved the apex court against the high court order to promote Srijan.        
	The authorities have no intention to disobey the high court order. They have moved the apex court and are awaiting its order, said La Martiniere lawyer Ranjan Deb.        
	Banerjees lawyer Soumya Majumdar argued that since there was no stay on the high court order, the management should have allowed Srijan to join Class V.        
	The bench adjourned the hearing till December 7 but said the school should have taken up the matter as a humanitarian issue.

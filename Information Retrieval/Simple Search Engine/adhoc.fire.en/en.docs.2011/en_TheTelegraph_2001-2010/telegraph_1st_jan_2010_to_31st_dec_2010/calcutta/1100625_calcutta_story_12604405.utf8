The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU in a fix over college to-do list   Colleges hit UGC rules hurdle
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU in a fix over college to-do list     - Appeal against UGC order          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	A set of University Grants Commission guidelines on college education has plunged several city colleges into uncertainty, prompting Calcutta University to appeal for a review of the directives.        
	The guidelines issued earlier this year set a new infrastructure standard, stating that a city college must have a 2-acre campus, lecture theatres must have 15sq ft of space for each student and libraries must have at least 100 books of different titles in each subject. The institutions are also required to open a Rs 15-lakh fixed deposit account for each undergraduate course.        
	The UGC has specified that if a college fails to meet any of the conditions, the affiliating university will be penalised.        
	There is hardly any college in Calcutta that can fulfil all the conditions laid down by the UGC. Even new colleges cannot fulfil all the criteria. Is it possible to acquire a 2-acre plot in the city to open a college? wondered Anjan Sengupta, the general secretary of the All Bengal Principals Council and a member of the CU syndicate.        
	We will write to the UGC requesting it to reconsider its decision as it will be difficult for any institution to follow the revised regulations, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	Some members of the universitys syndicate, where the CPM has a majority, suspect the new conditions are aimed at facilitating the entry of big corporate houses in college education as the infrastructure requirement is beyond the means of most institutions.        
	Even without going into the debate on privatisation of higher education, we can say the existing colleges will be unable to fulfil most of the criteria, said a syndicate member.                    
	The member said space crunch was a major problem for most city colleges, with a dozen-odd campuses being forced to function in three shifts.        
	For instance, the Ashutosh College campus houses Jogmaya Devi College in the morning and Shyamaprasad College in the evening.        
	The guideline has also asked colleges to create rooms for individual faculty members, medical units, separate common rooms for boys and girls and multi-purpose complexes with auditoriums, gymnasium and sporting facilities.        
	The intention behind issuing the guidelines is no doubt noble but can we afford such facilities? asked a senior CU official who did not wish to be named. We should walk a middle path so that students get what they deserve.        
	The UGC, however, is firm in its stand on enforcing the regulations, which have been drawn up following recommendations of a high-powered panel. The regulations are meant for institutions across India. The new rules are aimed at preventing mushrooming of inferior colleges, said Ratnabali Banerjee, the UGC joint secretary (east).        
	Burdwan university registrar Sarashi Mohan Dan was a member of the committee. I had pointed out the problems our colleges may face but the regulations were framed on the basis of observations of all members, said Dan.

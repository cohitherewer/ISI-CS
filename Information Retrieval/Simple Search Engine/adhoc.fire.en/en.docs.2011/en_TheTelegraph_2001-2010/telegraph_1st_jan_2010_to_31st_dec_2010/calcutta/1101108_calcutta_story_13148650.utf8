The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A few years that left an everlasting imprint
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A few years that left an everlasting imprint
                            
	Siddhartha Shankar Ray had joined St Xaviers as a seven-year-old in the First Standard in 1926. He was a Xaverian till the Sixth Standard, when he was taken out and admitted to Mitra Institution. He spoke about his school days to The Telegraph in January 2009, on the eve of the 150-year celebrations of St Xaviers.              
	St Xaviers was known as an Anglo-Indian school in those days. Most students were Anglo-Indians and Bengali or Sanskrit was not taught at all, though Latin was compulsory. Jyoti Basu, who was about six years my senior in school, could not write the Bengali script. When I reminded him of this at the Raj Bhavan some years ago, Jyoti just smiled.        
	In school, maintaining discipline was of foremost importance. School started, most probably, at 9am and the teacher would not let the latecomers enter the classroom without a note from the prefect, who would strap us when we went to his office to get the note. So many of us preferred to wear two or three shorts when we went to meet him on such occasions!        
	I joined the school as a seven-year-old in the First Standard in 1926 but was withdrawn, along with my brothers, at the height of the nationalist movement, when I was in the Sixth Standard.        
	I would like to testify that, contrary to the belief of a few, the St Xaviers authorities never harboured anti-nationalist feelings. They were beyond all that.        
	One incident that comes to mind was that I had dared to skip school the day Jatin Dass mortal remains were brought to Calcutta. Its difficult for this generation to fathom how passionate we would become on such occasions. I had preferred to watch the funeral procession of the martyr from the first-floor balcony of our house rather than attend classes that day.         
	The next day I had to go to Fr Prefect to explain why I had been absent without reason. I went wearing three half-pants because I was sure I would be strapped. When Fr Sebastian asked me why I had been absent, I said, because Jatin Dass body had arrived.        
	He didnt scold me or strap me. He only said: I see that, my boy, I see that. He seemed to share my angst as if he were my closest relative.         
	Even in those days St Xaviers took sporting activities very seriously. I owe it to St Xaviers that I went on to play cricket and football quite well and led Presidency College in football and cricket. I also played tennis.        
	Even at this age, I remember all my teachers vividly. In the Third Standard Mr Carr, in the Fourth Standard it was Mr Couch and in the Fifth and Sixth standards Fr Pinto. Fr Vermere was the rector and Fr Stephens the prefect.        
	I only attended the primary school but I was lucky that all the classes were held on the 30 Park Street campus. I was mesmerised by the building every day and used to gape at the majestic columns near the hall after my father dropped me to school on the way to office.        
	There was an undeniable culture shock involved when I had to join Mitra Institution.                
	As told to Rith Basu

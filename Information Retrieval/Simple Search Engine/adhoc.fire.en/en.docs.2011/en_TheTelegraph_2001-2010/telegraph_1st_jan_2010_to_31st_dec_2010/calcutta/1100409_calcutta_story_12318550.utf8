          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday directed the Howrah sessions court not to proceed with the trial of the Sushil Pal murder case before May 12 this year.         
	The body of Pal, a city doctor who was attached with Sreerampore Walsh Hospital in Hooghly, was found in a canal in Sankrail, Howrah, on July 13, 2004. Preliminary investigation by police had revealed that a racket engaged in smuggling drugs from government hospitals was behind the murder.        
	Justice Kalidas Mukherjee of the high court passed Thursdays order on an appeal by Sushils widow Kanika, who alleged that the trial court was not allowing police to submit documents that would help substantiate the charges against the accused.        
	According to Kanikas lawyer, Kinkini Banerjee, a receptionist at Bally Sebayatan clinic, with which Pal was associated, had twice said on television in 2008 that she knew the people involved in the murder. She, however, denied any knowledge of the matter before the trial court judge.         
	The lawyer claimed the investigators had sought the trial judges permission to produce CDs containing Banerjees comments on television but the judge refused to accept it.        
	Kanika had sought the trial judges permission to ask the police to hand over the CDs to her so that she could produce them in the high court, but was turned down, said the lawyer.

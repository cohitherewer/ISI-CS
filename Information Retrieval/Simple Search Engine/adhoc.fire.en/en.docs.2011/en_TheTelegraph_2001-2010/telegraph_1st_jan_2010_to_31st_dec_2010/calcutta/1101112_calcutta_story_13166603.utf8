The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City centre choked again
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City centre choked again

	Two city centre meetings that were attended only by a handful unleashed day-long traffic horror on Thursday, providing a curtain-raiser to the Left Fronts planned week-long siege of the Metro Channel.         
	The first meeting in Metro Channel was by para-teachers from noon to 3pm. Before the traffic could normalise in the central business district, the second one, by a clutch of small Left-backed organisations, started 100 metres away on Rani Rashmoni Avenue. The programme continued from 5.30pm to 7pm, a period when the volume of vehicles in the area peaks.        
	I am almost resigned to the fact that someone or the other will stall traffic in Metro Channel or Rani Rashmoni Avenue or both, said septuagenarian Gobinda Agarwala, who had to spend an hour in a taxi that was stuck on Jawaharlal Nehru Road from around 2pm.        
	Todays politicians are good only at muscle-flexing; they dont care about the common man. They dont think twice before harassing and inconveniencing us, added the Alipore resident in his 70s.        
	Mainak Sarkar, who was driving his hatchback, suffered the same fate.        
	They should shift the circus somewhere else. How can Metro Channel be an option for a rally venue? wondered the 36-year-old.        
	These gatherings serve no purpose. Every time I pass the stretch, I glance to see who is holding the meeting and curse them.        
	If he had managed a glimpse of the protest site through the sea of vehicles, he would have been shocked that only about 500 people had reduced the width of the north-bound flank by half.         
	Two-and-a-half hours after the para-teachers had dispersed, almost an equal number of agitators, belonging to several organisations, marched to Rani Rashmoni Avenue and started a meeting.        
	That disruption mattered more than what they were demanding  better security for Metro Railway passengers  was evident from the way they approached the venue.        
	Thirty people, under the banner of an insurance employees union, spread out across the south-bound Central Avenue flank forcing hundreds of cars and buses to crawl behind them as they walked to RR Avenue to discuss the rights of commuters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Conjunctivitis casts eye
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Conjunctivitis casts eye
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Conjunctivitis is painting the city pink in the worst outbreak of the viral eye infection in several years.        
	Doctors have blamed the late monsoon for the high incidence of conjunctivitis or pink eye at this time of the year, saying that the moisture-laden air is the perfect breeding ground for the virus.        
	The incidence of conjunctivitis is more than it has been in the last four to five years. Also, it has surfaced simultaneously across the country, which is spreading the disease faster, ophthalmologist Abhijit Sen told Metro.        
	Of every 100 patients visiting ophthalmologist Sens clinic on Prince Anwar Shah Road, around 15 suffer from conjunctivitis. Thats a lot more than in previous years, he said.        
	So how does one ward off the pink eye?         
	According to doctors, avoid rubbing your eyes often, steer clear of anyone with bloodshot eyes and hope for the best.        
	Amitava Biswas of Sunetra Family Eye Care Centre in Ajoynagar said the trigger for the disease this year was the common adeno virus, which causes an allergic reaction in the eyes that leads to inflammation of the lids and bleeding of the blood vessels. The virus produces a secretion called interferon that eventually self-destructs.         
	 The infection is severe in most cases this year. The only consolation is the low incidence of corneal involvement or kerato conjunctivitis, which causes corneal ulcers and can even lead to blindness if not treated properly, said Sen.        
	Doctors prescribe an antibiotic drop or ointment along with a lubricant to ease the discomfort till the virus dies. If the infection is severe, the cornea could be affected.

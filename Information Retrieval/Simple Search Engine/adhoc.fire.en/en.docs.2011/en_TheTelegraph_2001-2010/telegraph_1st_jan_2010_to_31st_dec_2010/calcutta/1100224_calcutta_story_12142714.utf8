	The first day of Madhyamik 2010 went off without any complaints from examinees.         
	Students were happy with the question paper. There were also no reports of any untoward incident anywhere in the state, said Mamata Ray, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. The exams were held peacefully in trouble-hit West Midnapore as well as the Hills, Ray added.        
	Tuesdays examination was on paper I of the first language. Five teams of senior board officials visited various schools in the city and its suburbs to inspect the exam centres. Similar teams were sent to exam venues in the districts by the boards regional offices.         
	Taki Girls School in Rajabazar was thrown into a tizzy for a while after the authorities received a call from a woman who threatened the school with dire consequences if all the examinees were not allowed to cheat during the test.         
	The authorities informed Narkeldanga police, who later traced the call to a public booth near Rajabazar. The caller could not be identified.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Coal still culprit in power cuts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Coal still culprit in power cuts
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Power cuts plagued the city and its fringes for the sixth day on the trot as the shortage in high-quality coal crippled generation by the state utility and restricted CESCs imports.        
	Power department officials warned that the situation could only improve by the weekend.        
	The supply of high-quality coal has been a major letdown for nearly a week. Generation by the state utility has been badly hit, said a power department official.        
	The shortfall during peak demand in the CESC-served areas was around 90MW, resulting in rotational power cuts totalling between 60 and 90 minutes.        
	CESC sent out 1,087MW against the peak-hour demand of 1,419MW. The deficit was mainly because the import from the state utility was restricted to 242MW, said a CESC spokesperson.        
	To make matters worse, the power supply from the Kidderpore and Jadavpur distribution stations is likely to be affected on Thursday because of urgent maintenance work, causing widespread power cuts.        
	The power cuts in the summer swelter have come as a double blow to the 50,000-plus ICSE, ISC and CBSE examinees in city schools.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court slams senior cop
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday slammed the deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division) for keeping a man in jail for 43 days without investigating the complaints lodged against him.        
	What were your subordinate officers doing? They are spending time idly How much time do they need to investigate a petty case? Justice Asim Roy asked deputy commissioner Pallab Kanti Ghosh.         
	In Calcutta, your force does not have the time to start an inquiry even a month and a half after an accused is arrested. And in the districts, terrorist activity is increasing by the day because of the callousness of the force, observed the judge.         
	He had summoned the officer while hearing a bail plea by Partha Sarathi Ghosh, a worker in a foundry at Maniktala, on July 1.        
	Anil Basak, the owner of the foundry, had lodged a complaint with Maniktala police station accusing Partha Sarathi of duping him of Rs 7 lakh by falsely promising to secure a Rs 80 crore loan for him.         
	Partha Sarathi was arrested on May 18.         
	On July 1, he had moved the bail plea, which was granted by Justice Roy, who asked the deputy commissioner to appear before him after two weeks.        
	On Wednesday, the judge asked the officer to make arrangements so that investigations into the petty case could be completed as soon as possible.

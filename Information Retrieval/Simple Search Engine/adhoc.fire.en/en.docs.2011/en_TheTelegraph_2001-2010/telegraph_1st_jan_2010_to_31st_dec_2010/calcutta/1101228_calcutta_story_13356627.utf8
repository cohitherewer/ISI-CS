 - Mother sorry,   accused defiant          OUR BUREAU                                                    Trinamul councillor Rebecca Sultanas son Asif Hasan covers his face while being produced in court on Monday along with co-accused (left) Bijoy Sarkar and (right) Shubhajit Mukherjee.

	A Salt Lake councillors son and two friends allegedly molested a young homemaker walking home from City Centre with her husband on Sunday night and then followed them to the police station to stop her from lodging a complaint.        
	Police did arrest Asif Hasan, the son of councillor Rebecca Sultana, and his friends Bijoy Sarkar and Shubhajit Mukherjee  all in their mid-20s  but the trio were on out on bail by Monday afternoon.        
	Trinamul councillor Rebecca, elected from ward V of Bidhannagar Municipality, had apparently apologised to the 26-year-old victim after someone informed her about the incident but Asif was allegedly unrepentant.        
	That is when we decided to go to the police station. The councillor tried to convince us not to do so by saying that her son sometimes drinks more than he can hold, the victim told Metro.        
	The trio have been charged under sections 294 (using obscene acts and songs), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 34 (a criminal act by several persons with a common intention) of the IPC.         
	The police usually slap the charge of outraging the modesty of a woman (Section 354) in tease-and-molest cases. Anyone convicted under Section 354 can be jailed for up to two years. Under the sections invoked in the case against Asif and his friends, they can at the most be jailed for three months, if found guilty.        
	Dhrubajyoti Dey, the acting superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas, insisted that the charges were framed on the basis of the strength of the complaint.         
	Sunday nights incident had occurred around 9.45pm near the Baisakhi crossing, adjoining Kestopur.        
	According to the victim, she and her husband had barely got off an autorickshaw at Baisakhi when she heard a car honk right in front of where she was standing.        
	I jumped onto the pavement to get out of the cars way, only to be shouted at by the occupants of the vehicle. I ignored them and took two steps backwards but they continued verbally abusing me. Suddenly, the passenger next to the man at the wheel lunged at me. I screamed, the woman recounted.         
	On hearing her cry for help, the trio in the white car apparently panicked and sped away. We also thought they were gone and tried to ignore it as a stray incident. I was comforting my wife even as we started walking home when we spotted the white car parked just across a bylane. One of the men was craning his neck to see where we were going. I instantly knew we would be in trouble if I didnt find a safe place quickly, said the victims husband, who owns an interior design firm.        
	The couple decided to enter a nearby drug store and seek help. By then, word had reached councillor Rebecca, who was in the nearby ward office. She arrived to apologise to the victim. But Asif, who was also called to the drug store, refused to say sorry. He instead glared at me in front of his mother as if I was the offender, the victim alleged.        
	Determined to lodge a complaint, the couple took a rickshaw to Bidhannagar North police station, only to be followed by the white car with Asif at the wheel. He stepped out of the car and stopped us. He threatened us but I ignored him and somehow managed to enter the police station, said the victims husband.         
	Asif and his friends were later arrested near Baisakhi.        
	Asifs councillor mother declined comment but Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee appeared at the Bidhannagar Municipality on Monday evening to say that Asif was in no way connected to the party. His mother is a councillor but he isnt a Trinamul member. We denounce the incident and the law will take its own course, he told reporters.

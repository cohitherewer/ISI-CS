                      Exploring the intrinsic        One can safely say that the real lineage of the Madras Art School was not just the formal element of line but its emphasis on the unity of process and product wherein the line was developed both as a tool of expression as well as the subject itself. In Search Within, the ongoing exhibition, one finds that the old lsquo;Madras Metaphor rsquo; has been transformed into other metaphors in the vision of five artists associated with Chennai, each of whom expresses a unique concern. For Dimpy Menon, the modelling and casting of bronze sculptures by herself not only defines her own identity, but also in a circular way creates an identity for a body of works, just as the making and casting of each sculpture inspires her to the next piece. Benitha Perciyal rsquo;s works are manifestations of alternative processes of viewing, where the monumental is seen encapsulated within the miniscule. M. Siva rsquo;s works are inspired by mythology. In the current series of works, however, he uses dreams and momentary thoughts of fantasy to create twilight works that are at the process of emergence and dissolution. The works of N. Prasanna Kumar (a creation by him appears here) look at the interplay between vision and blindness in an attempt to understand and distinguish the various levels of visual perception. By making viewers aware of their own lsquo;blindness rsquo;, his works talk about vision as a product of faith. Parvathi Nayar rsquo;s works also deal with the idea of vision, but she redefines them through the medium and process of drawing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Assault driver   gets bail
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Assault driver gets bail
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Rogue driver Samad Khan, who was arrested on Thursday for allegedly assaulting 23-year-old MBA student Sayantee Majumdar, was released on bail on Friday.        
	The news shocked Sayantee who feels Khan should have been in custody for at least a few days to realise the gravity of the crime he had committed.        
	He got bail within 24 hours of being arrested. This shows how unsafe we are on the road. A few days custody could have acted as a deterrent, the Salt Lake resident said.        
	Sayantee, who was taking a lift in Khans car (owned by a woman in Bagha Jatin) from Bijon Setu to Salt Lake, still feels the pain from the bruises she suffered while jumping off the speeding vehicle to escape the assaulter.        
	The driver, a father of three, has been charged under IPC sections 354 (assaulting a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt).        
	If convicted, Khan may be sent to jail for up to two years in the first case and imprisoned for up to a year or fined Rs 1,000 in the second.        
	The law doesnt allow us to charge him under stricter sections. He has to turn up at the police station once a week, said an officer of Bidhannagar (East) police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fight that puppy fat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Fight that puppy fat
										                                  
	A lot of youngsters these days are overweight, either from eating too much, not being physically active, or because of both. But equally disturbing is the prospect of thin children gorging on diets of sugary snacks and processed food.         
	As Amishi Vora, mother of a seven-year-old, points out: Its tough trying to raise a healthy child these days, with all those flashy fast food stalls vehemently wooing children from an early age.         
	Child obesity is no longer a problem only in the West.         
	Obesity is the main cause of Type II diabetes among urban children in India, affirms a city-based paediatrician, Dr Santanu Ray.         
	In the wake of the obesity menace, many city schools have taken up a special agenda to keep their students fit.         
	Tiffin regime   
	Some schools are working closely with parents to formulate nutritious, child-friendly recipes and tips for getting picky eaters to try healthy new foods. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA) sends out tiffin schedules at the beginning of the academic session.         
	If Monday is for healthy sandwiches, Tuesday is fruits and nuts, the next day is bread pulao or chow mein (not Maggi), etc. Its a mix-and-match of different healthy items so that the child doesnt get tired of having the same tiffin daily and develop a craving for junk food, explains Meena Kak, principal, LSA.         
	It also helps the entire class to enjoy the same food and not encourage one child who is not bringing the more delicious junk food to go back home and demand it, after seeing the same in a friends tiffin box, adds Kak.        
	In schools like The Heritage, where food is supplied by the institution itself, special diets under the guidance of a dietician are prepared.         
	We send applications to parents, urging their kids to take up special diets in case they are obese, that include porridge, fruits, khichdi, bland dal and vegetables, quot; says Seema Sapru, principal, The Heritage.         
	Checking tiffin boxes and monitoring the school canteen menu are conducted in Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar and MB Girls Higher Secondary School.         
	Parents orientation             
	Mahadevi Birla Girls School asks parents of students from classes V to VIII to send a list of what their children eat at home. A nutritionist charts out a diet according to individual needs after taking a look at the food habits and we hold lectures for parents on the importance of meals, specially breakfast. Very often, I find children coming to school without having breakfast and carrying a packet of chips as they can gobble it up quickly. Only parents can stop such habits, says Malini Bhagat, principal, MB Girls.        
	Regular counselling for parents on a childs diet are held at DPS and Garden High. LSA has identified every Monday as Health Day, when parents and children are shown films and given lectures on healthy food habits.         
	Anti-obesity games             
	At DPS, Ruby Park, we urge children from classes IV to XI to use the school gym. We have also introduced free hand aerobics, karate and yoga, that undoubtedly help in shedding extra fat, quot; says A. Ghosh, principal, DPS, Ruby Park. Heritage, MB Girls, Indus Valley and Pailan World School have proper sports stadiums, including swimming, skating, gymnastics, cricket and football facilities, which are a strict part of the curricula ensuring that a child gets physical activity. Even schools like LSA and Shishu Vihar, who do not have big playgrounds, take their children out for sessions in gymnastics or swimming, for at least an hour or two hours weekly.         
	Excursions and projects   
	School excursions no more aim at just going around and learning on history and geography. These days, they also mean intense physical activities to burn down obesity. Most schools take their children to adventure camps where they have to participate in rock climbing, rafting, trekking and rappelling. Garden High gives students projects on good eating and healthy food.         
	Regular check-ups  
	Along with check-ups of the eyes, nose, throat, height and weight, schools also take note of the BMI (body mass index) to find out if the child is obese. If yes, then special attention is paid to him or her and the parents informed.              Saheli Mitra

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Family party on college campus
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Family party on college campus
  - Guests in union room, food on court          A STAFF REPORTER                           The students union room of Presidency College where guests at a family programme were entertained on Saturday night. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Bengals world-class university in the making turned into the venue of a family function of a Group D employee on Saturday night, underlining the need for change in Presidency College.        
	According to sources, guests at the rice-eating ceremony organised by the employee assembled in the students union room. The food was cooked outside the room and served on the badminton court, adjoining the union room.        
	The party started around 7.30pm and continued till 1am on Sunday. Loudspeakers belted out film songs well into the night, said the source.         
	A Group D employee did take permission to organise a rice-eating ceremony in the college. But I did not know the nature of the programme. I will visit the spots where the seating or dining arrangements were made, said Amitava Chatterjee, the principal of Presidency College.        
	Members of the students union did not know about the programme.         
	We were not told about the party. There are two keys to the union room. The general secretary has one and the security office the other. We will try to find out who opened the room and take up the matter with the principal, said an office-bearer of the SFI-controlled students body.         
	Such programmes are common on the campus. I have seen many such events in the college compound when I was a student. Usually all family programmes of Group D employees are held on the premises, said a student of the history department who graduated last year.         
	What peeved many students was the use of the badminton court as dining space.         
	If at all the occasion had to be celebrated on the campus, it should have been celebrated within the staff quarters. How could they use the badminton court? We play there regularly, said a second-year student.        
	A senior official of the college found nothing wrong with a family occasion being celebrated at the seat of learning.        
	They didnt use any classroom. The campus was not littered with waste. The programme was organised after the classes gave over and no academic activity was disrupted, he said.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Police have started a case of rash and negligent driving against the driver of the Maruti Swift that rammed into a highway divider near the Kolaghat flyover on Sunday night, killing sisters Rebecca and Arati Das.        
	The driver and owner of the car, 25-year-old Mohammad Danish, was admitted to a city nursing home with fractured legs and broken spine.         
	The fourth person who was in the car, 21-year-old Ravi Shaw, was shifted out of the Intensive Care Unit of another nursing home on Tuesday.        
	The four youngsters were returning home to the city after dinner at Sher-e-Punjab dhaba in Kolaghat, about 60km from Calcutta.        
	We are not arresting Danish immediately as he is under treatment. He will have to surrender once his condition improves, said an officer of Kolaghat police station. If found guilty, Danish can be imprisoned for up to six months or fined Rs 1,000 or both.        
	Danish told me that Ravi was at the wheel at the time of the accident. In fact, Danish had gone for the trip as he was unwilling to allow Ravi to drive the car by himself, said Danishs father. Cops said the nature of injuries suggested Danish was driving the car.

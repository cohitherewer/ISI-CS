 																											      Peter R. Moore, who served in Calcutta police in the mid-1960s, recounts March 15, 1967, when the United Front swept to power. Moore belonged to the city rsquo;s Anglo-Indian community and left the country to join the London Metropolitan Police. He lives in Perth after retirement                        Jyoti Basus first day as chief minister at Writers Buildings in 1977; (below) Peter Moore				                                       
	It is sometimes amazing how an evocation, a sight, sound, smell or mention of a place or name, can transport one back over time to far-off places with considerable clarity. Not being given to lingering nostalgia as a general rule, I was figuratively stopped in my tracks by a name I hadnt heard in over 40 years.               
	I was sitting at my desk in the morning, sheltering from the searing heat of a mid-summers day in Western Australia (40 degrees Celsius), idly surfing news on the Internet, when I saw a name that caught my eye. It was a report on the passing of Jyotirindra (shortened to Jyoti by his father) Basu. As a schoolboy in Jesuit-run St Xaviers College, I had heard that Jyoti Basu, then a prominent politician in Opposition, was an old boy of the school.         
	As the son of a senior police officer I had assimilated my fathers attitude that policemen were, or ought to be, apolitical. Whoever was elected to office by the democratic process was accepted and the law enforced without fear or favour in the spirit of constabulary independence and impartiality  or that was the theory anyway. It made me think of the day that Jyotibabu came to power.        
	Wednesday, March 15, 1967, was another hot, smelly, dusty, humid, uncomfortable day. For the citys police, it was a day of unusual tenseness. It was polling day in West Bengal and there was a surge of resistance to the incumbent Congress state government. Red flags and the hammer and sickle emblem of the CPM hung everywhere. In the months leading up to the election, police were kept busy by complaints of harassment and intimidation of potential voters by supporters of the political factions.         
	On election day, I paraded for duty in the Wireless Room in Lalbazar, with 19 other sergeants. The sergeant-major in charge of the shift allocated patrols for each unit, called a Radio Flying Squad or RFS.         
	I was issued a command certificate (each duty required a written instruction) and allocated Charlie Romeo 22 to accompany the Heavy Flying Squads (HFSs) standing by at the north district office. The vehicle was fuelled and readied by the Hindu-Punjabi constable driver and I drew the armed escort from the mass of men standing by in the Movements Hall (which used to be the Dance Hall of the Sergeants Institute before Independence).         
	Tension build-up        
	They were all Santhal constables, a taciturn lot and while they jumped to every order, little conversation took place. We honked and ground our way to the north district rendezvous point where I reported my presence to the inspector-in-charge of the HFS, an Anglo-Indian officer from the port police. Very formal and military-like; saluting and clipped instructions. There was an atmosphere of apprehension and the tension was almost palpable.         
	I maintained a radio-watch and reported significant calls to the inspector who sat in the cab of the ex-US Army 3-tonne China Dodge-234 truck reading a battered copy of a Louis Lamour western. He flagged the passing chaiwalla and we sipped our way through the scalding, but refreshing, tea made with condensed milk. He impressed upon me that this was a politically sensitive time that called for much personal restraint and a tight grip on the men.        
	By early evening, the election results were out and a United Front coalition formed between the Bangla Congress led by Ajoy Mukherjee and the CPM led by Jyoti Basu had ousted the Congress in Bengal. The deputy commissioner, north district, requested the inspector to conduct a patrol of the district to maintain a visible police presence in support of the street pickets who were now quite vulnerable amidst the crowds thronging the roads and pavements.        
	Shop-fronts displayed lines from which green bananas were suspended. They were intended to be symbolically insulting to the Congress supporters. Any doubt as to intent was removed by the crowds energetic gestures indicating how the bananas should be applied. In the absence of Congress supporters, who had all judiciously gone to earth, the police as the sole representatives of governmental authority on the spot had to weather the roaring disapproval of the mob. Soda-water bottles, garbage and in some instances excreta  human and animal  were thrown at police vehicles. The police radio chattered on. The mens faces were stone-like. Any over-reaction could precipitate a bloodbath. We were armed, but they were enormous in number.         
	We crawled the length of Upper Circular Road through teeming crowds at walking pace, just ignoring the waves of screaming abuse and threatening gestures until ones senses became numbed. Not one policeman changed expression. I fixed on a spot on the windscreen and forced myself to play Tales of the Vienna Woods in my head and found myself whistling the passages. The driver and escort looked at me curiously and must have mistaken my seeming nonchalance for confidence  or maybe I was just young, or mad, or both.         
	Crowd frenzy        
	I remember us reaching the five-point traffic island at Shyambazar where the crowd was even bigger, but they were trying to listen to someone who was howling into a microphone in Bengali, so we werent noticed. Still in convoy, we turned into the top end of Vivekananda Road where the crowds thinned out and I dont remember much else until we got back to the north district office.         
	I had not taken note of the time in between, but we had left just before 6pm and when I looked at my watch on return it was just after 11pm.         
	I could not believe that the patrol had taken us five hours. No one had broken rank and discipline had carried us through. Somehow three of the street pickets in the most volatile areas had been discreetly picked up by the HFS and quietly withdrawn. The China Dodge, with its little Gurkha driver peering over the high dashboard, was carrying nearly 100 men. The inspector was tight-lipped and just nodded at me. There were no casualties although some of the men had sustained scratches from broken glass chips and the excreta had struck some.         
	At Lalbazar the forecourt was alive with other units returning and the clamour of voices, rattling equipment and ammunition-boots seemed unreal. The Santhal escort looked as bewildered as I felt. I checked their numbers off, even though they hadnt left my side for the last 12 hours and dismissed them. I wonder if they ever remembered our total reliance upon each other during the patrol.         
	Somehow, when I saw Jyoti Basus name on my computer screen today, all I could think of was the heat and the fixed expressions on the constables faces as the brickbats drummed on the sides of the wireless van.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | IPL match at the movies
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      IPL match at the movies
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	IPL 2008: Shah Rukh Khan dances in the galleries of Eden Gardens.        
	IPL 2010: Sourav Ganguly strokes it through the covers on a city big screen.              
	In the latest trick of the IPL trade, the Twenty20 matches from the third edition will be shown live at cinema halls. This, in addition to the matches being telecast on your TV screens and also webcast live on YouTube.        
	So, come March 12, from INOX to Fame, Ajanta to Aruna, almost every evening, you can buy a ticket and watch the potent mix of cricket and Bollywood live on at least 10 big screens in town.        
	And theres even the promise of the semi-finals and final being shown in 3D, a la Avatar, in theatres with the special-format projectors if Team Lalit Modi manages to keep its word of shooting those three matches on 3D.        
	UFO Moviez, the company specialising in digital prints of movies, is using its digital satellite cinema network to make all this happen.        
	The last time Calcutta saw a major sporting event live in a movie theatre was the final of the FIFA World Cup in 2006 between France and Italy. But that multiplex beaming too was largely by invitation.        
	This will be just like watching a movie with no advertisement breaks during the two innings, Kapil Agarwal, the joint managing director of UFO Moviez told Metro. We have always watched cricket matches with friends and family and here you are being able to do that at a movie theatre.        
	Whats more, a stadium atmosphere will be created in some of the theatres. Every time a four or six is hit or a wicket taken, cheerleaders will go up on stage and do a jig.        
	The reason the movie theatres have agreed to beam the matches is because Bollywood is slated to go slow during the 45 days of the IPL tournament. So as many as seven multiplex screens have committed to beam the matches.        
	Going by the last two years we have very little to lose, says Deborshi Basu of INOX (Forum). If Bollywood chooses not to release any big film, it makes sense for us also to make most of the IPL.        
	The ticket price has not been finalised, it should not be more than what you pay for a weekday movie ticket for most matches and for KKR matches the price can go up to weekend rates.        
	But there is a catch  you can cheer the Kolkata Knight Riders only during the teams away matches. As per the IPL rules, matches will not be beamed in the venue cities on the days they are being played there. So, when the KKR takes on the other seven teams on home turf, an Eden Gardens ticket remains your best bet.

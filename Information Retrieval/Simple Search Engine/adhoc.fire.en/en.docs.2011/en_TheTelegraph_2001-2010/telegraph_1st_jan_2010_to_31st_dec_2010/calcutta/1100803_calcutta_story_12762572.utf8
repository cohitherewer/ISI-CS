          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The headless body of a young woman was found in a pond in Kheyda in Sonarpur on Monday morning, triggering panic in the locality on the southern fringes of the city. Police identified the woman as Rina Khatun, 27. The severed head is yet to be found.         
	The police said Rina hailed from Murshidabad and had claimed to be the wife of Kheyda resident Tapan Mandal. But Tapans neighbours told the cops that he had refused to acknowledge her as his wife.        
	The additional superintendent of police (rural), Ranendranath Banerjee, said: Tapan is missing. We are interrogating his parents. Rinas parents have arrived from Murshidabad and identified the body.         
	An officer said a local resident had told the police that Tapan had been missing for nearly eight years. He returned home on Friday and the next day Rina came to their house claiming to be his wife.         
	But Tapan refused to recognise her. They had a heated exchange and she left, an officer quoted Tapans neighbour Chandi Naskar as saying.         
	Naskar said Rina came back on Sunday morning. The two left the house and didnt return till late on Sunday. On Monday morning, residents recognised Rinas body by her sari. Neighbours told the cops that Rina had claimed that she and Tapan had been living in Barasat after their marriage.         
	We will talk to the parents of Tapan and Rina, said the officer.

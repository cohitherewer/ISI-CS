                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sitar legend sets sights on century
                            
	Tanmoy Bose flew down to San Diego to attend Pandit Ravi Shankars 90th birthday celebrations. The tabla player from Gariahat who travels the world with the sitar legend tells Metro about the special day.        
	Sukanyaji and daughter Anoushka arranged the 90th birthday celebrations for Pandit Ravi Shankar as a surprise for the sitar maestro at the La Costa Spa and Resorts in Carlsbad, San Diego, on Wednesday.        
	Sukanyaji welcomed everyone with a speech, which was followed by the screening of a rare episode of the Don Ellis Show, George Harrison speaking on Raviji. Then three dancers performed to Ravijis music. Odissi exponent Shalini Patnaik  who has choreographed performances by the likes of Madonna and Ricky Martin  performed beautifully. This was followed by a sumptuous dinner.        
	There were over 300 guests, including Ravijis grandson and granddaughter. Lakshmi Shankar, Anoushka and Norah and her mother Sue Jones, and musicians like English songwriter Jeff Lynne, drummer/composer Jim Keltner, jazz saxophonist Ravi Coltrane were there.        
	Raviji, as always, was full of humour. I dont know what to say because I have never been 90 before, he said, his characteristic wit in place. Very sweetly, he added, I would try to make it till 100.

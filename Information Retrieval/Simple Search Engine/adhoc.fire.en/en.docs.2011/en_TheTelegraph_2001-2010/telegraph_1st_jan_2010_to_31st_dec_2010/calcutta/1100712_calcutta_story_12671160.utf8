	The CID which keeps a tab on criminals on the city outskirts and beyond has been hit by a manpower crunch that has resulted in several key posts lying vacant.        
	Officers said the agency had never been hamstrung by such a human resource crisis in recent past.        
	Three key posts have been lying vacant while the incumbents of another three have been on a prolonged leave for health reasons.        
	The post of the deputy inspector general (operations) has been lying vacant for the past month since Ajey Ranade left and joined the port trust as part of the mandatory deputation service for IPS officers.        
	The DIG (operations) looks after the Special Operations Group (SOG), which has been set up to deal with terrorist activities, fake note racket and high-profile murders and abductions.         
	Now there is no one to guide us in sensitive cases, said an officer attached to the SOG. There are two officers of the inspector-general rank but because of their administrative responsibilities, they cant provide us the guidance that a DIG does.        
	In recent past, the SOG had cracked a number of high-profile cases and arrested several accused, including six Bangladeshi gangsters, on the fringe areas such as Baguiati, Dum Dum, Lake Town, Tiljala and Behala.        
	In the last reshuffle of IPS officers, no one was asked to join the post of DIG (operations). No officer was willing to take the responsibility. The DIG (operations) also deals with Maoists across the state but he is not entitled to any of the special privileges enjoyed by his counterpart in the Special Task Force of Calcutta police, which too deals with terror modules. The government, for instance, provides a risk allowance to STF officers at 30 per cent of the basic salary.        
	Why is such a crucial post remaining vacant? One of the most efficient officers needs to be appointed to the post. We are looking for such an officer.        
	The post of deputy superintendent of police (cyber crime) has been lying vacant for two months since Ranjit Chakrabarty was transferred.        
	The wing deals with new-age crime. We receive a number of complaints about email hacking and creating fake profiles on social networking sites. The absence of the DSP is affecting our work, said an officer of the cyber crime wing.        
	The post of special superintendent (I), too, is vacant following the transfer of Bastab Baidya to Calcutta police.        
	Besides, three deputy superintendents are on sick leave  two of them are seriously ill and another has met with an accident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rob raid   on train   at dawn
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rob raid   on train   at dawn
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Several passengers of the Sealdah-bound Darjeeling Mail were robbed of their valuables early on Tuesday but nobody lodged a complaint.         
	Passengers on the S5 coach said a gang started snatching bags, cameras and other valuables from some of them when the train was waiting for track clearance near Rampurhat station, 200-odd km from Calcutta, around 5am. An Eastern Railway spokesperson denied receiving any complaint while a railway police officer said he knew of only one passenger being targeted.        
	A group of robbers had tried to snatch the handbag of a passenger named Sheila Banerjee when she was asleep. But she woke up and screamed, prompting the robbers to flee, said Tanmoy Roychowdhury, the superintendent of railway police in Howrah.         
	By the time the train guard reached the coach, the robbers were gone. Nobody filed a complaint, he added.         
	But passengers alleged that there was no guard around when the incident occurred. We shouted for help but nobody came. A guard arrived later to ask what had happened, said a passenger.         
	Instances of passengers being robbed on long-distance trains have become frequent. A 20-year-old German student travelling to Howrah from Varanasi by the Vibhuti Express last January was drugged and robbed.        
	Last year, at least 200 passengers of three air-conditioned coaches of the Barbil-Howrah Janshatabdi Express were robbed near the Bengal-Jharkhand border.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Red light for yellow cabs
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Red light for yellow cabs
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                            
	Calcutta didnt miss its yellow taxi much on Thursday, at least not as much as the striking cabbies would have wanted it to be missed.         
	The daylong strike by 34,000-odd taxis to press for a fare hike to offset rising fuel costs turned out to be more of an advertising opportunity for the new alternatives in town  air-conditioned Volvo buses and radio cabs  than a tool to blackmail the government by inconveniencing the commuter.         
	The message for the taxi lobby at the end of the day was: you can take your wheels off the road but you cant slam the brakes on the Calcuttan on the move.        
	Banker Alok Mukherjee, a Salt Lake resident who regularly travels by taxi, was one of the many who discovered how a comfortable commute need not necessarily mean hailing the nearest cab.        
	I had barely stepped out of my housing complex (near PNB Island) when I saw a Volvo bus passing by and boarded it. I must admit I hadnt expected such a comfortable ride for less than what I spend on a taxi trip every day, Mukherjee told Metro.        
	The 33-year-old bank executive intends commuting to and from his Theatre Road workplace by the Airport-Santragachhi Volvo bus whenever he can instead of taking a taxi to Sovabazar Metro station, boarding a train to Rabindra Sadan and then walking some distance.         
	A comparison revealed benefits for Mukherjee in terms of time, money and effort. Until Wednesday, he would spend around Rs 50 on a 20-minute taxi ride from Salt Lake to Sovabazar, Rs 6 on a Metro ticket from Sovabazar to Rabindra Sadan and then walk for around 15 minutes. A Volvo ride would entail an average waiting time of 20 minutes for the AC bus, a fare of Rs 40 till AJC Bose Road and a short walk.        
	Volvo bus operators  the West Bengal State Transport Corporation and Royal Cruiser  also seemed to be alert to the opportunity to grab a market share, increasing the frequency of their services on Thursday. Royal Cruiser, which runs a fleet of 20 buses and charges a fare of Rs 20 for the first 8km and Rs 10 extra for every additional 4km, increased the number of vehicles from six to eight on the Airport-Tollygunge and Airport-Santragachhi routes.         
	The frequency of buses was 15 minutes, against half-an-hour on other days. Business went up by 35 per cent in the morning peak hours and by 45 per cent in the evening, said Raj Kumar Biyani, who handles the city operations of the companys Volvo service.        
	The 10 state-run Volvo buses also recorded a 20 per cent increase in the number of passengers.         
	For those outside the Volvo routes, there was a pricier but more comfortable alternative to yellow taxis: radio cabs. The 335-strong fleet was booked through the day.        
	 We started receiving bookings from Wednesday evening. We had as many as 62 airport drops, which is almost 75 per cent more than on other days, said an official of Orix Auto Infrastructure Services Ltd, one of the radio cab operators in the city.         
	Radio cabs charge Rs 15 for the first 2km and an additional Rs 3 for every 200 metres. The fare is steep but they are so comfortable. They pick you up from your doorstep, said Shreya Ghosh, who fetched her daughter from her Lenin Sarani school in a Megacab.        
	According to the taxi unions, only 10 per cent of the 40,000 taxis plied on the streets of Calcutta. But not all of them joined the strike voluntarily. Union members damaged six taxis on Ripon Street for defying the strike. Police arrested a youth, Mohammad Sabir, at the Kidderpore crossing for pelting a taxi with stones and a driver, Md. Kamruz Zaman, for damaging one on AJC Bose Road.        
	Taxi owner Raj Kumar Sau, 43, did not take out his vehicle but admitted that he wouldnt gain anything from the strike. I came to Calcutta from Bihar in the early nineties and became a taxi driver. In 2006, I bought a taxi with a loan whose EMI is Rs 6,000. Even a days loss for me is a big financial blow, said Sau.        
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundus statement did not augur well for the taxi lobby either. We need more time to decide on the fare structure. The taxi unions cannot force us to take a decision. If they want to go on strike, so be it.        
	So do operators like Sau fear that taxis will be elbowed out of city roads someday? I am sure people will quit boarding taxis if Volvos offer them comfort and convenience at a lower price, he said.        
	But bus operators admitted that ending the monopoly of the yellow fleet would take a long time. The transport department should issue more permits and make better business propositions to operators, suggested Biyani.

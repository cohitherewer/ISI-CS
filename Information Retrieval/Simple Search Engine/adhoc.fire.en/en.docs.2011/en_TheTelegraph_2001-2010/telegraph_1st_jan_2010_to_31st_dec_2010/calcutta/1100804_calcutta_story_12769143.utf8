                Three youths entered a 58-year-old womans home in Bagha Jatin on Tuesday morning claiming to know her husband and son and attacked her before fleeing with the gold chain, ring and the gold-plated bangle she was wearing. Gita Chakraborty, 58, was alone in the house when the three rang the bell and asked for her husband Dulal, 65, and son Arup, calling them by their nicknames. Gita allowed the three in and rushed to the roof to remove the clothes that she hung out to dry as it had started to rain. When she came back, the trio hit her and tried to gag her before taking away the jewellery. Arup returned home and saw his mother lying on the floor with a bloody nose and took her to hospital. Cops suspect the trio were business rivals of Arup, a building materials supplier, and had come to beat him up.

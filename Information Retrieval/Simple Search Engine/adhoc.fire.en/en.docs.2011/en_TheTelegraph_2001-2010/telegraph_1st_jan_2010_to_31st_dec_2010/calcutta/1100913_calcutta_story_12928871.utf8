                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Extortionist walks into police trap
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Extortionist Zaffar Siddiqui alias Gudda and his girlfriend Shabnam Begum on Sunday evening walked into a trap set by police.         
	The two were whisked off to Lalbazar police headquarters as soon as they walked into Gulshan International, a hotel off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, to meet an acquaintance. A revolver was found on the extortionist.         
	Gudda got bail last month. He had immediately started extorting traders. We learnt that in less than a fortnight, he had collected about Rs 25 lakh from businessmen in Topsia, Watgunge and several parts of central Calcutta, said a senior police officer.         
	According to the police, he also masterminded at least two abductions since coming out of jail.        
	We have booked him under the arms act for carrying a gun. We will also slap kidnap and extortion charges on him, added the officer.        
	Gudda will be produced both at Bankshall Court and Sealdah Court on Monday.         
	We were looking for him but could not catch him. So we used an informer to lure him to the hotel to discuss a plan to extort a businessman, a resident of Wellesley Second Lane, said the officer.         
	Gudda, along with Shabnam, entered the hotel around 6.30pm and called the acquaintance to inform him that he had reached. The cops, who were waiting in the adjacent lanes, rushed into the hotel and arrested the two.         
	Gudda, who grew up in Narkeldanga, cut his teeth on extortion and other crimes after shifting to Wellesley Second Lane.        
	The cops have learnt that he had bought properties in Shibpur in Howrah and in Jadavpur. To evade arrest after his release, he was shuttling between the two addresses while continuing to terrorise traders.         
	Police sources said he had abducted Sheikh Aslam alias Santu from 43 Topsia Road on September 3 and released him after three days on payment of a ransom of Rs 10 lakh. Gudda also collected a ransom of over Rs 10 lakh from family members of Sheikh Asmat after kidnapping him from the Kabitirtho area.

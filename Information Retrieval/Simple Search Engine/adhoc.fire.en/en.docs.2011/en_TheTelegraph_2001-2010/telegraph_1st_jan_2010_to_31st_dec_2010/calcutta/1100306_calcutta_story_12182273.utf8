The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | K-word causes a flutter
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      K-word causes a flutter
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Kidnap is the new keyword in the citys crime lexicon, replacing the old menace of extortion, or tolabaji in local parlance.        
	Tolabaji has a long history in Calcutta. Several politicians, including at least three sitting MPs, were actively involved in the business of extorting money from traders in the name of giving them protection, said a retired police officer.         
	With the cops making little headway in tracing those who had recently made pay up-or-be-kidnapped calls to some city businessmen, the K-word has now become the weapon of choice for the E-brigade.         
	The reactions of top state government officials have not only made the K-word more potent but also triggered panic. Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti advised businessmen to recruit private security guards and not leave their houses after midnight, while home secretary Ardhendu Sen jumped the gun by suggesting that the terror calls could have a Karachi connection.        
	A team of police officers from Bidhannagar North police station got a first-hand feel of the new trend while investigating a complaint of Rs 10 lakh being demanded by potential abductors from an employee of an IT firm.        
	The man had lodged a complaint after receiving calls demanding Rs 10 lakh from him to avoid abduction. We traced the number and arrested two persons. But the complainant told the court on Friday that the arrested duo were only playing a prank on him, said an investigating officer.         
	The police are continuing their probe as the Salt Lake additional chief judicial magistrates court refused to close the case without going through the case diary, to be submitted on March 11.        
	Whether the arrested duo did play a prank will be known later, but it is clear that Calcuttans have started taking such threats seriously with Capgemini executive Sandipan Dass abduction for ransom coinciding with a few businessmen receiving extortion calls with kidnap warnings.         
	The police are looking for more than 10 small-time criminals  including Raju, a resident of Howrah, Shankar and Ramesh Yadav  allegedly involved in extorting money in Hooghly and Howrah by threatening abduction.         
	Three months ago, one such group, apparently helped by a taxi driver, had abducted a techie from Sector V. He was released against a ransom, just as Sandipan was.        
	The governments faulty handling of complaints is tantamount to encouraging extortionists to target people with kidnap threats. Instead of keeping the calls to businessmen under wraps, senior officials made the details public, which is unprofessional, said the retired officer.

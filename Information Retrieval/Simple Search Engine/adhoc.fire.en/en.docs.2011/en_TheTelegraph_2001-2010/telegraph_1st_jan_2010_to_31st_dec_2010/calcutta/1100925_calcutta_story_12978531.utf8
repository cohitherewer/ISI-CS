	The government has joined hands with a private partner to launch a three-hour river cruise with lunch or dinner on board.         
	KBS Tour amp; Travels will operate the cruise using the 100-seater Queen of the Ganges that it has rented from the government on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.        
	The boat will set sail this weekend and ply on all the Durga puja days. The journey will begin and end at Babughat New Jetty, next to the Eden Gardens Circular Railway station.        
	There is no fixed route yet. Dakshineswar and Belur Math are two of the attractions the cruise will cover. Tickets (Rs 950 per person for the evening cruise, Rs 900 per person for the afternoon cruise) will be available at the KBS office at Fairlie Place and other outlets across the city.        
	Tourism minister Manabendra Mukherjee launched the service on Friday.        
	Sanjay Goswami, the managing director of KBS Tours and Travels, said: Private cruises are usually operated only if there are bulk bookings. But Queen of the Ganges will run every weekend and public holiday even if it is half-empty.         
	The vessel can also be hired for parties.         
	Plane switch         
	Singapore Airlines will soon start to operate Airbus A330 planes, instead of Boeing 777s, between Calcutta and the island state, the general manager (India) of the airline announced on Friday.         
	An A330 plane has 30 business class and 255 economy class seats. A Boeing 777 has 300 seats. Airline officials said the A330 seats can be reclined up to 180 degrees and were equipped with iPod and iPhone connectivity.        
	We have seen a surge in traffic from Calcutta to Singapore and beyond. Hence, we have decided to offer better services to our flyers, said C.W. Foo, the general manager.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tweet amp; text on terminal fret
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tweet amp; text on terminal fret
										      SANJAY MANDAL      ttforcity: AARGH! AIRPORT                                          
	Calcutta airports untreated terminal illness is not only the citys shame but also the lament of the twitterati.        
	Calcutta airport at 6am...jam packed, bursting with angry travellers lining up an hour in advance and yet missing their flights because of the slow understaffed security checks!!! Feel bad for the patient Calcuttans... they deserve a new, much larger airport... and sooooon!!! tweeted actor Vivek Oberoi on Sunday morning after a visit to the city.        
	Vivek, returning home with memories of sweet people and yummy mishti doi and nolen gurer sandesh for his family (as expressed in an earlier tweet), was so taken aback by the long queues for security check that he even clicked and posted a picture of the chaos.        
	A few days earlier, the congestion at the city airport had prompted actress Genelia Dsouza to tweet thank god after barely making it to her flight. Calcutta airport is so so chaotic...        
	So what has changed at the domestic terminal in the weeks since Metro started highlighting the appalling state of the airport that refuses to be privatised? Metro revisits.        
	Queues        
	The whole airport experience has been a nightmare! Every queue from the minute you enter gets longer: baggage, check-in and the absolute mad one, the security check! Nine booths searching 1,000 people! How does any flight take off on time? Meltdown in a year, if not earlier, unless the government decides to halt the expansion of air travel! Birmingham-based entrepreneur-cum-actor Zain Sikander Bhana texted Metro on Sunday morning, before flying out to Delhi after a brief visit to the city.        
	Zains plaint mirrors the plight of most fliers out of the airport. The queues at the registered luggage scanning counter are snaking with the authorities keeping the in-line X-ray system in cold storage.         
	The excuse for not making it operational is the all-too-familiar: We are awaiting clearance from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.        
	The worst part of the airport experience  unless one is a pretty celebrity like Genelia with super nice people eager to help  remains the queue for security check.         
	On Sunday morning, a mother and daughter bound for Bangalore spent 45 minutes queuing up before finally breaking the line in sheer desperation.        
	There was nobody to help, either from the airport or the airline. After waiting behind some 200 people, we broke the queue lest we missed our flight, When we reached the gate, we saw an airline official shouting for passengers booked for Bangalore. We probably wouldnt have made it to the plane had we awaited our turn, said the woman, in her thirties.        
	Officials of the Central Industrial Security Force said the number of X-ray machines were waiting to be increased. There are currently nine frisking booths and five X-ray machines with one on stand-by.         
	There is no space to set up another counter or create a passage to the first floor, where we could set up more counters, said an official.        
	Trolleys        
	A new agency has been awarded the maintenance contract for trolleys and around 400 new ones added, but that has hardly made a difference to fliers.        
	Citu forced the agency to retain the previous set of workers. Basically, its a new agency with the same old attitude, rued an airport official.        
	Evidence of that came on Wednesday evening when a train of trolleys being pushed by two workers knocked down a young woman.         
	Forget apologising, the workers abused her for allegedly blocking the way. When other passengers protested, an army of trolley pushers ganged up against them. Dont you dare talk to us like that. Leave now if you dont want to be beaten up, an elderly flier quoted one of the workers as warning him and the other passengers.        
	Cleanliness        
	A team of 30 has been hired on contract to keep the area outside the terminal clean, but the interiors of the building remain neglected. An official said some of these contracted workers could have been deployed inside  the Airports Authority of Indias cleaning staff are renowned for their callousness  had they been issued security passes.        
	The authorities have failed to arrange for security passes because of opposition from the AAI staff. If private workers are brought in to clean the toilets and mop the floors, the unions will hold the airport management hostage, the official added.        
	What horrors at the airport have you faced? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

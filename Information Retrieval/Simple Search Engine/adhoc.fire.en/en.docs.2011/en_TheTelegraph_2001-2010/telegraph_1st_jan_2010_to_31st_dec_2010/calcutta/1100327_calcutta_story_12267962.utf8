                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Samples for DNA matching

	The process of DNA sequencing of the bodies of unidentified victims of the Stephen Court blaze started on Friday with the collection of samples from the charred remains and claimants at SSKM Hospital.        
	Our forensic experts collected blood samples from 17 persons of nine families that have been claiming four bodies. Samples were also collected from the bodies, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM.        
	Sources said samples of soft tissue, liver and bone marrow were collected from the charred bodies. The bodies were badly burnt and it was extremely difficult to detect muscles and organs that were less damaged, said a forensic expert.        
	The samples, collected over five hours, were taken to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL).         
	C.N. Bhattacharyya, the director of the laboratory, said it would not be known before Saturday whether the DNA sequencing would be possible. The laboratory will remain open through the weekend since this is an emergency.        
	The forensic department at SSKM was flooded with traumatised family members looking for the bodies of their near and dear ones.         
	I am still in shock but somehow managed to undergo the process of DNA sample collection. I never thought I would have to go through such a procedure for getting my brothers body, said Mili Roy, the sister of Bidyut Acharya, a suspected fire victim.        
	Prabhati Dhali, the mother of 20-year-old Bhagyashree Dhali who has been missing since Tuesdays blaze, said: This sample collection is only adding to our trauma. I was made to see bodies, horribly burnt, to try and identify my daughter. I was feeling nauseous from the stench of rotting human remains while they were collecting my blood sample.        
	Forensic experts said it was not known when the sequencing would be over and the bodies handed over to the rightful claimants. Given the condition of the bodies, it is impossible to say how long it would take for the process to finish, said an expert.

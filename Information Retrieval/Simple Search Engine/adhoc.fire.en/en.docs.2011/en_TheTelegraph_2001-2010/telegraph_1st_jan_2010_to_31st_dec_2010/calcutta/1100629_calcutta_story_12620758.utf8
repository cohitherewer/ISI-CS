	A push from a breakdown van to move a stationary tram separated its two compartments, one of which got derailed and hit a car, triggering two more collisions on Bagmari bridge on Monday afternoon.         
	The tram, which was going to Bidhannagar from Rajabazar, was stranded on the bridge around noon as a snag in the overhead wire had cut off electricity supply.         
	Around 12.20pm, a sergeant asked the breakdown van that was being used to carry out repairs on the overhead wire to gently push the tram from behind. The idea was to roll the tram to the foot of the bridge, said Bagmari resident Sumit Chakraborty, who witnessed the incident.        
	As soon as the tram was pushed, the two compartments got separated with a violent jerk. The wheels at the back of the front compartment got detached from its body. It then got derailed, rolled ahead about 25 metres and hit a Toyota Innova coming from the opposite direction, added Chakraborty.         
	The Innova veered left and hit a Maruti Esteem on its right. At the same time a taxi hit our car from behind. The tram could easily have crushed us had it been moving faster, said the driver of the Esteem.         
	All three cars were badly damaged but the occupants were not injured.        
	A Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) official said the compartments were separated as the kingpin, which holds them together, broke.         
	A tram has three trucks under which the wheels are fitted. The centre truck, which extends from the back of the front compartment to the front of the rear one, got detached from the front compartment, added the official.        
	The mishap raised concerns about the maintenance of trams, nearly 150 of which ply in the city. CTC had last bought trams  14 of them  in 1992.        
	Company officials were tight-lipped about why the kingpin broke. We have our workshops where the trams are repaired. The trams are allowed to ply on the streets only after a nod from our engineering department, claimed Pradip Chatterjee, the managing director of CTC.         
	Our preliminary investigation suggests that the accident took place because of the push by the breakdown van, said Chatterjee.         
	According to police, the tram was pushed as it was clogging the narrow bridge, disrupting traffic flow.        
	Traffic movement on Maniktala Main Road eventually had to be suspended for nearly two hours because of the accident.         
	After CTC officials joined the two compartments with wires, the breakdown van pulled the tram to Bidhannagar depot. On Friday morning, an engine and two compartments of the Mumbai-bound Duronto Express had got detached from the rest of the train.

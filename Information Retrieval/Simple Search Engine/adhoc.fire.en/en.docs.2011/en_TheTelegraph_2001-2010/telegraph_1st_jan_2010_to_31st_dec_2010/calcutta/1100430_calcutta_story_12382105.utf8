The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth drive after Stephen blot

          SUBHAJOY ROY                          Occupants of Stephen Court wait for help on March 23. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The fire services department is keen on injecting fresh blood into the force after coming under fire for its handling of the Stephen Court blaze that killed 43 people.         
	The department has cleared the decks for recruitment of fire operators, fire engine operators-cum-drivers and assistant mobilising officers. The recruits will be young  20 to 27 years old. This is expected to reduce the reaction time of the firemen, said an officer of a fire station in north Calcutta.        
	We will recruit 466 fire operators. They are the ones who work in the field during a fire, said Shaique Ahmed, the joint secretary of fire services department.         
	A source in the fire department said 142 fire engine operators-cum-drivers and 12 assistant mobilising officers will also be recruited. Many tenders were lying unused because of lack of drivers, he admitted.         
	Assistant mobilising officers relay information to the officers of the division and stations in whose area a fire occurs, explained an official.         
	The department has also written to the state public service commission for employing 250 sub-officers and proposed an amendment to the rules governing their recruitment.         
	We have proposed direct recruitment for half the sanctioned posts of sub-officers. Now, only 25 per cent of the posts are filled up through direct recruitment while 75 per cent sub-officers get promoted, said an official. The directly recruited sub-officers will also be aged between 20 and 27, he added.        
	The department wants sub-officers to undergo a written test, an interview and an endurance test to qualify for the job. The candidates now appear only for an interview. The endurance tests will see whether they are physically fit to combat a fire, the official added. Four fire operators and one sub-officer accompany each fire tender.         
	Speaking about bringing in youths, officials stressed on the importance of minimising the reaction time of firemen. Each and every minute counts in case of a fire, pointed out an official.         
	Someone in his 20s would react quicker than a fire operator in his 40s, he added.         
	A source in the fire services department admitted that the department was keen on an image makeover after the March 23 Stephen Court blaze.         
	The role of the fire services was severely criticised after the Stephen Court fire. We now want to fill up as many of the vacant posts as possible, said the source. Advertisements announcing recruitment of fire operators first appeared on April 11, 19 days after the Stephen Court blaze.         
	Officials pointed out that the recruitment drive wouldnt fill up all vacant posts because of lack of funds. There are 1,600 vacancies for fire operators. We can employ only that many people sanctioned by the finance department, said an official.

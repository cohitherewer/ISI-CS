          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police on Monday arrested the thief who had allegedly burgled the residence of the owners of catering firm Bijoli Grill on Saturday morning.        
	The bulk of the jewellery and cash worth Rs 7 lakh stolen from the house on Hazra Road were recovered from 22-year-old Sanju Mondal, said police. He was produced in a city court on Monday and remanded in police custody.        
	The police said Mondal, a repeat offender, was arrested in his Manoharpukur Road home. We recovered most of the stolen items from him except Rs 2,200, a gold ring and four gold bangles, said a senior officer of the city polices south division.        
	Mondal was behind bars for close to a month in a cellphone theft case. He was released last Friday and was back in business on Saturday, the cop added.        
	The burglary occurred in the third-floor room of Annapurna Barik, 76, the mother of Bijoli Grill owners Anil and Tapan Barik. Among the items stolen were 12 gold bangles, a gold chain, gold and diamond rings and earrings as well as Rs 10,000.        
	Annapurna had gone to the terrace of the four-storeyed building around 6.30am and returned to her room around 8.15am to find two almirahs ransacked. She also spotted the thief scampering down the stairs.        
	We questioned three local criminals and got some leads. We then searched documents and found out that Mondal was out of the jail. Also, the sketch prepared on the basis of Annapurnas statement tallied with the photograph of Mondal, said the officer.

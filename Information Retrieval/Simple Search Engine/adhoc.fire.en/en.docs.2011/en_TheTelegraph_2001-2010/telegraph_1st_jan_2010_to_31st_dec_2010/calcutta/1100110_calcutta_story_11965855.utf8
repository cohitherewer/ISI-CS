The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Market rebirth
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Market rebirth
										      Footfalls have picked up again at Calcuttas favourite shop stop. But can New Market survive the competition from malls? Metro explores                        The New Market facade. Pictures by Pabitra Das				                                 
	There is a buzz about New Market again. The faade has been painted, the big clock on the clock tower is working. Walking along Lindsay Street, it is slightly magical to hear its deep, musical chime above the din, especially on winter evenings. And the people are back at the shops.         
	After several years of parking woes and dug-up streets, at a time when Calcuttans were just switching their loyalty to glitzy malls, the 135-year-old market has proved it has an appeal all its own. You are almost tempted to visualise the Gothic structures of old London that inspired Hogg Market. If it was not for the imposing underground parking plaza.         
	That was the conflict zone. The construction of the parking zone robbed New Market of its business, felt the shop owners. Now that its functional, things look different. Our parking was taken away in 2002-03 to build Simpark. The roads were bad. People come shop in a car. How were they to come in a situation like this? questions Mahesh Punjabi, the deputy secretary of SS Hogg Market Traders Association.                   
	Not just New Market. The entire stretch suffered. Every shop along Lindsay Street complained of erosion of their customer base. Even during peak Puja periods in 2004-2005, shop owners in the area reported poor sales. Our sales had dropped by half during these years, claims Punjabi. It was also the time other popular shopping destinations opened in Calcutta. Forum opened in 2003. City Centre in 2004.        
	The Simpark underground parking was inaugurated in 2008. Two years later, Punjabi says the market has got back the business it had lost and is growing annually. Others agree.        
	The last one-and-a-half years have been good. The sales have been much better; there has been an increase of about 20 per cent. The malls have been there for some time. So the people have seen it and realised New Markets unique appeal, says Shiv Daswani of Little Shop, who also has stores at malls.         
	It is not just nostalgia that brings people to New Market. If it has managed to hold its own against new-age malls and supermarkets it is because of its enduring utility.        
	I get about 60 per cent of my fresh buys from New Market, says Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpies, a restaurant. There was a time when you couldnt get exotic vegetables, different kinds of meat and special cheese anywhere else. Now they may be available at the supermarket, but you still get good quality stuff at reasonable rates at New Market.        
	All her prawns, seafood, pork and beef and some vegetables come from New Market. The shopkeepers have been doing this for years. I can tell them I need the meat for chops, a rezala, a Bengali preparation or Continental and they know what kind of cut I mean. I could never explain this to a shop attendant at a supermarket, says Dasgupta.         
	There are the well-known charms. For many Calcuttans, the first ethno-chic look comes with the first silver trinket from Chamba Lama and then it becomes a habit. Then there is Nahoums and its cheese samosas, lemon puffs and water biscuits. And perfumes from The Royal Stores.         
	But a trip to New Market can be an educating experience even for a regular. I go to New Market at least twice a month and every time I am there, I discover a new shop, says 26-year-old Cauvery Ganapathi, who works in a research organisation.         
	I went with my group to explore New Market recently, says Salmoli Mukerji, a member of Food + Fotos, a group of Indian and foreign nationals set up to explore the city. It was nice to see that the market has been painted and the clock was working, says Mukerji.         
	She too stresses that some cheeses and spices and cold cuts are best available in New Market. However, she misses the cannon at the centre of New Market, one of her earliest childhood memories.         
	The downturn, which affected the shopping malls, possibly helped New Market to get back in shape.         
	I had got into the habit of shopping at the malls. But in the past year, when I did not get a hike because of the downturn, I had to find cheaper alternatives. I started going back to places like New Market and Metro Plaza. Products are more affordable and the designs are nice, says 28-year-old media professional Moumita Mukherjee. They might not have the fancy brand tag that a mall ensures, but as far as fashion goes, few will be able to tell the difference. Not just with ready-made clothes.        
	Brocades are usually very expensive. But at New Market they cost less than at many stores outside. Gariahat too has affordable stuff, but the quality is not as good, says Ganapathy. Indrani Gupta not only picks up the stocks for her salon from New Market, but also stuff for herself. I sometimes bargain just for the fun of it, says model Jessica, who also picks up flowers, shoes, jewellery, dresses and dress material from New Market.         
	And who doesnt like a good bargain in Calcutta. The New Market shop owners develop a rapport with the customers over the years. You dont get such a relationship at the malls, says Daswani.         
	With more business the shopkeepers have upgraded their collection. From harem pants to leggings, shorts the kind Priyanka Chopra sports in Dostana and Pyaar Impossible, and chequered pants, skinny jeans and skirts, cropped and flowing  the shops of New Market have it all. All our clothes are picked up from south-east Asia, from places like Singapore, says a shopkeeper. Brands like Adidas have started entering New Market, says Punjabi. Shops like V2 have a very good western-wear collection. I think many old shops are also extending their collection to cater to the younger clientele. Sometimes I have picked up a top from a mall and found out later that it is available for half the price at New Market, feels Jessica. Many more people go to hang out at the malls, to watch a movie and eat than to buy, says Ganapathy.        
	For the shopkeepers it is a bid for survival. We have got a new association of shopkeepers. There are many youngsters in the association and they are bringing fresh ideas, says Punjabi. There are promotionals. During Puja we had a promotional activity where we gave away a car and LCD televisions to shoppers through a lucky draw, said Punjabi.         
	Among the 19 Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)-owned markets, New Market generates the highest revenue, about Rs 3.5 crore annually, says Bhaskar Ghosh, the chief manager (market) of the CMC.         
	Punjabi says the CMC is now positive about the market. Earlier if we wanted to implement something to improve the market, the CMC decisions would take a long time. But now things move very fast, he says. Not all the shopkeepers agree. I need to repair the trial room of my shop. But I am yet to get permission from the CMC. And they dont care for the market, complains a shop owner. He has a problem with the Simpark Mall. New Market is a heritage market. They cannot build another mall so close to it.         
	While the association plays peacemaker, shrugging off any negative impact of the mall, the CMC has gone ahead to point out how the shop owners themselves are responsible for the lack of development. The market is full of encroachers, they have to be taken care of before any maintenance work can be done. We need cooperation from the traders. We had plans to air-condition the market, but the traders objected to the proposal to add a floor inside the market to recover the cost of the project. They pay rent per square feet but when an extra floor was proposed they wanted the same space on a cubic feet basis, says joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam.         
	The association says its current goal is to give basic amenities to the shopper. The Calcutta shopper has had a taste of comfort, and even if drawn by the charm of New Market, they would like to see some changes. We have to look at proper maintenance, provide clean drinking water to the shopper and proper restrooms. We inaugurated a restroom for women a month back, says Punjabi. Probably they would also do well to mark out its direction.         
	Not every problem can be solved by Punjabi and his association. Commuting remains a problem. I was going to New Market recently and there was a rally and I was stuck on the Park Street flyover forever, says Dasgupta.         
	But for the time being, the pace of the business is back. I saw this beautiful purple skirt at a shop near the flower stalls, but I thought I will pick up a cake from Nahoums first. I came back in 20 minutes and the skirt was gone, rues Preyashi Banerjee, who was at New Market recently.   
	Bazaar basics  
	 New Market opened on January 1, 1875  
																								 It was initially called the Municipal New Market. In 1903, the name was changed to SS Hogg Market, after Sir Stuart Hogg, who was the chairman of the Calcutta Corporation and the commissioner of police  
																								 The market was built at a cost of Rs 6,55,277. This was inclusive of the land. In 1909 it was expanded on the eastern side at a cost of Rs 11,53,388  
																								 The original design of the market was by Roskell Bayne  
																									 The market building, barring the clock tower, is reminiscent of the 
  Marylebone Station in London  
																								 A large part of the northern section of the market was destroyed in a fire which broke out on December 11, 1985. It was later rebuilt and opened again in the early 1990s  
																								 A Hindi-medium school has been running on the south roof of the market since 1954   
	 The present location of New Market was once occupied by a bazaar which was known as Fenwick rsquo;s Bazaar  
																								 While zoning is an evolving concept in organised retail and new-age malls, New Market has always been divided into sections that house shops selling a particular category of products  
																								 Before Independence, New Market was mainly patronised by the British. After Independence there was a period of uncertainty about the future of the market. The traders went through a bad phase between 1948 and 1960. Many sold their shops for just Rs 7,000-8,000 at the time

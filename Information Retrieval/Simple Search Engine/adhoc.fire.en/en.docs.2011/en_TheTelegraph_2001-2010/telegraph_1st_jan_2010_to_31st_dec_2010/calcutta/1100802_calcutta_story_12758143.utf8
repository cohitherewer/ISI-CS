The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Back to the queue for wasting time on tarmac
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Back to the queue for wasting time on tarmac
  - Airport authorities bank on stricter runway rules and new technology for timely take-off          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	Tough take-off guidelines and a technological leap are set to help flights out of the city beat the traffic jam on the tarmac.        
	The first change could take effect in a month, forcing aircraft lined up for departure to come out of the parking bay and start taxiing within five minutes of clearance from air traffic control (ATC).         
	According to a circular from the directorate-general of civil aviation, any aircraft that fails to adhere to the new norms would need to queue up all over again and await clearance, subject to availability of take-off slots.         
	This is meant to force airlines to adhere to their scheduled take-off time. Any delay will place them in a long queue, said an airport official.        
	Runway procedures are poised to become even smoother after a precision-based navigation system called Air Traffic Flow Management is put in place by next year. We are planning to install the system in all major airports. The costs and other details are being worked out, a senior official of the Airports Authority of India told Metro from Delhi on Sunday.         
	The navigation system is similar to Eurocontrols Central Flow Management Unit, widely used in European countries and some Asian airports like Bangkok and Singapore.         
	Software will be installed at the ATC tower to collect data and provide analysis meant to be used for optimum utilisation of air and ground space, an airport engineer explained.         
	The system will automatically slot flights for take-off, identify problem points when clustering takes place and also regulate the movement of overflying aircraft. It will tell the ATC and the pilot which route can be taken to avoid congestion and minimise fuel loss, the engineer said.        
	The city airport is known for congestion with peak hours routinely witnessing delayed take-off. Airlines struggling to maintain on-time performance have, however, begun nosing ahead of time on some days, thanks to the new rule of check-in counters closing 45 minutes before departure. Boarding now needs to be completed 15 minutes before take-off.        
	According to airport officials, pilots seeking clearance for take-off even as passengers are boarding is one of the main causes of clustering on the runway. This usually takes place between 5 and 7am, 9.30 and 11.30am, 4 and 6pm and 7 and 8pm, when 20 to 25 flights take off on an average.

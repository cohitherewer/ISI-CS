The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Newborn found in toilet
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Newborn found in toilet
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A newborn was found inside the womens toilet in the emergency ward of Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital around 10am on Friday.        
	The male baby, weighing 2.35kg, has been admitted in the paediatric department of the hospital. The baby has no health problems, said doctors.        
	We alerted police. If no one claims him in 15 days, he will be sent to a government home, said L.K. Ghosh, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of the hospital.         
	The mother probably severed the umbilical cord with a sharp instrument after giving birth and then tied the part attached to the baby in a knot to prevent bleeding, he added.

          OUR BUREAU                                            
	The silence in the hospital room was broken by the wail of Saurav Bariks parents when they saw their only child lying lifeless on a bed.        
	The 25-year-old Barik had set out from his Ichhapur home in North 24-Parganas in the morning for his office, Rawat Engineers Pvt. Ltd, on the fourth floor of Stephen Court.        
	His parents had heard about the fire but had no clue that their son had jumped from his office in an attempt to save himself.         
	Barik suffered multiple injuries in the fall and was rushed to the Mission of Mercy Hospital where he was declared dead.        
	Our only son is gone and we have nothing to live for, cried father Sailen, a defence ministry employee. Mother Kavita almost choked on her tears after seeing her sons body.        
	A friend of Saurav had called the parents and asked them to come to the hospital. The couple, instead, rushed to Park Street and were frantically searching for their son. They turned up at the hospital only in the evening.        
	I cant believe he has met with such a fate. I spoke to him in the morning, said Sauravs childhood friend Amit Kumar Dey, who was trying to console the bereaved parents.        
	Pradip Kumar Chokhany, also an employee of Rawat Engineers, died of brain haemorrhage he had suffered after jumping from the fourth floor. Doctors at the Mission of Mercy Hospital said the 40-year-old Khardah resident had also suffered asphyxiation.        
	I was in Howrah when I heard the news and rushed to the hospital, said Shankar Chokhany, Pradips cousin. I cant believe that I wont see him any more, said Shankar.        
	Chokhany is survived by his wife, eight-year old boy and six-year old girl.        
	Shruti Bansal, 45, is the third employee of Rawat Engineers who died in the blaze. Shruti was also a co-owner of the firm, opened by her father Pradip Rawat.        
	She jumped through a window of her office and was rushed to Columbia Asia Hospital in Salt Lake, where she was declared dead. She had suffered multiple injuries, said a hospital official.        
	The Bansals 14th-floor apartment on Shakespeare Sarani was deserted on Tuesday. A maid said Shrutis husband Suyesh had died last year. The couples only son Surit has been pursuing higher studies in London since last September.        
	Shruti used to come to office quite often. Who knew a tragedy like this will strike our family, said the womans uncle D.D. Rawat, a partner of Rawat Engineers.        
	Vivek Upadhyaya, 30, an employee of a call centre on the fourth floor of the building, leaped to his death unable to bear the smoke that had filled his office.         
	The Panditia Road resident was taken to SSKM Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. Doctors said he had suffered multiple injuries.         
	We had heard about the fire at Stephen Court and rushed to the site but there was no trace of him on Park Street. We then went to SSKM Hospital, where we heard the devastating news, said a relative.

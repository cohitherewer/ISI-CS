The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Steps to make Setu safer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Steps to make Setu safer
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The government has come up with a speed-limit and a host of other measures in an attempt to regulate traffic on Vidyasagar Setu, where five people died after a trailer smashed into their car standing at the toll plaza on Tuesday evening.        
	Metro had on Thursday highlighted a series of traffic management flaws  including the lack of a speed-limit and dedicated bays for goods vehicles  that had reduced the showpiece bridge into a death trap.        
	As part of the measures to be enforced over the next month, vehicles on the bridge would be barred from travelling at more than 20kmph. There will be separate lanes at the toll plaza for goods carriers and smaller vehicles.        
	To curb speeding, officials have decided to set up two speed-breakers on the approach to the toll plaza.        
	The stretch near the toll plaza has turned into an accident-prone zone. We have decided to implement all these measures in a months time, said transport minister Ranjit Kundu, who visited the accident site on Thursday.        
	The driver of the trailer responsible for Tuesdays fatal mishap was arrested on Coal Dock Road in the port area early on Thursday.        
	Officials said lanes 1 to 4 at the plaza would be marked for vehicles bound for Kona Expressway, and 6 to 8 for those on their way to Andul Road.        
	Goods vehicles will be routed through lanes 1, 2 and 6, while cars will cross the plaza through alleys 3, 4, 7 and 8. Lane 5 has been reserved for two-wheelers bound for Kona Expressway as well as Andul Road. To tackle the chaos, the lanes will be marked 100 metres ahead of the plaza.        
	Metro had reported that several lights on the bridge were not working and some of the stretches were so dimly lit that one could not see the road in front.        
	Officials said the toll plaza would have a generator to ensure that all lights were on even during a power cut.        
	A well-lit toll plaza will alert drivers from a distance, said a transport department official.        
	There was, however, no word on replacing the malfunctioning lights on the Setu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power minister in the dark
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Power minister in the dark
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Frequent power cuts forced this Salt Lake student to study by candlelight during the HS exam                                  
	The government is not in a position to set a deadline to meet the surging summer demand for electricity, power minister Nirupam Sen said on Friday         
	I am hardly in a position to comment on the future of the power situation in the state as I assumed charge of this department only a few months ago. But I admit that the growing gap between demand and supply of power, especially during summer, is a matter of concern for us, Sen said at an interactive session on Friday evening.        
	The minister referred to a new thermal power plant in Katwa and a few coal-based units  two at Sagardighi and one each at Bakreswar and Durgapur Projects Ltd  as well as a hydel project in Darjeeling, but parried questions on generation of power at these centres.        
	The gap between supply and demand has widened in the past few years with the demand growing at more than 8 per cent per annum but the supply remaining static at the 2008 level.        
	A number of unavoidable circumstances are hindering whatever plans we have. The situation will improve, said the minister.        
	Asked how long it would take the state government to generate enough power to meet the demand, Sen said: It is very difficult to give such a date now.        
	The power situation in the city during the day worsened compared with Thursday, when a drop in demand resulted in uninterrupted supply.        
	CESC-served areas faced a shortfall of around 50MW during peak demand while areas supplied by the state utility reeled under a deficit of around 225MW.        
	Power cuts added up to 30 minutes in the CESC areas and up to two hours in the rest of the state.        
	The peak demand in Calcutta hovered around 1,570MW while that across the state crossed 3,940MW.        
	Hope of a relief from the swelter was dashed as the predicted Norwester gave the city a miss.        
	Though some parts of south Bengal received rain accompanied by a thunderstorm over the past 24 hours, the city and its neighbourhood were denied relief despite a favourable forecast.        
	There was a forecast for thundershowers but nothing happened in the city. The neighbouring districts did get some rain. The thundercloud cell that had formed spent itself before reaching the city, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Norwester activity is expected over the weekend as the weatherman forecast a partly cloudy Saturday with rain or thundershowers towards the evening or night.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two persons died of electrocution and two others were injured in a Baghajatin house on Thursday.        
	Sarojubala Das, 70, and her son Swapan, 50, died after touching an iron clothesline that came in contact with an electric wire.         
	Sarojubalas daughters-in-law, Chitra and Ratna, were injured when they tried to detach the wire from the mother-son duo.        
	Police said Sarojubala was brushing her teeth at 6.10am in the courtyard when she touched an iron wire used for hanging clothes out to dry. One end of the wire came loose and got entangled with an electric wire jutting out of a switch board.        
	Power surged through the clothesline and Sarojubala fell on the ground with a thud, but still in contact with the wire.        
	The sound alerted Sikha Halder, a tenant, who raised an alarm. Swapan feared that his mother might have suffered a heart attack and tried to raise her, getting electrocuted in the process. Both were taken to MR Bangur Hospital where they were declared dead on arrival. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem, said an officer of Jadavpur police station.        
	Neighbours said as the two lay on the courtyard, Swapans wife, Chitra, and his sister-in-law, Ratna, tried to remove the wire. Both were injured.        
	Later, the neighbours switched off the main switch. Ratna has been admitted to a nursing home, while Chitra was released after treatment, the officer added.        
	Ticket booking: Eastern Railway has decided to keep all satellite reservation offices open on Sundays and nominated holidays from July 11 to August 15 to allow passengers to book tickets for pujas. The offices will remain open on July 11, 18, 25 and August 1, 8 and 15.        
	Traffic blocked: Around 60 students of AJC Bose College blocked AJC Bose Road on Thursday afternoon for 20 minutes alleging that cops had misbehaved with one of their students who was not wearing a helmet while driving. Police said the youth was prosecuted for driving without a helmet.

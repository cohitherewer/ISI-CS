          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Overloaded goods carrier, which are now only fined and allowed to go, will soon have to offload the excess items, transport minister Ranjit Kundu said on Thursday.        
	Errant transporters will be responsible for offloading and removing the offloaded goods. If they fail to do so, the vehicles and the goods will be seized, Kundu said.        
	He was speaking after a meeting called to finalise the crackdown on overloaded goods carriers, to be launched next week, and regulation of pool cars.        
	The meeting was attended by chief secretary Ardhendu Sen, home secretary Samar Ghosh, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, state police chief Naparajit Mukherjee and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	The initial drive will continue for at least a fortnight and be restricted to three or four zones. The government also decided to invite applications for permits for pool cars through advertisements. Vehicles will be issued permits for commercial use after they pass safety checks, Kundu said.

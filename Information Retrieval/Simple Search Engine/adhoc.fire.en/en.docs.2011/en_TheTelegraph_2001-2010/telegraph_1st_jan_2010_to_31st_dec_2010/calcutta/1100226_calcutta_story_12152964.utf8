          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	A few residents of a housing estate off VIP Road were attacked by goons on Thursday allegedly at the behest of the promoter of the complex.        
	Police said residents of Indraprashtha Housing complex in Kaikhali lodged a complaint alleging that they had been beaten up for opposing promoter Ashok Pansaris plans to lay a road through the complex.        
	Pansari wants to make a passage through our complex for trucks to carry building material to another of his project sites, said M.K. Akhter, the secretary of the residents forum at Indraprashtha, which has 220 flats.        
	At 11.30am, some residents objected to workers pulling down parts of the boundary wall. Around 20 goons, some of them engaged in supplying building materials in the area, started abusing and attacking us, said one of the residents.         
	We had just returned from Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality. The sub-divisional officer of Barasat has directed that the work be halted till the matter is resolved, said another resident.        
	Pansari refuted the charges. Though we have sold the plots, we have retained the right to make a passage through the complex, he said.        
	Holi special: Eastern Railway will add an additional coach to the Up and Dn Ganadevata Express, Sahid Express and Hool Express between February 27 and March 1 for Holi.

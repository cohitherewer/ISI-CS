The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: safe path to school
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wanted: safe path to school
  - Abducted childs mom raises single-parent concerns          KINSUK BASU                                          
	Her daughter is back home safe and the culprits are behind bars, but theres no escape from anxiety for the single mother who spent 36 hours cursing herself for recruiting a woman she barely knew as her six-year-olds school escort.        
	What next? was the question on the 40-year-old working womans lips when Metro caught up with her in her north Calcutta residence on Friday, a day after police rescued her abducted daughter from Tarapith in Birbhum district.         
	This incident has yet to sink in  that my daughter could be abducted on her way to school, and by the person I trusted her with. But for her quick rescue by the police, I dont know what I would have done. I am happy, very happy that my daughter is back without a scratch but, honestly, my worries about her safety have increased. I really dont know how to send her to school. I just know she would have to rejoin school and that too, very soon.        
	There are many working mothers like me who appoint escorts for their children. But now I am not too sure if this is the best possible arrangement. I guess it makes sense to form a group of children from one area going to the same school and have a common escort (as suggested in Metro on Friday) to cut down the risk.        
	My daughter could be abducted so easily because she was alone with this woman I had employed only a day earlier. When I recruited Soma (Kundu), there was no reason at all to suspect her. She seemed to be a dependable person....Now, I am very wary of sending her with an escort. I feel it isnt safe to leave her alone with anybody for that matter.        
	The good thing is that my daughter is very spirited. The abductors, I am told, had sedated her several times. So I took her to a doctor on Friday morning. The drowsiness is gone, and she seems fine now. I have the officers of Calcutta police to thank for reuniting us; for that moment when she jumped into my arms again....        
	But being a single mother, my problems are far from over.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Bound by bonds of creativity

	A cocktail of Tagore, bhatiali songs, flute and Indo-US bonding marked the end of the 11th International Education Week at the Lincoln Room of the American Center on November 19.         
	The education week, an annual event, was organised by the United States India Educational Foundation (USIEF), in collaboration with the American Center from November 15 to 19. The theme this year was International Education: Striving for a Sustainable Future.                        A little girl enjoys herself at a play area during Eduworld Kolkata, a three-day education fair organised in association with The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS), on the Milan Mela grounds. The fair provided parents with information on schools in the city. It also organised parent counselling sessions and seminars on corporal punishment.

	Through the week, USIEF held a series of events like creative arts and poster competitions, quiz, seminars and an interactive session on student visas and education abroad.         
	A cultural programme was slated for the final day. It was inaugurated by the US consul-general, Beth Payne, who felt that creative expressions enrich the level of interaction among Indian and American students.         
	And the evening turned out to be an enriching experience for the audience, indeed. It started off with a flute recital by Eric Fasser, an artist from Brooklyn who is also associated with Mentaid, Calcutta.         
	Sohini Das, the programme coordinator of USIEF, paid tribute to Rabindranath Tagore with beautifully choreographed dances to Rabindrasangeet like Bhalobashi bhalobashi and Aro aro prabhu.         
	Tagore poems were recited alternatively in English and Bengali by Jordan Pleasant and Subhalakshmi Nandi.        
	While the performances were on, Emily Schantz, an artist from Goshen College, Indiana, brought out the flavour of Calcutta through her impromptu sketch.         
	Next in queue was Debaprasad Chatterjees rendition of folk songs. The professor of sociology of Maulana Azad College presented bhatiyali songs. His daughter Dutyi sang a solo. But the best was the father-daughter presentation of the popular song Sohag chaand bodoni.         
	The little girl stole the show, gushed Kamalika Bhowmick, a teacher of Delhi Public School, New Town, after the performance.         
	The final performance was a recitation of Tagores poem Bashi by Kalachand Seal, a college teacher. At Seals request, Philip recited a translated version of the poem.

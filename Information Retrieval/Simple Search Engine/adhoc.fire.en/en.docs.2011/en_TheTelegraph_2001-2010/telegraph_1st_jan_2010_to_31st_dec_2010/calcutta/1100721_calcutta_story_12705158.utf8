The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citu muscles out taxis
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Citu muscles out taxis
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The empty taxi stand at Howrah station on Tuesday afternoon. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Citu flexed its muscles to enforce its 12-hour taxi strike on Tuesday, causing inconvenience to commuters at many places in and around the city.        
	Supporters of the CPM-backed labour organisation, in teams of five to 10, stood with bamboo sticks, brickbats and flags at various points in the city, intimidating taxi drivers and commuters alike.        
	Passengers were forced to get off taxis and take other modes of transport. Drivers were threatened with sticks and brickbats. They were told to not ply till the strike was over, said Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association, which has around 14,000 members.        
	Operators said nearly 40 per cent of taxis that plied on Tuesday had to pull over by the road and stay parked till the strike ended at 6pm.        
	Around 32,000 of the 42,000-odd taxis hit the road in the morning. But more than 12,000 could not ply till 6pm, said a member of the Progressive Taximens Association, which has around 10,000 taxis in its fold.        
	The Citu leadership, however, had a different version of the days events. Most taxis did not come out during the strike, which was largely successful, said Citu state secretariat member Debanjan Chakraborty.        
	Priya Bhattacharyya, 25, said she had been refused by by over 20 taxi drivers, forcing her to take a bus and two auto rides to reach Esplanade from her Salt Lake house.        
	The taxis were out but the drivers didnt want to ply. They said they would be beaten up and their vehicles would be damaged if they dared, said the employee of a private company.        
	Citu had called the strike to protest the July 5 assault on a driver, Bolan Pir, who died on Monday. The three key taxi unions  Bengal Taxi Association, Calcutta Taxi Association and Progressive Taximens Association  had not joined the strike.        
	nPump strike: Most of the 1,900-odd petrol pumps in the state are likely to join the day-long strike called by the West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association on Friday to protest the irrational policies of the oil companies. Fuel would be sold only in emergencies and to ambulances and other vehicles providing essential services. Associations said the oil companies had been selling inferior fuel and paying inadequate commission to the dealers.                    
	State consumer affairs minister Naren De would meet representatives of the oil companies and the association on July 29 to resolve the issue.                          
	Transport department officials had on Monday said only those drivers and mechanics who were loyal to Citu would join the strike.

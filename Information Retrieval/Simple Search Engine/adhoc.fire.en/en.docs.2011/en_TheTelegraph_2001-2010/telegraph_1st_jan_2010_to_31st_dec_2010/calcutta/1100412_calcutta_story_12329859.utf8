The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seat of heat and darkness
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Seat of heat and darkness
          MOUBANI CHATTOPADHYAY IS A RESIDENT OF AA BLOCK IN SALT LAKE AND AN HS EXAMINEE FROM BIDHANNAGAR GOVERNMENT HIGH SCHOOL. SHE PENS A PIECE FOR METRO, BY CANDLELIGHT                                            
	The first thing I need to do after my Higher Secondary exam ends on Monday is to go see my ophthalmologist. Every evening, for more than a week now, I have had to sit down to study for one of the most vital exams of my life by the flickering light of a candle.        
	I suffer from myopia since Class V, that too with high cylindrical power. The first point that the doctor had prescribed was never to study in poor light. But I have had to spend the past seven evenings studying by candlelight. After every hour or so, my eyes start to ache and I am forced to take a break.        
	Our troubles began on Friday, April 2, with load-shedding for around an hour. On Sunday, the day before my geography exam, there was no power for four hours at a stretch. We did not even have a hand fan or a candle at home  its Salt Lake, remember?        
	Now, we are scrambling for candles. The other evening I spent 45 minutes hunting for some as all the local shops were out of stock.        
	Our problems are compounded in the dark as we stay close to the Kestopur canal. Mosquitoes swarm in the moment the lights go off; we are forced to keep the windows open because of the heat. What do I do? Guard the flame or kill a mosquito or study?        
	My exam ends on Monday but is there any light at the end of our dark and hot tunnel?

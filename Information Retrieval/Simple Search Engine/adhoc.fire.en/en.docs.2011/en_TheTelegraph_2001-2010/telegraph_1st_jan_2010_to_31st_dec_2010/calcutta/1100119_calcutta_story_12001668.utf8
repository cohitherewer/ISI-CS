	SSKM              
	The anatomy department of SSKM Hospital, which will receive Jyoti Basu rsquo;s body on Tuesday, was being spruced up the day before. Employees said this was the first time since the Dr BC Roy Post Graduate Institute of Basic Medical Science, which houses the anatomy wing on the ground floor, came up in August 2004 that such an extensive clean-up drive has been undertaken. The buildings have been given a coat of paint, the floors wiped clean and the meter rooms cleared of cobwebs. Parts of the footpaths around the hospital gate on AJC Bose Road, through which Basu rsquo;s body is likely to enter, have been relaid.

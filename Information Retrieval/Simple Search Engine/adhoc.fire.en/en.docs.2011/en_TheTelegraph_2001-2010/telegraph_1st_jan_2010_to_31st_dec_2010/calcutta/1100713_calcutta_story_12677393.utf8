                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      New home for Durga
  - Temporary quarters for studio revamp                              (From top) An artisan works on Durga idols at the new address; a part of Kumartuli which has been pulled down for reconstruction. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta                                 
	About 120 artisan families from Kumartuli will sell Durga idols from a new address this Puja  541B Rabindra Sarani, where they have been temporarily sheltered to facilitate the reconstruction of their old quarters in Kumartuli.         
	These families lived on Bhaskar G Pal Street and a part of Bonomali Sarkar Street in Kumartuli.         
	Work for the Puja is on in full swing at the new premises, only a few metres away from Kumartuli. The concrete buildings are a welcome change for the artisans who have so long struggled in their ramshackle studios in Kumartuli.         
	It is very comfortable working here. We dont have to rush for tarpaulin sheets to cover the idols before every shower. Besides, theres much more room to arrange the idols, said Nemai Pal, the president of Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskritik Samity, who is currently working out of the new address.         
	However, the lack of awareness about the place among customers is bothering some artisans. We fear losing out on customers who might not bother to check out the new site, said Sailen Pal, an artisan.

           Autos clog busy roads during peak traffic hours                                                 
	In response to the report Auto writ runs on cop assault stretch, December 13, here are my suggestions for reining in rogue three-wheelers:             
	Educate and sensitise auto drivers about traffic situation in their areas           
	 Slap spot fines of at least Rs 2,500 for breaking traffic rules or put the violator behind bars for seven days           
	 Passengers must learn to value their lives. Instead of penalising drivers, cops should fine passengers who board overloaded autos           
	Any auto that violates traffic rules should be removed from the road for at least a month.           
	Partha Pratim Saha,           
	Address not given                     
	 Autos are responsible for traffic snarls across the city. Police and the administration seem reluctant to tackle the menace. My suggestions to improve the situation are:           
	Passengers, even if they are in a hurry, should not board autos that are not parked properly           
	Cops should be ruthless with errant drivers           
	Fuel should not be sold to auto drivers who flout rules.           
	Asit Kusari,           
	Tollygunge                     
	 Auto drivers often take on more than the stipulated number of passengers and sometimes charge exorbitant fares on the flimsiest of excuses. They misbehave with passengers and even assault policemen. The unions are there to ensure that they get away with anything. Police must take strict action against auto drivers irrespective of which union supports them.           
	Madhabi Banerjee,           
	Madhyamgram                     
	 The auto drivers have a free run because no one hauls them up. They are well aware that they have the backing of both the CPM and the Trinamul Congress. The following steps can be taken to control the three-wheelers:           
	Regular meetings between the transport minister and representatives of the Trinamul-run civic board, Calcutta police and the autorickshaw unions to decide how to keep autos in check           
	Publicity to the rules concerning autos and the penal measures           
	Police must enforce the rules and penalise errant drivers.           
	Amal Ghosh,           
	Address not given                     
	 It is a pity that policemen are being assaulted by auto drivers. The root cause lies in the policing system. Some officers and constables take money from autos and allow the drivers to do whatever they want. As a result even those men in uniform who are honest cannot make the three-wheelers obey the road rules.

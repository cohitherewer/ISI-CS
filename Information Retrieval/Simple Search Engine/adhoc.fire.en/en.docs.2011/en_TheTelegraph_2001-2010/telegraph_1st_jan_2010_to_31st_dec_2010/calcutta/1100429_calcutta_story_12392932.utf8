                All 48 police stations in Calcutta have been put on alert following a central intelligence warning that terror outfit Indian Mujaheedin (IM) could target major markets or crowded places across the city. Soon after the alert reached Lalbazar on Wednesday, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti called upon chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and later met other senior police officers. Cops in plainclothes have been asked to step up vigil. The Special Task Force, too, has been alerted.     A group of 200 demonstrated outside the office of a labourer hiring agency in Salt Lake on Wednesday alleging that the management had left around 70 people stranded in Gabon in Africa. The company had taken around 120 labourers to Libreville in Gabon in September 2009.   he group was supposed to work in a construction site in Libreville. The protesters alleged that the firm exited the contract but did not bother to bring the workers back home.   f the 120 labourers, around 50 had managed to come back on their own in January. Among the rest, the demonstrators said, one had died. Company officials, however, said they had brought back the 50-odd labourers while the rest wanted to stay back. We will make arrangements to bring the others back home, said an official.    The body of a middle-aged man was found in a sack hidden in a bush at Kaikhali, on the northern city fringes, on Wednesday morning. An officer of the airport police station said the body bore several injury marks. Sleuths suspect the youth was killed elsewhere.    The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) will start a soft skill-training course in collaboration with the West Bengal University of Technology in August to enhance the employability of engineering graduates of the university. Barely 25 to 30 per cent of engineering graduates in West Bengal are directly employable, said Aloke Mookherjea of the CII while launching a manual on communication skills and personality development on Wednesday. The four-month course will be open to students of undergraduate engineering courses (computer science and IT) run by the WBUT.     A high court division bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice K.J. Sengupta on Wednesday directed the member-secretary of the state pollution control board to appear before it on April 30 and explain why he had failed to file a report on an electrical unit on Kalikapur Main Road in Kasba. The court, acting on a complaint alleging that the unit was violating sound norms, had asked the member-secretary to file a report. But the official did not do so.    A three-year-old boy, Pronoy Ghosh, was critically injured after being knocked down by a speeding bus on Rishi Bankim Chandra Road in Naihati on Wednesday morning. An officer of Naihati police station said a private bus on route DN5, which was racing another private bus on route 85, ran over Pronoy around 6.30am. The boy was on his way to school with his mother. Residents stopped the bus and beat up the driver before handing him over to police. The boy has been admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.     Several guardians of students of Kamala Girl School, off Southern Avenue, gheraoed the headmistress for three hours on Wednesday morning demanding that the authorities issue a fresh list of books.

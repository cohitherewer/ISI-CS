The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drier days ahead:   Met office
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Drier days ahead:   Met office
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The city will continue to receive scattered rainfall for the next few days but the monsoon deficit is unlikely to be made up in a hurry, weathermen said on Thursday.        
	The low-pressure formation near coastal Orissa resulting in the cloud cover and rain over the past few days is likely to weaken in the next 48 hours.        
	The amount of rainfall in south Bengal will decrease as the low-pressure formation loses its strength, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The weekend, Debnath said, is likely to be drier compared with the rest of the week.        
	The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the rainfall in Calcutta and south Bengal had not been satisfactory in July. The first five days of August werent promising either. Judging by the trend, we cant say August will be any better, an IMD official told Metro.        
	The monsoon deficit so far in south Bengal is 30 per cent. The July deficit in the city was 28 per cent. According to the IMDs long period average, the city should receive 328.8mm of rain over 17.2 rainy days in August.        
	The IMD official said the city needed prolonged spells of heavy rain or thundershower  instead of the localised or scattered rain of the past few days  to compensate for the deficiency.        
	The weatherman said Friday was likely to be generally cloudy, with possibility of rain or thundershower.

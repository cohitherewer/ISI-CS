                      Power of design                    Effective communication design services provide orientation, ensure legibility and aid recognisability, and thus serve an important function in our daily lives. Ideally, they help us to understand information intuitively, so that we automatically go the right way and instantly recognise the products we seek. Featuring around 150 examples of this practice, the exhibition The Dimensions of the Plane shows how good communication design helps us to navigate our way through the information jungle. It showcases the full strength and scope of two-dimensional communication design services of Germany as selected by five acknowledged experts in the field. Works by these mentors  Johannes Erler (corporate design), Mike Meir (graphic design), Joachim Sauter (digital media design), Eric Spiekermann (typography) and Andreas Uebele (wayfinding systems)  are also featured here and thus form the core of the exhibition. Rather than presenting a retrospective of graphic design and visual communication in Germany over the last 100 years, it offers a snapshot view in the beginning of the 21st century, with a few notable exceptions whose formative influences can still be felt today. The focus of the show is on communication design in Germany and, therefore, reflects the cultural specificities of that country. Yet, viewers will soon realise that these communication design services are also highly relevant in an international context.                  Event: An exhibition of contemporary communication design in Germany When: Till March 18; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

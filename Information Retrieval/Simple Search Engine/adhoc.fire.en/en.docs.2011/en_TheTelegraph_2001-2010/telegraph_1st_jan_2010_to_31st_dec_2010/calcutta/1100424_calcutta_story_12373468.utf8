                              Computer training at the Welfare Society for the Blind                            
	Thirty-year-old Keka Roy is waiting expectantly for the result. The visually challenged graduate and a trainee at the Welfare Society for the Blind has appeared for a job interview at IBM.         
	The Welfare Society for the Blind chose an innovative way to host its 40th foundation day on April 14, inviting corporate bigwigs for the job fair organised on its premises on Diamond Harbour Road.         
	The fair was a follow-up of the interaction we had organised with corporate giants a month ago, where we had explained why the visually challenged should be absorbed in the job market. We wanted the bigwigs to observe our trainees at work and assess them, said Jharna Sur, principal of the Society.         
	Three trainees were absorbed by Wipro Infotech after the interaction.        
	Computer training is provided by Jaws (Job Access with Speech), a software for visually challenged users. The Society has 35 computer trainees. The elementary training is a three-month course, followed by a 120-hour course recognised by the special education cell of Jadavpur University.         
	Besides computer expertise, students displayed their skills with the loom and in paper bag-making. They are also provided with mobility training and communicative skills for the job market. The society trains 50-odd people in the 20-35 year age group. The funding comes mainly from private firms and donations.

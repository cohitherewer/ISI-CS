The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City youths in global green network
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City youths in global green network
										      Climate Watch
                              
	A group of young Indians, including Calcuttans, tried to forge global solidarity on actions against climate change in Copenhagen while world leaders bickered about the biggest threat to mankind.         
	Ekta Kothari, a film-maker from south Calcutta, was part of the group of 23 students and young professionals. Trained at the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune, she not only documented various facets of the conference but also took part in youth programmes and demonstrations in the Denmark capital.        
	I have made a seven-minute film on the Sunderbans (The Rising Tide), which was privately screened in Copenhagen, said Ekta.        
	The documentary is part of Project Survival Media, which was launched about six months back.        
	I was in Copenhagen as part of a young journalists network, which again was a part of an Indian youth climate network. The world leaders furthered their own agendas and stuck to their respective positions and could not achieve anything. But thousands of youths who came to Copenhagen could at least stress that one could not negotiate on the existence of the world, and climate change is more a moral than a political issue, she added.        
	Her partners in the climate crusade included Aniruddha Sharma, who is pursuing a masters in statistics and informatics at IIT Kharagpur. I have been working on environment matters for over a year. I went to Copenhagen to track climate policy and attended high-level delegation meetings, he said.        
	This was the first time that the UN recognised youth NGOs as a formal part of climate negotiations. About 2,000 youths from various countries attended the Copenhagen conference.

	Indian films inspired by climate change could soon release at a plex near you, if Rahul Bose has his way.           
	 ldquo;Everything is a bit delayed in India. I expect scripts revolving around climate change to be ready in another six to eight months and the first such film to be released in 2011, rdquo; said Rahul on the sidelines of the Copenhagen summit when asked why such films were not made in India. ldquo;I definitely want to be a part of such a film when it is made, rdquo; the actor added.   
	Rahul, who has been campaigning on environment issues over months, was critical of the Indian delegation not raising the Sunderbans issue at the summit though millions of residents have been affected by climate change and the lives of many more are at stake.   
	Rahul spent time in the Sunderbans while shooting for Aparna Sen rsquo;s The Japanese Wife.       JAYANTA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safety sieve at cop barracks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Safety sieve at cop barracks
          KINSUK BASU                          The unprotected entrance to the New Market police station. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Calcutta police have kept their barracks porous despite the top brass ordering extra protection to prevent a rerun of the Shilda massacre in which Maoists made sitting ducks out of cops.        
	A visit to some of the barracks in town barely 10 days after the incident at Shilda, in West Midnapore district, revealed callousness and complacency in equal measure. Amaader ekhaney ei rokom-i choley (this is how we function), said a cop caught napping in the virtually unprotected barracks at Hare Street police station.        
	Metro picks holes in the bandobast  or the lack of it  in the barracks attached to police stations in the heart of the city days after Lalbazars supposed security shake-up.              
	Rulebook: Restricted entry to barracks with all visitors, including police personnel who are not inmates, being frisked.        
	Reality: Entry was unrestricted in each of the barracks Metro visited with the ones attached to New Market and Park Street police stations being among the most accessible. Anybody could walk in and out of these barracks without being noticed, leave alone questioned.        
	Rulebook: Armed sentries at the entry points round the clock to restrict visitors and check the identity documents or visitors passes of those coming to the barracks         
	Reality: No uniformed guards at the entry to any of the barracks. Nobody would stop a new visitor or even ask for an identity card. At New Market police station, plainclothes policemen sat near the landing of the staircase leading to the first-floor barracks, unmindful of who was entering or leaving the place.         
	Rulebook: CCTVs at all barracks        
	Reality: If CCTVs were in place and the footage shown to the top brass who brainstormed on security in the barracks following the Shilda attack, they would have known how outsiders have turned these into civilian messes. An inmate of the New Market police station barracks said civilian friends or relatives of cops regularly have lunch or dinner at the mess. Some even stay the night.         
	Rulebook: Iron gates with sturdy locks and alarm system         
	Reality: None of the surveyed barracks has an iron gate. At Park Street police station, anyone can walk in through the main door and take the flight of stairs leading to the barracks without being stopped once. Sources said some people visit the barracks regularly to watch television. Why do we need an iron gate or an alarm? We dont fear our friends, said a nonchalant cop.

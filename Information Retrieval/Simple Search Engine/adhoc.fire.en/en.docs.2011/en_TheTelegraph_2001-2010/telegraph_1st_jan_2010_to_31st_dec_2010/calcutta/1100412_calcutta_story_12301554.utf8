The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Azad push to hospital plan 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Azad push to hospital plan 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Ghulam Nabi Azad at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital                                   
	A prod from Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad last month has finally given the much-needed momentum to the Rs 150-crore upgrade of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital that has missed two deadlines and is running behind schedule by more than a year.        
	Upgrade work, which had slowed down considerably, has gathered pace since the ministers visit, said Utpal Dutta, the principal of the medical college. The two buildings coming up as part of the project will be ready by July, after which work on the super-speciality building will start.        
	It would take another two years for the super-speciality building to be operational.        
	Azad, along with his junior minister Dinesh Trivedi and state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, visited the hospital on March 6 and enquired about the delay in the implementation of the project.        
	The Union health minister was told that a dispute over payment between the contractor, HSCC, and the implementing agency, Unit Construction, was one of the reasons holding up the project. Azad then talked to both parties in an attempt to get the dispute resolved.        
	The project, aimed at upgrading the medical college and hospital to the level of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, was scheduled to be over by January 2009.        
	The deadline was later deferred to June and then to March 2010. But a payment dispute between the contractor and the implementing agency forced further delays, said an official. This led to an escalation in the project cost from Rs 100 crore to Rs 154 crore.        
	The Centre is contributing Rs 100 crore for the project.        
	One of the two four-storeyed buildings coming up on the campus will house the outpatients department while the other will be used for academic activities.        
	Once the new OPD building is unveiled, the existing one will be demolished and a nine-storey super-speciality building will come up in its place, said Dutta.        
	The authorities have identified a plot on the hospital premises for setting up a regional cancer institute. An architect will soon be appointed to prepare the design of the cancer institute, which will be on the lines of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, said an official.         
	The hospital has applied to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for approval for its nuclear medicine set-up.

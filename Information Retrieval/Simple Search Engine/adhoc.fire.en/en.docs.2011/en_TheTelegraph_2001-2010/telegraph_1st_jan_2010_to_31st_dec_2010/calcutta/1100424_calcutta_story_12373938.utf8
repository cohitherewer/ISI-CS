The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Battered Peerless opens doors
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Battered Peerless opens doors
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Peerless Hospital on Friday re-opened its outpatient department and emergency ward that had borne the brunt of a mob attack on April 13.         
	Thirty-eight patients were also admitted to the indoor departments on Friday, 10 days after a 200-strong mob of local residents had wreaked havoc on the hospital for allegedly turning away an accident victim for lack of funds.         
	The vandalism had forced the management to suspend admission of patients.         
	We started the repairs immediately after the attack and have been able to restore most of the facilities damaged by the mob, said Sudipto Mitra, the medical superintendent of the hospital.         
	Over 300 patients attended the OPD on Friday and 100 patients are being treated in the wards at the moment, Mitra added.         
	He said the hospital authorities were getting in touch with patients they were forced to turn away after the mob attack.         
	Mitra, however, added that the hospital would require another month and a half to complete all the repair work.        
	Our losses have crossed Rs 1 crore. But the actual figures are much higher  we lost out on a lot of business as we could not run the OPD and had to stall admissions for the past 10 days. We also lost a lot of data as our computers were broken and documents burnt in front of the main gate, said Mitra.        
	Police had picked up 13 people on the day of the attack from a nearby locality, Shahid Smriti, following a complaint by the hospital. They were later released on bail.         
	The cops have made no further arrests for the attacks on two hospitals on April 13. Investigations are on, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said on Friday.

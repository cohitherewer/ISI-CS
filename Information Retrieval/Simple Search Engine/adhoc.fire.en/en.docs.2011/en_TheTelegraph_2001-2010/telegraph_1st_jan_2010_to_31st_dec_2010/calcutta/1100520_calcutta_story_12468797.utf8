The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Foul air
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Foul air
                                          
	Four auto-emission testing centres Metro visited on Wednesday were closed, following a pollution control board order asking 11 such centres to stop issuing fitness certificates as they were operating with defunct gadgets. Board sources said the other blacklisted centres, too, did not open shutters.        
	With each centre issuing around 30 pollution under control certificates in a day, the board order would, on paper at least, prevent close to 300 vehicles daily from polluting the air armed with fake papers.

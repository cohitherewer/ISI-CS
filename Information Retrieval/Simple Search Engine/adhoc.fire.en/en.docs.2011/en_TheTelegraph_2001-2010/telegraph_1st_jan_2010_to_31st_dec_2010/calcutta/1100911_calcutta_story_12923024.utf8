Murali Karthik, Franz Beckenbauer amp; Virginia Madsen  You are religious and philosophical. You are attracted to those who are creative. You come up with innovative solutions. You love to socialise. Stand up for yourself if you know what you are doing is right. Be patient in your dealings with the authorities and never be upset with minor setbacks.

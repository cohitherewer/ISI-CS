                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Back to the books
 							       iPods, mobiles, digital cameras and the Internet mdash; tech-savvy kid have options galore to wean them away from books. But through multiple reading activities, schools are trying to woo them back to the printed word, says Jhinuk Mazumdar                                   (Top) The pre-primary section library at The Heritage School has car-shaped book racks to lure the children.

	The technological invasion has brought a certain bend in the reading habits of children, agreed Malini Bhagat, principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School. Children are more inclined to the audio-visual medium and this, in turn, is hindering their imagination and almost everything for them is technologically oriented.        
	The Heritage School, with five libraries, tries to promote reading through a gamut of library activities  like writing book reviews and story telling. An overnight reading camp in the school was a successful formula. The children stayed overnight in school and read out to each other and wrote stories, beamed Seema Sapru, principal, The Heritage School.         
	The pre-primary library, with car-shaped racks and comfortable mattresses thrown in, attracts the toddlers to pick up books. At this age, they cannot start serious reading. But the idea is for them to pick up books and glance through them, which will inculcate the habit of reading from childhood itself, she said.         
	At Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, the involvement of parents is a driving force. A worksheet is given every two weeks to the students, in which a parent has to fill in the names of books that he/she has read along with the child during that period, and the interaction. The parent must be there along with a child while reading, so that the support and encouragement that they get makes the entire process interesting for the child, says Anjali Chopra, headmistress of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy.         
	At Delhi Public School, New Town, one day in the year is earmarked DEAR (Drop Everything and Read), applicable to the entire school. Besides, for the pre-primary, set, there is circle time every week, where teachers read out stories. Workshops are conducted for the seniors.         
	At Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan, besides reading books, the school encourages reading newspapers. Everybody has to read a newspaper and anybody from any class can be called in to recall the days main headline in the assembly. This develops both the habit of reading and it also keeps students abreast with current affairs, said Sunita Sen, principal of the school.         
	At MB Girls, the formula to get them to the books also hones their creative writing skills. For the middle-school children, the librarian gives them two paragraphs and they are asked to complete the story in a week as they comprehend it, said Bhagat.         
	Even the bookstores engage in a lot of activities and not just stash their racks with books. Both Oxford Junior and Starmark organise story-telling sessions and book launches. Oxford Junior, in the recent past, has launched childrens books like the Woofus series, Chinku and the Wolfboy, and have also conducted interactive sessions with Australian authors Alison Lester and Michael Panckridge with an aim to generate and sustain interest for books among children.         
	There is also a change in reading habits. There is a certain blurring of preferences within different age groups. The publishing industry is responding to cater to the need. Fairy tales, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and similar adventure series were the favourites but nowadays, there is a lot of choice in reading, such as the Harry Potter series and graphic novels. Most of these books translate into major movie screenplays, which more often than not drives children to read the original books as well, said S.N. Mishra, COO, Apeejay Oxford Bookstores.         
	However, Indian authors are also very popular among schoolchildren now. Be it literary fiction like Jhumpa Lahiri or Amitav Ghosh or popular fiction like Chetan Bhagat, children are picking them up, said Gautam Jatia, CEO of Starmark.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | German giants in luxury car race
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      German giants in luxury car race
          ANASUYA BASU                            The Mercedes C Class and (below) the BMW 5 series have sold well in the city                                 
	The race between German luxury wheels will hot up in the city next year. Mercedes and BMW, which finished neck and neck in the 2009 sales charts, are pulling out all stops to zoom ahead in 2010.         
	While the Beemer starts the year in front with 120 cars rolling out of its showroom in 2009, Mercedes is not far behind after selling 103 units, according to market sources.        
	Both marques are slated to launch a slew of models at the Auto Expo in New Delhi, starting on Wednesday, that would fuel the fight for the Calcutta market.        
	The third German giant, Audi, is scheduled to join the fray in the second quarter.        
	We sold over a 100 units in 2009 and hope to do much better in the new year. We have already booked 15 cars, said Hiteswar Singh of Interkrafts, the sole Mercedes dealership in the city. It would open a second and much larger showroom on the Bypass in the second half of the year.         
	BMW, which followed the Merc into Calcutta in 2008, notched up the 100-mark in September, before its rival. The best-sellers from the Beemer stable are their 5 series and 3 series. Both sell in equal numbers and contribute about 70 per cent of the sales, said a source.        
	Merc sold 53 units of the C Class and 36 of the E Class, its bread-and-butter vehicle.        
	Mercedes CEO Wilfred Auburn said: The ninth generation E Class (W212) came to the market in October last year with a very competitive price of Rs 46,98,000. We hope to see a surge in our figures this year. Plus the Mercedes has lined up the countrywide launch of some superlative vehicles on Monday.         
	Calcutta has also witnessed a rising demand for CBUs that attract 110 per cent import duty and carry price tags more than Rs 60 lakh. While the BMW X3 and X5 along with its 7 series and the 650i convertible make up 30 per cent of the sales in the city, its latest launch, the Z4 roadster priced at Rs 65 lakh, has also found takers in Calcutta.        
	Mercs S Class, its luxury salon, found five buyers. Nine CBUs, including M Class, SL63 AMG and E350 CDI models, were also sold in the city last year.

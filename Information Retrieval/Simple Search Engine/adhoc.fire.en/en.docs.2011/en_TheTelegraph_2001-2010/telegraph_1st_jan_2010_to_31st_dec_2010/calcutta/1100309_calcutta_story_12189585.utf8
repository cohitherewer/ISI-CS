                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rs 14cr upgrade for Nimtala burning ghat

	The Centre has prepared a Rs 14-crore upgrade scheme for the Nimtala crematorium on the eve of the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, who was cremated at the north Calcutta burning ghat in 1941.        
	The project, to be unveiled early next month by Union minister Jairam Ramesh and executed by the civic body, also includes a scheme to beautify the Rabindranath Tagore Memorial in the crematorium compound.        
	According to the revamp blueprint, the crematorium will be shifted to a two-bigha plot to the south of its present location. A two-storeyed building will come up on the plot and house eight electric furnaces on the ground floor. An air-conditioned waiting room will be set up on the first floor.        
	The burning ghat now has four electric furnaces in a single-storeyed building and space to set up eight wooden pyres in an adjoining plot.        
	The burning ghat came up in 1827. The citys population has grown manifold since and we need to set up more furnaces to avoid long queues at the crematorium, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said.        
	The Tagore Memorial will be illuminated with decorative street lamps and the ground around it will be paved with granite. The civic body will also remove obstacles surrounding the Memorial so it could be seen from the adjacent river and Strand Road.        
	The Centre will bear 70 per cent of the project cost of Rs 14 crore under the Ganga Action Plan while the state will cough up the rest.        
	Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy said Rs 2.32 crore would be spent on the beautification of the Tagore Memorial, which will be carried out in consultation with the state heritage commission and the civic heritage panel.

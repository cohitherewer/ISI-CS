The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Die-hard fans terrible loss in teams derby victory 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Die-hard fans terrible loss in teams derby victory 
          SANJAY MANDAL                          Parimal Das with his bandaged right arm in a brace at a city hospital.                                  
	The real loser in East Bengals derby victory last month was not arch-rival Mohun Bagan but die-hard red-and-gold fan Parimal Das.        
	I am fanatical about football and my team but I wish I had not gone to watch that match, 42-year-old Parimal, recuperating from multiple reconstructive surgeries at AMRI hospital in Salt Lake, told Metro of his brush with death during the big-ticket encounter on November 26.        
	Parimal, a resident of Khardah on the northern fringes, was celebrating the first of East Bengals two goals in the middle tier of a gallery in Salt Lake stadium when a crude bomb hurled by someone in the stands exploded on him.        
	I blanked out for a few seconds and woke up to excruciating pain in the stomach region and my right hand. I almost fainted again when I saw my intestines spilling out and my arm almost severed. Only god knows how I survived, recounted bachelor Parimal, who works in a security agency and supports his elderly mother and younger brother with his monthly salary of Rs 3,000.        
	Parimal was on the ventilator for 10 days and has already undergone two major and two minor surgeries. Doctors say he might lose the use of his right arm despite reconstruction.        
	His arm bone had broken into two and the muscles were all ruptured. We have done skin grafting following surgery to repair the damaged bone and muscles, but it will be a while before he can use that arm, if at all, said medical superintendent Rajesh Chatterjee.        
	A team of critical care specialists and doctors are monitoring Parimals condition.        
	Officials of East Bengal Football Club claimed to have visited Parimal in hospital and offered help. Our club colleagues went to the hospital after the match and spoke to doctors about his treatment, said Debabrata Sarkar, a club official. We will surely support him, he added.        
	For Parimal, the thought of not being able to use his right arm again is the scariest part of this never-ending ordeal. The doctors have prescribed some exercises to restore the strength in my arm. I am trying my best to do them despite the heavy bandaging (and steel braces). If I dont recover, there will be nobody to look after my family, he said.        
	Parimals mother Bina is 80 and brother Kamal has been unable to work for more than a year because of a liver ailment for which he underwent surgery.        
	I am paid only when I go to work. I dont know how I will be able to support my mother and brother if I need to stay in hospital any longer, said Parimal, who expects nothing of the administration after hearing from his nephew how he had to rush him to hospital alone.        
	I was battling for life with critical injuries and yet not a single policeman came forward to accompany me to hospital. If my nephew wasnt there with me that day, I probably wouldnt have made it to the hospital alive, he recounted.

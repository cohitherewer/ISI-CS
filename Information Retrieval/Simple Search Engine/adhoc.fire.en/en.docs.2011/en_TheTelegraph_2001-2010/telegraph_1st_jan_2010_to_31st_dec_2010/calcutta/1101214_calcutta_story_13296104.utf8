           Surya Sen revisited: Having watched the Ashutosh Gowariker film Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey, I can say there will be a revival of interest among the masses about Masterda Surya Sen. The film gives an in-depth account of Masterdas life. Both Abhisekh Bachchan and Deepika Padukone have done justice to their roles. Deepika, in particular, has shed her glam-girl image and blended well into the character of Kalpana Dutt.   Priyanka dutta , Nagerbazar                                            
	Whether IPS officers need to play the game at all is debatable (Tennis is a law amp; order game, November 26). Empirically, their association with sport has only brought ruin to the game and themselves too. It is a shame that for their pleasure, fuel is bought with the taxpayers money at a time when the state is moving through a phase of financial belt-tightening. This is nothing but a mockery of the law. Has the chief minister, who is also the police minister, taken note of the incident? Can we expect a disciplinary measure against the erring officers?

	Lawlessness has become a part of the citys culture, whether led by the Red brigade or the green. In the run-up to the Assembly elections, both the political parties seem equally desperate. In this madness, they do not care for the citizens sufferings. No wonder the rally in Salt Lake proved such a huge harassment for the residents (Brigade comes home to Salt Lake, December 10).             
	I hope the Trinamul leadership, seeing the photographs in Metro, would direct the rank and file to maintain decorum and not violate private property.           
	A.S. Mehta,New Alipore                     
	All rallies are a mess and the recent rally at Salt Lake only underlined that. What a place to select for a rally  in front of the AMRI hospital, a silence zone! A party that takes such a decision, I wonder if it would be right to repose any faith in them during the elections. If change should come, it should not just be in the political hue. Instead, it should be a positive change embracing humanism and action over violence and indolence.           
	The Trinamul rally proved one thing: if it comes to power, Calcuttans will continue to encounter the same hazards that they are suffering now.           
	Nothing can  and perhaps ever will  change in Calcutta!           
	Amrita Mallik,Salt Lake                     
	After reading the report (Brigade comes home to Salt Lake), I realised what an ordeal it must have been for the residents of Salt Lake that day. It is a shock for us, who live abroad, to see such an incident happening in our hometown.           
	Anjan Roy,US                               
	As an alumni of Jadavpur University (1959 electrical engineering) I was ashamed to see how an educational institution like JU has become a place for trade union-like activities (Students blink first, eye return to class, December 11). The culture of gherao/strike/demonstration in the factories has been extended to the universities.             
	I am pleased to see that the JU authorities have been courageous enough to take a tough stand this time. This should be the model in all educational institutions.           
	Sunil Kumar Pal, London                     
	Yes, other campus authorities should learn from the JU authorities and act tough. The way the JU administration is acting right now is commendable.           
	Shankha Shuvro Chattopadhyay,Dhakuria                     
	Jadavpur University, a centre of excellence for education, has become the playground of political rowdies. Student organisations like Fetsu have been blackmailing the universitys executive council and dictating terms. No university in the world allows this kind of negative interference by students in the management, administration and security of the university. The university authorities must act tough with such unruly students who not only destroy the academic career of others but also bring a bad name to the institution.           
	Siddharta Ray,Behala Chowrasta                     
	There should be no compromise on education and the future of students. I guess only five to 10 per cent students are creating the problems on the JU campus and because of them the rest are suffering. The university authorities should take a tough stand on this issue. At the same time, I want to reiterate, ragging is a crime. This must be stopped. Guilty students must be rusticated from the institutions and they should not be eligible for admission in any other institution in the country for at least two years.

	In response to the question What steps can you suggest to end the licence-for-a-bribe raj in Beltola?, October 26, I suggest:             
	1. Touts must be eliminated. Only employees should be allowed to enter the PVD building.           
	2. The test must be conducted properly. The PVD man conducting it must be accompanied by a police officer.           
	3. The signature of the police officer and the person conducting the test, with name and designation, must be recorded on the licence for accountability.           
	4. If any employee is found to be in touch with touts or taking a bribe, he must be penalised or sacked.           
	Kabita Roy, Address not given                     
	A licence being issued to an underage driver proves how corrupt the system is. I feel a driver must have some basic education, at least till the secondary level. This should be made mandatory.           
	Tapan Adhikary,Address not given                               
	In response to the question Do you think students can be disciplined like this?, November 10, adding or deducting marks in a subject like Discipline is indeed a novel concept. What remains to be seen is the co-relation between the disciplined behaviour of a student and the marks obtained by him/her at the end of an academic year.             
	Binu Thankappan, Beckbagan                     
	In all my years as the principal of a school in Calcutta, never have I come across such a ridiculous notion on Discipline! Values are learnt from three sources: the childs parents, teachers and friends. These three elements influence the childs behaviour or demeanour. What the schools should introduce is what we call a good standing policy, where reward points are given or taken away for things like attendance and other behaviour. Also, the cane as a way of disciplining students is a thing of the past. Dont even think about it.           
	Geoff Jordon,Address not given                     
	The introduction of a new subject will never make a student disciplined. Discipline starts from home and parents play a vital role in making their wards disciplined. Students will take it as a subject like value education and never put it to any practical use.           
	Dipanwita Roy,Address not given                     
	I appreciate the move by St James School to introducing Discipline as a paper. As an experienced teacher I feel this move will initially set the children thinking and gradually being good will become a habit for them.           
	S. Nayar,Address not given                     
	The plan sounds interesting. However, it appears a little doubtful as to who would supervise all the actions/reactions of the students. What happens when some kids put all the blame on others just to skip the punishment? I think this needs further review.           
	Sandra Clarkson,Address not given                     
	The proposal to include Discipline as a subject is a step in the right direction. But this step alone, if approved and implemented by the school authorities, is not enough to solve the deep-rooted problem. The parents and guardians should come forward to introduce discipline at home and inculcate the idea through words and actions. The problem can be solved only through sincere, active and constant interaction between parents, teachers and school authorities.           
	Shivaji Bharadwaja,Moore Avenue                               
	This is in reference to the report HC bans shooting at botanical garden, December 2. It is good to learn that the high court has directed the Botanical Garden authorities not to allow any social gathering, including film crew. This garden draws a huge number of visitors. Any social function or shooting of a film would erode the beauty of the green hub.

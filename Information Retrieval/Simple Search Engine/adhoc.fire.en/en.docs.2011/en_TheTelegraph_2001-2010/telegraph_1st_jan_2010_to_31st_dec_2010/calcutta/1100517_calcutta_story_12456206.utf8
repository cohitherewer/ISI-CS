The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Phone link snaps in boy kidnap
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Phone link snaps in boy kidnap
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The cellphone from which Howrah child kidnapper Rakesh Singh was negotiating a ransom for the release of his former colleagues three-year-old son was found switched off on Sunday, shortly after cops had traced the call location to Gaya in Bihar.        
	Amans father Pappu Gupta, a Burrabazar trader, has joined a four-member team from Bally police station in Patna in a bid to re-establish contact with Rakesh.        
	Sources said police had advised the rest of the Gupta family in Bally and native state Bihar not to make any more independent enquiries about Aman  erroneously mentioned as a girl in The Telegraph on Sunday  because that might endanger his life.        
	Rakesh, 36, is suspected to have nurtured a grudge against Pappu for a long time, though he never showed it. The duo had worked together in a garments shop before Pappu set up a small business and his colleague and friend returned to his ancestral home in Nalanda, Bihar.        
	We have yet to confirm what provoked the kidnapping but it seems there was a financial dispute between the two former colleagues, said an investigator.        
	Rakeshs brother-in-law Jayananda Singh, in whose house he was staying since arriving in Bally a fortnight ago, is under detention for allegedly playing a role in the kidnap-for-ransom plot.

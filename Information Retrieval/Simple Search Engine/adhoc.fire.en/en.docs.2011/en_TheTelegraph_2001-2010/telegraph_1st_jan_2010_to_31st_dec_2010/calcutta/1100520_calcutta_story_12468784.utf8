                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          City girl makes her mark
  - All in a days work: Calcutta teen aces ISC, wows Buddha          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee congratulates ISC top scorer Sreya Daga on Wednesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                        
	Sreya Daga was awaiting her board results, like any other student, on Wednesday morning, with butterflies in her stomach and a prayer on her lips. Little did she know that the day would bring her a double treat.         
	The commerce student of Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar has scored 98.75 per cent, one of the highest marks in ISC in the country. And in the evening, she managed to meet the chief minister, who congratulated her and even asked about her future plans.        
	I expected to do well but I never imagined that I would score the highest, said the slim girl in a black T-shirt and brown trousers. The second of three sisters, Sreya aspires to become a chartered accountant.         
	Her inspiration came from father Ramesh Kumar Daga, who runs a chartered accountancy firm, and elder sister Richa, who has followed in their fathers footsteps.        
	I have been surrounded by chartered accountants in my family and they got me interested in this career, smiled Sreya.         
	Richa said Sreya would score the highest marks in class throughout school but she wasnt a bookworm.         
	An avid painter, Sreya says she loves making greeting cards. She also likes dancing. But these are just hobbies, she explained.        
	Mother Suman and grandfather Jamunadas couldnt have been more proud of the 18-year-old, who has set her sights on studying BCom at St Xaviers College. She plans to pursue CA simultaneously. She can do her internship at her fathers firm. But whether she will eventually join the company depends entirely on her, said Suman.         
	Sreya, who lives in a joint family with uncles and aunts at their Phoolbagan home, names mathematics and economics as her favourite subjects. She took tuition only in these two subjects, she says.        
	After the chance meeting with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at a TV studio, Sreya gushed: I still cant believe I met him. The chief minister asked me my name and wanted to know where I wanted to study next. He also wished me luck for my future.        
	But the future can wait; the only thing the eager teen can think of right now is celebrating the day with her family.

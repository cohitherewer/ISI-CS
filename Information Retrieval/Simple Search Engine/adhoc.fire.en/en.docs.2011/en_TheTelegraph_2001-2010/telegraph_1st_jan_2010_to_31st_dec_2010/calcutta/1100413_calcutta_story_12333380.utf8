The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Humidity adds to heat horror
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Humidity adds to heat horror
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	The scorcher in the districts has claimed its first victims while the city continues to wilt under the twin assault of heat and power cuts.        
	The high humidity over the past few days, however, has kindled hopes of a Norwester that may bring some respite, however brief, from the scalding heat.        
	A 40-year-old unidentified man died at Bankura Medical College and Hospital on Sunday night after suffering from heat-stroke symptoms. The man had suffered severe dehydration and cramps, said a hospital official.        
	On Saturday, a youth identified as Sanjay Bauri fell ill while travelling by train in Purulia. He was admitted to a health centre at Kustaur where he later died.        
	Closer home, at Liluah, a 55-year-old state government employee, Sanat Kumar Bramha, died of heart attack while standing in a queue for autorickshaws under the scorching sun on Sunday.         
	In the city, the maximum temperature on Monday climbed down to normal for the first time in a week but high humidity, between 89 and 59 per cent, pushed up the discomfort index.        
	Temperatures have fallen because of higher humidity. Over the next couple of days, the maximum will hover around the normal mark or dip lower but there wont be any comfort because of the high humidity, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The weatherman attributed the rise in humidity to a low-pressure trough across Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa that is sucking moisture from the Bay of Bengal.        
	An official in the India Meteorological Department in Delhi said the high moisture content in the air may trigger Norwesters. There is a good chance of a Norwester hitting the city in three to four days, the official said.        
	While the city was battling the scorcher, large parts reeled under power cuts adding up to three hours as CESC resorted to 240MW of loadshedding.         
	Deficit in the state grid necessitated the load-shedding, said a CESC spokesperson. The utility sent out 1,131MW and imported 238MW from the state grid.        
	The situation is expected to improve from late on Monday as the inactive 210MW unit at Kolaghat is back in action, said a power department official.        
	For the eighth consecutive day weve suffered power cuts for several hours. Nobody expects the situation to improve soon, said Dhrubo Nandy, a resident of BH block in Salt Lake. The VIP township has been among the hardest hit by power cuts.

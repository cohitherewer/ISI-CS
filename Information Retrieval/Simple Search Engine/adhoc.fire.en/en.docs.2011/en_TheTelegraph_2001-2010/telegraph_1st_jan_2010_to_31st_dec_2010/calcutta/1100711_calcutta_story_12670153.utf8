The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Filmy menu for family
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Filmy menu for family
                                              
	A famous dhaba at Kolaghat offers more than great food. Part of the spread is the menu, which is very thoughtfully written. It is a celebration of life and relationships, and it is laid out neatly, one could say in the chronological order of both meals and lifes great events. The headings are written in chaste Hindi, followed by English subtitles, if in somewhat unorthodox spelling.        
	For the carfuls and busloads of men and women and their families who get down to eat here on their way to Mandarmoni or Digha, the menu makes the spouse and the family look charming. Almost Bollywood. Though the spouse and the family look a little more charming anyway when you are on your way to a holiday.        
	The menu starts with Mausam ka bahar (hot and cold drinks), which mean beverages and fruit juices. Then comes Mulakat (breakfast), with its chart of toast, eggs, alu parathas. It is followed by Biwi ka khuwoyees (The wifes desire).         
	It is quite wonderful, I am sure, for the tired and harassed wives who have packed the luggage from the previous night to suddenly find someone thinking of them. It can move some to tears even, perhaps. When was the last time someone tried to fulfil their khuwoyees, what if it only meant pakoras on the menu, chicken, paneer, egg, vegetable?         
	The wifes desire is followed by Roti ka silsila (tawa) and Roti ka silsila (tandoori). The word silsila can never be thought of without the delicious frisson between Amitabh and Rekha in the film of that same name, and it feels nice to think your bread has been touched with it.        
	Then comes Chawal ki chal, with its suggestion of a manipulative woman, for isnt chal (strategy) a womans domain, from Manthara to Indian television? The presence of a female in-law becomes manifest with Saas ho to aishe (paneer), which is soft and fair, though one thought that these features were required in the bride only.        
	The female in-law, in fact, is a dominant presence. Towards the end of the menu appears Jamai ka najar mithai ki aour (desserts), allowing the man his occasional dalliances. A flirtatious son-in-law is cute. It is followed by Salika nut khut (ice-cream), which includes Fruit and nut.         
	Somewhere along the way, Gaon ke bageeche se (vegetables) and Phool aur kaante (fish) had also materialised as pastoral interludes, perhaps to balance the toxicity of the female relatives. Oh yes, Tandoori items were clubbed under Jalte riste. Fire and smoke and carbon footprints.         
	Though I am still wondering why the goat items were called Bakre ke nakhre (goats tantrums). How would one like the animals best? Unfussy? Even when they are dead? I am even more intrigued by name given to the chicken items: Nasib apna apna (To each his own fate). This is frankly philosophical, for I hope the maker of the menu was not sordid enough to refer to the fate of the birds.         
	Most profound, though perhaps touched with the scatological (the two go very well together), was the description of curd: Sleeping in the night/ morning is the tight.         
	At this point I switched on my camera and photographed every page of the menu. The music in my heart I bore.                                Chandrima S. Bhattacharya

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Designer racks raided by gang
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Designer racks raided by gang
          OUR BUREAU                          Monapali which a gang raided on Thursday.   (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	Monapali, one of the oldest fashion addresses in town, was raided on Thursday afternoon with designer wear worth over Rs 6 lakh being stolen.        
	The flagship Loudon Street store of designer duo Mona Lamba and Pali Sachdeva, not far from the city police chiefs residence, was targeted by a gang of seven posing as customers around 12.30pm.        
	Seven saris, two bridal lehngas (of a Hong Kong-based client that were to be delivered on Thursday) and around 10 tunics were stolen from the shop, said Pali.        
	The ground-floor store which is normally manned by at least three persons was under the sole charge of 20-year-old Chandan Pandit on Thursday. The others had taken the day off.        
	According to Chandan, some members of the gang kept him busy at one end of store while the others went about looting the racks. A man dressed in white shirt and trousers and a woman in a green sari entered the store around noon, selected three garments and began haggling over the price. At this point, three men and two women entered, started picking clothes off the racks and asking about their price, Chandan, a resident of Gariahat, told police.        
	Only after all seven had left without buying anything did I realise that some clothes were missing from the racks, he added.        
	Officials from Shakespeare Sarani police station found loopholes in Chandans statements and put him down as a suspect. Initially he said that the robbers had beaten him and tied him up with a rope before fleeing, said an investigating official.        
	Since the criminals probably knew that only one person was manning the store on Thursday, an insider job cannot be ruled out, said Pali. But Chandan has been working with our store for the past three years, she added.        
	Monapali is one of Calcuttas most celebrated design labels with the sisters having set up shop 25 years ago. They are senior members of the Fashion Design Council of India.        
	City designers were shaken by the raid on Monapali. Designer stores are soft targets, not as heavily guarded as jewellery stores but often housing goods worth lakhs, said one.        
	Star designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee caught the whiff of an inside job as a regular robber is after the cash box rather than bridal clothes.

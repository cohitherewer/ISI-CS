The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Job in the jungle for jumbo trio
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Job in the jungle for jumbo trio
  - Zoo to bid farewell to star elephants this winter; 700km truck journey and new assignment await gentle giants           IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                                      
	Star jumbo trio Mumtaz, Phulwanti and Uttara are set to retire from sedentary zoo duty this winter to take up a challenging field assignment where they would be required to earn their daily chomp patrolling a wildlife sanctuary.         
	Chief wildlife warden S.B. Mondal confirmed on Sunday that the trio would be transported from Alipore zoo to their birthplace north Bengal  700-odd kilometres from Calcutta  by truck later this year in accordance with a central directive banning elephants in zoos.        
	 They will be spending the rest of their lives in one of the 15 sanctuaries of the forest department in north Bengal. I have asked the director of Alipore zoo to make arrangements for transportation. It is the zoos responsibility to ensure that the trio reach their destination safely, Mondal told Metro.         
	Transporting elephants poses a jumbo challenge for zoos with the risks sometimes outweighing the benefits of shifting them to new locations because of their sheer bulk. An Asiatic female elephant weighs up to 5,400kg, with tuskers topping the scales at 6,350kg.        
	Mumtaz, Phulwanti and Uttara  who weigh between 2,000 and 2,200kg  would each be put on a truck with scaffolding to keep them from falling during the long journey to north Bengal, officials said. The estimated cost of transportation is Rs 50,000 each, part of which has already been allotted by the Central Zoo Authority.        
	According to a wildlife expert, transportation of elephants is not only a highly specialised job but also carries high risks. Several countries have very strict guidelines for transportation. You need to get the technical plan approved in advance, follow a drill to prepare the elephant for the journey and get all the required equipment in place, he said.        
	In some countries, elephants even get to fly with insurance cover. An aircraft once carried 10 elephants from Swaziland to an American zoo with a combined insurance of $1.7 million for the 36-hour flight.        
	For Mumtaz, Phulwanti and Uttara, the only luxury will be the services of a mahout each. We dont insure wildlife but we do take special care of them. Our mahouts are very experienced, insisted a zoo official.        
	If not travel by truck, Mumtaz, Phulwanti and Uttara could have walked to north Bengal. An elephant can walk long distances at around 7kmph, which means it would take the trio five days of non-stop trekking to reach their destination.        
	For 60-year-old Mohammed Islam, the senior jumbo keeper at Alipore zoo, the trios departure would mean more than just an empty enclosure.They came here from Jaldapara when they were barely three years old. We have raised them like our children and have become so used to their presence that it will be hard to see them go, said Islam with a heavy heart.

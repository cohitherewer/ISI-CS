The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Quiet vote for PM family
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Quiet vote for PM family
          RITH BASU                          Pritam Kaur casts her vote on Sunday. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Nobody batted an eyelid when Pritam Kaur stepped out of her flat in Radhakrishan Apartment in Parnasree to cast her vote on Sunday morning. But then, to her neighbours, she is not the Prime Ministers sister.        
	We have been living here for 20 years, from before Manmohan Singh became even a minister. People here look at us as their own, said Pritams husband Vidyyarattan Singh on the way to the adjacent polling booth.        
	A neighbour, 38-year-old Bratai Mukherjee, put it best. When I see her (Pritam Kaur), the first thing that crosses my mind is not that she is Manmohan Singhs sister. I am reminded of her grandson Guneet who used to take tuition from my husband.        
	But that changed as soon as the younger of the Prime Ministers two city-based sisters (elder sister Gobind Kaur is in Delhi) stepped inside her polling centre, Parnasree Vidyamandir School.        
	A young policeman tried to click a photograph of her on his cellphone. Overseers and poll agents guided her through the corridor to the correct booth. The presiding officer sprang to attention as soon as she entered the room and kept standing till the 63-year-old homemaker left after casting her vote.         
	Later, she and the older members of the family only said they wanted civic amenities to improve whoever came to power, but the younger members spoke their mind.         
	I just want the Congress to win because that will make my grandfather happy, said Pavneet Singh, the son of Pritam Kaurs elder son Kanwardeep.         
	The Class VIII student at St James School would probably be disappointed with the result in his own ward, 131, where his grandfathers party does not have a candidate.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three men were arrested on Monday for allegedly selling voters identity cards, PAN cards and other documents.        
	Howrah-residents Mohammad Farookh, 49, Mrinmoy Dutta, 45, and Mohammad Ishtikhar, 33, were picked up from a computer centre in Bantra where they allegedly used to forge the documents and sell them for Rs 200 each.        
	Farookh ran the racket. Dutta used to ready the documents with details provided by customers at his computer shop in Bantra. Ishtikhar helped them, said a senior officer of the detective department. Cops seized several fake voters identity cards, silver foils used for making holograms and ration cards from the computer centre.        
	Cops tracked down the three while investigating the men behind a fake Philips India website that was used to dupe several people. The racket was busted on November 17.        
	The money collected from the victims was kept in three accounts at a nationalised bank in Belghoria.        
	All the three accounts were opened by furnishing forged documents made by the Howrah gang, said joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen. The trio arrested on Monday were remanded in police custody till December 13.

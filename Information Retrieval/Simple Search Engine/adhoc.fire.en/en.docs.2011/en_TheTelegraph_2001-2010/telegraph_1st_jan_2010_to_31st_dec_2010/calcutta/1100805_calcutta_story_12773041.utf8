                A power cut for nearly 15 minutes at Writers Buildings on Wednesday afternoon forced chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to hold a meeting with CRPF inspector-general (operations) P.K. Singh by the light of an emergency lamp. Repairs on a transformer led to the power failure, said a senior official of PWD, which looks after the state secretariat.    Ohio-based virologist Kunal Saha wrote to the state medical council on Wednesday pointing out that according to its website, he was dead and his registration had been cancelled. After the council asked registered doctors to update their particulars last year, I had filed an application in February with the details, paying a fee of Rs 550, said Saha. A council official said: If we receive any such letter, we will conduct a probe. Saha had moved the council in 1998 after his wife Anuradha died during a visit to Calcutta because of negligence by four city doctors. The council had exonerated the four but the Supreme Court last year found them guilty of negligence.    nProfessor Bimal K. Roy, a statistician and cryptologist, joined the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta, as its director on August 1.     A Thai Airways Bangkok-Calcutta flight that landed in the city at 1am on Wednesday took a wrong taxiway and had to be towed back to the designated taxiway. Sources said the flight chose the wrong path because of problems with runway lights.    Dulal Chandra Das, 70, was injured after a minibus hit him on Judges Court Road on Wednesday afternoon. He was admitted to SSKM Hospital.     Geetanjali Mukherjee, 38, was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her Sibakrishna Das Lane house in Phoolbagan on Wednesday. A suicide note was found in which she said no one was responsible for her death.    AMRI Hospitals on Wednesday announced plans to increase its beds in eastern India from 560 to 1,400.    Traffic was disrupted on JL Nehru Road, SN Banerjee Road and Shakespeare Sarani on Wednesday afternoon because of a Trinamul Congress rally from Birla Planetarium to Metro channel to protest irregular power supply and hike in power tariff.    Nearly 60 Congress supporters blocked the crossing of Rabindra Sarani and Kali Krishna Tagore Street between 3.10pm and 3.25pm on Wednesday to protest price hike.

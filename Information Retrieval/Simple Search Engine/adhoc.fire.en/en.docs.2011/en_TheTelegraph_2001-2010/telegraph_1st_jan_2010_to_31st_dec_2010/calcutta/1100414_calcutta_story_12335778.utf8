          A STAFF REPORTER                          Family members of two child victims at Peerless Hospital. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	A journey for a holy dip ended in the loss of five lives as the goods carrier in which the group was returning home turned turtle after being hit by a lorry on the Bypass on Tuesday morning.        
	Around 40 residents of Nayapatti and Mahisbathan, under Salt Lake municipality, had on Monday evening set off for Lakshmikantapur in South 24-Parganas to take a dip in a pond whose water they believed could cure ailments.        
	We were all travelling in a Tata 407, said Bhaba Tarafdar, whose 10-year-old son Shonai and father-in-law Baikuntha Mondal were among the five victims.        
	Apart from his daughter and father-in-law, Tarafdar had taken along his wife and other two children  Rupa and Suman. Our journey was cursed. I still cant accept the fact that Shonai and her grandfather are not among us anymore, cried Tarafdar, who runs a small stationery shop in Nayapatti.        
	The other victims were 12-year-old Arati Gayen, a distant relative of the Tarafdars, and a young couple from Mahisbathan  Swapan and Shiela Poddar.        
	We left for Lakshmikantapur on Monday evening and started our journey back home around 3.30am on Tuesday, said Manmohan Mridha, who had taken a dip in the pond once earlier.        
	After the mini-truck in which the group was travelling crossed the Bagha Jatin flyover on the Bypass, a south-bound lorry rammed into it. The mini-truck overturned.        
	Shonai, Baikuntha and Aarti were sitting at the back. The sides of our vehicle got unlocked under the impact of the collision and the three were flung on the road. Swapan and Shiela, too, suffered the same fate, said Tarafdar.        
	Eight others in the group were injured. Three of them were released from Bagha Jatin State General Hospital after treatment while the rest were admitted, said a cop.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Picture in hand, prayer on lips
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Picture in hand, prayer on lips
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mithilesh Sharma shows his daughter Aartis picture on Wednesday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                   
	The search for loved ones continued for many, more than 24 hours after the flames were doused at Stephen Court. Most of them ended up waiting outside the SSKM Hospital morgue after doing the rounds of hospitals and Park Street, picture in hand.         
	Mithilesh Sharma reached Calcutta from Asansol on Wednesday morning with the news that his daughter was inside the Park Street building when it caught fire.        
	Till late on Wednesday, Aarti Sharma, who lived as a paying guest in Gariahat and worked for Wintech PC on the fourth floor, remained untraceable.         
	Mithilesh has been going from one hospital to another with a photograph of his daughter, said a family member.         
	We realised Aarti was missing when the parents of another friend of ours, Prithish Ghosh, who also could not be found, came to our place on Tuesday night, said the girls roommate Mamta Deb.         
	Prithishs father Pankaj visited the SSKM Hospital morgue on Wednesday morning.        
	I have been told that some more bodies have been recovered and they will soon be brought here, said the retired employee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.         
	Prithish called his mother around 2.15pm and could only say, Ma, ami ar parchi na (Ma, I cant bear it anymore). After that we couldnt reach him on his cellphone, said a family member.                     
	The morgue was the last stop for friends and family members of 56-year-old Jaiprakash Jaiswal after they did the rounds of the hospital.         
	The Amherst Street trader was visiting Stephen Court on work on Tuesday.        
	We have been trying in vain to find him since last night, said Jaiswals son-in-law Rocky Gupta.        
	That officials of the morgue were not sure about the number of fire victims inside the morgue prolonged the agony of those waiting outside.         
	They should put up a list outside naming those whose bodies have been identified, said the relative of a victim at SSKM Hospital.         
	Cant the authorities understand our plight? Cant they be a bit more co-operative? said another relative.        
	The search operation at Stephen Court is still on. A large part of the third floor ceiling collapsed. We will clear the debris and find out if anyone is trapped inside, said a senior police officer at Lalbazar police headquarters on Wednesday night.

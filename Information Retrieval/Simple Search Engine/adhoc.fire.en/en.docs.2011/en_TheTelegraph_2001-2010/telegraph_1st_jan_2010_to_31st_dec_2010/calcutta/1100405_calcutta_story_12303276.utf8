                      Inspired by feminine beauty                    Three artists belonging roughly to the same generation come together with their works in Chasing the Muse, the ongoing exhibition of paintings. Dwijen Gupta, Rupchand Kundu and Subrata Chowdhury have been working independently for more than two decades, scaling individual peaks, winning awards, going places, generating new ideas and making it known to the art fraternity that they have a language of their own. Though each artist works within the realistic format, they open up new worlds and invite viewers to look below surface impressions. An obsession with the female form appears to dominate their works, but what the artists try to discover are subtle insights into the mysteries of the feminine body and mind. Rupchand Kundu (a painting by him appears here) tells stories about his women, who are buffeted by the hardships of life yet preserve the inner beauty that comes through in soothing colours. Dwijen Gupta successfully interweaves form and content in the images of his women, whether they evoke a sense of longing and sensuality or remain a lonely figure with suppressed emotions. Subrata Chowdhurys women are charming creations, evoking a soft appeal in gentle shades. His works also tell stories of life, and the narratives expand into diverse shades of social significance.

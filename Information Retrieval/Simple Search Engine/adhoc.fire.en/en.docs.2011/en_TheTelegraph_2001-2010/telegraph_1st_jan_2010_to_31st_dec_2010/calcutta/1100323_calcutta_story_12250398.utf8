                      Reflections of inner life        For Prokash Karmakar, art is a way of recollecting the past.   Some remembrances are deeply personal, others are the   product of dreams while the rest have been taken from the dark  est moments of human history. Though influenced by the Impres  sionist painters and Picasso, his artistic vocabulary reflects life   around him in a visual language that is foregrounded in the na  tive traditions of India. Interestingly, the city constitutes a setting   for his narratives and is represented as a surreal landscape; a   landscape in which surrealist tropes and icons figure in a dis  tinctly modern vision of the urban. Certain motifs serve as com  mon meta-phors in nearly all his works; the horse, the circle and   the woman are the most widely-used. Karmakars representation   of his inner life is linked to the settings of his sexual and social at  titude, eroticism and social politics. In his works, the use of the   erotic becomes a way to portray a particular vision of creation   and the ways in which it operates in a specifically urban context.   Experiments, the ongoing solo show, features some of his recent   works.

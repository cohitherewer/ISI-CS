The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 10 teams to scan buildings 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      10 teams to scan buildings 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Stephen Court on March 23                                  
	The civic body has set up 10 teams to inspect fire-prone buildings in all 15 boroughs of the city.         
	The borough-wise inspections are expected to ease the load on the police-led panel formed immediately after the March 23 Stephen Court blaze that claimed 43 lives.         
	We will focus on fire-safety arrangements in the buildings, without going into the legality of the structures, said Debashis Ghosh, a deputy chief engineer in the building department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Ghosh said the inspection team would mainly focus on buildings taller than 14.5m (usually five or more floors).        
	The teams also include members of the fire department, police and CESC. The aim is to decentralise inspection to ensure that more unsafe premises are covered, said Ghosh.        
	After the Stephen Court fire, a team was formed with representatives of the police, CMC, CESC and the fire department.        
	The team  led by the special additional commissioner of police (II), Banibrata Basu  has inspected 15 buildings and 12 markets in central Calcutta over the past few weeks.        
	The police will find it difficult to inspect all the fire-prone buildings. So, the CMC will head the teams set up for borough-wise inspections, said a senior civic official.        
	He said the CMC-led teams had already started work. Inspections have been carried out in three boroughs  VI, VII and IX, said a CMC official. The areas are Topsia, Park Street and Kidderpore.        
	However, the complete lists of buildings to be visited in each borough are yet to be drawn up. All four departments forming the teams have given their inputs for preparing the lists.        
	The police received several complaints of irregularities after the Stephen Court fire. They have forwarded those complaints to the respective boroughs, said a CESC official.        
	Civic officials said the inspections would be a prolonged exercise. Its very difficult to give the exact number of buildings and the time required to complete the work, said Ghosh.        
	The team will issue notices to the buildings where the inspectors spot violation. We will give them a deadline to make the changes. If the orders are not carried out, action will be taken against those responsible for the upkeep of the buildings, said the civic official.

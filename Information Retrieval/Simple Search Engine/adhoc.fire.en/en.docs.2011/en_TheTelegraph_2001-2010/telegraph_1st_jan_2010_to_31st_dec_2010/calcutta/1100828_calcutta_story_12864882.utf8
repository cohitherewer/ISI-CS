          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A mother of two accused of murdering her former tenant for allegedly having an affair with her husband was traced to Dadar in Mumbai on Friday with a man suspected to be her ex-lover.        
	Majda Khatun, in her mid-thirties, had gone missing since police identified her as the prime suspect in the murder of Mohua Alam, 35, in a Karaya apartment on July 7.        
	The detective department finally found her in the Dadar house of a man named Zakir, her alleged boyfriend from their madarsa days.        
	Majda has confessed to killing Mohua following an argument over her husbands relationship with the victim.        
	Mohua and husband Nur Alam, a health department employee, used to live in Majdas Budge Budge house as tenants till they shifted to a second-floor apartment in Karaya in May.         
	On July 7, Majda turned up at the Karaya apartment to meet Mohua and there was an altercation between the two over an alleged relationship between the victim and the husband of the accused (Mohammed Iqbal). Majda went to the kitchen, picked up a knife and slit Mohuas throat, said joint police commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.         
	A critically injured Mohua managed to call Nur and mumble that she had been attacked.        
	He rushed back home and took Mohua to National Medical College, where she died, an officer said.         
	A slip of paper with the barely legible words Sonia-r ma (mother of Sonia) and the building guards description of a woman in her thirties leaving the flat on the afternoon of the murder helped the cops identify Majda.        
	After committing the crime, Majda contacted Zakir in Mumbai. The duo had studied in the same madarsa and Zakir was happy to give her shelter, said the officer.        
	It is not known whether Majdas husband Iqbal, a part-time taxi driver, was aware of his wifes whereabouts. The couple have two teenaged daughters.        
	Mohua and husband Nur, who has two sons from a previous marriage, had married in Birbhum in 2004.

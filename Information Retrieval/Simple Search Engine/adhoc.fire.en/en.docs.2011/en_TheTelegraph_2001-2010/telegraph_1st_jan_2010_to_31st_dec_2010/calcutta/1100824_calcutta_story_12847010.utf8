                      Art and identity        At a relatively early stage of his illustrious career, P.R. Narvekar realised that apart from creating narratives and describing the here and now, there is another major function of the artist. This lies in creating an essential form that quintessentially grows from the inner consciousness and subconscious of the artist; a concentrated darkness containing the subtle light of the prolonged past of humanity. The uniqueness of such form, along with the unveiling of the inner being of the artist, enlightens a community-oriented identity that acts as a bridge between national and international ideals of beauty and transforms the local into global. This is what the great artists of the world, from Matisse to Modigliani and Abanindranath Tagore to Jamini Roy, did. Narvekars art has a similar lineage of extracting sonorous beauty from the darkened reality all around. The paintings in Transcending Popular, his ongoing solo show, are figurative and human-based. He distorts or transforms the figure rhythmically, or rather extracts rhythm from the essence of civilisation and induces it within his human figures so that they resonate with an inner harmony. This harmonious transformation of human figures is the essence of Narvekars art.

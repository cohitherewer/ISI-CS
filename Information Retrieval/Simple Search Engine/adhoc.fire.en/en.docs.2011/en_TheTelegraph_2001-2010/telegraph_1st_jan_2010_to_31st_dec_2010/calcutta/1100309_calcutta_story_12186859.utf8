The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bolly biggies bow to bat amp; ball   T20 ticket to the big screen
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bolly biggies bow to bat amp; ball     - IPL season signals box-office drought with plexes banking on T20 lure          PRIYANKA ROY                                    WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER WATCH? Shah Rukh Khan at an IPL match or Aditya Narayan-Shweta Agarwal in Shaapit                                        
	February 2010: My Name Is Khan, Karthik Calling Karthik, Teen Patti        
	March 2010: Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Kings XI Punjab              
	From this weekend, the IPL will be the only big release at the box office.        
	Till end-April, the Bolly barmy army will have to settle for small-budget films and long-delayed projects if they decide to ditch the TV remote  or a ticket to Eden  and go for a movie instead.        
	What was earlier a trickle because of the school exam season has now become a drought thanks to the IPL schedule. Lack of substantial audience means that no big producer is willing to release his film during this phase. Its a terrible time for the industry and so losses must be minimised. Things will be lean till the release of Sajid Nadiadwalas Housefull on April 30, says Mumbai-based trade analyst Komal Nahta.        
	Thats five days after the IPL final, proving just how seriously Bollywood takes the T20 cricket extravaganza. Director Sajid Khan has promised producer Sajid Nadiadwala that the multi-starrer will earn more than Rs 60 crore. If they release it during the IPL they would never hope to earn even half that amount, says a trade insider.        
	If it was the Shah Rukh Khan-Kajol biggie My Name Is Khan in February, with Amitabh Bachchan-Ben Kingsley and Farhan Akhtar-Deepika Padukone for company, then this month is meant for Rohit Roy-Rituparna Sengupta in Mittal v/s Mittal, Aditya Narayan-Shweta Agarwal in Shaapit, and Shahid-Kareenas much-delayed Milenge Milenge.                          
	So what will the multiplexes do? Simple, switch to the cricket-plus-Bollywood winner called the IPL. Whoever likes films, also likes the IPL, because they both mean entertainment. There is a huge buzz around the IPL this year and we know a lot of hardcore film buffs who are getting ready to view the matches at the plexes, says Rishi Negi of Fame Cinemas.        
	Count actress June among them. I will definitely try and watch a match on the multiplex screen, says the plex regular and KKR fan.        
	INOX, too, is batting for T-20 cricket to bail out the big screen. We are pricing the IPL screening tickets more or less in the same range as a normal movie ticket to enable a lot of people to watch the game here with family and friends, says Virendra Marya of INOX.        
	But Nahta is not convinced. Why would people pay in hundreds to watch something that they can watch at home for free?        
	The hardest hit by the IPL blow to Bollywood releases will be the single screen cinemas. Business is at a low right now. With multiple screens at their disposal, multiplexes can afford to screen the IPL, but all that the standalone theatres can do is wait for big films to release again, rues Pranab Ray of Menoka.        
	And theres no Tollywood as fallback either. The overall occupancies are low and we have decided not to release any of our Bengali projects during the IPL, says Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films.

          MOHUA DAS                          Konkona Sensharma and Ranvir Shorey                                  
	At 3am on Sunday, Konkona Sensharma and Ranvir Shorey announced their Friday wedding to the world. The chosen medium? Twitter.        
	He from his iPad and she from her iPhone, at exactly the same time, tweeted: We wanted you to read it here first but... We got married! Yay!        
	While konkona: konkonas followed it up with a personal tweet: Hey guys. Ranvir and I got married on the 3rd. Thanks for all the good wishes! Goodnight., ranvir:ranvirshorey wrote: The best wish/advice Ive received on marriage so far: Congratulations! Dont do it again.        
	Aparna Sen, mother of the bride, was back at the studio in Mumbai for the re-recording and dubbing of Iti Mrinalini  which stars both Konkona and Ranvir  after the whirlwind wedding weekend.        
	Late on Sunday, The Japanese Wife director decided to break her silence with a Facebook status update.        
	Coco amp; Ranvir got married day before yesterday at their apartment in a very private amp; select little ceremony. May they be happy ever after! posted the happy mom, followed by a flurry of congratulatory messages from friends and fans.        
	The buzz about the two tying the knot had been doing the rounds for sometime now, but the wedding came as a surprise to their friends in and outside Bollywood. After the 3am disclosure, most tweeted their best to Konkona.        
	Director Sujoy Ghosh was quick to tweet: outstanding!! awesome stuff. pls come to cal and distribute loochi begunbhaja, while Rahul Khanna, her boss in Wake Up Sid, tweeted: Congratulations! Wishing you both only the best of the best... :-)         
	Karan Johar wrote: huge congratulations!!! The best years ahead!! Genelia keyed in: congratulations konkona, lots of love n happiness to a new life.        
	Shabana Azmi, a dear friend of Aparna and Konkonas screen sister in 15 Park Avenue, wrote: congratulations both of you bahut saara pyar.         
	Actor and friend Rajat Kapoor, who lives in the same Versova building where the couple have been living for the past few years, stood in for Ranvirs brothers who couldnt arrive from abroad. He even performed some Punjabi rituals at home before the groom rode around the complex on a ghori.        
	The evening was reserved for a party with friends and family that stretched till the early hours.        
	After the quiet Arya Samaj wedding on Friday with a mix of Bengali and Punjabi customs, Konkona and Ranvir are likely to visit Calcutta later this year to host a small reception party for friends, family and, most importantly, her grandfather. He (Chidananda Dasgupta) could not make it to the wedding in Mumbai because of his health, said a family friend.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writers scores a record low   Count down to 17, CM cuts lonely figure
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Writers scores a record low 
  Count down to 17, CM cuts lonely figure          KINSUK BASU                                                   
	17/6,000 = 0.28 per cent.        
	Writers Buildings achieved a record attendance low as only 17 out of around 6,000 employees attended office on Monday braving the bandh called by the Left and other parties to protest fuel price hike.        
	Altogether 17 employees, including the chief secretary Ardhendu Sen and myself, have reported for work today, said home secretary Samar Ghosh at the state secretariat.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  who cannot be called an employee  was the 18th odd man out at Writers as he turned up for a full days work despite the bandh being termed an unprecedented success by his party secretary Prakash Karat.        
	Bhattacharjee, who has serious reservations about the bandh culture in Bengal, will not be amused to learn that Mondays attendance figure at Writers was quite unprecedented. It is believed that the chief minister had opposed the partys decision to call a bandh just eight days after the state faced a near shutdown thanks to a Citu-sponsored transport strike on the same issue.        
	An attendance percentage of 0.28 is almost 0.Undoubtedly, this is the lowest ever turnout at Writers on a week day, said Ananta Banerjee, the general secretary of the Left-affiliated State Co-ordination Committee.         
	The headcount stood in sharp contrast to the near 25 per cent attendance at the civic bodys offices across the city. Of the 33,000-odd civic employees, around 8,000 registered their presence. Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, of the Trinamul Congress, also attended office on Monday.        
	Writers was deserted despite a July 2 circular issued by the chief secretary asking all staff members to attend office on bandh day and ensuring that the offices were open. On Monday, home secretary Ghosh said those who had not turned up would be required to apply for a days casual leave.        
	Nobody has ever had to apply for casual leave for absence on a Left-supported bandh day. Besides, only the gates of the main block leading to the chief ministers office remain open. How can you expect people to turn up when the gates are locked? demanded an employee of the finance department.         
	Subesh Das, principal secretary to the chief minister, was one of the victims of the locked gates. Denied access to the corridor leading to his office, he was forced to take an alternative route to Bhattacharjees office.        
	Though the liftman who operates the VIP lift was not around, Bhattacharjee did not have to take the stairs  like on an earlier bandh  when he turned up at 11.05am. Now, if the liftman is missing, one of our officers operates the lift, said a Calcutta Police official overseeing the chief ministers security at Writers.        
	In two phases  between 11.10am and 1.27pm, then 4.07pm and 5.58pm  the chief minister was busy with paperwork, that included responding to letters sent by Union ministers to the chief ministers office and signing some pending files.        
	Less than 10km away from Writers, the one eyeing his chair remained closeted in her Kalighat residence with aides from the railways, port and the newly-formed civic body.         
	We did not want to oppose the bandh as it would have resulted in bloodshed.While they were not working, we used the day productively by drawing up plans for the city, the railways and the port, announced Mamata Banerjee.

	A 13-year-old girl died after coming under the wheels of a private bus on JN Mukherjee Road in Howrah around 6.45am on Wednesday. Witnesses said the bus on route 56 was racing a minibus when it hit the cycle on which the girl was riding pillion.         
	Angry residents damaged nearly 30 trucks and blocked JN Mukherjee Road and GT Road for over an hour demanding closure of a weigh bridge that was narrowing the width of the busy road.         
	Police said Pinki Biswakarma, a resident of Madhabbabu Lane in Howrah and a Class IX student, was going to school along with her two brothers when the bus hit their cycle from behind. The girl was rushed to a nursing home, but was declared dead on arrival. Pinkis younger brother Mantu, 10, was given first-aid and the elder brother Sanjay, 19, was admitted to TL Jaiswal Hospital with multiple injuries.        
	The bus was impounded but the driver fled.

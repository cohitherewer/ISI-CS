          ANASUYA BASU                          A new JNNURM bus plies in the city. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                   
	The JNNURM buses that have changed the face of public transport in the city have fallen out of favour with operators and owners. While the operators are complaining of diminishing returns as a result of lower mileage, the state transport corporations are bleeding because of unpaid EMIs.        
	We know that the environment comes first but ever since we rolled out the new JNNURM buses, our balance sheet has been in the red, said Dhiman Mukherjee, the managing director of the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation, which has a fleet of 525 semi-low floor non-AC buses.        
	The Centre paid 35 per cent of the Rs 19.94 lakh price tag of the vehicles, the state 15 per cent and banks forked out the rest of the amount as loans.        
	Private operators are plying these buses as our franchisees. They pay an EMI of up to Rs 17,000 per month along with road tax, insurance charges and route permit charges, said the official.        
	Many private operators admit that they have been failing to pay their EMIs. We cannot take the buses off the road because the operators are not paying their EMI. So we chip in but our finances are strained as a result, said Mukherjee.        
	The operators, who used to make healthy profit by running second-hand buses with little maintenance, claim they have been hit harder than the corporation.        
	The 16-tonne buses with 180 horsepower engines are not suitable as city transport. They are over-powered. Our old buses weighed 15 tonnes and had 120 horsepower engines, adequate for city roads. They yielded a mileage of 4km/l. With the new buses, we hardly get 2.5 km/l. They are not economically viable, said Lakshi Narayan De, who plies a Tata Motors JNNURM bus on the Bagbazar-Jodhpur Park route.        
	We pay an EMI of Rs 22,000 per month to the corporation. Besides fuel, we also have to pay for repairs. We make around Rs 7,000 daily from ticket sales, which leaves us with a profit of Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,600 per month, added De.        
	His old bus had the chassis of Tata Motors but was built locally and gave a mileage of 4km/l. The other problem operators are facing with these buses is the cost of spares. The windshield alone costs Rs 40,000. Besides, tubeless tyres are not available everywhere. The tyres get overheated and there is much more wear and tear, complains Abshesh Daw, another operator.        
	According to operators, JNNURM buses are much more viable in a city like Delhi because the routes stretch over greater distances.         
	Tata Motors, which has orders for 570 non-AC semi low-floor buses and 240 low floor AC buses, have admitted to snags in the buses that the dealer service teams have immediately attended. But the company has not received any letters on recurring snags on these buses till date, said a spokesperson in Mumbai.         
	He added: Some customers had issues of low mileage which have been addressed through proper driving tips and relevant training.        
	Mukherjee, however, blamed the bus manufacturers for the problems. The companies having received unprecedented bulk orders seem to have slipped in terms of quality, he said.

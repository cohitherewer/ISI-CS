          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE AND ZEESHAN JAWED                          A Haldirams banner hailing the CM at a government fair in Prabhu Shankar Agarwals building. (Amit Datta)                                        
	Prabhu Shankar Agarwal relied on the four Ps of marketing  product, price, place and promotion  to turn Haldirams into a popular brand but it was a fifth P  political clout  that helped the bhujia king expand his business in a hurry.        
	How Agarwal had bent the rules using his political connections was the talk of the town even as the Bankshall court sentenced him to life imprisonment on Friday for hiring goons to try and kill a tea-stall owner because he was blocking a site where he had planned a highrise.        
	He knows several senior CPM leaders and would flaunt his connections, said a former business associate.         
	Earlier this month, Agarwals brand shared space with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees portrait (see picture) on a banner during the Sabala Mela, a government fair meant to promote self-help groups that was inaugurated by the chief minister in a building (329 VIP Road) owned by Agarwal. The first edition of the fair was held in the same building.        
	An accused in an attempt-to-murder case doesnt get the chance to be associated with a government event unless he knows the right people in the right places, said a businessman who knows Agarwal well.        
	Minister Rekha Goswami, who is in charge of the department of self-help groups, claimed that the venue was decided by the local municipality (Rajarhat-Gopalpur) in consultation with the local MLA (Robin Mandal).        
	Agarwal allegedly used his proximity to people in high places to flout norms wherever he set up a business. Residents of buildings adjacent to the Haldirams outlet in Teghoria and the one in Burrabazar had often objected to the foul smell emanating from the kitchens but Agarwal could not be bothered. He had too much clout to care, said an employee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic laptop slur 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civic laptop slur 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Trinamul Congress delegation, led by former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, on Friday urged municipal secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay to stop the outgoing Calcutta Municipal Corporation board from draining civic resources.         
	After meeting Bandyopadhyay at Writers Buildings, Mukherjee alleged that the board had decided in an urgent meeting on May 21 to give laptops to mayoral council members for Rs 5,000 each.         
	Why was this decided only eight days before the civic elections? Some mayoral council members have already taken away laptops, said Mukherjee.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the laptops in question were being used by mayoral council members since 2006 and their depreciated value was fixed at Rs 5,000. Instead of selling the laptops to outsiders, we offered mayoral council members the option of buying the laptops for Rs 5,000, said Bhattacharyya.         
	Mukherjee also alleged that the civic board was clearing hefty bills, especially for work done under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, in a hurry before transferring power.

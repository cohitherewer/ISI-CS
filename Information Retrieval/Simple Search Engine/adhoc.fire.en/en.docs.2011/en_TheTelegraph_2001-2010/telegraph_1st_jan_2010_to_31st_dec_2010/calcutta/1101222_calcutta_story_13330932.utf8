The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll code prod to campuses
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Poll code prod to campuses
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The spurt in campus violence has prompted the West Bengal State Council of Higher Education to ask the vice-chancellors of all 18 universities in the state to immediately adopt the proposed model code of conduct for student elections.         
	Although campus violence was not on the official agenda of the councils meeting on Tuesday, that is what the officials discussed for the most part.        
	The high incidence of campus violence is a matter of concern. We have requested the vice-chancellors to adopt the model code as soon as possible so that student polls can be held in a peaceful manner, said Subimal Sen, the chairman of the higher education council.        
	Metro had highlighted on Saturday how the model code could have helped maintain a semblance of order on campuses in the city in the run-up to elections had Calcutta University not put the draft in cold storage. The draft code contains a clause granting a university the right to intervene at any stage of student elections.         
	A second-year BCom student of Prabhu Jagabandhu College in Andul died on Thursday in an alleged attack by Trinamul activists while a student of English at Asutosh College lost vision in one eye after being hit by a brick during an SFI-Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad clash.        
	The vice-chancellors of Calcutta University, Jadavpur University, Presidency University, Gourbanga University, Sidhu-Kanhu Birsa University and Vidyasagar University were among those who attended Tuesdays meeting.        
	Governor M.K. Narayanan and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee have expressed serious concern over the increasing incidents of campus violence. We need to hold a discussion at this meeting as almost all the vice-chancellors are present, a senior official said, tabling the unlisted subject.        
	Calcutta University, which controls over 100 colleges in the city, South 24-Parganas, Howrah and parts of Hooghly, is apparently wary of adopting it without examining the legal implications. Our legal officers have advised us to implement the code only after amending the university statutes. That will take some time, vice-chancellor Suranjan Das had said.        
	But the council members were unanimous that the clause empowering universities to intervene in college elections would go a long way in pre-empting violence.        
	Some universities have already started the process of adopting the model code. The rest of them have promised to start the process as soon as possible, council chairman Sen said.        
	The meeting decided to give the universities the freedom to tweak the regulations to suit their requirements. It is not binding on the universities to follow the draft code the way it has been framed, an official clarified.

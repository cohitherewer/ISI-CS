The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Comfort zone to fear factor
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Comfort zone to fear factor

	Mouparna Gupta, an advertising professional, could not take the Metro on Wednesday. The voice on the public address system said that a train had been derailed and so services had been suspended. My first reaction was fear. What if I had been on that train? the young mother later told Metro.        
	With a one-year-old back home waiting, I used to feel safest travelling by Metro. Not anymore. The trains are invariably late and overcrowded. Every day there is some snag. Today, I board the Metro with my fingers crossed. Tomorrow, I may be too scared to take the Metro at all, she added.        
	Mouparna mirrored the mood of Metro commuters across Calcutta. I am scared, said Mansi Sharma, 27, a private bank employee.        
	The Lenin Sarani resident travels between Esplanade and Jatin Das Park twice a day. It is still cheap and saves time. But it is no longer comfortable or safe, she added.        
	Ever since the extension beyond Tollygunge  till Garia from August 22, 2009, and now till New Garia from October 7 this year  its all gone horribly wrong, slowly but steadily.        
	Things have come to such a pass that Garia resident Sudipto Saharoy promised his 11-year-old daughter Sayantani on Wednesday that he would not take the Metro for at least a month. The TV footage made her panic. She made frantic calls to my office and insisted that I avoid the Metro. She was so adamant that I had to promise, said the 47-year-old state government employee, a Metro commuter from Garia.        
	The 17 non-AC rakes  most of them aged and ailing  and two new AC rakes  with tech glitches galore  are proving inadequate for the overcrowded and snag-hit service that is the lifeline for 5.5 to 6 lakh commuters everyday. The plan to replace old rakes with new, AC ones has also hit a slowdown.        
	The trains are overcrowded to the point of being claustrophobic and timings have gone haywire. After what happened on Wednesday, its also a threat to limb and life, said Samrat Dutta, who will avoid the Metro till steps are taken.        
	Are you scared to take the Metro? Tell

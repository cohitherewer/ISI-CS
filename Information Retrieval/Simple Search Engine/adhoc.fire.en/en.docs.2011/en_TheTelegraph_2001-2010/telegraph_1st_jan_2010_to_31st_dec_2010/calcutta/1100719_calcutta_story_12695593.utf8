	Durga puja is still three months away but scores of dhakis will descend on Calcutta and drum up a beat in Swabhumi in end-August. An organisation helmed by one of the best-known pair of hands wielding the traditional sticks has planned a three-day workshop on August 27, 28 and 29.        
	We are contacting artistes from districts famed for dhakis, such as Bankura, Purulia and Murshidabad, says Gokul Das, who has played abroad with Tanmoy Bose, Ustad Zakir Hossain and Pandit Ravi Shankar.        
	Every year, dhakis are in demand only in the Puja season. The rest of the year, they have no work. They have to learn more than the traditional beats to be accepted as percussionists, says Gokul, who himself underwent months of training with Bose.        
	Gokuls teacher explains the need for such a workshop, being held under the aegis of Bangla Souhardya, an organisation formed by the dhakis.        
	There are many expert hands but only Gokul has made a name for himself. Others fail to make the cut as they have neither any clue about rhythm outside the traditional beats nor flexibility about the way they play. Unless they break out of the mould they cannot be accepted into percussion bands on a par with other instrumentalists, says Bose.        
	Of course, the traditional beats will be the bedrock of the workshops agenda. Each district has a style of its own. We want to highlight the difference, Gokul says.        
	The organisers are planning visits to dhaki paras to invite players to the workshop. The best artistes can be put on the organisations website with sample clips of their performance. This way clients can get in touch with them, suggests Bose. Bengal Souhardya is also planning a stall in front Sealdah station on Puja-eve to facilitate bookings.

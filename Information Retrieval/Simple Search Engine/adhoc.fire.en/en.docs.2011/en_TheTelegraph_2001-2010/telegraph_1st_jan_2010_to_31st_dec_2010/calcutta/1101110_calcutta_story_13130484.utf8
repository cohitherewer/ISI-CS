The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tale of two fests: feel-good and folly 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tale of two fests: feel-good and folly 
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          THEIR SHOW, OUR SHOW: Oliver Stone and Jane Campion at the Mumbai Film Festival this year and (below) Tarun Majumdar, Soumitra Chatterjee and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the inauguration of Calcutta Film Festival 2009                                            
	The 16th Calcutta Film Festival gets underway on Wednesday, just two weeks after the curtains came down on the 12th Mumbai Film Festival.        
	The festival organised by the Mumbai Academy of Moving Image (MAMI) is a Reliance Big Entertainment property from last year with Anil Ambani lending muscle to the annual event.        
	When Metro asked Calcutta Film Festivals chief patron Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, as he was unveiling this years screening plans on November 1, whether he had any plans of bringing in corporate muscle to bolster the event, he replied: There are no plans to commercialise the festival showing the best films is our only concern.        
	Well, who are we kidding? Forget best films, there are not enough passable films at the Calcutta Film Festival these days. Something that is not lost on Bhattacharjee either. Joto tuku naa korlei noy tototai korchhi.... Today it is very easy to get access to foreign films and you can watch films from all over the world sitting in your home. If you look for them, you will easily get the (DVDs of) films we are screening this year, he said.        
	In contrast, the quality of movies at the Mumbai festival has improved dramatically since Reliance Big Entertainment stepped in.        
	After breezing through the Mumbai festival and while bracing for the Calcutta festival, Metro lists just a few things that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees pet would do well to pick up from Anil Ambanis project. If tomorrow comes.        
	Source new films        
	The highlight of this years Mumbai Film Festival was the screening of films like Alejandro Gonzlez Irritus Biutiful, Sofia Coppolas Somewhere and Abbas Kiarostamis Certified Copy. Films which won major prizes at major festivals like Cannes and Venice just a few months ago. And point to be noted Buddhababu, there are no DVDs of these films in the market.        
	All it takes is some awareness and persistence to get the prints, and so it cannot possibly be the preserve of the chief ministers office.        
	Go big on opening night        
	Screening Of Love and Other Demons, a 2009 co-production of Colombia and Costa Rica, directed by Hilda Hidalgo, on the opening night is like showcasing Calcutta airport, chaotic and squalid, to a first-time visitor to the city.        
	What Of Love and Other Demons? Who Hilda Hidalgo? We cant even blame the CM for tripping on her name.        
	At the MAMI 2010 show, the opening slot belonged to David Finchers just-released The Social Network. Overnight the festival became the talk of the town and thousands queued up for a rollicking ride.        
	Get a move on        
	Every year, year after year, the Calcutta Film Festival falls back on the Kurosawas and the Chabrols. Time may have stood still in Bengal, but world cinema has moved on, Buddhababu. No film festival can remain in action replay mode and yet pretend to be relevant.        
	When Mumbai Film Festival goes retro, it does so with a reason. The festival showed the restored print of Mrinal Sens Kandahar, which had been screened at Cannes. And when it showed the horror classic The Exorcist, Jane Campion was there to take a masterclass on acting.        
	Know your chief guest         
	According to sources, it was the might of Reliance Big Entertainment that brought Oliver Stone down to Mumbai to receive his International Lifetime Achievement award. Getting the man who made Platoon and JFK, Natural Born Killers and Born on the Fourth of July put the festival into a whole new orbit.        
	And who does Nandan have as chief guest this time? Jon Jost. Jon who? Well, the chief minister didnt seem to have a clue; after some below-the-breath prompting he explained that the chief guest is an avant-garde film-maker from America.        
	Hmmmm.        
	Show your own films        
	The Mumbai Film Festival showed, for the first time in India, the new films of Rituparno Ghosh, Aparna Sen and Anjan Dutt. Why doesnt the Calcutta Film Festival have the first right of refusal for films like Memories in March, Iti Mrinalini and BBD? If you showcase the new films of the best film-makers from the state, the festival automatically gets a home-grown boost.        
	Go Tolly glam        
	Okay, many were surprised to see Indra Kumar and Hrishita Bhatt as part of the MAMI closing ceremony but that was just a way of getting the film industry involved. When the likes of Ashutosh Gowariker, Ramesh Sippy, Yash Chopra and Vidhu Vinod Chopra drop by, the festival bar is so easily raised.        
	Why cant the Prosenjits and Rituparnas, Mithuns and Roopas be brought in to do the same for the Calcutta festival?         
	Set the party mood        
	With the moneybags ditching the CMs show to hop onto Mamata Banerjees bandwagon, the festival tea parties and dinners have suddenly become unnecessary in Nandans lexicon. But the Mumbai film festival showed just how much these after-parties mattered for the feel-good factor. Ask Oliver Stone, who was seen chilling at the Sun-n-Sand Hotel late into the night.

                      What is the FUSS about?        Truly, what is the fuss about? As the word suggests, its about being the fussy person that we all are. The fuss here is about living life with exclusivity and discovering style in everything in and around you. In a nutshell fuss is a way of living. FUSS, a retail therapy, is a fashion and lifestyle exhibition pioneered by two aspiring youngsters, Paridhi and Abhishek Sukhani. It was due to their unique sense and appreciation of style and aesthetics and their vision of an exhibition with no stalls, but providing the feel and comfort of a high-end store, that FUSS was born. Celebrating its first birthday, FUSS has put on display an ensemble of prt lines, fashion accessories and lifestyle products by eclectic designers from across the country. Beginning today, it boasts a combination of vernal talents, that has produced a treasure-trove of unique and at times even quirky, but affordable products. Host Paridhi Sukhani believes in fashion which doesnt burn a hole in the pocket; plus, an amalgamation of fresh designers offering niche products at good prices will ensure that comfortably. Visitors can expect to get select handpicked highly fashionable Western and Indianwear, edgy fashion accessories, and a vibrant home line including cushions, platters, trays, candles, lapdesks, lights and much, much more.

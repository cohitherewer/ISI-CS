	The 56-year-old guard of a Kasba school was found murdered in his room on the premises on Wednesday morning.        
	Employees of Adarsha Balika Vidyalaya also found the doors of three rooms broken and the almirahs inside ransacked. The authorities later lodged a police complaint stating that Rs 50,000 was missing.        
	Khublal, the guard, hailed from Bihar and stayed alone in his room in the school compound. There were deep wounds on his head. The nature of the injuries suggest that he was attacked with a sharp weapon, said an officer of Kasba police station.

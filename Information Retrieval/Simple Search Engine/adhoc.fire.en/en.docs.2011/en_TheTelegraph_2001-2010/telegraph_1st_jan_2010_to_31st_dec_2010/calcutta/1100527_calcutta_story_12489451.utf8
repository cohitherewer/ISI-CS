	Three people on their way to Puri died when the Tata Sumo they were travelling in with seven others rammed into a parked truck on National Highway 6, near Uluberia, early on Wednesday.        
	Relatives of the victims blamed the mishap on the driver, Sanjoy Sardar, who they said had hardly slept the previous day and might have dozed off while ferrying the holidaymakers from Rajarhat.        
	The seven others in the group, including three children, and Sardar were injured.        
	An officer of the district police said the mishap occurred at Khalisini Kalitola on National Highway 6.         
	The car packed with 10 people from three families of Rajarhat was travelling at a high speed. Three passengers died on the spot, said a senior officer of Howrah district police.        
	Among the dead were a young couple  Prosenjit Mandal, 32, and Gita, 28  and their relative Kalidas Mandal, 50.        
	Prosenjit and Kalidas were sitting next to the driver while Gita was sitting in the left window seat, just behind the duo. All three were residents of Natun Pukur in Rajarhat.        
	Puja, the four-year-old daughter of Prosenjit and Gita, suffered critical head injuries.        
	Nine-year-old Bubai, who was playing a game on his mothers cellphone, broke his collar bone but still managed to call and alert his uncle Tapan who rushed to Uluberia.        
	I reached the accident spot an hour later. Till then, the bodies of Prosenjit and Kalidas could not be extracted from mangled remains of the car. Later, a crane had to be brought in to wrench open the left front door, said Tapan.        
	The injured were taken to Uluberia Sub-divisional Hospital from where they were shifted to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.        
	Rupali Basu, the chief executive of Apollo Gleneagles said the condition of four of the injured  including a seven-year-old girl, also named Puja  was acutely critical.         
	Prosenjits cousin Bablu, not a member of the travel group, said he had come to know that the 24-year-old driver had made a round trip to Tarapith on Tuesday and then worked for a wedding party till late at night before picking up the Rajarhat residents at 4am.        
	Sanjoy hardly got to sleep on Tuesday. Its obvious he had dozed off on the highway. We will lodge a police complaint against the travel agency that had supplied the car, said Bablu.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Relief in a tragedy revisited
  - Pune blast survivor meets slain friends family          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                             Rishabh Agarwal (top) survived the Pune blast   but friend Rajeev   Agarwala didn rsquo;t                                
	A family revisited a tragedy as a friend relived a nightmare in a Girish Park home this weekend.        
	Rishabh Agarwal, one of the survivors of the Pune German Bakery blast, had walked into former roommate Rajeev Agarwalas home on Saturday carrying a packet filled with a few of his friends favourite belongings and apprehension in his heart about meeting his parents.        
	By the time he left, the 24-year-old Mumbai lawyer seemed to have been unburdened in more ways than one.         
	I feel relieved now. As a close friend of Rajeev, it was my responsibility to check on his family, but I was worried about how I would face them I was happy to see that uncle and aunty are coping up with it as best as possible, recounted Rishabh of the meeting, barely two days after police claimed a breakthrough in the blast case.        
	Rajeevs parents Nand Kumar and Madhu made Rishabh as comfortable as they could  asking questions but never demanding an answer, reflecting on what could have been but not once pointing a finger at anyone.        
	So you would have left the bakery if you hadnt found an empty table straightaway? asked Nand Kumar, also a lawyer, after Rishabh had recreated the scene at the Koregaon Park caf when he and four friends walked in on February 13.         
	I was not very eager to go there after a long, tiring day. There was no space to sit when we walked in but a table became vacant just as we were wondering whether we should step out. Rajeev sat closest to the spot where the bomb exploded, recalled Rishabh, whose family is from Lucknow.        
	Rajeevs sister Radhika, a second-year student of Shri Shikshayatan College, asked the one question that has been troubling her for the past seven months  how come no one noticed the bag that contained the bomb?        
	Had it been spotted, this would have been a story of a bomb being defused. It became a blast tragedy because nobody saw the bag lying there, Rishabh replied.        
	The five friends  Abhishek Kumar, Vineeta Pathak, Sumit Singh, Rajeev and Rishabh  had spent around five minutes at the caf when the blast occurred.         
	Rishabh, who still has splinter scars on his limbs, said Vineeta and he were at the counter when everything became black and the terrace crashed on him. For 4-5 minutes, nobody entered the caf. I kept screaming, he recounted.        
	A critically injured Abhishek died three days later and Rajeev on February 21.        
	Ab to bas yaadein hi reh gayee hain (There are only memories of him now), cried mother Madhu.        
	The packet brought by Rishabh lay untouched on a side table in the 12x12ft living room. This contains a watch that was Rajeevs favourite and a few personal notes Only I knew where they were kept, said the youth, trying to break the silence.        
	Rishabh has been to Pune twice since the blast, once to write his exams and then to pick up some belongings. I walked past German Bakery on August 14 and couldnt stop myself from entering, he said.        
	And what did he see? It was eerily desolate.

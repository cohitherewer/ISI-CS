The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Left to boycott mayor poll
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Left to boycott mayor poll
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Left Front councillors will boycott Wednesdays elections for the posts of mayor and chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	The decision to boycott the polls was taken at a meeting of the Left Fronts Calcutta committee at Promode Dasgupta Bhavan.        
	The decision was unanimous. We want to respect the verdict of the people who have elected 33 Left Front councillors and 95 from the Trinamul Congress. Besides, we are not contesting the posts of mayor and chairman, CPM state committee member Rabin Deb said after the meeting.        
	Deb said the Left Front councillors would attend Wednesdays swearing-in ceremony of the mayor and the chairman, though minutes before Left Front Calcutta committee convener Dilip Sen had said the opposite.        
	The Front would stay away from the elections as well as the swearing-in ceremony, Sen had said.        
	The Left Front on Tuesday chose the councillor from ward 32, Rupa Bagchi, as the leader of the Opposition in the CMC. Dipankar De, a mayoral council member in the outgoing board, will be the Left Front leader in the CMC, while Amal Mitra will be the Front whip. Bagchi, De and Mitra are all from the CPM. Bagchi is also the partys MLA from Maniktala.        
	Elaborating on the decision to select Bagchi as the Opposition leader, Sen said: Forty-seven per cent of the Left Front candidates in the civic polls were women. Sixteen of our councillors are women. Rupa is a senior councillor and legislator. We believe she will perform competently and raise issues related to the well-being of Calcuttans.

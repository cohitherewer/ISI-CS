The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clouds at play in rain divide
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clouds at play in rain divide
  - North vs south in monsoon match        OUR BUREAU                        A waterlogged Central Avenue near Sovabazar and (below) a dry stretch of Syed Amir Ali Avenue on Friday morning. (Tamaghna Banerjee and Bishwarup Dutta)				                                             
	The north looked set for a walkover till early afternoon, but the south fought back in the slog overs and by Friday evening had snatched a narrow victory.        
	The monsoon match between north and south Calcuttans was the talking point of the day in a city grappling with the great rainfall divide.        
	Morning did not show the day for either north or south, with four hours of heavy first-half rain making way for a dry late afternoon in one part of the city and a dry first half for the other leading to two hours of lashing rain later.        
	Several parts of north Calcutta were flooded during the downpour between 11am and 2pm even as the southern parts were bathed in sweat. The skies finally played fair with the south in the afternoon, opening up for a sustained spell of rain from 3pm to 5pm. So heavy were the showers that the south scoresheet more than made up for the morning lull.        
	According to the Met office, north Calcutta received around 15mm of rain between morning and early afternoon, while the southern parts received 15.9mm of rain till 5.30pm.        
	Residents of central Calcutta and the eastern parts of the city were the losers in the monsoon game, receiving barely a drizzle.        
	This is a very strange monsoon for Calcutta, said 28-year-old investment professional Abhigyan Singh Gill from Sovabazar.        
	Gills neighbourhood was flooded when he left for work at midday. He was surprised to see that it hadnt rained at all around his workplace in Shakespeare Sarani. In the evening, when he travelled to Alipore to meet a client, he was greeted by a shower.        
	On a rainy day, most parts of the city receive rain in varying intensities around the same time. But what we have been seeing since Thursday is new to me, said Gill.        
	But the rain game between north and south isnt new to the city, insisted the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore. This is not an abnormality. Such scattered rain often takes place in the city, said director Gokul Chandra Debnath.        
	The weatherman attributed the scattered rains to localised formation of thundercloud cells on Thursday.        
	The low pressure area that was in our vicinity till Thursday induced the formation of these thundercloud cells, which caused rain in parts of the city at different times, Debnath told Metro.        
	The rain, however, did not help lower the Celsius. The maximum temperature was a degree above normal at 33.1 degrees Celsius. The minimum was also two notches above normal at 27.6 degrees. Humidity ranged between 68 and 95 per cent.        
	Rainfall at this time of the year usually does not make the weather cooler unless it is prolonged, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.         
	The influence of the low pressure area is already on the wane, as it has moved further away from the city. The weatherman said rainfall would be scant over the Independence Day weekend.        
	That, of course, also means little chance of freedom from the heat.

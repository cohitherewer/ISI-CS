  - Son who landed on her lap starts going to school          BRINDA SARKAR                           Sunita Biswas works at her food stall in Salt Lake while son Akash, home for the summer holidays, keeps himself busy with a textbook. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                        
	An unlettered food vendor who couldnt take her two children past primary school after her husband went missing has since made it her lifes mission to educate an abandoned boy she brought home five years ago.        
	Sunita Biswas, in her 40s, was struggling to run the stall in Salt Lake her husband left her and raise their two children when little Akash literally landed on her lap one rainy day in 2005. He was six months old then and is close to six years now, going to a boarding school in Barrackpore and living his doting Mas dream.         
	I know Akashs biological mother, Kakoli. She had worked in my stall for a while but didnt seem to care much for her baby. She would bring him to work and leave him crying in a corner. Then one day she just vanished, leaving the baby in the stall, recalls Sunita, ladling out some rice for a customer in her stall below Salt Lakes tank number 9 in CK Block.        
	When her husband went missing in the 1990s, Sunita had felt helpless. When Akashs mother went missing, the first thought that came to Sunitas mind was that she shouldnt ever make him feel helpless.        
	 He would have died had I left him there, says Sunita.        
	She named the baby Akash soon after reaching home in a Nayapatti tenement with a bag of groceries in one hand and her son in the other, the aanchal of her sari shielding him from the rain.        
	Her daughter was supportive but her son, the elder of the two, wasnt amused.        
	My son, who is now married, and daughter-in-law still havent accepted Akash. I have been bringing Akash with me to the stall ever since he was an infant because I suspected he wouldnt be safe at home, reveals Sunita.        
	Now, her only worry is educating Akash. She has already taken a loan of Rs 5,000 from her brother to get him admitted to the Barrackpore school and intends doing whatever it takes to continue his education.        
	Akashs monthly school fee is Rs 400, which Sunita hopes to manage with donations from some Samaritans of the area. Apart from money, some people have gifted clothes, she says.        
	Regular customers recall how hard Sunita has worked over the years to raise Akash, who learnt to walk and speak later than most children.        
	The child couldnt walk until he was two and learnt to speak only when he was around four. Sunita took him to many doctors. She would apply hot towel on his throat thinking something was wrong with his vocal chords. Sometimes she would stick her fingers into his mouth in her desperation to get him to utter a few words, recounts Sankari Adhikari, a customer who lives on the campus next to the stall.         
	Sunita had tried admitting Akash to SOS Village in Salt Lakes BK Block last year but backed out when the authorities said she would have to give him up for good.        
	Why shouldnt I see him again? If I ever give the boy away, it will be to his real mother and nobody else, insists Sunita.        
	Kakoli did come to see Sunita once three years ago but not for her son.        
	She wanted her job back. Akash heard her asking someone whether I had taken anybody else in her place and he came up to me to say: O ma, dyakho tomar kaajer lok eshechhe (Look Ma, your help has come), she recounts.        
	Sunita told Kakoli not to turn up again until she was ready to raise her son properly. I dont know who Akashs father is. I only know Kakoli, and she didnt look capable of taking care of her son when I last saw her.        
	So has she ever told Akash who Kakoli is? Hes too young to understand everything, says the feisty mother.        
	Akash was invited to his first birthday party in the neighbourhood last month, and he hasnt stopped talking about the cake-cutting ceremony since.        
	Unfortunately, I dont know my sons birthday. But I do try to give him a little bit of happiness every day of the year. He is back home for the summer vacation and I cant bear to think it will soon end, smiles Sunita, looking indulgently at her little one flipping through his first textbook.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | BOOK WALL GROWS BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Book Wall grows by leaps and bounds
                                          
	Actress June walked in with around 15 books, including Tell Me Why from her childhood stock and Enid Blyton and math textbooks from her sons kitty. There is no substitute for books India can shine when India is educated, smiled the lady draped in a peach cotton chikankari.                
	The weekend worked wonders for the Aviva Great Wall of Education, presented by The Telegraph. On Saturday, Day 4 , friends and family descended on City Centre (Salt Lake) and even stood in a queue to build the wall 1,78,600 books strong, a head taller than Delhi, which had clocked 1,23,000 books last year.                 
	Among Saturdays donors were three-year-old Vanalika Rathi (picture above), who gave away four of her favourite books, and Anchit Dutta (picture right), a Class XII student of Bhavans Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, who came with three friends and bags full of textbooks and fiction.                    
	Two-and-a-half-year-old twins Ashmita and Adrita Das cut a pretty picture in identical dungarees as they walked into City Centre with their parents, colouring and picture books in hand, to add to the fast-growing wall.              
	Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh came armed with a set of encyclopaedias for the cause. The best gift my mom gave me was the love of reading. Books shape our minds. This project of helping the underprivileged is invaluable, priceless and futuristic, she said.      Text: Jhinuk Mazumdar;

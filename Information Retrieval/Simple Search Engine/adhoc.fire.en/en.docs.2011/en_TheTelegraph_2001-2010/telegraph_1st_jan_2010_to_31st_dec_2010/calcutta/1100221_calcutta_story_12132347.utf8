The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Green zone as carbon cure
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Green zone as carbon cure
                                          
	The Maidan, the lush expanse of green spread across 5sq km in the heart of the city, acts as the lungs of Calcutta. It is the biggest carbon sink in the metropolis, recently crowned the carbon capital of India.         
	A carbon sink is a natural or manmade reservoir that stores carbon- containing chemical compounds for an indefinite period. Other than oceans, plants act as natural carbon sinks, absorbing huge amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, through photosynthesis.        
	A recent study by the regional centre of the National Afforestation and Eco-Development Board in Jadavpur University found that Calcutta emits 3,490 tonnes of carbon dioxide every day.         
	If around 13 per cent of the citys carbon dioxide emission is targeted to be neutralised through afforestation in 2010, around 4.61 million trees need to be planted in Calcutta, which will absorb 453 tonnes of the greenhouse gas, says Asish Majumder, a JU professor who is leading the study.        
	Though accurate city-specific tree census data is not available, according to various estimates there are around 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh trees in Calcutta. Around 3,000 trees of various kinds are in the Maidan area. Based on the centres research that one tree absorbs nearly 0.04 tonnes of carbon dioxide in a year, the Maidan (picture by Pradip Sanyal) is responsible for absorbing nearly 120 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.         
	The Maidans contribution may be even bigger. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the Maidan annually may be much higher than 120 tonnes, says Debal Roy, the chief environment officer of the environment department.         
	The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by a tree depends on its canopy size; as far as my knowledge goes, the quoted figure (0.04 tonnes annually) has been arrived at by considering medium to small canopy trees. But larger canopied tress, like most of those found in the Maidan area, are expected to absorb at least four times that amount, he explained.        
	Roy adds that the grass-covered part of the Maidan also acts as a carbon sink.        
	The Maidan stretches over nearly 5sq km and is responsible for 60 per cent of the green verge of the city, which has around 1 per cent of organised green space.        
	The findings vindicate the importance of the Maidan in countering climate change as it absorbs so much carbon dioxide. Hopefully, political leaders will now think twice before sacrificing the greens in the name of public meetings, said environment activist Subhash Dutta, who has been fighting to save the Maidan in the judicial forum.

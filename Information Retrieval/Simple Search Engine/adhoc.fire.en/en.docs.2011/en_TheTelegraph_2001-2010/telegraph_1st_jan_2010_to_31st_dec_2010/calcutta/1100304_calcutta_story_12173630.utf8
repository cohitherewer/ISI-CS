The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police: threat calls were real
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Police: threat calls were real
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A senior officer of Calcutta police on Wednesday confirmed that the calls received by four city businessmen demanding ransom to avoid being kidnapped were serious in nature and not pranks.         
	There is no reason to believe that someone was making the calls for fun. The calls were real and have been made with a definite aim, the officer said.         
	The officer hinted that the police had traced the callers. But it would be improper to share further details of the investigation now, he added.         
	The police also advised businessmen not to panic if they faced similar threats in future. The word of advice came on a day several members of the citys business community turned up at Lalbazar wanting to know what they should do in case they received a ransom call. Police sources told Metro that some businessmen also sought protection.        
	We told them that if they receive ransom calls, they should not panic. Paying up is not the solution to such a situation. They must get in touch with the police immediately and leave the rest to us, a senior IPS officer said.         
	According to him, the police have launched a technology-intensive probe to trace the calls, besides contacting Delhi and Mumbai police for details of operatives of the Indian Mujahideen and Asif Reza Commando Force.         
	On Tuesday and Wednesday, senior officers briefed members of a special team drawn from the Special Task Force and the detective department  on how to probe a ransom call and offer protection to the recipients of threat calls.

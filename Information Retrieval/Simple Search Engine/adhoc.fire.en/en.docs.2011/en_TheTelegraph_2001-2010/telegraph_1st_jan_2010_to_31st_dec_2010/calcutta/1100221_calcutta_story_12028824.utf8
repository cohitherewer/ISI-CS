The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | How many go to the police?
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      How many go to the police?

	Soma Chakraborty went to a police station to report the theft of her cellphone but had to return after filing a diary that merely said the phone was missing.         
	Its not easy filing an FIR (first information report). The officer who finally took down Somas complaint warned her that if she filed an FIR, she would have to appear before court. After having spent an hour at the police station, where she had to repeat her complaint to several officers, Soma vowed never to go to the police again.        
	Police stations are crowded places. But they would probably have been far more crowded if the police were more encouraging. According to a PUBLIC amp; GfK-MODE survey on civic problems (Metro on Sunday, November 8, 2009), of the 600 respondents, only 12 went to the police. Of them, 10 did not get their problems resolved.         
	In each of the 48 police stations in the city, 25-40 FIRs are lodged in a month. The number does not reflect the magnitude of crime. Fewer cases mean less work and also helps earn a pat on the back from seniors, says an officer at Lalbazar.         
	Calcutta police have several hotline numbers  1090, 1091, Dial 100 (crime control) and 1073 (traffic related). But people hardly get through these numbers in emergencies, and often the officers do not give a patient hearing to the caller.         
	Complaint forms are hardly available in traffic booths or kiosks. Police stations also shirk their responsibility on grounds of jurisdiction.         
	The West Bengal Human Rights Commission receives several complaints about the police.         
	Lalbazar has set up a grievance cell for complaints against cops. Every month we receive over 20 such complaints. We conduct an inquiry and stern action is taken if the allegations are proved, said an officer. But how many know of the cell?         
	An IPS officer says the police face several problems following the rise in population and the surge in the crime rate. With 24 departments in Calcutta police, the strength of policemen is around 22,000.         
	The people behind the survey remind us that if the police need to be more active, it is also the citizens responsibility to keep the police working.         
	Four key issues emerge from the survey that need police leadership  traffic, pedestrian safety, air pollution and noise. But this role will require much more active information dissemination by the police and information seeking by citizens. We need to work on both ends of the spectrum, says Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sigh of relief for panel head
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sigh of relief for panel head
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          A queue of voters at a Beleghata booth. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	State election commissioner Mira Pande woke up hours before polling started at 7am on Sunday, ready for a long day at work.         
	Twelve hours later, the busiest and most-sought-after woman on election day was also one of the happiest. Months of hard work have paid off. I am happy with the way the polls were conducted. The elections were by and large peaceful, apart from one or two incidents, she said in the evening.         
	Her office on Rawdon Street was a hive of activity from 6.45am with teams of officials glued to their phones, co-ordinating with election personnel across the 81 civic bodies that went to polls.         
	Most of us walked into office at 6.30am. Everything had to go right today, or months of painstaking preparations would come to nothing. I took my first break after seven hours, said an official tracking the proceedings in city booths.        
	Around 10am, the calls started pouring in. Keep me in the know. Do not hesitate to come to me with even the smallest update, S.N. Roychowdhury, the secretary of the state election commission, told officials and cops.        
	The commissioner and the secretary were keen to ensure that everything went according to plan. All of us were on our toes. We were quite tense but by the end, we knew we had achieved what we had been working so hard for, said a junior official while taking a tea break at 5.30pm.        
	We must have received several hundred phone calls today. EVM glitches caused many disruptions this time, he added.        
	Except for the 10 policemen standing guard outside the Rawdon Street address, there was nothing to suggest that elections at 81 civic bodies across the state were being conducted from the old, grey building.        
	When she emerged from her room at 5pm, Pande knew she had pulled it off. There is a sense of satisfaction. But lot of work still remains to be done, she told Metro.

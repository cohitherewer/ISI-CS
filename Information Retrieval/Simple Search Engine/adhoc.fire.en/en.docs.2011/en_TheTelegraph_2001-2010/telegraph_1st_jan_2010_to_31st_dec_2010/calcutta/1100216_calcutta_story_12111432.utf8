	A doctor, a corporate employee, a teacher at a business school and a first-year engineering student were among the eight contestants who fought it out in the finals of Quizzit, the quiz contest organised as part of Infocom 2009-10, the IT conference and exhibition by Businessworld, on January 23.         
	Held in association with Texas Instruments and International School of Business, Calcutta, the contest included four days of preliminary rounds conducted by quizmaster Lloyd Saldanha, from which the finalists were selected.         
	The finals, conducted by Giri Balasubramanium, included five rounds, from Museum of Innocence, comprising direct as well as visual clue questions, a crossword round called White Tiger, to Five Point Something, a buzzer round.         
	The questions ranged from the serious to the quirky. One visual question required participants to identify a photograph of French President Nicolas Sarcozy as a child model.         
	The last question, from the round India Inspired, saw the quizzers struggling to identify an instrument that runs on a six-volt alkaline battery, with a design modelled on the musical keyboard and equipped with a Braille option. TCS employee Sudip Kalyan Dey was the one to recognise it as the electronic voting machine.         
	Dey was declared the winner, followed by Dr Soubhadra Chakraborty and Mounik Sarkar, a student of Academy of Technology, Bandel.         
	Said Dey, a die-hard quizzer: You may know all the answers. But to win, it is important to recollect facts at the right moment.        
	Dey received a home theatre system, while Chakraborty and Sarkar went home with a netbook and an iPod, respectively.         
	Said Subramaniam: The Infocom quiz has always attracted the best brains in the city. This year was no exception.

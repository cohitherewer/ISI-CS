The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Train split by rare snag 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Train split by rare snag 
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Passengers of the Mumbai-bound Duronto Express had a close shave on Friday morning when an extremely rare glitch detached the engine and two compartments from the rest of the train in Uluberia, Howrah.        
	Panic gripped passengers as 13 coaches of Mamata Banerjees showpiece train, which was travelling at 50kmph, ran for around 150 metres without an engine before coming to a halt.        
	The engine and the first two bogies  a generator coach and B1  rolled on for 500 metres before driver Santanu Pal brought it to a halt.        
	Shyambazar resident Subir Ghosh, who was in B1, said: The train suddenly slowed down with a loud clatter. I later realised the train had been split into two.        
	Had the driver slammed the brakes immediately after the detachment, the rest of the train that was running on momentum would have rammed into B1, resulting in a disaster.        
	The central buffer coupler (which ties two coaches) between B1 and B2 had come off, said an official of South Eastern Railway.        
	These are new couplings. Traditionally, there are two buffers and a coupling on either side of a coach. But in superfast trains like Duronto and Rajdhani, a buffer and a coupling form an integrated unit. Once the couplings of two coaches are joined, they are locked by a pin. The pin of the couplings between B1 and B2 might have accidentally come loose. It was an extremely rare glitch, the official added.        
	The train  the Howrah-Mumbai Duronto Express was flagged off by Mamata on September 28 last year  left Howrah at 8.20am.        
	The coupling between B1 and B2 came off around 9am, just after the trains tail had left the platform at Uluberia station.        
	The train was yet to really pick up speed  the average speed of Duronto trains, which travel non-stop between metro cities, is 90 kmph  when the freak snag occurred.        
	Driver Pal immediately realised what had happened but allowed the engine to roll on for nearly half-a-km to ensure a safe distance with the detached part for it to came to a halt on its own.        
	This is the usual practice in case such a thing occurs.... The trains automatic brake system got activated as soon as the brake pipe snapped following the separation. The brake system in the guards cabin, too, was activated, the official said.        
	The train resumed its journey at 10.27am after engineers rejoined the couplings but the suffering of the passengers continued for another one hour and 15 minutes, till they reached Kharagpur, because of a breakdown in the air-conditioning system.        
	Railway officials claimed the cooling problem was confined to B1 but passengers of several other coaches complained that the air-conditioning was not working.        
	Efforts to restore the system at Kharagpur station failed, triggering protests by passengers.        
	The problem was solved after B1 was relocated and fitted between B7 and B8. The other coaches were getting power from the generator at the rear end of the train, said an official. The train left Kharagpur at 12.50pm.        
	Maniktala resident Renuka Gupta, who was travelling with her three-year-old son, said: I was haunted by thoughts of the Jnaneswari Express tragedy. I kept clutching on to my son till I realised that it was just a freak accident. He was crying constantly as the coach became hot and humid.        
	The railway has ordered an inquiry into the bizarre incident, straight out of a Tintin adventure or a Bollywood potboiler but laced with fear.        
	Officials said the maintenance and safety inspection team at the Santragachhi yard might have been at fault for the detachment drama.        
	The coaches were manufactured at the Integral Coach Factory in Kapurthala, Punjab. We have to find out whether inferior metal was used, said an official.

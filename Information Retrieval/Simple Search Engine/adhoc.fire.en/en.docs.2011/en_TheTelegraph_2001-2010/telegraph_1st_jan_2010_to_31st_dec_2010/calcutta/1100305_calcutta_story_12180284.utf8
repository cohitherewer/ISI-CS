                      Art for the people        His name synonymous with Indian contemporary art, M. F. Husain is unquestionably India rsquo;s best brand ambassador. According to him ldquo;silk screen print is like the silk route to satisfy people rsquo;s need of collecting works of art, as original paintings are incapable of reaching the common man rdquo;. He further mentions that lsquo;a thing of beauty is a joy for ever rsquo; but more importantly, for everybody. ldquo;And the place where everybody can enjoy the work of art, is a public museum. Da Vinci rsquo;s Mona Lisa can rsquo;t be kept in private homes, she belongs to the world. Thus, graphic is a social art form... rdquo;. The ongoing exhibition, Graphic World of M. F. Husain, marks an endeavour to bring his art to every household, in a manner that the artist himself desires. The collection comprises over 100 of his limited edition graphic prints. Mainly serigraphs and offset lithographs, the works are diverse in range and theme; from mythology and religion, to Mother Teresa and his famous Horse series. What makes the show remarkable is that it significantly reduces the monetary pinch that would accompany acquiring a Husain painting, and yet allows for the satisfaction of actually owning a genuine Husain. As the saying goes, lsquo;a print is for people with more taste than money. rsquo;

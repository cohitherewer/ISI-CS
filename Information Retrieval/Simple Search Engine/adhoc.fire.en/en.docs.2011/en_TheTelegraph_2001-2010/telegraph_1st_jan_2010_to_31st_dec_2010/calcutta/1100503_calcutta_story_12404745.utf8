The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dusk thundershower for swelter city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dusk thundershower for swelter city
  - Hope for elusive Norwester this week as formation spotted over Chotanagpur           OUR BUREAU                          Lightning and thunder on Park Street on Sunday evening. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                        
	Thundershowers brought much-awaited relief from the swelter on Sunday evening though the accompanying wind triggered chain reactions that claimed two lives and caused some injuries.        
	Dark clouds started gathering in the sky from around 4.30pm and the first flash of lightning was seen an hour later. The rain came down around 6.30pm and carried on in spells till late into the evening. Most parts of north and south Calcutta received spells of heavy rain between 7pm and 8.30pm.        
	The thundershowers were expected. The phenomenon, however, cannot be called Norwester or thunderstorm, said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The elusive Norwester could hit the city some time this week as the Patna Met office has spotted signs of the swelter saviour sweeping the Chotanagpur region in Jharkhand in the next 48 hours.        
	The impact of the Sunday shower was swift as the mercury, which soared to 38.1 degrees Celsius in the afternoon, dropped by five notches while it was still pouring.        
	The weatherman at Alipore held out hope of more rain in the next couple of days, thanks to two atmospheric formations. A low-pressure trough is stretching from Haryana to Assam through Bengal with an embedded cyclonic circulation over Bihar. Another trough runs from Bihar to the northwest Bay through Gangetic Bengal. Thundershowers are likely under the influence of these two formations, said a Met official.        
	The thundershower took a tragic turn for one family as an electric wire snapped under the impact of the wind and fell on Rabindranath Singh and his eight-year-old daughter Ruby in Thakurpukur. They were taken to hospital where they were declared dead on arrival.        
	Around the same time, seven people enjoying a boatride at Rabindra Sarobar panicked on hearing thunderclaps and injured themselves while trying to clamber to safety in a hurry.        
	Traffic was disrupted in various parts of the city as broken branches blocked roads. At least two cars and a few roadside eateries in Sector V were damaged as branches came crashing.        
	Trains and flights, too, took a hit. JetLites Lucknow-Calcutta and Guwahati-Calcutta flights were diverted to Bhubaneswar, while BMG and Biman Bangladeshs Dhaka-Calcutta flights were forced to return to Dhaka.

      A Staff Reporter                     
	Heramba Chandra College remained shut for the second successive day on Wednesday, following Mondays student demonstration that led to the principal lodging police complaints against two students.     
	Police said they raided the houses of Chand Prakash Singh and Mukesh Tripathi, who have been charged with attempt to murder and suicide, but could not find them.    
	When Metro called Singh, he sounded frightened and pleaded innocence. My only aim was to stir the college authorities into ensuring that regular classes were held. I did not intend to hurt the principal, said the BA first-year student, who claimed to be staying at his paying guest accommodation.    
	I got myself admitted to the college on July 15. Classes havent been held till date. I dont have the money to take private tuition. I requested the student groups and the principal several times to take steps so that classes are held regularly but none paid any attention to the matter, said Singh.     
	Several other students said classes are not being held regularly in the college this year. This is a serious problem. Classes after 2pm are rare as there are very few full-time teachers, said Arnab Ghosh, an SFI supporter.    
	Singh could not explain why he poured petrol on himself during the protest. On Tuesday, he had said that a comment by the principal had prompted him to pour petrol on himself.    
	Principal Khagen Adhikary had alleged that the student had also poured petrol on him and brought out a matchbox. Singh denied the allegation.     
	Protests continued outside the campus on Wednesday with SFI organising a demonstration to denounce the attack on the principal.     
	We are trying our best to start classes as early as possible, said Adhikary.    
	If the principals council and the university agree to forgive the two students, I wont have any problem, he added. A person who identified himself as Chand Prakashs brother called me and cried. I told him the same thing.     
	Policemen were posted outside the college on Wednesday.    
	Balcony collapse: Ila Das, 60, sustained head and hand injuries after she fell down when a portion of a first-floor balcony in her Kali Tara Bose Lane house in Beleghata collapsed early on Wednesday. She was taken to NRS hospital.

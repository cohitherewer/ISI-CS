The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Center trio walk free
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Center trio walk free
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rehan (left) and Adil after their release on Monday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	Rehan Alam and Adil Hasan, who were once facing gallows, got back their freedom on Monday following a high court order acquitting them of all charges in the American Center attack case.        
	Shakil Ahmed, another death row convict, also earned his freedom during the day as he had already spent more than eight years in jail against the five-year prison term the high court had ordered, overturning a trial court verdict.        
	Hasrat Alam and Musharat Hossain were set free on Saturday for the same reason as Ahmed.        
	The trial court had awarded death sentence to all five, along with Aftab Ansari and Jamiluddin Nasser. The high court on Friday upheld the death sentence against Ansari and Nasser but changed the order for the rest.        
	Ahmed was lodged in Dum Dum Central jail while the others were in Presidency jail.        
	I always asked the judge what was our fault. I am happy today that the truth has come out, said Adil, 32. I want to see my mother.        
	Rehan only said: I am happy at being released.        
	The duo was arrested on January 29, 2002, from Hazaribagh. Mazahir Hassan, 73, Adils father and Pervez Alam, 48, Rehans father, had a long wait since Friday.         
	The duo were arrested on January 29, 2002, from Hazaribagh. Policemen from Calcutta went to our home and even ate with us. They told us the duo were being taken to identify some people, said Mazahir. The children were falsely implicated. Just imagine what they have gone through after being branded terrorists.        
	They have lost the best part of their lives inside jail without any fault of theirs. Who will compensate for this? asked Pervez.

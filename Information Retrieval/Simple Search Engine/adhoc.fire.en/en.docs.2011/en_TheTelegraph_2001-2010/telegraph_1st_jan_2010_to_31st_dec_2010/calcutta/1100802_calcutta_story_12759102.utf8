                      Tradition and modernity                    The miniature art of the subcontinent has a long and distinguished history. In Search of the Exquisite: Contemporary Miniature Art from Pakistan brings together a group of artists who, though schooled in this tradition, have modified it to fit contemporary themes. These artists combine a unique accuracy of observation with incredible technical precision. They have a deep and intuitive understanding of the special advantages of this sensitive format for capturing the feel of a particular place or moment. Appreciating the inner vibrancy of the subcontinents cultural heritage, they convey it through sensitive forms and tones. Their works develop on intimacy and atmosphere and are, therefore, pregnant with mystery, wistfulness and nostalgia. The artists reinvent the glorious tradition of the miniature and, in doing so, re-evaluate it such that it is no longer opposed to modernity. They have used a large and varied visual vocabulary in their creations: part-traditional, part-modern, part-reinvented and part-unabashedly harkening back to earlier forms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Job restored after 15 years
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Job restored after 15 years
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Niranjan Adhikari has got back the job the government had been denying him for 15 years following his victory in a legal battle.        
	But justice for the 56-year-old, who joined the Sunderbans Development Board as assistant worksman on Monday, has come too late. I am only four years short of retirement. But thanks to the verdict, I stand clean, said the Canning resident.        
	Adhikari started working for the board as a contract labourer  first as khalasi and then as assistant worksman  in Kalinagar in North 24-Parganas in 1983. He and 170 others were made permanent employees after 13 years.        
	But on August 7, 1996, the day before Adhikari was to join the board as a permanent employee, he was arrested on the charge of staging a dharna in front of an official several years before.        
	They had accused me of illegally possessing arms. It was a false case and I was out on bail after 14 days but I was not allowed to join the board as the police report had gone against me, said Adhikari, the father of six children.        
	My client was acquitted of all charges in 2001 but the board still did not take him in, said Adhikarys lawyer Kaushik Chanda.        
	Adhikary moved the high court in 2005 seeking an order allowing him to join work but Justice Tapan Sen ruled that the case should first be dealt with by the state administrative tribunal. An appeal before a division bench was rejected.        
	My client then moved the tribunal but it turned down his plea in 2009. We challenged the order in the high court. On April 10, the division bench of Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay and Justice P.K. Dey ruled that until a person was found guilty, the government could not deny him job, said Chanda.        
	Adhikary, who will get a salary of Rs 18,000, will file a fresh plea claiming his wages for the past 15 years. He had to sell his eight cottahs of land to raise funds for his legal battle and to feed his family. No one can imagine the hardship I had to endure to marry off my three daughters, said Adhikary.

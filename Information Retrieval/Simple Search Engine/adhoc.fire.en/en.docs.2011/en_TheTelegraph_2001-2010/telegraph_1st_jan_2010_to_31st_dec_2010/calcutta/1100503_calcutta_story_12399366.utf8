The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Knight fans ahead in gear sales
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Knight fans ahead in gear sales

	The fans did what the Knights failed to do. The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), which missed out on a semi-final berth in the just-concluded IPL, has achieved a podium finish in the Battle of the Fans.         
	As Sourav Ganguly and his men in purple battled it out on the field, his teams fans were active online, bidding for team merchandise on ebay India, Indias leading e-commerce marketplace and a one-stop online destination for IPL 2010 merchandise.        
	The Battle of the Fans is a barometer we have created to track the popularity of an IPL team by the quantity of team merchandise bought by fans on eBay, explains Deepa Thomas, senior manager (pop culture), ebay. KKR has finished third with 11 per cent sales, behind finalists Mumbai Indians (at 27 per cent) and semi-finalists Deccan Chargers (at 26 per cent).         
	The IPL merchandise on offer on eBay India includes jerseys, t-shirts, caps, footwear and a wide range of fan gear from backpacks, key chains, fan capes, bottle chillers, cheering sticks, tattoos, cards, wrist bands and even trumpets.        
	Thomas is not surprised at KKR scoring so highly among fans despite the below-par showing. The Calcutta team has the biggest advantage of having Shah Rukh Khan on its side. That has generated a lot of interest worldwide, says Thomas.        
	Taking part in the bid were fans from countries as diverse as Bahrain and Barbados, Pakistan and Poland. The other factor working in favour of the team was the change in jersey colour. That made many fans buy the new jersey despite having the old black one, adds Thomas.        
	Based on our performance, it seems, we would have qualified for the Champions League, sighed a fan who had successfully bid for a KKR pack of cards online.

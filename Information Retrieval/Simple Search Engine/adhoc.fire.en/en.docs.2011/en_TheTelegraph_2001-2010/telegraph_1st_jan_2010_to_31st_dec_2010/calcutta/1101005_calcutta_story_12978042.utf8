The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bard cue for urban tale
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bard cue for urban tale
          MOHUA DAS                          A scene from In the Further Soil at the ICCR auditorium on Monday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	To study a banyan tree, you not only must know its main stem in its own soil, but also must trace the growth of its greatness in the further soil for then you know the true nature of its vitality.        
	 Rabindranath Tagore in a letter to C.F. Andrews        
	A dance and music theatre production that takes its cue from the Tagore letter and tells human stories from the urban landscapes of India and the UK premiered in the city on Monday.        
	The international cast of In the Further Soil sang, danced, spoke and made music to weave together segments from Tagores Gitanjali and a collection of stories and poems called Journeys with the personal experiences of the artistes into an hour-long performance at the ICCR auditorium.        
	The performance was backed by the Birmingham City Council, British Council, ICCR and the University of Birmingham. The production is a part of the People Dancing programme, a West Midlands cultural initiative in the run-up to the 2012 Olympic in London.        
	Brilliantly conceived, fascinatingly and professionally executed. This creation in its travels to other parts of India and the globe will do Bengal, our city and our country proud. It harks back to happy days of vibrant theatre that mesmerised us four decades ago, said actor Victor Banerjee after watching the performance.        
	The six-member international troupe will perform in Delhi and Mumbai before embarking on the UK leg of the tour. In the Further Soil reflects how cultures grow and flourish despite political and physical divides. It explores the life and philosophies of Indians and Londoners living different lives yet connecting on a larger plane, said Piali Ray, the co-producer of the project and the director of Sampad, a Birmingham-based organisation that promotes Asian art forms in Britain.        
	The director, Harmage Singh Kalirai  who has over 20 theatre productions, including Layla Mujnun and Heer Ranjha, and the film, Chicken Tikka Masala, that was nominated for the Raindance Award, under his belt  came together with the team of dance, music and theatre artistes from India and the UK in January at a choreo-laboratory at the Jaipur literature festival.        
	The ideas exchanged were developed into a full performance with an ensemble cast comprising British jazz saxophonist and rapper Soweto Kinch. It also includes London-based Bharatanatyam dancer and dance therapist Anusha Subramanyam and Shelley King, an Anglo-Indian actor who has performed at The National Theatre and Londons West End and was a part of the Bombay Dreams cast.        
	After auditions in Calcutta, Delhi and Bangalore, Sampad tuned in to three Bengal talents  percussionist Ratul Shankar Ghosh, who has been a part of world music projects, Sanjukta Ray, a young Odissi dancer who has also trained in the chhau, kathak, ballet and jazz forms, and singer-turned-actor Dibyendu Mukherji, who had started off singing for Orient Express before moving on to Bollywood playback.        
	The location is unknown but we use the metaphor of a railway station. It could be the railway platform at Howrah or the Euston station where the characters meet, interact and separate, said Harmage.

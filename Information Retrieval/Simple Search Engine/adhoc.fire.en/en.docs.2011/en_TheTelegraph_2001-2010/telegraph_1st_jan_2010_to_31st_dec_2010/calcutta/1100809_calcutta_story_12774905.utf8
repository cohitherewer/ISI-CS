          MADHURIMA CHATTERJEE                          A performance during the final round of the drama festival at Kala Mandir. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	The Annual Inter-School Drama Festival 2010, hosted by the British Council and Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), University of London, concluded on Friday evening at Kala Mandir.         
	Forty-four schools from across the state participated in the theatre workshops, writing, directing and performing plays. The aim behind the event was development of drama in classroom.        
	Kids from Army Public School, St Helens School, Sri Shikshayatan, Birla High School for Boys, Bidya Bharati Girls School, and Techno India Group Public School, Chinsurah, made it to the finals.         
	Theatre veteran Bruce Wooding (UK) and actors Emily Pollet (UK), Kaushik Sen and Churni Ganguly were on the judges panel and Moon Moon Sen was the chief guest.        
	The focus was on introducing a teaching method that is interactive and fun. Wooding said: There are a lot of transferable skills in drama that students can apply in their lives. Learn to act as a team, be confident, develop delivery skills, a sense of discipline, all of which can be of use in life.        
	Stressing the importance of holding on to the local flavours, while introducing international standards, Wooding added, A massive amount of intercultural exchange is the essence of festivals such as this. It is all about mutuality and cultural contextualisation.        
	The fact that the best actor, actress and teacher co-ordinator will get to visit the Central School of Speech and Drama in the UK for workshops was an added incentive for the finalists.        
	Sujata Sen, director, British Council, East India, said, Last year we had 14 schools, this year 44 and next year we hope more schools from the districts will come as well.        
	Vijay Sauryavanshi from Birla High School became the best actor. Mahasweta Chakroborty from Vidya Bharati Girls High School won the best actress prize.         
	The award for the best teacher co-ordinator went to Trina Ghosh of Techno India School.         
	Army Public School and Techno India School became the first and second runners up respectively. The overall winners were the boys of Birla High School whose portrayal of the countrys terror situation in Do We Have a Choice? had the audience enthralled.

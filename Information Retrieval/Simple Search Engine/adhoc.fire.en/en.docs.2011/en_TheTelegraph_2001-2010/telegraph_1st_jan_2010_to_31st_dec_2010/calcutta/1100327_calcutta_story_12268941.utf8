Why then the fear that an irrational faith in the state is leading corporate houses up a blind alley? Hear the views and insights of some important men of ideas at The Telegraph Panel Discussion on The faith corporates have in the budget is misplaced. Speakers: Ashok Desai, Ashok Ganguly, Pawan Munjal, Salman Khurshid, Suhel Seth and Udayan Bose. Moderator: Rudrangshu Mukherjee.

                      Of cathartic emancipation        Rabindranath Tagore wrote Raktokarobi (Red Oleanders) in 1923-24 during a visit to Shillong. He was inspired by the image of a red oleander plant crushed by pieces of discarded iron that Tagore had come across while taking a walk. Soon after, an oleander branch with a single red flower protruded through the debris, as if, he noted, ldquo;created from the blood of its cruelly pierced breast. rdquo; Red oleander indicates the beautiful but toxic nature of the flower and its association with beauty and death in the play. This unique play echoes the very rhythm of the unearthly and personal rousing of an individual in his or her eternal quest for truth and beauty. The immense humanism, the sheer vitality and that intoxication to appreciate nature rsquo;s timeless beauty coupled with Tagore rsquo;s social views set the mood of the remarkable work, Raktokarobi. Many renowned theatre personalities have worked on this play and now Jahnavi Centre for Performing Arts endeavours to present this play in the form of dance-theatre. The complexity of the play and its light and dark shades will be explored through different media including mime, puppet, mask, music and choreography. In fact, the stage will be treated as a blank canvas where the entire story would be treated as an installation. Madhuboni Chatterjee will delineate the character of Nandini in the Bharata Natyam style while the central character of the Raja (King of Darkness) will be essayed by popular Rabindrasangeet practitioner Manoj Murali Nair through Kathakali movements and expressions. He underwent rigorous training for the role under Kalamandalam Murali, who has also composed the Kathakali portions. Concept, direction and choreography: Madhuboni Chatterjee. Music composition: Manoj Murali Nair.

                              A band practises at Musebox. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                            
	Rehearsing for a rock group and maintaining good neighbourly relations are often not possible together. There seems to be a way out. You can book yourself a slot at a practice pad.        
	Rental jam rooms might have found their way into Calcutta a little late in the day compared to Delhi, Mumbai or Chennai, but their number is growing now with eight fully functional ones. What is most important is that these practice pads are sound-proof, says Lakkhichhara drummer Gaurab Chatterjee.         
	Cactus keyboardist Sudipto Banerjee aka Buti owns Butis Loudhouse. The 11ftx10ft room on the ground floor of his Hazra Road house is packed with bass and guitar amps, mixers and mikes.        
	When practising inside a room of concrete walls, theres a lot of slapback of the sound. Its important to have a room with absorption material, especially for loud acoustic instruments like the drum, he says. I had an unused room where Id practise but faced the same problem. Thats when I decided to create a professional practice space and maybe initiate good business.        
	Amit Chatterjee created a practice pad to help out musician friends desperate for a place to play their music loud. He had 45 bands on his roster over the past year.         
	The pads are air-conditioned rooms with wall-to-wall carpeting, padded with soundproofing material to minimise sound intrusion or bleeding and stacked with amplifiers, microphones, keyboard stands, monitors and drum kits. They charge between Rs 70 and Rs 150 per hour.        
	Setting up the room can take up to three months and cost between Rs 60,000 and Rs 2 lakh. The investment hasnt been tough to make up given the demand, says Nilanjan Mukherjee, guitarist for The Colors. While Musebox in Garia is booked for more than 24 hours a month, The Soundgarden registers nearly 80 hours of bookings.        
	The names of these pads are appropriately flamboyant: Verv, Octave, Purple Haze and Garage Rocks, spanning Salt Lake to Garia. Most are done up in dark, vibrant colours with graffiti on doors, posters on the walls and dim lights to heighten the mood. Some come with beds for members to relax in between the heavy duty jamming and some have adjoining storage rooms or a giant mirror to let a band know what it looks like in performance.         
	The doors to the jam rooms usually open at 10am and shut by 11pm, though Loudhouse might make an exception for a night shift.         
	We have a strict set of dos and donts to prevent the place from turning into an adda spot, says an owner. So its no smoking, no drinking, no shoes and no non-members inside the rehearsal space.                    MOHUA DAS

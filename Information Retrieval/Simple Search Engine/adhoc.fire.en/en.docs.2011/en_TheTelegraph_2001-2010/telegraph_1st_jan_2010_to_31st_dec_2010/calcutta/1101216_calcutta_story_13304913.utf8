The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Close shave after bus mishap
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Close shave after bus mishap
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The bus that jumped the railing (below) on VIP Road. (Sanat Kr. Sinha)                                            
	A CTC bus travelling down VIP Road on Thursday afternoon hit a stone and jumped a foot-high concrete railing before ramming into two cars parked under the slope of the yet-to-be opened flyover leading to the Bypass.        
	None of the 40-odd passengers on the bus on the Tollygunge-Barasat route was seriously injured.        
	It could have been a disaster. Several people would have died had the bus overturned while it was out of control for around 50m till crashing into the cars, said driver Dhruba Narayan Singh. We are lucky that no one was seriously injured, he said while sitting at Lake Town police station.        
	Singh did not slam the brakes immediately after hitting the stone because he thought that would have led to a mishap. I wanted to steer the bus to the left and then stop it but didnt get the opportunity as it went out of control, he recalled.        
	An officer of Lake Town police station said a case of rash and negligent driving had been filed against Singh.        
	Subir Moitra, one of the passengers, said the bus was travelling at a high speed when it suddenly swung to the right and then left. We heard a loud thud before the bus crashed under the flyover.        
	I couldnt understand how it all happened, said conductor Shatrudhan Prasad, who was injured in the left leg.        
	When Metro visited the spot, three concrete chunks big enough to topple a bus were lying on the road.        
	The cops, too, were surprised at the nature of the accident. Had there been anyone in either of the parked cars, he would have died on the spot, said an officer.

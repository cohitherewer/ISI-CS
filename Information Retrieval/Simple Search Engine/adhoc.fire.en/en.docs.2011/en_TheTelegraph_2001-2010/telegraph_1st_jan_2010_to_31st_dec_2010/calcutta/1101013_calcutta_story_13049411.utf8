          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The bail pleas of two Stephen Court Limited directors  Sushil Sureka and Pradeep More  were rejected on Tuesday, the day after the third director got interim bail from the high court.        
	The company is responsible for the upkeep of Stephen Court, where 43 people were killed in a blaze on March 23.        
	Sureka surrendered on September 17 and More on October 1.        
	The lawyers for Sureka and More submitted before the 12th metropolitan magistrate that their clients would extend all help to the investigators if they were let out on bail. The magistrate, however, rejected their pleas.        
	On Monday, a vacation division bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M.K. Chowdhury of the high court granted interim bail to Sanjay Bagaria, the third director of the company, till November 8.        
	Bagaria would be back in custody if he fails to get the bail confirmed by a regular bench of the court by then.        
	Murder cry: Police are looking for Ashim Mukherjee, a mason, who had allegedly murdered wife Meera by slitting her throat in their Muraripukur Road house on Tuesday morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Get yourself the German edge
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Get yourself the German edge
  - Firms tie up with chamber for B-course          SUBHRO SAHA                          The convocation ceremony for the batch of 2008-2010 in Mumbai                        
	Calcutta, which has enjoyed a special connection with Germany since decades, thanks to the dynamism of the Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan and the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, is set to boost the ties further with the rollout of a B-school course this August.        
	The 18-month post-graduate certificate programme in business administration is the flagship course of the Indo-German Training Centre (IGTC), the training wing of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce. The course will integrate six months of hands-on practical training in a collaborating member-company with a year of theoretical learning at the IGTC.        
	Through this programme, we facilitate a close interlocking of academic course work and on-the-job training into one learning system. It is a model where the corporate firms are both a destination for our students and a full partner in their education, explains Bernhard Steinruecke, director-general, IGCC.        
	The four-unit course, launched by the chamber in Mumbai in 1991 and subsequently in Chennai and Bangalore, debuts in Calcutta in August, with the theoretical classes to be held at Max Mueller Bhavan. A beginners course in German language, with stress on business conversation, has also been thrown in. Practical training for each student will be held at an assigned company, said an IGTC member.        
	In cooperation with each collaborating company, the training centre will facilitate the three stints of practical training, customised according to the companys post-training absorption requirements. This enables the company to examine the students potential. Students, in turn, learn to work responsibly and gain exposure to diverse areas of business management, said B.G. Roy, regional director of the chambers Calcutta chapter.        
	Some of the German and Indian companies partnering the initiative include Auma, Bajaj Allianz, Bayer, Bosch, DHL Express, Dorma, Fuchs Lubricants, Merck, Metro, Siemens and Volkswagen. The chamber has over 600 members in Calcutta and in the east.        
	The evaluation process at IGCC is two-fold: theoretical assessment in every subject in each phase at the training centre and practical appraisal by the collaborating company every two months. Examinations may be written, oral, through case studies, project assessments, or a combination of all these.        
	The programme fee is Rs 200,000 (plus service tax), payable in two installments on admission, before the commencement of the second theory phase. To apply, students can download the application form from www.igtcindia.com or alternatively, purchase the application form from any of the Indo-German Training Centres. Graduates with a minimum score of 50 per cent in engineering, commerce or law are eligible.        
	The faculty for the course is drawn from academicians and industry practitioners. The philosophy of sending students to the same training organisation for three stints of practical internship is unique. As a faculty, I see a distinct transformation in the students as they progress through the programme with this corporate exposure, said S.M. Fakih, general manager, strategy development, BASF Group in India.

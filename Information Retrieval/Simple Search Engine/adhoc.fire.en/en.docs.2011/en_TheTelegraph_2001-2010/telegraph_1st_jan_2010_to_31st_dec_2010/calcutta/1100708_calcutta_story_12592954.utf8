          MOHUA DAS                          Architect-turned-photographer Anwar Hossain in a city home. (Rashbehari Das)                                  
	Dhaka-born, Paris-based photographer Anwar Hossain was in town after almost two decades to spend a week with old friends. What kept him away for so long?         
	I really feel that there should be greater enthusiasm and effort from both the Indian and Bangladesh governments to facilitate better art and culture exchange, says Hossain.         
	Three of my best documentaries had an Indian chapter that I couldnt shoot and had to be shot by an Indian cameraman because of restrictions. I love coming back to India and wish we could do away with those barriers, he adds.         
	Although Hossain would rather be known as a cinematographer, his stills done casually have earned him recognition in countries across the world. I shoot whatever interests me and they end up in my photo books, exhibitions or the trunk, he smiles.        
	Back in Calcutta, Hossain has been clicking away at random. I got some lovely images of yellow ambassadors, three women huddled under an umbrella, rickshawpullers through a rain smattered car window, says Hossain, who will shoot a film on schoolchildren for Dhaka before returning to his French wife and his sons in Paris in September.         
	Hossain uses both digital and analogue technology to photograph people before converting the images into black and white.         
	But even after having lived for more than 25 years in the culture hub of France, nothing beckons the architect-turned-photographer more than Bangladesh where he spends three to six months every year working on films and shooting documentaries. Some of his films include Shurjo Dighol Bari, Lalon and Chaka.        
	I moved to France after a personal crisis and started a family there. But even though I enjoy being in France, I dont work there. France is an ocean and I cant be a drop of water there. Id rather be a drop of creative nectar in the heart of Bangladesh that needs me and my expertise. Also France tends to be semi-racist as far as art is concerned, says Hossain, who has been capturing Bangladesh for the last four decades.        
	He says it is difficult for non-white artists to hold exhibitions in Paris.         
	Hossain rues the lack of quality films from Bangladesh. Its sad but true that there are almost no real film directors in Bangladesh. The maturity and honesty one needs to be able to be a good director are missing. A new crop of filmmakers is trying to break the mould but they have a long way to go.         
	With 15 films and 30 documentaries to his credit apart from eight major photo books, Hossain now wants to organise his work. The first one I have in mind is a book I want to call The Indian Woman, says Hossain. To lend shape to his collection of Indian women photographed all over the world, Hossain has requested friend Moon Moon Sen to curate the project.

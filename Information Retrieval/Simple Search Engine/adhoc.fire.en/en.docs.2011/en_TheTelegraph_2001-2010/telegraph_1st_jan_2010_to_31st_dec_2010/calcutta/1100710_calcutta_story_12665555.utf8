The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic body to act after pond-fill reply
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civic body to act after pond-fill reply
          OUR BUREAU                                        The pond on Golf Club Road that was being filled up in   violation of a Calcutta Muncipal Corporation directive            A cart-load of garbage being dumped on a pond in Netaji Nagar            A pond in ward 105 which residents say   is being encroached on.  (Bishwarup Dutta)      
	The civic body had served a show-cause notice to the Calcutta Improvement Trust for filling up a water body on Golf Club Road a few days before an environment activist was assaulted for protesting the landfill.        
	We have served a show-cause notice to the agency (CIT) under Section 53 of the Town and Country Planning Act and are waiting for its response before deciding our course of action, Sanchita Mondal, the mayoral council member in charge of environment, said on Friday.        
	Mondal, who visited the pond between 14 and 17A Golf Club Road in ward 94 during the day, said there seems to be an attempt at filling up the water body.        
	Civic sources said municipal commissioner Arnab Roy had on July 1 shot off a letter to the CIT, asking it to stop the landfill which was in violation of the Town and Country Planning Act and the Fisheries Act.        
	The show-cause notice from the civic environment department followed a couple of days later.        
	CIT secretary J.K. Sadhukhan had earlier told Metro that it had probed the matter and would sent a report to the civic body soon.        
	A gang of 100 had assaulted green activist Dhrubo Mukherjee when he went to the spot on Wednesday and protested the landfill. The CIT, which was apparently filling up the pond to build a Centre-approved housing estate for slum-dwellers, had issued a stop-work notice on Thursday.        
	Councillor Mondal, who said her office was being flooded with complaints of pond-fill from across the city, also inspected a few water bodies in wards 98 and 105.         
	Parts of some of the ponds have been encroached on, while a few have been converted into dumps. I have asked my department to clear the ponds first.        
	Two waterbodies in Neli Nagar Colony and Asutosh Colony  both off Garfa Main Road in ward 105  were covered with thermocol, plastic sheets and branches. The sides of the ponds were lined with tin sheets, which an expert said was affecting the bio-diversity of the area.        
	Residents of Netaji Nagar in ward 98 alleged that a pond in their neighbourhood had been reduced to half. Metro saw a cart-load of rubbish being dumped on what the residents said was once a part of the water body.

                      Woes of womanhood                    Epics from all over the world abound in women who have been sinned against: Sita, Draupadi, Iphigenia, Antigone, and many more. Even in contemporary India, names like Roop Kanwar, Hamida Banu, Shah Bano and, more recently, Jessica Lal and Vaishnavi, only reaffirm the truth that men have always repressed, exploited and dominated over the lives of their womenfolk. Madhabi of The Mahabharata represents womanhood, perpetually demeaned, desecrated, debauched and deflowered to fulfil the desires and ambitions of men. Her story is a tempestuous journey of a woman confronting a hierarchy that is steeped in moral pretence and demonic in its desperation for status and power. Yet, this evenings premiere of Nandikars Madhabi presents more than just a feminist manifesto. Expectant in love, acquiescent in duties, subservient to hierarchy, Madhabi has all but lost her own identity. The world without batters her, but her soul, triggered by shocking acts of inhumanity, transforms her from being agonistic and indifferent to triumphant. More importantly, the trials of her life and her responses to them give us a chance to discover the boundless goodness endowed in each of our hearts. Drama: Bhisham Sahni. Adaptation, music and direction: Swatilekha Sengupta.                  Event: Play in Bengali, Madhabi, produced by Nandikar When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

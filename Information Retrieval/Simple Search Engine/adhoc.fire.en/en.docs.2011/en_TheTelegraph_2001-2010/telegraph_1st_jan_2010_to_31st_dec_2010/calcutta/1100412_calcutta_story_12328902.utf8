                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clash over extortion
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two gangs out to extort traders in and around the Sonagachhi red-light area fought and hurled bombs at each other in Burtolla on Saturday night. Four men were injured in the clash and three were arrested on the charge of rioting.        
	Some youths were collecting money from traders when another group of youths turned up and asked the traders to pay them instead. An altercation broke out, which led to fisticuffs and then indiscriminate hurling of bombs, said an officer of Burtolla police station.        
	The four injured were admitted to RG Kar Hospital.        
	By the time we reached the spot, both gangs had fled. Our sources told us that they were from neighbouring BK Pal Avenue and Beadon Street. We conducted raids and picked up three men, said another officer.

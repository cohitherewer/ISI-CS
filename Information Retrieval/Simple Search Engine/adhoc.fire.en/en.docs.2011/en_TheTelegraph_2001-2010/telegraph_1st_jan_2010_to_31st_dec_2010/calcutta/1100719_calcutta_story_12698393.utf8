          A STAFF REPORTER                          The unguarded rear entrance to Stephen Court on Sunday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Alarmed Stephen Court residents rushed to inspect their flats the day after an apartment in the building with police guards in front was found burgled.        
	At least 15 families entered their flats and took away whatever they could  from shoes to showpieces. But that may not be enough to keep thieves away. From Lalit Kumar Malhotras flat, even bathroom fittings and pipes were stolen.        
	It is shocking. We are entirely dependent on police for the security of our flats. The administration is preventing us from staying in our flats and letting thieves take away whatever is left behind, said Prateek Kayani, a fifth-floor resident of Block II.        
	Kayani, who has been staying at a rented place on Lowdon Street since the March 23 blaze in the Park Street landmark that killed 43 people, was among those who came on Sunday to check whether their belongings were intact. Thankfully, my flat was not burgled.... The cops seemed least bothered even after the theft at the Malhotras flat, Kayani said.        
	Cops posted in front of Stephen Court tried to calm the visiting residents saying the theft was a one-off incident. We are probing the theft and verifying the flat-owners statements. We will tighten the security around the building and deploy a few more men, said a senior officer.        
	There was, however, no sign of tighter security on the ground. While four policemen seated at the Park Street entrance were chatting, the Middleton Row entrance was unmanned. The Malhotras main door was intact, suggesting the thieves had entered through the Middleton Row end.

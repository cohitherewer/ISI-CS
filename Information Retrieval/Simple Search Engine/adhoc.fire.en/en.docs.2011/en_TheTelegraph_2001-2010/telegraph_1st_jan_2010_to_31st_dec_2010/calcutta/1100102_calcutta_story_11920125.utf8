	Parents spending sleepless nights over kindergarten admissions need no longer rush to the nearest nursery to prepare their children for the first entrance exam of their lives.        
	Reputable city institutions are bridging the gap between the pram and primary school with playhouses of their own to groom kids as young as two-and-a-half-years-old for formal education.        
	Calcutta Girls and Boys schools are set to introduce nursery sections this year with the minimum age for admission being three years. In both schools, the cut-off age for KG-I is four years.        
	Ram Mohan Mission School has also decided to introduce a pre-primary wing in Lake Gardens for children between two-and-a-half and three years.        
	Delhi Public School, New Town, will be adding sections to its pre-primary class during the next academic session to meet the demand for more seats.        
	Kasba resident Sanjukta Sarkar, who had admitted her elder daughter to a pre-primary school near home when she was two so that the girl knew the alphabet, numbers and shapes before kindergarten admission, is one of those breathing easy now.         
	Now my two-and-a-half-year-old younger daughter need not go to two schools in as many years. I intend taking her straight to Calcutta Girls School once the playhouse opens, she told Metro.        
	For most parents, the best thing about a playhouse within the school of their choice is that it means one hassle less  that of queuing up for admission again after the pre-school training is over.        
	Ruma Chandra, the principal of Delhi Public School (New Town), said there was no harm in opening a pre-primary section if a school had the requisite infrastructure. Working parents prefer to admit their children to a school where they can study from pre-primary to Class X or XII rather than to a playhouse from where they later have to switch to a formal school. We have the required infrastructure to cater to this segment, she added.                          
	Playhouses started sprouting in the city around seven years ago when the admission age for Class I was reduced to five-plus, against six-plus fixed by the government earlier.        
	The pre-school admission age has dipped further since then, said an official of the state Anglo-Indian school directorate.        
	Schools like St James have been taking in students at three years, while both the La Martiniere institutions as well as South Point have reduced the pre-primary admission age to two-and-a-half years.         
	The reputable playhouses charge approximately between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 at the time of admission. The monthly tuition fees ranges between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,500.         
	According to an estimate by the Anglo-Indian school directorate, the city has nearly 3,000 private pre-primary schools.

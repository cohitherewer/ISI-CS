          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court has some queries on the CID probe into the death of Besu student Soumik Basu, who many suspect was a victim of campus violence, and has asked a senior officer to appear before it with all relevant documents.        
	The court has some queries about the investigation. So this court is asking the special superintendent of the CID to come and answer (the queries) on March 16, Justice J. Biswas said, after the agency submitted its report.        
	The Siliguri boy, a third-year student of electrical engineering, fell off the second floor of a hostel on the morning of August 9, 2006. The campus was rocked the previous night by a series of clashes among students.        
	A critically injured Soumik was on life support at CMRI till he died on August 11.        
	The CID took up the case following an order from the chief minister but Soumiks parents  Ashok and Dipika  moved the high court in early 2008, pleading for a probe by a central agency.        
	Justice Biswas had, however, held that it would not be proper to disturb the CID probe and asked the state agency to file its report in a sealed cover.        
	The court was not satisfied with the report which was submitted today, said a lawyer who attended the proceedings.        
	Soumiks aunt Sangita Basu refused to comment on Justice Biswass order as the case was sub judice. The order followed a petition by us. So it would not be proper for us to comment at this stage.

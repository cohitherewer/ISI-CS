  - Whats on your mind this week                                              
	Lets just be ourselves        
	The film 3 Idiots holds up a mirror to the struggle for survival among young people today. We all want to be go-getters like Chatur Ramalingam. Yet Aamir Khans character, Rancho, is not so far removed from us. His love for knowledge and his zest for life are present in all of us, but we choose to ignore them in order to succeed in the rat race. We prefer to slog for short-term goals instead of focusing on the larger picture, as Rancho did. Why cant we be ourselves and let our own preferences guide our choices instead of trying to live up to societys ideal?

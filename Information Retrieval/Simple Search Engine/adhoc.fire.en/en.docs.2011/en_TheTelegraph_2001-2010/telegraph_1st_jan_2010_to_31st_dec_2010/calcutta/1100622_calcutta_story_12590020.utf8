The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Garden has cop station, lacks security
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Garden has cop station, lacks security
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Several trees were uprooted in the garden when cyclone Aila hit the city last year      
	The botanical garden in Shibpur pays Howrah police Rs 40 lakh annually for its protection, only to get a handful of allegedly disinterested cops lounging in lungis most of the time.        
	The Town outpost near the Andul Road gate of the garden was created by state government in 1973 solely to provide security on the premises.        
	The outpost supposedly has 26 police personnel  one sub-inspector, one head constable and 24 armed constables  yet the garden remains virtually unprotected. There are only three to four policemen in the garden and a few at the gates, said Hemanta Sekhar Debnath, who took over as the joint director of Indian Botanic Garden in April.        
	The garden authorities have filed over 100 FIRs since 1991. Nothing has come of those FIRs yet and theft and snatching continue unabated on the premises. Fences, lamp posts and cables regularly go missing. We pay Rs 40 lakh per annum to Howrah police for their services but the garden does not benefit, added the director.        
	On June 5, Howrah police superintendent Harikishore Kusumaker visited the garden to inaugurate battery-operated buses on the occasion of World Environment Day.         
	I showed him around the garden and pointed out how police personnel loitered inside in lungis, said Debnath.         
	According to him, Shibpur police station deploys personnel from the garden outpost elsewhere whenever they are in need of manpower.        
	Kusumaker denied the charges. The outpost is very much functional and the policemen posted there do their duty, he said.         
	The men posted there can obviously take time off and be in plainclothes in the garden. What is wrong with that? he asked.        
	The garden has been at the centre of controversy in the recent past.         
	While Girija Shankar Giri was the director, trees were allegedly felled inside and the wood removed through gaps in fences along the garden boundary bordering the Hooghly. A CID investigation was ordered after stumps of trees, allegedly axed, were found in the garden.         
	A team from the state forest department had visited the garden after the Aila devastation in 2009. Debnath refused to comment on the matter since it is sub judice.        
	Besides, film shoots and picnics are regular affairs in the over 200-year-old garden that has only recently been declared a plastic-free zone.  
	Charge sheet  
	 Action seldom taken on FIRs by garden authorities  
	 Policemen loiter in the garden ignoring their duty  
	 Theft and snatching rampant  
	 Fences, lamp posts and cables regularly go missing

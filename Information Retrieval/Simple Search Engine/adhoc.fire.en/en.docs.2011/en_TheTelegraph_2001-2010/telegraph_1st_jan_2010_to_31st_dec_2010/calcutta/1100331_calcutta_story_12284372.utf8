                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Snag snaps power

	Power went out in many areas across the city around 9.10pm on Tuesday night following a snag in the CESC network. Company sources said soon after that the supply would be restored within two hours.        
	The generation was full but the distribution went offline because of the snag, said a CESC official.        
	The affected areas included the Shyambazar, Sovabazar, Girish Park, Lake Town, Ultadanga, Kankurgachhi, Esplanade, Shakespeare Sarani, Elgin Road, Gariahat and Tollygunge areas.        
	Parts of south Calcutta faced prolonged power cuts throughout the day because of maintenance work at CESCs South City distribution centre.        
	Repairs may disrupt supply in the Baguiati, Dum Dum Park, Kestopur, Nagerbazar, Tiljala, Chowbhaga, Christopher Road and the Park Circus connector areas on Wednesday.

Co-existence holds the key          NANDINI SARAF                          EARTH DAY
  APRIL 22, 2010                  
	Tiger: Human beings are cutting trees, killing animals and with each passing day, it is becoming dangerous for us to survive.         
	Penguin: Why are humans doing this?         
	The answer to the question is rhetorical, but the message clear. Masked in a puppet show, the conversation highlighted one of the most pertinent issues plaguing the earth  global warming. Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) observed Earth Day on its premises with a gamut of activities, like identification of trees, puppetry, quiz and lecture.         
	About 1,700-odd students from across 19 city schools like South City International, Loreto Day School (Sealdah), National High School for Girls, Sacred Heart Mission and Holy Child School trooped in for the days event.         
	Natural resources are being continuously depleted, a trend that needs to be arrested. To maintain the ecological balance, all species need to co-exist and every child has to understand this. Our objective is to convey the message to the young generation in an enjoyable way, said E. Islam, director, BITM.         
	The identification of trees was organised for classes IV to VII. Class V student Labonya Chaudhuri beamed: I identified the banyan, lemon and hibiscus tree. The lemon tree serves as a reservoir of drinks in this hot weather, said the student of Young Horizons School.         
	The quiz, conducted by Dilip Ghosh, education officer of BITM, for classes VI to XI, was not in the regular question- answer format but as an interactive session, where the next question sprung from the previous answer, followed by a detailed explanation.

	Which gas causes the greenhouse effect other than carbon dioxide, he asked. From the answer, methane, sprung the next question: What is the most dangerous spot in which methane is produced? The answer was in a paddy field.        
	The quiz was followed by a talk on Origins of the Earth by Tarak Mohan Das, former professor of zoology of Ballygunge Science College. He spoke about the history of the Earth and the solar system.         
	For some of these students, it was not just a day to while away but incorporate the lessons in everyday life.         
	We should rely more on renewable sources of energy, like solar power and rainwater harvesting. In our day-to-day life, we should stop deforestation, use jute bags and recycle paper, asserted Aditi Mehra of South City International School.          
	WAKE-UP WALK: Calcutta police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti leads the walk for Ingenium 2010, St Xavier rsquo;s Collegiate School rsquo;s programme to spread awareness on Earth Day. On the 29th, there will be power-point presentations and panel discussions, a nature quiz and even a one-act play to focus on growing environmental problems.

The middle and junior levels made fans and bags out of paper and book marks and pen stands with ice-cream sticks. They put potted plants on the window sills of classrooms and a small basin of water for birds to drink from.             
	MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth, Howrah: A rally was taken out and saplings presented as a mark of solidarity.           
	About 150 poor kids attended the Earth Day commemoration at Victoria Memorial. They drew and performed skits on preservation of water, waste management and the need for growing trees

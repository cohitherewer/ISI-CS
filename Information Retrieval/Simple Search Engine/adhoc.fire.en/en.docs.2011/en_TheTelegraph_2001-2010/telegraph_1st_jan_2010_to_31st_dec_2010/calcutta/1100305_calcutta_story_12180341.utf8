                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lonely couples suicide pact
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Standalone: The scooter on which the Sarkars would go shopping. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                          
	An elderly south Calcutta couple wracked by loneliness after their only son took up a job in Bangalore lost the will to live and attempted suicide, only to end up being tragically separated with the husband being found alive.        
	Manoranjan and Sikha Sarkar, aged 64 and 56, wrote a 12-page suicide note expressing how lonely they were and pledging the Rs 4,000 they had kept aside for their last rites.        
	The couple said the money could also be used to send their bodies for cadaver donation, if their 22-year-old engineer son Debjyoti so wished.        
	The pair then consumed what doctors suspect was an overdose of sleeping pills. Some relatives who had gone to Southern Garden apartments, a part of Chhattisgarh Housing Complex near Patuli, to check on the couple on Thursday morning found Sikha dead after breaking open the main door. A source close to the family said the relatives suspected something was amiss because the couple werent answering their phone.        
	Manoranjan, a retired official of the National Thermal Power Corporation, was found unconscious and admitted to Peerless Hospital with severe symptoms of poisoning. Sources in the hospital said his condition was critical.        
	Debjyoti, who had joined a Bangalore firm as a trainee last year after earning an engineering degree from an institute in that city, arrived in Calcutta on Thursday afternoon after being informed about the tragedy. He was unavailable for comment.        
	A senior officer of South 24-Parganas police said there was no immediate reason to suspect foul play because the suicide note, penned in Bengali, seemed authentic and mentioned that the couple were frustrated with their loneliness. The note doesnt blame anyone for their act, he added.        
	We will examine the suicide note in detail on Friday. We will also have it examined by a handwriting analyst, said S.K. Chaudhury, the additional superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas.        
	A relative said the Sarkars were always together. They would go shopping on their scooter and for walks in the evening. They also own a steel grey Maruti Alto but that would be used only when their son came visiting from Bangalore, he added.        
	Neighbours of the Sarkars described them as a normal couple. We couldnt have imagined they would do something like this, said a neighbour who lives on the third floor of the same building and had last seen the couple around a week ago.        
	The gatekeeper of the building said he last met the couple either on Monday or Tuesday evening, when they had sent him to buy brinjal and green chillies from the market. They looked perfectly normal, he recalled.        
	The medical superintendent of Peerless Hospital Sudipta Mitra, said Manoranjans gastric lavage would be sent to the local police station on Friday for analysis. For now all we can say is that he did not consume anything corrosive like an acid. It could be sleeping pills, added Mitra.

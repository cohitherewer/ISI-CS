The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Missing mom back home
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Missing mom back home
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Radha Das with her son on Sunday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	A 27-year-old woman who went missing after leaving for Gwalior on work in May has returned home.        
	Cops from Lalbazar and Karaya police station brought Radha Das back from Delhi, where she was working as a help. The chief judicial magistrates court handed her over to her father Ganesh Gayen on September 29.        
	Radha had left for Gwalior after a city-based agency, Sakuntala, got her a maids job there. The news of her going missing brought to light the lack of proper monitoring of agencies that help people get jobs outside the state.        
	The police said they would frame guidelines for such agencies and keep a tab on their activities. We are planning to monitor the agencies that send girls on work to places across the country, said Damayanti Sen, the joint commissioner of police (crime). Sen led the probe into Radhas disappearance.        
	Radha said the Gwalior family had given her Rs 500 and asked her to leave as they were dissatisfied with her work.        
	Another Bengali girl who was working there as maid told me about an agency in Delhi. I went there and got a job. I gave the phone number of my home to the agency authorities but they did not inform my parents that I had shifted to Delhi. I could not call home because I later misplaced the notebook where the number was scribbled, Radha said at her parents home in Kalighat, where she shifted with her six-year-old son Subho after her husband deserted her a few years ago.        
	Ganesh had moved court alleging that the agency and the police were not taking any initiative to trace his daughter.        
	He said the agency had informed him that Radhas employers in Gwalior had put her on a train back home three days after she reached there. The agency shirked all responsibilities after learning that she had not reached home, said Ganesh        
	Niranjan Jhagaria, the co-owner of Sakuntala, said: We had called the family in Gwalior and got the father speak to them. What else could we have done? According to Jhagaria, a maid works for a year before getting a months leave to visit her family. But if someone returns earlier, its not our responsibility.        
	Radhas son Subho is very happy to get his mother back. He was waiting for her to bring new clothes for Puja. Ma is back and I am happy.

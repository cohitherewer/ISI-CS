                    At the crossroads of cultures                Prabuddha Dasgupta, the enfant terrible of modern Indian pictorial photography, grew up in the cultural chaos of post-colonial India. A self-taught photographer, Dasgupta broke the shackles of 200 years of Victorian morality imposed by the British colonialists with the publication of Women, a controversial collection of portraits and nudes of urban Indian women in 1996 (Viking Books). In the decade that followed, Dasgupta pursued a variety of photographic projects, while unapologetically straddling the two worlds of commissioned and artistic work, bringing to both, a bold, individualistic sensibility that quickly placed him in the ranks of major photographic talent in the country. Dasgupta's new book, Edge of Faith, published by Seagull Books, is a portrait of the Catholic community in Goa rarely seen before  a portrait of people torn between their fidelity to a history of Portuguese faith and culture and their post-Independence Indian identity. In addition, acclaimed travel-writer William Dalrymple provides an accompanying text that explores both the history of Goas Catholic past and its struggle to deal with its multi-cultural, multi-religious present. The Edge of Faith captures Catholic Goa in a haunting, but beautiful impasse  caught in a time warp between comforting nostalgia and a doubt-ridden, insecure future.                              Event: An exhibition of photographs by Prabuddha Dasgupta When: Till February 3; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

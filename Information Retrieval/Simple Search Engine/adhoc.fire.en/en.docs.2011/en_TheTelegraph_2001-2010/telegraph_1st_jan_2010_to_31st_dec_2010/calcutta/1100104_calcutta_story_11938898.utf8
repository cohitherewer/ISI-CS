The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pneumonia blame on Celsius amp; poison air
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pneumonia blame on Celsius amp; poison air

	Pneumonia has become the scourge of the season with Celsius lows combining with high air pollution to send many like former chief minister Jyoti Basu to hospital.        
	According to doctors, there has been a 20 per cent increase in the incidence of pneumonia in the city over last year.         
	The majority of the patients admitted to intensive care units of various hospitals are suffering from pneumonia, chronic bronchitis or other chest infections, said critical care expert Subrata Maitra.        
	The high-risk groups include the elderly, infants and those with pre-existing medical conditions like chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and asthma.        
	Salt Lake resident Ranajit Sekhar Chandra, 81, is one of the many patients above 70  Jyoti Basu is 95  in intensive care for severe pneumonia. He was complaining of respiratory distress along with wheezing episodes and momentary loss of consciousness. We first put him on oxygen support but his condition worsened on Sunday morning, forcing us to shift him to hospital, said son Surojit, a state government official.        
	Pulmonologist Ashok Sengupta said winter was not so much the cause of the increase in the incidence of pneumonia as the sudden drop in temperatures last fortnight and the rise in pollution. Air pollution affects the lung and respiratory system, making it weak and susceptible to virus attacks that often trigger pneumonia, he added.        
	Patients with chronic renal failure and those on dialysis are also vulnerable to pneumonia because they lack the immunity of a healthy person, say doctors.         
	Among children, those under two years account for the highest number of paediatric hospitalisations for pneumonia. In winter, the metapneumo virus becomes active along with other viruses. These are directly responsible for the increase in pneumonia cases, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health.         
	The good news is that viral pneumonia is self-limiting in 90 per cent of the cases and can be quickly controlled with antibiotics and supportive therapy. The fatality rate is high for the remaining 10 per cent, Ghosh said.        
	So how can Calcuttans get through what could yet be the coldest winter this decade without having to battle a bout of pneumonia?        
	 An influenza vaccine is very important. It may not completely eliminate the chances of pneumonia but it definitely reduces the chance of the disease, said Maitra.         
	Those in the high-risk groups are also advised against exposure to cold and rapid fluctuations in temperature. Asthma and patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder must not forget their regular medicines, said pulmonologist Sengupta.        
	Pneumonia is characterised by a sudden rise in body temperature accompanied by chill, bodyache and wheezing.  
	Do    Vaccinate against influenza   Wear adequate winter clothing  Take medicines if you have asthma or similar conditions    
	Don rsquo;t    Expose yourself to rapid fluctuations in temperature  Step out in the cold if you are not well-protected  Neglect fever if it comes with wheezing and body ache

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Foreign orders desert idol hub
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Foreign orders desert idol hub
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          An artisan makes a fibreglass idol. (Amit Datta)                                  
	India might have escaped the worst of the economic downturn but Kumartuli is still feeling its pinch.        
	The idol-makers hub has got low prices and few orders from abroad for the second consecutive year since Bengalis in the West curtailed Puja budgets to cope with the economic crisis.         
	For instance, Prodyut Paul, who in 2008 sent more than 10 Durga idols overseas, got three orders in 2009 and only two this year. I may get one or two more orders, but I am not sure. There were 18 enquiries but only two materialised, he says.         
	Orders from overseas are important because they pay more and are placed early. The money we earn from them is invested in making idols for the local market, says Mintu Pal, a joint secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity. He has only one order from abroad  from Mauritius  this year.         
	The idols shipped abroad are mostly made of fibreglass. Each takes a month to make and costs approximately Rs 1 lakh. A clay idol of the same size would cost Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000. More orders from abroad means more money from fewer idols, according to Babu Pal, a joint secretary of the Samity.        
	Kaushik Ghosh says he has 26 orders from the US, Europe, and other places. But the customers are reluctant to pay the quoted price. Budgets are still tight, he explains.         
	Organisers abroad admit that they have become tight-fisted. Jayanta Panda, a member of a Bengali association in the heart of Silicon Valley, says they did not choose the most expensive idol despite many liking it. The downturn had slightly less impact here compared with the rest of the country. Still many of our activities have been affected, he adds.

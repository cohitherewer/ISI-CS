The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pump problem on fringes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pump problem on fringes
          SUBHAJOY ROY                           A waterlogged stretch in Tangra during monsoon                                  
	The waterman mayor-to-be has a waterlogging problem waiting for him on the city fringes with 27 pumps bought under the Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project (CEIP) in early-2009 malfunctioning.        
	Officials of Worthington Pump India Limited, from which the pumps were bought, said there was nothing wrong with the pumps.         
	We installed two of the pumps in a new pumping station at Kasba and two in an existing pumping station at Chingrihata, replacing old pumps, said a senior CEIP official.         
	Since none of the pumps worked properly, we had presumed that the other 23 pumps also would not and had asked the company to replace all the pumps last year, he added.         
	The pumps are meant to drain out water that accumulates in the sumps  large underground reservoirs in the pumping stations  into adjacent canals. Underground sewers carry water from the streets to the sumps.         
	The company has agreed to change some of the pumps, including the ones installed at Kasba and Chingrihata, added the CEIP official.         
	A senior official of Worthington, however, said: The question of replacing pumps does not arise. At Chingrihata, there was 1.2m silt underground, which was not supposed to be there. At Kasba, the minimum water level required was not available, said Uday Shankar Roy, the general manager of the company.         
	The blame game has stalled the installation of the rest of the pumps. We would not be able to install the pumps this monsoon, said the CEIP official.        
	That means large parts of Kasba, Topsia and Tangra, where the pumps were supposed to have been set up, would continue to be submerged after showers.        
	The faster the pump drains out water from the sump, the quicker the water recedes on the streets, explained a CEIP engineer.        
	Mayor-in-waiting Sovan Chatterjee, who had earned the moniker Jol Sovan or waterman during his stint as mayoral council member (water), said he would comment after finding out about the problem.         
	Both Worthington and CEIP have turned to the mechanical engineering department of Jadavpur University for a verdict on the pumps. Its difficult to say when we would be able to submit our report but we are doing the job on a priority basis, said a teacher in the department.

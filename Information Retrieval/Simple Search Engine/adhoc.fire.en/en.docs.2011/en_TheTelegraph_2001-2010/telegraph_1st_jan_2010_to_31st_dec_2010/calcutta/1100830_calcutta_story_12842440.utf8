The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Market mantra in varsity success
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Market mantra in varsity success

	Universities should come out of ivory towers and commercialise results of research, believes the man who headed a pioneering effort to turn around the fortunes of a British university.         
	This is 21st century, universities need to reach out to the society, exploiting research and collaborating with the industry, said Sir William Wakeham, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, UK, and its international secretary, and a former vice-chancellor of Southampton University.        
	Wakeham was delivering a lecture From university research to economic and social benefit at Jadavpur University, as part of a series organised by the British Deputy High Commission.         
	Since government universities are run on public money its their obligation to pay back the society, said Wakeham, citing examples how three British institutes Imperial College, London, University of Southampton and Exeter University  turned entrepreneurs to earn billions of pounds.         
	Drawing from his experience with Southampton University he illustrated how a decaying port city was rejuvenated after the university began commercialising research, creating spin-off companies.        
	Optical fibre companies created from university research captured the multi-billion pound market in Internet business, he said. A company was also listed in the London Stock Exchange.        
	According to him, universities should deploy management processes to run these entrepreneurial wings. There should be complete autonomy and the staff working in these units must be tuned to the market, he said.        
	He stressed the need to exploit intellectual property, attract venture funding, create incubators, science parks and nurture business managers, even while pursuing academics. In India, IITs have begun treading the entrepreneurial path, and now it is time other government institutes catch up with them, said Sir Wakeham.        
	He also said since Indian universities follow the British model, it would be good for them to learn from mistakes committed by the British universities.

	If you are a fan of sci-fi films and were thrilled to watch the antics of the loveable Wall-E or Arnold Schwarzeneggers cyborg assassin-turned-protector in the Terminator franchise, how would you feel if you had the chance to build your own robot?         
	This was the opportunity 16 youngsters had at a summer camp organised by robo.in at the Reliance World store on Syed Amir Ali Avenue from May 31 to June 5. Robo.in is a venture of ThinkLABS, the robotics training and education division of the company TRI Technosolutions, founded by a group of IIT Bombay alumni.        
	The six-day camp, targeted at students grouped into junior (from Class IV to VI) and senior (from Class VII to XII) categories, aimed to teach participants the principles of physics and mathematics that govern robotics. The charges for the camp were Rs 3,999 for juniors and Rs 4,999 for seniors.         
	Said Ashish Chowdhury, one of the members of robo.in who conducted the camp: I have held camps in several Indian cities, but found that kids from Calcutta are quicker in picking up concepts.        
	The juniors were provided with a robonaut kit to build simple robots, including a remote control, a plastic gear box, a meccano set and motor shaft connectors. Remote-controlled cars, a pick-and-place robot and a garbage-collecting robot were only some of the things the kids made at the camp.         
	Said Joy Bhardwaj, a Class VI student from Navy Children School, Port Blair, who was in the city for his summer vacations: I really enjoyed the camp. My favourites were the kicker and gripper robots. With a remote control, they can be made to move and kick or pick up things on the ground.        
	The seniors used an i-Pitara kit that includes more than 50 components, like a micro-controller chip, multiple sensors and mechanical building blocks. Said La Martiniere for Boys student, 14-year-old Devang Kumar: I have always been interested in mechanics and have made my own miniature cars, boats and propellers using materials from the hardware store. I picked up a few pointers at the camp. Firefighters, obstacle-avoiders and light followers were some of the items the seniors made.         
	Youngsters who want to keep up their interest can even visit ThinkLABS website and buy robotics equipment online.         
	The participants can also take part in the National Robotics Competition, held every year at IIT Bombay. The winner of the contest is taken on a trip to Nasa.

	Date with dolphins   
	Science City is screening daily shows of the Academy Award nominated film, Dolphins, from June 10. In the 40 minute documentary, viewers get a glimpse into the lives of the inquisitive Atlantic spotted dolphins, acrobatic dusky dolphins, and the bottlenose dolphins from the coral reefs of the Bahamas to the wind-swept seas of Patagonia. The viewers follow marine biologists Kathleen Dudzinski, Bernd Wursig and Alejandro Acevedo-Gutierrez, as they research the communication of wild dolphins with innovative scientific methods. The voice-over has been rendered by Pierce Brosnan while the music is by Sting. The film is produced and directed by MacGillivray Freeman Films in association with the National Wildlife Federation. It was nominated in the ldquo;best documentary short subject rdquo; category by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2000. Science City will host five to seven daily shows of the film for the next six months from 11.30 am.							   
	THE DIARY   
	Aporia  
	I sit and dissolve
  The neutral and neon
  In the fourth dimension.
  Paraphrasing all that you spoke of
  Between the born and the yet to be.  
	Dissolve another colour on my palette
  And create another on the black canvas,
  Blackened already by soliloquies
  That I ate last night And threw the remains upon the sodden floor.   
	Water from my glands streamed down
  my collar bone and down the throat,
  We both stood with a soliloquy on our lips.
  The rain camouflaged the streaming tears,
  I silently swallowed mine.  
	Shubharthi Pandey    
	The world  
	The world that sleeps and recreates,
  Is not mine,
  I survive where there is pain.
  I live because I can rsquo;t die.
  I live because I know That I am not consumed yet,
  Yet I want to live.
  You would not know why
  For you are not me.
  But I am forever yours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citizens take the civic stage
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Citizens take the civic stage
  - Me the Mayor: From an empty chair in the deserted HQ
										      On Sunday morning, while the city was busy (or not busy) voting, Chandrima S. Bhattacharya slipped into the mayor rsquo;s chair in the deserted seat of civic governance.                                    
	Some chairs are made for men, some for women.        
	Chairs that are made for men are usually spacious and when a woman lowers herself into it, she knows it was not meant for her, for she feels small and wanting.        
	As she seats herself the first woman from the city feels so too. The mayors chair is large, black, padded and with a tall backrest. There is another sign that it was meant for a man: it is anti-macassared with a white towel. The roots of this ancient and indigenous tradition are not well-known, but they have something to do with bureaucracy, our colonial past and sweating male backs.        
	It is not easy for a woman to feel at home at once in the mayors vast room at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), if she is conscious of her gender. Apart from the chair, the walls above on both sides and in front are lined with photographs of all previous mayors, starting with CR Das (1924) and ending with Subrata Mukherjee (2000-2005). Soon, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas portrait will hang beside Mukherjees. Not a sari in sight; the formidable men bear down on the latest occupant with the weight of tradition.        
	What does a woman do?        
	Right before her lies the vast green-felt-top table. It seems to stretch for yards. Beyond that is a seating area with four sofas. The room is big enough to contain one-and-a-half badminton courts.        
	And beyond the room stretches the city, even vaster than the mayors room. There is another difference: the mayors room is squeaky clean. The white towel, despite what it is, is spotlessly white and soft and the room, which has not been tampered with much since the beginning, exudes a quiet dignity.        
	The city is a cesspool.        
	The CMC building is not exactly clean either.         
	The mayor enters the building using the staircase that just has a sad miniature model of the Netaji statue at Shyambazar at its base. But the corridor that leads to the office is painted with betel juice. As elsewhere in the city the little red showers are often topped by the appeal: Please do not spit (in Bengali, ekhane thuthu pheliben na).        
	The showers line several corridors of power, which are also dotted with countless food-vendors selling rosogolla, chomchom, sandesh, puri torkari  the Bengali tiffin. Tea boys walk up and down carrying dripping kettles.        
	The toilets, about 60 of them, were unusable in the early 90s. Now they are better, though the automatic fittings installed during mayor Asim Barmans tenor were stolen and replaced with manual ones. But they are not inviting. The canteen below, which cooks a humble, but edible fare for a humbler price, is even less inviting.        
	And the files. They spill out of the shelves, from the tables, from the rooms, from the cupboards, and into the corridor. They are everywhere, getting into the way, stopping new paper from being looked at, containing within them unresolved problems that could have made so many lives in the city better. There should be a graveyard for the files.        
	One has to start somewhere, the new mayor thought. Why not with cleaning up her own house? Charity  or work  begins at home, and such statements go well as headlines with her gender too.         
	It may be choice or determination, but no one understands the business of cleaning better than a woman. There are rewards. The pleasure of successfully removing a deep betel juice stain is enormous. Those who have done it know.        
	So she will start with the betel juice. And think of ways to clean up the whole city. Howrah bridge must be saved. Much of Calcutta is crumbling.        
	One must begin somewhere.

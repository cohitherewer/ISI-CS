	IIM Calcutta will offer lessons on green management and green technology from the current academic year.         
	A green management component will be part of the flagship two-year postgraduate diploma in management, said institute director Shekhar Chaudhuri on the sidelines of a programme at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday.         
	A course on green manufacturing will be made a part of the one-year postgraduate programme for executives for visionary leadership in manufacturing offered by the Joka institute along with IIT Kanpur and Madras.        
	A green manufacturing course is being added to the leadership programme from this year. We will make arrangements so that those who had completed the programme earlier can also attend the course, said Chaudhuri.        
	He stressed the need for industry to demand knowledge of green technology from the students.

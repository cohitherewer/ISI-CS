                      World of intemperance                                    Human activity forms the cornerstone of the works of A Rajeswara Rao. His paintings are invariably set against a socio-cultural backdrop with no room for nostalgia. His exceptional skill and fine artistry redirects his sensibilities to invest in intrinsic compartments of the human psyche, appropriately heightened by the dimensions offered by acrylic on paper, the medium of his preference. Phir Wohi Doodh, the ongoing show of his recent watercolour and acrylic works, forms a segment of his shift from situational to personal and from local to universal. The works on show initially attempt to describe everyday activities  self-conscious performative arts, exclusive mannerisms, commonly practised by influential people who are worthy of imitation by others. These gestures and attitudes transform into highly articulate and sophisticated efforts by those anxious to identify themselves with the social elite. As a result, a common activity expands into an act loaded with socio-cultural significance. The title of the show is a metaphor for repetition, pretension, irony and self-gratification. What is important in Raos work is the implication of satire and the effort to find pleasure in peoples makeover, resulting in a dark humour.

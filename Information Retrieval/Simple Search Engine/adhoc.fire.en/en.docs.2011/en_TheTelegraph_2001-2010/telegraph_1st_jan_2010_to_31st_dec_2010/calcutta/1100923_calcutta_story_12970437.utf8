                A SpiceJet flight with 131 passengers was stranded at Dum Dum airport for about three hours because of a glitch on Wednesday. The flight, scheduled to leave at 4.50pm, experienced technical problems during take-off. Passengers had to wait for more than two hours and go through another round of security check before being put up on another flight at 7.50pm.    Amin Ansari, the CPM councillor of ward 137, was diagnosed with dengue on Wednesday and was admitted to Kothari Medical Centre and Research Institute. His brother, Shamsuzzaman Ansari, a Trinamul Congress mayoral council member, said Amin was suffering from high fever for the past two days.    A youth died and another sustained injuries when a Sealdah-bound local train hit them near Majherhat station on Wednesday evening. Mousin Gazi, 20, and Dipika Bag, 18, were walking close to the railway tracks when the train hit them from behind. Both were taken to a nursing home in Budge Budge where Gazi succumbed to his injuries. Dipika was released after preliminary treatment.

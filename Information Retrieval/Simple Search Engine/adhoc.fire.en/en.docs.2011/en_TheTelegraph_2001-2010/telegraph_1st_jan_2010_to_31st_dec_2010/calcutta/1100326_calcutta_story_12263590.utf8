The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire amp; ice minister
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fire amp; ice minister

	The good student that he is, Pratim Chatterjee decided to keep mum on Thursday after shooting from the lip on Wednesday and landing in a spot.         
	When he finally broke his silence at the end of a day of solitude in his Writers Buildings chamber, the minister with a penchant for histrionics in both reel and real life said with hands folded: Aami tomader ke tumi bolchhi na. Aapni bolchhi. Doya kore ei ghor theke beriye jaan (I am requesting you to please leave this room).         
	The countrys only fire services minister would not be coaxed into making a comment even when told that the chief minister had praised his department and criticised the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for regularising the illegal addition of floors to Stephen Court.        
	You are the seniormost minister, why are you being so reticent? The chief minister has praised your department and criticised the CMC in the Assembly. What do you have to say? asked a reporter.        
	Chatterjees patience was wearing thin. Arrey baba, bolechhe to bolechhe(if he has said it, so be it), he shot back.        
	So has Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees endorsement strengthened his resolve not to resign? Proshnoi nei kalke Vidhan Sabha-e to bollam (There is no question of resigning...I said so in the Assembly yesterday).        
	But wont he at least try to identify and rectify his departments flaws?        
	You suggest to me what I should do. Right now, workers are clearing the debris (at Stephen Court). Do you want me to wield a spade and join them? I have said enough. I wont say a word more. You people think you are very clever but your offices have cleverer people, said Chatterjee.         
	Asked whether he knew who would be in the fire probe committee, Chatterjee pointed a finger to his left (where Bhattacharjees chamber is) and said: I dont know. The chief minister knows.        
	Aides said the usually eager-to-talk minister, who has drawn flak for shirking moral responsibility for the delayed rescue efforts at Stephen Court, was pensive throughout the day and had asked them not to let in any journalist or photographer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bhutans gateway
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bhutans gateway
										      caleidoscope                        The fair on the consulate grounds. (Amit Datta)				                           
	Bhutan registered its diplomatic presence in Calcutta with the formal opening of a consulate in Dum Dum last month. Lyonpo Ugyen Tshering, the foreign affairs minister of Bhutan, flew down to attend its inauguration, where the governor of Bengal, Devanand Konwar, was the chief guest as consul-general Dasho Tsering Wangda played host.        
	The plaque of Bhutan House was unveiled and a magazine on Indo-Bhutan relations published by the Indo-Bhutan Friendship Association was also launched.         
	Speaking of his Bengal connection, Tshering said: I have always been fond of Darjeeling, having studied in North Point School there for 11 years.         
	The consulate in Calcutta is Bhutans first in India. Calcutta is very important to us as the gateway to the world, Tshering said.         
	A fruit and tourism fair was organised on the lawns of the consulate, in which oranges and apples from Phuntsholing were the star attractions. Our biggest markets in India are Malda and Siliguri. We are trying to tie up with the local chambers of commerce here, said Lungpa Tandin, the secretary-general of Bhutan Exporters Association.         
	Also on sale were 36 varieties of jams, pickles, canned fruits and vegetables under the Royal Bhutan label. Bhutanese travel agencies at the fair urged more people to visit their country as Indian nationals dont need a visa to travel to Bhutan. A colourful dragon dance brought the curtain down on the evening.        
	Romance rung wrong        
	At the stroke of midnight, when Calcutta was busy ringing in the New Year, a sober young man received a call from a sozzled young man. Okey phone ta din (Hand the phone over), slurred the voice. O-ta ke (who to)? he replied, puzzled. Jar phone, shey (To she who owns the phone), the voice retorted, irritated.         
	Look, this phone belongs to me, the man replied, and disconnected. Some moments passed in silence; then the phone rang again. The same voice was pleading this time. Please kaku, ekti bar din phone ta. Shudhu happy new year bolbo (Please uncle, hand the phone to her. I will just wish her for the New Year).         
	The message, obviously, never reached. We have no information on the state of the romance in 2010.       SUDESHNA BANERJEE

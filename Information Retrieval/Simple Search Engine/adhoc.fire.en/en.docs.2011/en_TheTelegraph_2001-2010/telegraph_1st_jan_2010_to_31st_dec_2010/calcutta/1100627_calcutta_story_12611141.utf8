										      Autumn flush      SAJNI MUKHERJI                        The TV, computer or books cannot replace stories told by a grandparent				                           
	As a little girl my daughter one day announced that she had 11 grandparents. Not just the four but aunts and uncles of her parents and a couple of spares among neighbours and friends. Unsurprisingly, her school gang always felt anything she said should immediately be metaphorically divided by nine. With a precociously large vocabulary and proneness to malapropism and exaggeration she was a happy imaginative child. I think the stories she avidly collected from her many grandparents contributed to these traits.        
	Her paternal grandfather, an author and teacher had the power to make anything sound like a story. He used his trademark Charminar packet and a battered old aluminium ashtray to demonstrate how the earth goes around the sun.         
	This became a swivelling dance in her version. Children do not distinguish between fact and fiction and this story was compelling! From him she learnt the difference between fog, mist and smoke. She had many quarrels with the TV versions of the epics. Sherlock Holmes was an old pal long before she could read.         
	He introduced her (and me) to the wonderful world of childrens literature in Bengali. Every fresh volume of the good old stories republished by Shishu Sahitya Samsad in the Seventies became dog-eared even before she learned the alphabet as he patiently and repeatedly read them to her. The terror of village stories like nishir dak was quickly dispelled by him as he gently explained how superstition grew and was nurtured because people did not know better.        
	A neighbour grandpa, an engineer who won awards for clever gadgets that he made in his retirement, adapted a gyaner alo package of General Knowledge questions and answers to demonstrate which substances were conductors of electricity: he included in the kit a pencil with the wood partly shaved off so that the lead was also exposed, cigarette foil, an eraser, a plastic comb and other such inexpensive items. This story reproduced in a Show and Tell at school won her many Brownie points.         
	She once claimed her maternal grandmother owned an Easter Lily farm. (These lovely seasonal flowers grew in flowerpots on her grandmothers terrace.) There she was also thrilled to plant a grain of chhola or a gota mug and watch it become a little plant in a discarded clay pot. Another favourite in those days was to watch a caterpillar grow into a butterfly inside a matchbox with a few airholes punched in. The little book called The Hungry Caterpillar helped with that.        
	An inspiring spare nani across the road who was once a national badminton champion has been a more adult teller of tales, particularly one in which she danced with a young lad called Roger at a cantonment ball who later became the pop singer Cliff Richard!         
	A poster I received from an NGO shows a sad and lonely old lady with the caption: She used to make up stories to tell her grandchildren. Now she makes up grandchildren in her stories.         
	If you have no grandchildren or if they live far away, adopt some. Share your favourites with them. Tell them about Pele and Vinoo Mankad. Grab a bunch of photographs from that old shoebox and tell their stories. You are the best person to preserve and secure this lively interaction between the young and the old. TVs, computers or books can never be a substitute.

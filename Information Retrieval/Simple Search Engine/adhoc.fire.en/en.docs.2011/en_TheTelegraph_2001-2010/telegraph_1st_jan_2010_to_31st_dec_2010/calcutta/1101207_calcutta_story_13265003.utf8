          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Salman Khan plays identical twins in the 1990s film Judwaa, in which one brother gets into trouble for the others mischief      
	A youth arrested in Jharkhands Giridih in connection with the theft of jewellery worth Rs 30 lakh from a Mandeville Gardens flat has turned out to be the identical twin of the prime accused.        
	City cops picked up Lattu Yadav from his house mistaking him for Raju, who is suspected to have stolen the diamond-encrusted ornaments from the house of his employer, Tulsi Dugar, on November 17. Raju is still at large.        
	The goof-up came to light when the sleuths tried to match Lattus face with Rajus image captured on the closed-circuit camera of realtor Dagars apartment block.        
	The Yadavs look identical except for the nose, which tell them apart, said an officer.        
	Sleuths, however, suspect that Lattu was a partner in crime. Raju had left some of the stolen ornaments with Lattu, who sold them to two men for Rs 2.9 lakh, said Damayanti Sen, the joint commissioner of police. The money was found in his possession.        
	The two who allegedly bought the ornaments  Nageswar Sonar, 50, and Anil Sonar, 30  have been arrested at Gorthamba village in Giridih.        
	Sources said teams from Gariahat police station and the detective department raided the Yadavs house soon after the theft but could not find the accused.        
	It was during the second raid on Saturday, which followed a tip-off, that the sleuths got hold of Lattu.        
	One of our officers who was keeping an eye on the house in Domardiha village in Giridih said he had spotted Raju. We went inside and arrested him but he kept saying that he was not Raju but his twin, said an officer who went on the raid.        
	The sleuths were sure that the claim was only a ploy to evade arrest but the truth dawned on them when they tried to match the face of the arrested youth with Rajus image.                                      
	Lattu allegedly told cops during interrogation that Raju might be hiding with a person whom he had sold a major part of the loot.              
	If Raju Yadav, the youth who stole diamond-studded ornaments worth over Rs 30 lakh from a Mandeville Gardens flat is giving the Calcutta police sleepless nights, his twin brother Lattu  who was mistaken as Raju during a raid, left the cops in a tizzy.        
	With exactly identical looks, except their noses, police arrested Lattu mistaking him as Raju from his Giridih home on Saturday night. Only minutes later, cops realised their mistake. The comedy of errors ended on a happy note, at least for the cops who recovered Rs 2.9 lakhs from Lattu that Raju had got after selling the stolen booty that helped the cops pin down even the twin brother.        
	Prime accused Raju is still at large. Officers from the detective department have arrested three persons including Lattu in connection with the burglary that occurred at the 4,000 square feet flat of realtor Tulsi Dugar on November 17.        
	Sources revealed that soon after burgling the ornaments from his employers house, Raju, who had introduced himself as Prakash, had sold the ornaments at a gold and bronze shop in Alipore area. Thereafter, he had headed straight for his hometown in Giridh.                                             
	Though initially the cops turned a deaf ear to Lattus cries thinking that it was a ploy to avert arrest, it was only after minutes that truth dawned upon them.         
	A still photograph from the CCTV footage that had captured Rajus image, came handy. Though apparently having the same face, the two brothers have different noses. This person had a crooked nose, while the one in the photograph had a blunt nose, added the officer.                          
	had sold the larger part of the booty to a receiver who is absconding and at present is believed to be with Raju himself. The Alipore shops owner and his son have been arrested. Cops have also found that Raju is wanted in at least another servant theft in Alipore area.        
	Lattu has told the cops that though originally from Giridh, the twins had come to Calcutta when they were barely 10 years old. They used to work as a tea stall in Burrabazar area. Raju later started working as domestic help in residential homes, while Lattu returned to their hometown, said an officer.        
	With Lattus arrest, we are hoping to get hold of Raju very soon, concluded the officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sex workers plea set for hearing
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sex workers plea set for hearing
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday said some of the points raised against the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act by an organisation working for sex workers rights were serious in nature.        
	Justice Jayanta Biswas made the remark while admitting a petition moved by the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee for a detailed hearing.        
	The organisation has alleged that some of the provisions of the act are unconstitutional and sought an order granting sex workers the right to carry on their trade without being harassed by police and allow them to take care of their families.        
	Additional solicitor-general Farroque Siddiqui submitted in the court that the Centre was aware of the problems of sex workers and had drawn up a programme to improve their living condition. The judge gave Siddiqui six weeks to submit a copy of the plan.        
	The petitioner has challenged the act on the ground that it makes it a punishable offence for an adult to live on the earnings of a sex worker. The organisation has stated that the provision is preventing sex workers from looking after their family members. The act, the petition says, violates Article 14 of the Constitution which allows citizens to practise any profession for livelihood.

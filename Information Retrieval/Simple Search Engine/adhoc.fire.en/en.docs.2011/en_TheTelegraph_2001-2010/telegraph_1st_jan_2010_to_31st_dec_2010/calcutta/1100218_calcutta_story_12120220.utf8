                      Eastern connection                    When P.V. Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh launched Indias Look East policy, it was only the first stage of the strategy to foster economic and security cooperation with the United States. But Looking East became an end in itself, and Singapore a valid destination, largely because of Lee Kuan Yew. Since the 1950s, he had been trying to persuade Indias leaders that China would steal a march on them if they neglected domestic reform and ignored a region that India had influenced profoundly in ancient times. Looking East to Look West: Lee Kuan Yews Mission India by Sunanda K. Datta-Ray recounts how India and Singapore rediscovered long-forgotten ties in the endeavour to create a new Asia. The book traces the process from the earliest mention of Suvarnabhumi in the Ramayana to Lee Kuan Yews letter to Lal Bahadur Shastri within moments of declaring independence on August 9, 1965; from the Tatas pioneering industrial training venture in Singapore to Singapores information technology park in Bangalore. It also explains the part Lee played in Indias emergence as a player in the emerging Concert of Asia. History comes alive in the pages of the book as the author, who had eight long conversations with him, tells the story in the words of the main actors and with a wealth of anecdotes and personal details not available to many chroniclers. This evening, M.K. Narayanan, Honble Governor of West Bengal, will release the book. Hosted by Penguin Books India and Oxford Bookstore. Published by Penguin/Viking; price: Rs 499.                   Event: Launch of Sunanda K. Datta-Rays Looking East to Look West: Lee Kuan Yews Mission India When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Oxford Bookstore, 17 Park Street

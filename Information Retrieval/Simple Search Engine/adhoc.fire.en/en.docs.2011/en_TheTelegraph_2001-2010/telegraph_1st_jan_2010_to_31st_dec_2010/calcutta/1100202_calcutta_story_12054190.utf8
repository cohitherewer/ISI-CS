                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dupe slur on air academy
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Seven students of Air Hostess Academy have lodged a police complaint accusing the authorities of breach of trust, the move prompted by the institutes decision to suspend classes.        
	Officials of the Minto Park centre could not be contacted for comment but students said the authorities had referred to lack of teachers while announcing their decision to suspend classes on January 20.        
	It was a breach of trust as we had been assured of uninterrupted classes as well as jobs after the completion of the course, said one of the seven students who lodged a complaint with Ballygunge police station on Monday.        
	The complaint has been recorded as a general diary. We are conducting an inquiry. If we find that the institution has duped the students, an FIR will be registered, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters. Two employees of the academy have been detained.        
	The academy was opened in Delhi in 1997 and is now operating from 25 cities across the country.        
	A woman in her early 20s, a signatory to the complaint, said she had paid Rs 1.18 lakh last May for joining the course. There were 14 others in our batch. All of us were assured of jobs. Now that the classes have been suspended, what will happen to our money? Our future is at stake, said the woman who did not want to be identified.        
	The complainants, who have demanded refund of their money, said they had found the academy closed most of the time since January 20.        
	A former air hostess who was once associated with the academy said most training institutes took in students by making false promises. The institutes promise 100 per cent employment but most students end up bottling pickles for catering companies, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic funds closer home
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civic funds closer home
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya proposed decentralisation of the expenditure of civic funds while presenting the Calcutta Municipal Corporation budget for 2010-11 on Monday.        
	The Rs 257-crore deficit budget proposes that councillors and borough chairpersons be made responsible for addressing local issues.        
	We want to empower the peoples representatives through greater devolution of funds, the mayor said, elaborating on the underlying theme of the Rs 3,491.25-crore budget.        
	Of the projected total development and maintenance expenditure of Rs 1,200 crore, the civic authorities want more than Rs 600 crore to be spent through the boroughs. The responsibility of paying employees salaries, power bill and maintenance and motor vehicle expenses will rest with the civic headquarters.        
	The boroughs will enjoy more financial freedom without having to share the liabilities of the civic body. This will help them focus on development, the mayor said.        
	The budget seeks to allot more than Rs 2.5 crore to each of the 141 wards for the upkeep of roads, lanes and bylanes, waterpipes, drains and narrow sewers.        
	The proposal on decentralisation follows the recommendations of the consultant AF Ferguson amp; Company, which was appointed with the UK governments financial grant for the CMCs capacity building programme.        
	Bhattacharyya also wants to broaden the revenue collection by levying an annual charge of Rs 100 for every lamp post used by cable operators as part of their network. The authorities hope to mop up Rs 2 crore on this score.        
	Mrinal Chatterjee, a registered cable operator, said the charge should not lead to any hike in the cable TV subscription rate. If the Rs 100 is distributed among the clients, it will come to 80 paise to Rs 1.25 per client per month, Chatterjee pointed out.        
	Demonstration: A group of passengers demonstrated at Ballygunge station on Monday morning alleging that a ticket checker forcibly took Rs 500 from a woman even though she had a valid monthly ticket. Four persons, including a GRP officer, were injured after the demonstrators started throwing stones.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Smooth repoll in 3 wards

	Voters turned up in numbers at the re-election in three wards of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, which passed off without a hitch, on Tuesday.         
	Residents listed under part 13A in ward 94 voted at Jatiya Sishu Siksha Sadan in Tollygunge, those under part 15A in ward 83 at Deshabandhu Balika Bidyalaya in Kalighat and those under part 21 of ward 101 at Kendua Mahendranath Girls High School in Patuli.         
	Kendua Mahendranath Girls High School, where a paramilitary jawan shot at CPM activist Arabinda Dhar, alias Bapi, barely 20 minutes before the elections ended on Sunday, was the cynosure of all eyes on re-election day.         
	On Sunday, 30 security personnel monitored polling in six parts in the ward. Today, 50 security personnel were deployed for re-election in only one part. We did not want to take a chance, said a senior police officer on Tuesday.         
	Out of the 626 voters, 362 cast their votes in Patuli on Tuesday.         
	I was not tense or afraid to vote because of Sundays incident, said 23-year-old Sutapa Singha, 23, who voted at the Kendua school.         
	Goutam Sarkar of the CPM and Mrityunjoy Mondal of the Trinamul Congress are the principal candidates in the ward.         
	In the other two wards, malfunctioning electronic voting machines led to the re-election.         
	At Jatiya Sishu Siksha Sadan, the electronic voting machine showed only one vote had been cast after 49 people had exercised their franchise on Sunday morning.        
	I reached office a little late because I went there after voting, said Ashok Das, a resident of Kalighat, who voted at Deshabandhu Balika Bidyalaya.        
	There was no violence during the re-election, said Sanjoy Basu, the additional district magistrate of South 24-Parganas.         
	Seventy per cent votes were polled in the CMC elections on Sunday.        
	The election commission could not provide the percentage of votes cast in the re-election. Poll personnel, however, said the turnout was healthy in the three centres.         
	Generally, the percentage of votes cast in re-elections is lower than in elections as many who want to vote cannot because they have to go to work, said a senior official of the election commission.         
	The results of the re-election would be declared on Wednesday, along with the other civic poll results.

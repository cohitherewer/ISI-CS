The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Transport strike put off
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Transport strike put off
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Transporters on Sunday deferred their 72-hour strike scheduled from Tuesday to press for a fare hike following the recent fuel price hike and decided to wait till August 23 for the government to spell out its stand.        
	The announcement came minutes after Mamata Banerjee requested the operators to call off the strike. Swarnakamal Saha, a key leader of the transport lobby, is an MLA of the railway ministers Trinamul Congress.        
	The transport minister has asked for 10 days from the bus operators and a fortnight from taxi operators to decide on the ways to compensate for our increased expenditure following the hike in fuel prices. We wont go on strike before that, Calcutta Taxi Associations Tarak Nath Bari said on Sunday afternoon after meeting transport minister Ranjit Kundu.        
	In deference to minister Kundus wish, we have decided to defer our transport strike till August 22. We will decide our course of action on August 23, said Sadhan Das, of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.        
	Representatives of all 14 major transport operator unions attended the meeting.        
	A few minutes before Dass announcement, Mamata said at a railway event: I appeal to those who have called the transport strike to withdraw it as it will inconvenience people. The railway is also bearing the brunt of the hike, but nothing can be done. We (the railway) have lost Rs 1,500 crore because of strikes and bandhs.        
	The operators had announced on July 29 that if the government refused to allow a fare hike by August 9, they would go on a three-day strike from the next day. The price of diesel has gone up by Rs 1.94 per litre to Rs 39.94 in Calcutta. The government has announced a subsidy of Re 1 per litre on diesel used for public transport but the operators feel the relief is inadequate.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fatal crash with teen at wheel
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    Vicky Ashwin Tete, 18 (top), was at the wheel of the (below) Maruti Alto that crashed into a tree near Nicco Park on Sunday, injuring him and killing his schoolmate Rahul Rai, 16.   (Bishwarup Dutta)      
	A car with a schoolboy at the wheel crashed into a tree near Nicco Park on Sunday afternoon, leaving him critically injured and killing his 16-year-old friend.        
	Vicky Ashwin Tete, a student of Class XI at The Assembly of God Church School, was driving friend Rahul Rai to a Bypass bus stop in his fathers car when the Maruti Alto hit the divider, careened off the road and rammed into the tree around 12.15pm, police said.        
	Rahul, a class junior to Vicky and the son of a driver, was declared dead on arrival at Salt Lake sub-divisional hospital.        
	Vicky, whose father Jobentus Tete is an Agartala-based ONGC officer and mother Gloria a central excise official, is undergoing treatment at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital for chest, leg and facial injuries.        
	Trader Amar Paswan, who informed the police about the accident and took Vicky to hospital in his car, said the Alto was probably moving at 70kmph when the accident occurred.        
	At 18, Vicky is eligible for a driving licence but the cops dont know yet whether he has one. Uncle Robert Tete insisted that his nephew had a driving licence, but clarified that he was driving the car only because the familys driver had taken Sunday off.        
	For Rahul, a resident of Jinjira Bazaar near Taratala Brace Bridge, it was a tragic end to a fun-filled weekend spent with Vicky and his family in their high-rise apartment behind Axis Mall in New Town.        
	Family members and friends waiting for the body  father Bodhu was seen standing outside the sub-divisional hospital till late on Sunday along with his wife and daughter  said the teenager had accompanied Vicky to his home on Friday night after attending a friends birthday party at Tangra.         
	Rahul was to have headed for the rehearsal of a school dance programme scheduled for later this week after being dropped by Vicky at the Chingrihata bus stop on Sunday. Vicky was planning to take a right turn to Swabhumi to meet some friends.        
	Rahul was a good dancer and so is Vicky. They have been regular members of the school troupe, apart from being good sportsmen. While Rahul was an excellent footballer, Vicky is very good in basketball, Anmol Gurung, a friend of the duo, told Metro.        
	Family members of Vicky, who joined Assembly of God Church School last year after taking a transfer from St Josephs School, Darjeeling, blamed the stone chips coming off the road for the accident.        
	I do think that the stone chips played a role in the accident, added trader Paswan, who postponed his days work and spent almost six hours on Sunday helping the families of the victim and the injured teenager.

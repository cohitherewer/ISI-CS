The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scan on Assembly chaos
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scan on Assembly chaos
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A rap from Alimuddin Street on Lalbazars knuckles has prompted the top cops to conduct a post-mortem of the crowd mismanagement at the Assembly on Tuesday.        
	After a meeting on the arrangements for Republic Day, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti reportedly dissected the cause and effect of the crowd chaos that resulted in Jyoti Basus body leaving the Assembly 45 minutes behind schedule.        
	Neither the CPM leaders nor the cops were willing to go on record but sources said Alimuddin Street had pinned the blame on Basus body arriving late at Citizens Park on poor policing at the Assembly.        
	Jyotibabus body had to be rushed to SSKM after the gun salute at Citizens Park, since the army wanted to remove the Tricolour before sunset, following protocol. As the body had reached Citizens Park late from the Assembly, the sun was about to set and so the handover was rushed, said a CPM insider.        
	The body was taken out nearly 45 minutes behind schedule from the Assembly. The gates couldnt be closed on time because of the chaos around 2.45pm, when a huge crowd comprising advocates and the general public gate-crashed from the VIP end, said a senior police officer, admitting that the force was caught out briefly.        
	City celebrities were caught in the crowd crush and blamed police failure for the stampede-like situation.

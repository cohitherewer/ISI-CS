                      Spirit of love and family bonding                    Gone are the days when family ties and filial affections held the most important place in ones heart. The modern world is active, dynamic and success-oriented, with its inhabitants engaged in a reckless pursuit to fulfil only their personal ambitions. This evenings production, Luxemburger Lakshmi, attempts to bring back memories of those long-forgotten, yet dearly-cherished time. It tries to revive the innocent, childhood joys of love and sharing, that are all but lost. Rekindling visions of what was once one of the most beautiful aspects of Bengali tradition, the play is set in an old mansion, which once played host to a large and extended joint-family. Stripped of all its former glory, it stands forlorn, in anticipation of Durga Puja, when the members of its now far-flung family will assemble for a few days of festivity. But this years celebration will be filled with nostalgia; it being the last time the family will celebrate together within its portals. The elders of the family have decided to sell off the mansion, shattering the expectations of the youngsters, who secretly pine for the fun, frolic and togetherness that the old house offers throughout the year. The action of the play gains momentum with the sudden arrival of an unknown cousin from America. While the older members of the family are apprehensive about the cause of her visit, an unbreakable bond of love and understanding develops between her and the children. Performed by students of Nehru Childrens Museum. Direction: Rama Prasad Banik.                  Event: Play in Bengali, Luxemburger Lakshmi When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Madhusudan Mancha

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Honk-happy city on noise high
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Honk-happy city on noise high
          JAYANTA BASU                                            
	Calcutta has honked its way to the top of the decibel charts even as stricter noise norms take effect nationwide with a reminder to drivers: no horn please, its not ok.        
	According to a survey by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, Ultadanga, one of the citys busiest crossings, averages 18,857 honks in 24 hours, or one honk every five seconds. During daytime, the average is one honk every three seconds.         
	Many of the citys other high-traffic zones also have high horn counts and ambient noise levels well above the national higher limit of 65 decibels. The 10 crossings selected for the 2009 survey average one honk every eight seconds over 24 hours, the frequency almost doubling during daytime.         
	Most of these areas are no-horn zones because of the presence of hospitals and educational institutions in the vicinity. Any area within a 100-metre radius of a hospital or nursing home, educational institution, court, library or Raj Bhavan is officially designated a silence zone.         
	Apart from banning honking between 10pm and 6am in residential areas and at all times in specific areas, the revised central provisions  notified on January 15  seek to regulate noise from construction sites and even the volume of music from your home stereo. Prosecution and conviction could invite a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh and imprisonment of up to seven years, depending on the nature of the violation.        
	This is an important measure to make our cities less noisy, our nights less noisy, our public places less noisy, Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh had said while announcing the norms.        
	In Calcutta, the average horn count at all 10 crossings during the survey was 1,07,392 per day, marginally less than 1,15,508 honks recorded on an average per day in the same places in 2008. The comparative figures prove that these are not fluke findings, said a senior official involved in the study.        
	The ambient noise level at all these points is in excess of 70 decibels, against the national upper limit of 65 decibels for commercial areas and 55 decibels for residential zones. Thinning traffic at night seems to make little difference, with the honking habit holding sway.         
	Calcutta presently averages four honks every minute between 10pm and 6am. Traffic police are supposed to crack the whip  in Europe and the US, unnecessary honking is not only considered rude but also punished with fines up to $350  but seldom do.        
	We have recently issued a comprehensive notification to control noise pollution, which strictly prohibits honking in silent zones and the police have been given the responsibility of executing the directive, said M.L. Meena, the state environment secretary and chairman of the state noise monitoring committee.        
	The deputy commissioner of the traffic department, Dilip Banerjee, claimed that the cops had begun a crackdown on honking in restricted zones.         
	We have been booking 15 to 20 motorists every day for unnecessary honking. The fine for a violation is Rs 100, he added.        
	According to ENT specialist and former sheriff Dulal Bose, the incidence of hearing problems in the city was rising steadily because of noise pollution, mainly honking.        
	Nowhere in the world does one have to endure blaring car horns as much as in Calcutta, which is such a shame. There should be concerted action by all agencies to minimise honking, including efforts to raise awareness among drivers for whom honking is a habit, he added.        
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department and a high court-appointed special officer for monitoring noise pollution, claimed Bengal was overall better than other states in enforcing noise norms.         
	We have at least imposed fines for bursting banned crackers, he added.

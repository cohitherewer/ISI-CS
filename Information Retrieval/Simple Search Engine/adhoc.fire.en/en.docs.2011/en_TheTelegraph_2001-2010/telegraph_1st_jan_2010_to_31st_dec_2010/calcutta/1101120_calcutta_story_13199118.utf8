                Debajyoti Mukherjee, 35, and Sweta Das, 35, were arrested on Friday for allegedly running a sleaze racket in the guise of a friendship club on Hazra Road. The racket came to light after a lawyer complained that she had been flooded with phone calls demanding service. The callers said they had got her number from the club, said joint police commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.   Fire: A closed-door meeting of family members of those who committed suicide has been organised at Rotary Sadan from 3pm to 6pm on Saturday. Lifeline Foundation, which tries to stop people from committing suicide, has organised the meet.   Tea association: The 127th annual general meeting of the Indian Tea Association will be held at Taj Bengal from 5pm on Saturday.

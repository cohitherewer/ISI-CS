                      Embroidered art                    Famous for its traditional hand-embroidery, Kutch in Gujarat boasts some of the most skilled and creative craftswomen in the world whose exquisite and intricate work on various textiles speaks of the mystery and magic of the land. Interestingly, their ethnic craft, carried down over generations, has also given employment to numerous rural women, who have effectively used it as a tool of economic empowerment. Used to make any fabric more colourful and attractive, Kutch embroidery is versatile, involving a variety of stitches. The colours used are bright and vibrant like red, coral, orange, neon-green, indigo, turquoise, pink and purple. Its motifs vary from floral, dancing human figures and peacocks to simple geometrical shapes. Shrujans ongoing exhibition, with a complete range of hand-embroidered traditional and Indo-Western garments and home furnishings, comprises saris (cottons, pure silks and tussars), kurtas, kurtis, accessories and fusionwear.

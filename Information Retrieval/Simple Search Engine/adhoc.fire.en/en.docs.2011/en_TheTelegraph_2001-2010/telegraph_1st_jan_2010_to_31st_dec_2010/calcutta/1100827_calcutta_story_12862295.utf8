The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Glare on go-slow and speed   Report catches Metro off track
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Glare on go-slow and speed     Report catches Metro off track
          SANJAY MANDAL                                                      
	An internal report of Metro Railway has confirmed what regulars have suspected for a while  the citys snag-a-day transport lifeline needs more than just a nip and tuck to get back on track.        
	The report, a copy of which is with Metro, states that Metro Railway in its present form has already become outmoded with the authorities in denial about festering technical problems for years.         
	Metro highlights the problems that have turned the smartest set of wheels in town into a slow  and often suspect  coach.                
	MAINTENANCE        
	Most of the electrical components that need to be replaced in the rakes are no longer available. There has been a high rate of failure of components in electrical equipment and in many cases repairs become difficult due to the unavailability of spares. Many of the imported equipment are not in the present manufacturing programme of foreign firms and supply takes inordinately long and at exorbitant cost, it states.        
	For the maintenance team, the primary problem is handling two types of equipment without spares. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) and the New Government Electric Factory (NEGF), which is now closed, had manufactured the old rakes that are still running.        
	Many of the equipment supplied by the two companies are not interchangeable. This puts a heavy strain on maintenance, says the report.        
	Metro ferries about six lakh commuters every day with 18 rakes, two of which have been sent for an overhaul and another for repairs.                
	DOORS        
	Motormen blame malfunctioning doors for most of the train delays, which has been corroborated by the report. The door equipment in the coaches manufactured at NGEF often fail to operate. Unlike the Bhel coaches where both door panels are operated by one equipment, NGEF coaches have two door operating equipment and this accounts for more number of door failures, the report says.        
	There have been instances of the doors jamming because of improper construction.              
	THIRD RAIL        
	Snags in the third rail have stopped the Metro in its tracks on several occasions in recent months. The report blames poor maintenance for most of these problems. There are a number of places where water directly drips over the third rail and on cables. This results in failure of power supply at times, it says.              
	OTHER EQUIPMENT        
	Power back-up and passenger amenities like escalators figure low on Metro Railways priority-maintenance list.        
	Most of the escalators used are not the heavy-duty type and equipment failure is on the high side. Safety equipment often fails. In-house expertise for maintenance is not presently available, it says.        
	The report also points out that inverters for emergency lighting dont function at many stations on the old route.              
	VENTILATION        
	The ventilation system is one of the most ignored aspects of the Metro Railway, says the report. No standby ventilation fans for either intake or exhaust are provided in the Metro system. Rectification of any failure of ventilation fans require a long time and this puts a strain on the system.              
	OFFICIAL VERSION        
	The Metro Railway authorities insist that the arrival of air-conditioned rakes would solve most of their problems. Two have arrived but are yet to join the fleet. Eleven more are set to roll out of the Perambur-based Integral Coach Factory over the next six months.        
	We dont compromise on quality and safety. We regularly conduct safety checks on escalators and the third rail, said a senior official.

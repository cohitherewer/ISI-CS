The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trade hub blind eye to blaze risk   Shops, offices play with fire
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trade hub blind eye to blaze risk     Shops, offices play with fire
                                  
	The Stephen Court blaze has put fire-safety measures in the citys commercial buildings under the scanner. Metro runs a check on two addresses to find them lacking on several counts:                         (Top) A canopy of wires hangs over meter boxes at 10 Kiron Shankar Roy Road and (above) a blocked corridor in Ganesh Market.

	Building: Ganesh Market, 58D NS Road        
	Condition: The seven-storeyed building in Burrabazar, which houses a private bank, is a tinderbox.         
	There is only one staircase for the 200-odd residents (tenants of the top two floors) and shop owners of the building. Traders have stored synthetic saris below the meter boxes. The single sand bucket in each floor is inadequate.        
	Most of the shops sell inflammable articles, including plastic items, ropes, paint, chemicals and clothes. Sacks of goods block a large portion of the staircase to the basement and the corridors of the first three floors.         
	Tenants voice: We are living in fear of an accident. If a fire breaks out, we would not be able to find a way out through the blocked corridors, said K.K. Bhansali, who has an office on the fifth floor.         
	Landlords version: We have asked tenants several times to keep the passages clear but they did not pay heed. They keep plastic items on top of the meter boxes. The shopkeepers and tenants should be conscious of fire hazards instead of passing the buck to us, said Girdhar Sarda.               
	Building: 10 Kiron Shankar Roy Road, near Calcutta High Court         
	Condition: A tiny spark could reduce this three-storeyed building to ashes.        
	A wooden staircase is the only escape route. The passage to the terrace has been sealed with wooden planks. Electrical wires criss-cross and hang from the walls on all floors. Cramped offices, most of them belonging to advocates, have come up in every corner.        
	Tea stalls with stoves and LPG cylinders have been set up in the corridors increasing the danger of a fire. Fire extinguishers and sand buckets were conspicuous by their absence.         
	Tenants voice: There is no escape route from the building except the staircase. We know the structure is a tinderbox waiting to go up in flames but we pay a nominal rent and where else would we get a chamber at such a low cost, said an advocate who practises in the high court and has a chamber on the first floor.        
	Caretakers version: The landlord is in Delhi. The tenants have brought in sub-tenants, who have constructed mezzanine floors. But nobody seems to be bothered, said Tarkeswar Singh, who collects rent from the tenants.               
	Officialspeak: According to civic rules, the corridor should be 2m wide in mercantile buildings. In case of office buildings, the width of the corridor should be 1.8m. There should not be any obstructions in the passages, said Dipak Sarkar, the deputy director (fire prevention) of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.         
	In mercantile and office buildings, the presence of sand buckets and fire extinguishers is not enough. The buildings should have in-built firefighting equipment like wet riser (150mm diameter) with accessories on each floor. In addition there should be a sprinkler system, which will burst automatically at 68 degrees Celsius. There should be emergency exits and two staircases that are some distance apart, he added.

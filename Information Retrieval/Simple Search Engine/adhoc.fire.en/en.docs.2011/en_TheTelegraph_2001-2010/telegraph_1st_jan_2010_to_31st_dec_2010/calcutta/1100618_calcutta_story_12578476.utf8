                A clash between CPM and Trinamul Congress supporters in a Howrah slum on Thursday afternoon left one man dead and six persons injured. Police claimed a family feud between Bhagirath Bag, a Trinamul supporter, and Naba Koley, a CPM leader, had led to the clash.  On Thursday afternoon, Koley had allegedly beaten up Bhagiraths wife. When Bhagirath attacked Koley with a knife, Asit Bag, another CPM supporter, came to Koleys rescue. Bhagirath allegedly stabbed Asit, who died while being taken to hospital. The CPM supporters blocked the Howrah-Amta road for more than two hours to protest the killing.     Armed youths snatched cash and ornaments worth Rs 1 lakh from a bike-borne couple in Baruipur on Thursday. Police said Swapan Haldar, a Ballygunge resident, was going to his in-laws house with his wife.    Running of passenger trains on the Kharagpur-Rourkela and Kharagpur-Adra sections of South Eastern Railway will remain suspended between 10pm and 5am till June 22 because of security reasons. Passenger trains have been barred from running at night in these sections after the Jnaneswari Express tragedy on May 28.    Three persons were injured when the car they were travelling in collided with a city-bound truck near Chiria More early on Thursday. The injured were taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital from where they were released after treatment.     Sudip Sarkar, 36, a Howrah resident, was found hanging from the ceiling of his room on Thursday morning. A preliminary investigation suggested the man had committed suicide. Police sent the body for post-mortem and started a case of unnatural death.    Trouble broke out at the oath-taking ceremony of the newly elected chairman of North Dum Dum Municipality on Thursday afternoon as nearly 50 people opposed the move to elect Sunil Chakrabarty, the CPM councillor from ward 10, to the post. The agitators broke flower pots and a few chairs. The ceremony resumed only after police persuaded the protestors to leave.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Debut meet to drop the cane

	Caning is a strict no-no, the highest decision-making body of La Martiniere for Boys underlined on Thursday while meeting guardians and alumni hours after the police probe into Rouvanjit Rawlas death entered the Loudon Street campus.        
	Caning is not acceptable anymore and there is no doubt about it, said David Howard, a member of the La Martiniere board of governors and the secretary of the St Thomas Schools, addressing over a hundred parents and ex-students in Atmodaya Bhavan on campus, where The Telegraph was also present.        
	In a first such exercise three days after principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi had admitted to The Telegraph that caning was an offence and promised that it would never be practised again in the school  the board of governors along with the secretary to the board Supriyo Dhar and the principal convened to help the school move forward after what has been a rocky few months. The board had met teachers of the school earlier in the week.        
	Howard urged the parents, many of whom support corporal punishment to discipline unruly boys, to come forward with suggestions for alternative measures as many teachers were wondering how to handle such children following the Rouvanjit Rawla tragedy. Weve to work within the framework so let us do everything but use the stick, he said.        
	Parents addressed issues ranging from infrastructure for children with special needs to better parent-teacher interaction, building confidence among its students as well as better ways to handle difficult children. Some suggested that a counsellor be appointed to improve teacher-student relations and also to handle difficult children.        
	The board appointed a counsellor last October but we perhaps need more as she is already handling 132 cases, said Chakravarthi.         
	The alumni termed the meeting a first and positive step towards increasing interaction between the school and its stakeholders.        
	The police on Thursday visited the school as part of the procedure followed to probe the abetment to suicide case lodged by Ajay Rawla against the principal and four other teachers for the death of his son Rouvanjit, who was found hanging from his Alipore home on February 12. The police have asked for certain documents and they have questioned a student, said Dhar.

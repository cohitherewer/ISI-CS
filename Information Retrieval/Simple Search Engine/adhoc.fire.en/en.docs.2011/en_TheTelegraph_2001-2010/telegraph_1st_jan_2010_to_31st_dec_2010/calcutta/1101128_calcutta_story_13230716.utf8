The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Only chicken
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Only chicken
          Dining out in Calcutta means feeding mostly on one bird, or paneer, says Chandreyee Ghose                        Good morning: The Chinese breakfast at Tiretta Bazar. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta; (below) Nanking restaurant				                                 
	Its six in the morning on a Tuesday. Tiretta Bazar is far from the bustling breakfast hub that it turns into on weekends. We dont get time to talk then, says Rita Wong as she serves pork suimai and steamed pork momos with chilly sauce. Another speciality of the famous Chinese breakfast, served in a lane near Poddar Court, is the pork and fish-stuffed bau, which has come to be known as pao.         
	On a Saturday or Sunday usually we are sold out by 8am, adds Wong. Call centre employees returning from offices in Salt Lake, nightclub hoppers and foodies come here frequently, claims Subhas Chandrana, who sells uncooked Chinese sausages, made of pork meat, wine and Chinese spices among other ingredients, for Rs 340 per kg. Like him, many Indians now sell Chinese specialities here.         
	Tiretta Bazar is one of the few remaining cosmopolitan food hubs in a city which is otherwise becoming conservative in its palette by the day. It is ironic that this is happening as a world cuisine eatery is springing up in a street corner almost every day.         
	Outside star preserves, restaurants feel inhibited to declare various kinds of meat. Pork is vanishing from menus in big restaurants. Beef has already faced a long discrimination in the city. Even duck is rarely served. Its only chicken on the Calcutta menu, with a bit of mutton and a dash of fish.         
	A standardisation of taste has set in and perhaps also less tolerance for a variety of food. Not that vegetarians have much choice either, beyond exotic veggies such as mushroom, babycorn and red and yellow bell peppers. And paneer.                   Nanking restaurant       
	Menu makeover        
	Many of the old familiar places in town, which served a variety of food, are shutting down or re-doing their menu. Central Calcutta, considered more cosmopolitan than many other parts of the city, is no exception. Neither is Park Street, the heart of cosmopolitan Calcutta.         
	A reputed Park Street eatery doesnt show the ham sandwiches that many of its patrons have loved for decades on its menu. If you ask for them, they are there, to be served to you discreetly. A waiter says that many of the patrons are uncomfortable with pork, and not always for religious reasons.         
	Trincas on Park Street has reinvented itself strikingly. The former tea room is now another multi-cuisine restaurant. Chung Wah in Central Avenue, once known for its lively chilli pork, has redone its menu, privileging the tandoori items, necessarily involving chicken. But the nearby Elfin, also known for its delicious pork, has stopped serving it.         
	It is the same unfortunate story in Tangra, the newer, bigger Chinatown. Few of the restaurants serve pork now, though once they were famous for the pork dishes that were washed down with rum. Many Chinese families, in Tangra and elsewhere, are selling their restaurants and sometimes leaving the country.         
	Indian Chinese is served everywhere now, including at dhabas. Some places also serve noodles with turmeric, says food writer Rajen Bali. An upmarket Chinese restaurant sells a mustard fish dish. Chicken momos are being served at wedding dinners. And at the supermarket, there is a preponderance of chicken ham, chicken pepperoni, chicken salami and chicken sausages. This is a national phenomenon. Its not for nothing that Venkys Chicken has bought Blackburn Rovers.         
	Health consciousness has played its part. Chicken is far less offensive to individual health and the environment  hence the number of red meat eaters is going down. Chicken is also cheap.         
	But variety may not be synonymous with red meat. Food lovers are grumbling.         
	Quails and octopuses are unheard of in the city. Seafood is usually considered a part of Chinese cuisine here, and seldom includes scallops or mussels. An Italian fare is nothing beyond various combinations of pastas or pizzas. Italian seafood is unheard of to most Calcuttans, says hospitality writer Ian Zachariah, who misses the au gratins and the baked dishes served in Sky Room in Park Street and the Chinese meals in Nanking.         
	Vegetarians seldom like to go for asparagus or various kinds of sprouts. Many are yet to get used to the taste of broccoli too. The very fishitarian Bengalis also have no only-fish eatery to go to, he adds.         
	I am sure a hamburger or a conventional cheese burger (which usually has a beef patty to go with the cheese) will have many takers. Need it always be chicken? We dont even have an affordable sushi joint in the city, cribs Priyam Dasgupta, a college student.         
	Some new restaurants try to make up for the variety with atmosphere. I like to try out all kinds of food  Arabian, Afghan, Japanese. But the ambience is more important to me than the choice of meat, says MNC executive Udayan Shankar Chaudhury.                   
	Calcutta was not always so chicken-hearted. In one of the first cookbooks in Bengali, Amish O Niramish Ahar, 1956, by Prajna Sundari Debi, the daughter of Hemendranath Tagore, recipes of a wide range of meat dishes are found. These included roasts of rabbit, deer and peacock meat. Pork chops and pork cutlets found a mention too.         
	Prajna Sundari Debi also suggested making white stock with horse leg meat. Killing of many of these animals has been banned in later years but it proves that liberal Bengali homes, especially the Brahmo households, were open to eating many kinds of animal flesh, says food writer Alpana Ghosh.         
	Tortoise meat was prepared in our household when I was a little girl as also duck meat. Most people had duck eggs those days, says Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta, restaurateur and culinary expert.         
	Popular taste        
	The citys food habits have changed as the citys demographics have changed.         
	Food habits change, says Bali, pointing out that in the 16th and 17th century there is no reference to hilsa in Bengali writing. But till Independence, Calcutta was the restaurant capital of India with Park Street serving the best grills, steaks and roasts, he says. Elite Bengalis would sample bileti stuff at Peliti, Firpos, Bristol Hotel, Wilson Hotel (which became the Great Eastern Hotel) and Spences.         
	The average Bengali still preferred fish, says Bali. But the bilet-pherot (England-returned) Bengali started eating poultry and it led to a new eating culture, adds Bali.         
	Chicken gradually earned its place in the Bengali kitchen. It is ironic for more than one reason. Many households once considered chicken dirty. In many Brahmin households eating chicken was taboo.         
	Initially chicken was more expensive than mutton. But since the broiler chicken revolution, started by Arambagh Hatcheries in the state with their first hatchery in 1973, things have changed.         
	About the same time, during the Naxal era, the cosmopolitan population left the city.         
	Most important, the dining classes have changed. Eating out is not the preserve of the elite any more. Not cooking at home was looked down upon in middle-class Bengali homes, remembers a 60-year-old. As affordable restaurants and take-away eateries have multiplied, eating out or ordering food has become a habit.         
	Many among the new clientele are vegetarians, who do not feel comfortable eating at a place serving meats they are not familiar with, as they are with chicken.         
	Catering to the varied interest of a liberal 40 per cent is not always economically viable. Besides, not all cooks are skillful enough to handle various kinds of meat, claims Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta.         
	The change is inevitable, says food writer Nondon Bagchi. In London you get halal meat only in certain pockets. Similarly, the older Park Street restaurants still serve a tasty Chateaubriand as the area was previously dominated by a lot of sahibs and later by the Anglo-Indians, says Bagchi. There is no point selling a tasty pork dish in the Thakurpukur area as there will be few takers. Similarly most restaurants in Tangra had to do away with pork dishes so as not to offend the religious sentiments of a minority community, he adds.         
	But some still are open to experiment. Chef Joymalya Banerjee, who has started a delivery unit of contemporary cuisine, has come up with an innovative bacon-wrapped chicken supreme bundles with mango mustard reductions or crab claws in spicy mango mustard. He also plans to add beef steak to his menu soon.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Olins back for brand boost

	The man positioning London for the 2012 Olympics, Wally Olins, arrived in Calcutta on Sunday morning to lead his teams effort to brand Bengal.        
	The state government recently engaged Olinss company Saffron Brand Consultants to boost the battered image of Bengal.        
	The brand guru will meet the chief minister at Writers Buildings on Monday to give him an update on the work in progress. Olins had first met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee four months ago with a proposal to position the state.        
	The brand consultant from London will also take part in a series of discussions with the advisory committee chaired by the state chief secretary over the next two days. The panel was formed last month to steer the project.        
	The studies are not yet complete but a lot of work has been done  here in Bengal and by my colleagues in London, said Olins. He will spend his time in Calcutta examining the work being done here, holding discussions with various working groups that Saffron is operating with and engaging in talks with political figures and senior officials.        
	With that we hope to get a clearer direction before we make our final recommendations in about a month, added Olins.         
	Were looking at what our colleagues in Bengal are discovering and analysing that in the light of our inferences elsewhere. Also, the visual manifestations of the work that we may produce is being done in London.        
	The places Saffron has branded include London, Poland, Spain, Rio de Janeiro and Ireland.        
	Looking at the brighter side of trying to resurrect the bruised Brand Bengal, Olins said: The perceptions of Bengal in India and in the world do not align with the reality. We have to change that because the reality is much more dynamic than it once was. Perceptions still remain as the reality 20 or 30 years ago was related to industrial strife, a declining agricultural base and civil unrest. But now things are changing.         
	What if the political scenario changes? Whats happening in West Bengal is a movement and quite clearly it will affect whatever it is we recommend. A change in the government is always an issue but on another level a region like this has great continuity, so even if theres change, there will also be stability and long-term continuity, said Olins.

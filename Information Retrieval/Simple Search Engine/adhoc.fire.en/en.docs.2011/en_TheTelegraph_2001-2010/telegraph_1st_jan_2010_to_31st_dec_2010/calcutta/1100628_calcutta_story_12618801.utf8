The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hear the cheer for Germany   Flow of high-fives and beer for 4-1
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hear the cheer for Germany
   Flow of high-fives and beer for 4-1
          SUBHRO SAHA                        A group of German friends watch the big match against England in an Alipore apartment on Sunday evening (Aranya Sen); (Below) German supporters have a ball in Bloemfontein. (AFP)				                                             
	Noch ein Tor.... Noch ein Tor... (One more goal, one more goal....)              
	They chanted in unison. The scoreline read 4-1 in favour of their team and the clock showed 10 minutes to play. They were demanding payback for the 5-1 humiliation in Berlin 2001, a rare slip-up against England.        
	Klaus Tesch had gone one step further (back) when Frank Lampards goal was disallowed. This is redemption for 1966, said the German deputy consul-general.        
	Clearly, the German fans  filling the TV room in an Alipore apartment, miles away from home or host country  were in as ruthless a mood as Joachim Lowes team busy beating Fabio Capellos pin-up boys to pulp in Bloemfontein.        
	With England sent packing out of the Cup, shouts of Klasse!!  well done  resonated in a Calcutta address.        
	When Tesch had gathered to watch the big match with friends, half an hour before kick-off on Sunday evening, the mood was rather relaxed.        
	That changed the minute the Germans stormed the English box. Auf gehts (just do it) Deutschland was the collective war cry. Mesut Oezil was the first to get them jumping from their seats. Oh, hes my favourite player, hes so good  always coming up with the unexpected, smiled Andrea Kellmann, who works in the German consulate office.        
	Beer flowed  with one pint of German Weiss, an Erdinger brought by Tesch, the prize catch of the evening, later to be claimed by Jane Forsterling, a tourist in town, for coming closest with her prediction (3-1) of the result.        
	Back home in Dusseldorf, I would have watched with friends on a portable TV on the banks of the Rhine with barbecued food. But we cant complain, said Andrea. After the final scoreline, she certainly had no reason to complain.        
	So is this soccers World War III? Not really. Its true, you cant escape all the hype thats always generated around this match...I would still like to look at this as only another game of football, said Tesch, who grew up in Johannesburg, playing a lot of soccer.        
	 But it didnt remain just another match by the time the final whistle blew. This is unbelievable, exulted Bernd Meissner, the host for the evening, who comes from Rottenburg near Stuttgart and is the managing director of a German company in India.        
	Meissners fridge was fast emptying of beer bottles as the German group drowned in the Bloemfontein blitzkrieg. All the roads are jammed with the auto corsos (caravan of cars). There are unbelievable scenes here, wish you were here, Meissners wife Gondel called from Rottenburg to declare, as the group did their high-fives and Calcutta connected seamlessly with Cologne.        
	So will the German consulate celebrate with a holiday on Monday? No, instead, I will urge my staff to work harder, like the football team. I want them to perform on 4-1 basis, declared Tesch.        
	Trust the Germans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Diwali gift, gorge amp; splurge
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Diwali gift, gorge amp; splurge
          Barely three weeks after the curtains came down on the Great Calcutta Shopping Festival  aka Durga Puja  the city shopper was back in buy-buy mode for Dhanteras, Kali Puja and Diwali. Metro decodes the Calcuttans festive shopping list                      Butterscotch Crepe            Branded watches                          
	Sweet surrender         
	The Diwali dhamaka is as much about bright lights as sweet bites. Traditional must-haves like Badam Katli, Motichoor Ke Laddoo, Barfi, Gulab Jamun and Chandrakala remain pop picks but desi-meets continental confectionery seems to be the flavour of the season. Gupta Brothers Jharokha is offering fusion sweets like Butterscotch Crepe and Nasheeli Malai Gilouri. The Malai Gilouri is a traditional sweet, we have just given it a butterscotch flavour, says Rajesh Gupta. Other innovations from Gupta Brothers Jharokha include Butterscotch Chhanar Payesh and Chocolate and Orange Sohanpapdi. The demand for fusion sweets has doubled in the past two years, says Gupta.        
	Fruity Freeze, a sister concern of Mama Mia!, is offering Dry Fruit-flavoured Anjeer and Toffee Walnut, Rabri Malai and Mishti Doi-flavoured ice-creams in addition to the existing Daab Malai and other flavours.            Crystal Ganesha      
	6 Ballygunge Place, which came up with Chhanar Payesh in a chocolate shell for Puja, is back with Blackforest Rasmalai for Bhai Phonta-Bhai Dooj. People appreciate experimental items, says Sushanta Sengupta of 6 Ballygunge Place.  
	Gift-wrapped        
	If you shopped till you dropped for yourself and your family during Puja, Diwali is about picking up gifts for relatives, friends and professional acquaintances. Again, old favourites like decorated sweet and dry-fruit packets are flying off the shelves, but many are going beyond the traditional.                  Go for gold, girl      
	At Shoppers Stop and Oxford Bookstore, candles of every shape, size and form  regular, scented or floating  are hot buys. At Starmark, the pop picks are crystals,  especially Lakshmi-Ganesha idols  kids products and DVD collections of classics.        
	The gift-it-right brigade is not shy of digging deep into the pocket either, with branded pens, watches and sunglasses in the sell-well bracket. People usually gift clothes during Durga Puja but prefer non-apparel buys as Diwali gifts, says Navin Misra of Shoppers Stop.  
	Also selling: silver coins and silver knick-knacks.                  
	Razzle dazzle            Floating candles      
	With Dhanteras and Diwali, she had every reason to splurge this week. Its auspicious. Its attractive. Plus, at Rs 19,500 per 10g and counting, its good and safe  investment.        
	This Dhanteras, Calcutta spent not just on gold jewellery but bars and coins too. At Anjali Jewellers, gold necklaces of 10-30g moved fast, as did bangles. At M.P. Jewellers, gold necklaces weighing 25-35g were the pop picks. At Guinea Emporium, balas, and churs of 60-65g a pair did well. Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons have seen a demand for gold bars the past few years. This Dhanteras, we sold 30 per cent more gold bars than last year. The 10g bars sold the most, says Bachraj Bamalwa. Sanjiv Kejriwal of Gold Silver Arts on Kalakar Street sold 25 per cent more gold coins this year. The 8g coin was the most in demand.              
	Lamp lore                  Dry fruit gift packs      
	Lighting 14 pradips a day before Kali Puja to ward off evil spirits is a tradition in Bengali homes. Earlier, we would buy the earthen lamps for Re 1 each. But now my daughter insists on buying designer diyas, said Seema Chakraborty of Beleghata.                  Teacup diyas          
	At Starmark, Charmukhi, Panchmukhi and Shagun diyas crafted in terracotta are the pop picks, while the experimental homeowner is picking up ceramic magic lamps, teacup-style diyas, aroma therapy diffusers that double as diyas and tulip diyas.

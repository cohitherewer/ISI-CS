                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Recruitment stay on madrasah panel
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday passed an interim order restraining the Madrasah Service Commission from recruiting teachers and other employees till further orders.        
	Justice Aniruddha Boses order followed petitions by the West Bengal Madrasah Association and Tantibagh Girls High Madrasah, which sought quashing of the government order to set up the commission to recruit teachers and other employees for state-aided madrasahs.        
	The petitioners submitted that the setting up of the commission infringed on the rights enjoyed by the madrasahs as minority institutions to appoint employees on their own.        
	The judge, while posting the matter for hearing three weeks later, issued an interim order restraining the commission from appointing any employee.        
	In 2007, the state government had issued a notification declaring all madrasahs minority institutions.        
	In 2008, it issued another notification, setting up the Madrasah Service Commission.        
	The other government-aided minority institutions  such as those run by Christian and Buddhist communities, as well as non-Madrasah Muslim schools  recruit their own teachers.

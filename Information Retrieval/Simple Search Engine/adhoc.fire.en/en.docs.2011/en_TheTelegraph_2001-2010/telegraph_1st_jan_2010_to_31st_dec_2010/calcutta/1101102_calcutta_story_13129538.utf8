The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rare cold day under cloud cover
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rare cold day under cloud cover
  - Maximum temperature 6 degrees below normal; winter still month away          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Calcuttans woke up to the first chill of the festive season on Aishwarya Rai Bachchans birthday as the city experienced an unusual weather phenomenon  cold day condition  marked by a maximum temperature six degrees below normal.        
	We call it a cold day when the maximum temperature is at least five degrees below normal. The phenomenon, common in late December and January, hardly occurs in November, an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi, told Metro.        
	Mondays maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius, with the weatherman attributing it to a cloud cover and light rain (0.1mm till 5.30pm).        
	The cold day condition is unlike the cold wave condition, brought about by a drop in the minimum temperature by at least five degrees below normal.        
	The first day of November also recorded another meteorological oddity  with the minimum temperature just two notches above normal at 24.2, the mercury had to climb only 0.9 degrees during the day. Between 5.30am and 2.30pm, the temperature approximately rose by only 0.9 degrees, said the IMD official.        
	The pleasant weather, which may stay for a day or two, is unlikely to signal an early winter. The temperatures will be lower than normal for a couple of days but that does not mean winter will arrive ahead of schedule, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	A scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida, said: Winter is not expected before the first week of December.                    
	The weatherman attributed Mondays cool breeze  and the cloud cover and light rain  to a low-pressure trough that extends from Bengal to Tamil Nadu.        
	The trough is responsible for the rain. While the coastal belt will receive relatively heavy showers, the city and its neighbourhood is likely to experience light to moderate spells of rain, Debnath said.        
	Meteorologists said the cloud cover was insulating the surface from heat through solar radiation, resulting in the wintry feel.

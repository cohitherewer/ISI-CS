The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | No Holly please, its Calcutta   City denied Holly ticket
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      No Holly please, its Calcutta     - Bolly-only screens deny city a date with George, Julia and more          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                    
	Mumbai: Matt Damon, Morgan Freeman, Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin.        
	Calcutta: Princess, Frog.                          Julia Roberts with Bradley  Cooper in Valentines Day                George Clooney with Vera   Farmiga in Up In The Air                Matt Damon in Invictus                Sandra Bullock in The Blind Side      
	The great divide continues to widen. This Holi weekend, while Mumbaikars could pick Clint Eastwoods Invictus or choose the starry rom com Its Complicated, the only non-Bollywood option for Calcuttans was the animated The Princess and the Frog. That too with just two shows in one multiplex.        
	Friday after Friday, Bolly-only Calcutta is denied a ticket to Hollywood. From The Blind Side to Julie amp; Julia, from The Informant! to Up in the Air, the prints reach Mumbai and Delhi but never make it to this part of the world. It doesnt matter if they have big stars  George Clooney to Julia Roberts  or if they are in the running for the Oscars.        
	Take Valentines Day, the latest love biggie from Garry Pretty Woman Marshall. It was ready to come to Calcutta, with the rest of the world, on February 12 but a last-minute logistical problem meant that My Name is Khan was the only release that Friday.        
	With the likes of Lighthouse and Globe gone, the multiplexes have a monopoly and they refuse to look beyond Bollywood. Two shows less of Khan wouldnt have made a difference but they didnt even want to lose out on that, says an industry insider.        
	So, whos to blame for the Hollywood drought in town? Everyone. Distributors blame it on the plexes for not giving them space, exhibitors blame it on the lack of demand, the audience blames it on the lack of supply. Result: pirated DVDs and torrent downloads for Holly, halls for Bolly.                          
	Captain Virendra Marya INOX argues: The Hollywood studios and their distributors choose not to release the films in Calcutta. We have always supported English films but its unfortunate that we do not get an opportunity to play them. Its not a programming problem to balance a Bolly biggie with a Holly release.         
	Distributor-exhibitor Arijit Dutta rues that young Calcuttans havent developed the habit of watching English films at the theatres. This situation is going to get worse because this entire new generation is not getting a chance to enjoy Hollywood in the halls.        
	The day-date release for a Hollywood film is now restricted to a franchise like Harry Potter or James Bond, comic-book adaptations like Spider-Man or Iron Man, or a Rs 1,200 crore giant like Avatar. Ironically, these did handsome business in the city, confirm the plexes, with the James Cameron 3D film and Guy Ritchies Sherlock Holmes going full for weeks.        
	The city is also steadily slipping down the charts for a phase release, where the same prints move from Circuit A to Circuit B to Circuit C.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | March for Mamata from seat of power
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      March for Mamata from seat of power
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          Employees leave Writers Buildings on Wednesday afternoon to join Mamata Banerjees rally. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Wednesday, 12.30pm. Around 200 state government employees, shouting Trinamul Congress slogans and holding aloft party flags and banners, leave Writers Buildings to join Mamata Banerjees martyrs day rally at Esplanade.        
	History is made today, quipped Sanket Chakraborty, the general secretary of the Trinamul-affiliated Federation of Secretariat Employees (West Bengal).        
	For the first time since the Left Front swept to power in 1977, state employees are leaving the secretariat in droves on a working day to attend a rally organised by an opposition party.        
	The policeman at gate 1 of the red citadel, which many believe would be Mamatas fief a few months hence, could not believe his eyes when he saw the 200-odd Didis men march out of the building with a swagger that one often associates with foot soldiers on the other side of the political divide.        
	Things have changed. Such scenes were common when the Left called a rally but never seen during a Trinamul roadshow, the cop said.        
	The march was not the days only exodus from the seat of power to express solidarity with the sworn enemy of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	As the rally hour approached, many pro-Trinamul employees in groups of five to 10 kept leaving Writers. Quite a few had applied for a half-day casual leave, citing organisational purpose.        
	Earlier, employees used to sneak out to take part in an opposition party meeting. Some did take leave but none dared to mention the reason for fear of reprisal. The winds of change has removed the fear, said Partha Mukherjee, an employee in the social welfare department who left office with six of his colleagues at 1pm.        
	According to police estimates, at least 2,500 of the 7,000-odd employees at Writers had left by 1.30pm.        
	Trinamul sources put the figure at 3,000-plus but the CPM-affiliated co-ordination committee refused to admit that the turnout from the nerve centre of red rule in the state was more than 200.        
	Around 200 employees of the Trinamul union left in a procession. Attendance is otherwise normal, said Ananta Banerjee, the committees general secretary.        
	The offices of transport, finance (budget and taxation), information and cultural affairs, PWD (roads), social welfare and correctional services departments wore a deserted look by 2pm. The absenteeism in some departments was as high as 90 per cent.        
	There are 130 employees in this department. Only 17 of us are still here, said a transport department employee. In the adjacent social welfare department office, 48 of the 70 employees were missing.        
	Home secretary Samar Ghosh said in the evening that he did not have the figures of other departments but was satisfied with the attendance in his own department.        
	Asked if employees could mention organisational purpose as a reason for a half-day casual leave, Ghosh said: People take casual leave for any sudden need. There is no mention in the rulebook of what reason can be stated.

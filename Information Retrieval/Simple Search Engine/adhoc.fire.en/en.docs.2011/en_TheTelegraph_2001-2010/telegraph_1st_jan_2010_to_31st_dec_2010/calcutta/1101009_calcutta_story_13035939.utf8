The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | AC rakes run few but full
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      AC rakes run few but full
  - Power system needs overhaul for Metro to go all cool          SANJAY MANDAL                                    
	Calcutta Metros air-conditioned trains will run the full stretch between Dum Dum and New Garia from Saturday but its entire power supply system has to be overhauled for all the trains to go cool, senior officials said on Friday.        
	The two AC rakes, which had joined the ageing Metro fleet in July, made their commercial debut on Friday, making two runs between Dum Dum and New Garia in the afternoon and evening.        
	As of now, the AC trains will run the full stretch. After a few days, well take a decision on whether they will run the full stretch or only in the extended section, a senior Metro Rail official told Metro.         
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee had on Thursday announced that the AC trains would run only between Tollygunge and New Garia to avoid any operational glitches.        
	The plan was to ask passengers on the AC coaches to get down at Tollygunge and take the next non-AC train.         
	Metro sources said there were two reasons why they had decided to run the full stretch. We apprehend agitation by passengers if we ask them to get down at Tollygunge, said an official.        
	Second, the maintenance base for the new trains has been set up at the Noapara car shed near Dum Dum. So, its not practically feasible to take the empty train from Dum Dum to Tollygunge and back, a Metro source said.        
	Officials said once all the 13 AC trains joined the fleet, it would not be possible to run the trains without upgrading the power supply system. The AC trains consume much more power than non-AC ones and so we need to overhaul the power supply system, said a senior official.        
	During Thursdays inaugural run, the power supply system tripped thrice, sources said. The system was repaired and running two trains wont be a problem now, they said. For the entire fleet to turn AC the sub-stations have to be upgraded and Metro would seek more power supply from distributors.        
	On Friday, both the AC trains ran slower than the 50kmph a normal coach clocks. The first train was delayed by 15 minutes and the second by 25 minutes, officials said.        
	Railway Board chairman Vivek Sahay, who held a meeting with Metro officials, said steps were being taken to increase the trains frequency. I discussed with the Metro authorities the steps that need to be taken to increase the frequency. They will be implemented soon, he promised.        
	Sources said the number of trains has to be increased and the signalling system overhauled to increase frequency.

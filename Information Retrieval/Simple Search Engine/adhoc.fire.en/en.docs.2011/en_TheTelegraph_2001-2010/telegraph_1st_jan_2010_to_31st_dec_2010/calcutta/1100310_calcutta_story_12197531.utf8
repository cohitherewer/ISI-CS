	Manoranjan and Sikha Sarkars loss of the will to live after their only son took up a job in Bangalore and the resultant suicide pact is a news to be sad about, but it is not entirely surprising, given the mentality of Indian couples (Lonely couples suicide pact, March 5).             
	Soon after couples turn parents, their whole world revolves around the offspring. Not only do they detach themselves from their hobbies, the couples even lose interest in and warmth towards each other. Thus, when the children leave the nest for studies, jobs, or marriage, the whole world of the couple seems to come crashing down. Life becomes meaningless to them. And after remaining emotionally detached for two or three decades, it is just not possible for the couple to bond overnight and re-ignite their lost warmth. Naturally they land in a depressive state of mind, leading to disease or suicide.           
	Couples must realise that a childs upbringing will not be compromised if they continue to remain emotional towards each other. Of course, we should live for our sons and daughters, but there is a need to live for each other too.                     
	Kajal Chatterjee,
  Sodepur                       
	Apropos Rescue roads blocked, January 13, it is most unfortunate that fire tenders could not reach a slum at Ultadanga on time as roads were blocked across the city for an agitation. Whenever political parties organise a blockade, they say it is for the sake of the common man. But in reality, it is the common people who suffer the most because of political protests. I request all political parties to remember the suffering faces of patients, children and the elderly before organising a road blockade.             
	Sourish Misra,
  Salt Lake           
	It was shocking to read that tenders bound for the blaze at No. 4 Basanti Colony were not spared by Trinamul supporters, who had organised blockades at various points in the city. The party preferred to flex its muscles at the cost of the life and property of fellow citizens. This inhuman act deserves condemnation.           
	Nanda Dulal Bhadra, 
  Gobardanga                   
	Dacoits shot dead a passenger on Howrah-Amritsar Express (Journey of hope ends in tragedy, December 28). What was even more shocking was that his son did not get any assistance from co-passengers or police. The same day another report said Guards go missing on dangerous tracks. It seems the rail ministry is more concerned about the safety of security personnel than the lives of passengers.             
	B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park                               
	It is encouraging that an MRI machine was installed at Nil Ratan Sircar Hospital in association with a private partner (Private help to boost public healthcare, January 5). This will help the state keep pace with the huge demand for diagnostic facilities at affordable rates. Bengals healthcare needs improvement, but it is not easy for the government to do it alone. Private help can play an important role in this regard.             
	If private bodies and NRIs join hands with the government to make available medical facilities at cheaper rates, patients will get much relief.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala                   
	Apropos the question Do you agree with Amitabh Bachchans description of Calcutta? (January 16) I completely disagree with Big Bs high praise of Calcuttas warm and enthusiastic nature. Stars are lionised here and that is why they love Calcutta. But if the city was so good, why do Calcuttans complain of corrupt cops or indifferent pedestrians every day? How can such a city be warm and friendly in the true sense?             
	Amrita Mallik,
  Salt Lake                   
	With reference to the report Police attacked dated March 8, I would like to inform you that no such incident took place. Neither were any of our workers arrested by Kasba police in the morning or the afternoon of March 7, nor did we go for their release. The present inspector-in-charge of Kasba police station is openly siding with the ruling CPM in this matter.             
	Javed Ahmed Khan,
  Trinamul Congress MLA           
	Metro replies: We stand by our report, which was based on police briefing.           Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Binodini now a Bachchan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Binodini now a Bachchan
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                          
	She kept Calcutta waiting for more than two hours on a Sunday afternoon but the packed auditorium No. 2 at Fame (South City) wasnt complaining. The city has seen walkouts and protests against slo-mo celebs but for Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, any time is a good time for Calcutta.        
	For the hundreds glued to the outer glass wall of the plex, the visit meant curtailed movie shows, truncated lunches and abridged shopping.        
	So, when Ash, in a red-and-black salwar kurta ensemble, announced: Its always a wonderful welcome that I receive whenever I come to Calcutta, the words rung true.        
	Really, the city holds a very special place in my heart, she added, soaking in the warm applause and harsh flashlight.        
	The actress was here to promote Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Friday film, Guzaarish, where she plays the quadriplegic protagonists caregiver. An unwell Hrithik Roshan couldnt take the morning flight to Calcutta. But Aishwarya was more than happy to come back to the city that gave her Binodini (Chokher Bali in 2003).        
	Guzaarish too has a strong Bong connection, with Bhansali actually calling it a machher jhol unit, thanks to director of photography Sudeep Chatterjee, costume director Sabyasachi Mukherjee and the Bengali unit of production designer Sumit Basu. (Turn to t2 for more.)        
	She went on to hail one of the B-team members as a genius. And he (Sabyasachi) has become a friend now... having worked with him in a couple of ads, then Raavan and now Guzaarish. Theres a director in him but then again theres a director in everyone in Calcutta, she giggled.        
	It was the talk about her chemistry with Hrithik  from Dhoom: 2 to Guzaarish via Jodhaa Akbar  that put Ash on the defensive. Hrithik is a colleague. We both maintain that chemistry is something that happens on paper. We actors only infuse life in the characters that have already been written and been thought of by the director, she spelt out, word by measured word.        
	And what do the Bachchans think of that chemistry? screamed a bouncer.        
	You are talking to a Bachchan, she hooked hard.        
	But didnt the Prateeksha people play a part in getting her hot scenes with Hrithik edited out? I am not a newcomer. Why should I do something thats uncomfortable and then get it deleted and then offer an explanation? the ice maiden froze over.        
	It took a mention of Rituda (Rituparno Ghosh) for her to get back into melting mood. We recently met at the National Awards and he asked me when are we working again, Aishwarya trilled. I love working with him and we should do something together again.        
	Her parting shot before breezing back to Mumbai? Most of my recent visits to the city have been brief... I hope to come to Calcutta at leisure. Maybe for a full length schedule of a film.        
	With colleague Hrithik or hubby Abhishek?

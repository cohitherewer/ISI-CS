The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops wake up to terminal ills
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops wake up to terminal ills
										            OUR BUREAU                                          
	The police brass landed up at Calcuttas eyesore airport on Thursday to find a cure to the terminal illness that Metro has been highlighting for three weeks.         
	Additional director-general (traffic) Vijoy Kumar said after the 45-minute meeting with airport officials in the conference hall of the international terminal that increased police presence was the only way to bring a semblance of order to the chaos till the slow-mo modernisation project was completed.        
	The police deployment outside the terminal will be increased immediately, Kumar promised Metro.         
	He and the rest of the team, including the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas, then headed for Writers Buildings to finalise the damage-control strategy with director-general of police Naparajit Mukherjee.         
	The long overdue recce by the police brass comes in the wake of Metros campaign against the taxi trauma, traffic chaos and tout raj that have left the citys pride trampled.        
	Airport director R. Srinivasan said proper policing held the key to solving most of the problems.        
	 We have sought the polices assistance in taking action against unauthorised car rental services operated by different groups in the parking lots. We had taken up the matter with the district administration earlier as well, he added.         
	Additional director-general Kumar said police personnel would move around with loudspeakers to guide passengers and visitors, who are either left confused by the absence of proper signage or misled by the touts who trawl the entrances.        
	 There is a need to guide people entering and exiting the terminal buildings, Kumar added.         
	Police chief Mukherjee admitted that the state of the airport was a matter of concern, if not shame. Our senior officers are formulating plans for better traffic management in and around the airport, he said.         
	The Airport Traffic Guard, which manages vehicle movement in and around the airport, is apparently hamstrung by a manpower shortage.        
	 We need to monitor traffic along parts of VIP Road and Jessore Road along with that at the airport despite having limited manpower. We have been struggling to cope with the shortage of personnel and the extra responsibilities. As of now, there is only one sub-inspector in charge of monitoring traffic movement in front of the domestic terminal. Hopefully, that will change, said an officer.        
	Airport officials, who have been playing pass-the-buck with the police over the traffic and tout trauma outside the terminals, again blamed political patronage of illegal car rental services for part of the chaos.         
	These illegal car rental services are run by goons with the support of political parties. They fleece passengers but there is nothing anyone can do about it. This practice has been going on for years, said a senior official.         
	So how do the cops intend cracking down on such a well-entrenched racket? There is no escaping our responsibilities from now on. We will find ways to tackle the menace of illegal car rentals as well as touts who sell foreign currency at higher rates and demand a fee for even guiding a passenger to a taxi or providing him or her a trolley, said an officer who attended Thursdays meeting.        
	Plainclothes policemen will be deployed to catch touts who harass passengers, the officer added.        
	The meeting also discussed ways to ensure smooth flow of traffic along VIP Road, where bottlenecks have become common. Scores of passengers have missed flights because of snarls in recent months.        
	Do you think better policing is the answer to the problems plaguing the airport?

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three cellphones were seized from a murder convict serving life term at Alipore Central jail on Monday.        
	Police said Binny Ray, in his late 30s, used to make extortion calls to businessmen from his jail cell.        
	Two teams were deployed to corner Ray. One waited outside his cell and the other went to his home and asked his wife to call one of the numbers from which the extortion threats came, said an officer.        
	As soon as the phone rang, the other team rushed in and found it. Two more mobile phones were found in his cell, the officer added.

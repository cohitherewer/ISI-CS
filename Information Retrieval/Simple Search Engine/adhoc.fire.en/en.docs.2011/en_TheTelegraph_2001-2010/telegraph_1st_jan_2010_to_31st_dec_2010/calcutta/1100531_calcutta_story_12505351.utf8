                      Music, the great leveller                    It is cruel, you know, that music should be so beautiful. It has the beauty of loneliness of pain: of strength and freedom. The beauty of disappointment and never-satisfied love. The cruel beauty of nature and everlasting beauty of monotony.  Benjamin Britten Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda  the two pillars of the Bengal Renaissance left their indelible marks in two different spheres. They carved out their respective identities and became intrinsically linked with Bengals rich cultural heritage. Yet, there was one factor that unified them cerebrally  their immense and unfailing love for and devotion to music. Tagore composed over two thousand songs, encompassing the entire gamut of human emotions. From records we know he had a mellifluous voice and participated enthusiastically in programmes organised both at his ancestral home in Jorasanko and later at Santiniketan. Swami Vivekananda, too, had a deep baritone and he could hold his audience spellbound with his singing. In fact, Ramakrishna Dev had often asked his favourite disciple, Naren, to sing some of his favourite compositions and he would go into samadhi (trance) while listening to the songs. As a matter of fact, music always played a pivotal role in the lives of both Tagore and Vivekananda. Both were like instruments that reverberated with rich music when played by their deft musician  the Creator. This evenings programme pays tribute to these two icons through their works. Subrata Sengupta will render a selection of Rabindrasangeet, interspersed with Soumitra Chattopadhyays reading from Swami Vivekanandas writings on music and life.                    Event: An evening of Geeti Sudharas  Tattwe-O-Sangitey, Sanyasi-O-Kabi When: Today at 6 pm Where: Vivekananda Hall, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park

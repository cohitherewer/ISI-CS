The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Status quo in Basu battle
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Status quo in Basu battle
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Unchanged was the word to worry about and low immunity to infection the threat to watch out for in Monday evenings medical bulletin on Jyoti Basus condition after his 11th day in hospital.        
	The progress of curative treatment is not satisfactory; only supportive treatment is effective as of now, said critical care expert Susruta Bandyopadhyay, one of the doctors treating the veteran leader at AMRI Hospitals in Salt Lake.        
	Doctors said the 95-year-old Basu had a bout of fever earlier in the day but it subsided with medication. A Cortisol test in the morning had revealed a higher than normal level of the main steroid in the human body, prompting the medical team to decide not to administer any steroid as of now.         
	The evening medical bulletin issued by AMRI said that his general condition was unchanged from Sunday. He continues to be on ventilation support and ionotropes are (being) administered to maintain blood pressure. His urine output has been satisfactory, it added.        
	Basu, admitted to hospital with pneumonia on January 1, has contracted septicaemia, affecting his vital organs, including the central nervous system, kidney, cardiovascular system and liver. He is also suffering from systematic inflammatory response syndrome, which doctors believe is the reason behind the signs of multiple-organ dysfunction and fluctuating blood pressure.        
	The lung infection has been controlled but the cascading effect on his other organs is still there. His body immunity is low because of his age, and this is also the main cause of concern as the functioning of vital organs can be affected, said Bandyopadhyay.         
	A series of blood and urine tests were conducted during the day to help doctors decide the next course of treatment. Bandyopadhyay later called G.C. Khilnani, a reputable critical care specialist at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, for his views on the treatment pattern. He told me the treatment protocol was accurate, added Bandyopadhyay.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two men loitering in the domestic departure lounge of the airport on Thursday night turned out to be cellphone thieves whose photographs were in the rogues gallery since 2002.        
	Dwarkesh Kurba, 44, Ushakant Janardan, 54, and Syed Sheikh, 52, had entered the airport around 6.30pm with tickets for the 8pm Air India flight to Mumbai. Officers of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) started tracking the trio since Kurba and Janardans faces looked familiar to them.        
	The three were dressed like other passengers and were carrying laptop bags but were behaving strangely. One of them kept going to the check-in area and returning to the lounge. Another surveyed the check-in area intently before cancelling their tickets, said a CISF officer.         
	He and his colleagues detained the three and started questioning them. Kurba and Janardan admitted that they had been caught in the airport in 2002 for stealing cellphones. We later found their photographs in the rogues gallery. Hence, they appeared familiar, added the CISF officer.        
	According to CISF, Sheikh was a new recruit of the gang. The trio had planned to steal cellphones in the airport on July 7 but could not do so because the check-in area was not crowded enough. So they had cancelled their tickets and came back on Thursday, said another officer.        
	The three, who were later arrested, allegedly confessed to stealing cellphones at other airports. Only old clothes were found in their laptop bags.         
	On Friday evening, Karanjeet Singh was caught on camera while he was allegedly stealing two cellphones in the airport. Singh had a ticket to an IndiGo airline flight to Delhi.         
	Both cellphones belonged to a passenger who was to take a Kingfisher flight to Bhubaneswar.        
	After he lodged a complaint that his cellphones had gone missing, CISF officers scanned the security camera recordings near the X-ray counter and arrested Singh.

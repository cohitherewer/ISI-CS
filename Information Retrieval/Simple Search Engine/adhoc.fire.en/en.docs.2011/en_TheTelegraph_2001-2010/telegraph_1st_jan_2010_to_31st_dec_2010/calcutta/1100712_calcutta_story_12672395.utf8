The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Survivor trumps amputation trial
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Survivor trumps amputation trial
          RITH BASU                           Shreya Sen at the Tollygunge apartment of her cousin. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Till a month and a half ago Shreya Sen would insist on travelling by train so that she could lie on the top berth and read. But not anymore. The 22-year-old will fly home to Mumbai next week, trying to leave behind the memories of the Jnaneswari Express sabotage that claimed her right arm.         
	I always loved travelling by train and took every opportunity to do so. But I am glad we are going back (to Mumbai) on a plane, said the final-year student at LBS College of Architecture, after being discharged from AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria, on Sunday.        
	The girl, whose hobbies were dancing and singing  she even won prizes in fests remains as full of life as ever. Drawings are very important for an architect. Now that I have lost my right hand, I have to learn how to draw well with my left hand. I am confident that I will, she says.         
	Lying on her hospital bed, Shreya practised signing with her left hand. She also presented AMRI employees a card with a painting. I drew a floral pattern and wrote a four-line poem thanking them for making me well and supporting me. I wrote that I had come to the hospital a broken bird and was leaving with wings to fly.         
	In the Tollygunge apartment of her cousin whose wedding she had come to attend in May, Shreya relived the moments after the Jnaneswari Express jumped tracks and was hit by a goods train, when she was certain that she was going to die.        
	It was the boubhat of my cousin and we (she was travelling with her mother and brother) had boarded the train after dinner. So we went to sleep soon after the train left Howrah. I just remember the jolt with which the train got derailed. I fell down from the top berth, says Shreya.        
	She regained consciousness when the goods train hit their coach (S3). I was lying on top of three bodies and my right arm was attached to the rest of my body by just the skin. When my brother found me, I asked him to take care of our mother and forget about me. I thought those would be my final words.        
	All three survived  only four others in the compartment did.        
	Shreyas doctor, vascular surgeon Arindam Chatterjee, is hopeful that she will be able to adapt to an artificial prosthesis. After four to six week, we can try a prosthesis that would allow her to move the digits, he says.

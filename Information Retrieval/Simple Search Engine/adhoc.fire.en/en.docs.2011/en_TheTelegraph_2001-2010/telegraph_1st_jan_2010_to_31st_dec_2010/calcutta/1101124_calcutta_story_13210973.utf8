The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt in pool-car climbdown
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt in pool-car climbdown
        OUR BUREAU                                     
	The Maruti Omni got a new lease of life as a pool car on Tuesday with the government bowing to pressure from unions and allowing the bread-and-butter vehicle of the school conveyance business to be used commercially for another year.        
	Pool-car operators who had gone on strike last Friday called off their agitation immediately after transport minister Ranjit Kundu handed the one-year extension along with an extra two weeks  till December 7  to apply for permits.        
	He also pressed the pause button on the crackdown on the illegal pool car fleet in what amounted to yet another instance of the government taking the easy way out. The ban on two other types of vehicles  Tata Magic and Tata Winger  being used as pool cars would continue.        
	Tata Motors issued a statement late on Tuesday, saying that both the Magic and the Winger were absolutely safe vehicles, with best-in-class safety features. It said the low-floor height for easy entry and exit eliminated the chances of anyone getting hurt and that the sliding doors were equipped with a child lock each.         
	The government had dubbed the Magic and the Winger along with the Omni as unsafe for ferrying schoolchildren, citing the lack of a buffer at the front and the back among other things.        
	Minister Kundu insisted that the government was giving more time to pool-car operators to adhere to the rules rather than easing the crackdown.        
	He promised that the crackdown on errant pool cars would continue till indefinite period so that they are compelled to obey the guidelines laid down by his department. We had to show some flexibility. This decision was taken with the plight of parents in mind, he said.        
	Scores of schoolchildren were caught in the crossfire between two pool car associations, one of them opposed to the strike, on Monday.         
	Many parents expressed disappointment over the authorities using them as an excuse to let pool car operators off the hook. The government has let us down one more time, said Kanika Ghosh of Dum Dum, whose daughter Diya travels by a pool car.         
	So what were her expectations of the government? Pool cars are a necessity, but so is enforcement of rules. The government has maintained status quo, she added.         
	That the pool-car operators arm-twisted the transport minister was evident from their reactions after emerging from the meeting between him and four unions, representing almost 5,000 pool cars. Maruti Omni will continue to be used as a pool car even after one year, declared Abir Roy, the general secretary of the Pool Car Owners Welfare Association.        
	Minister Kundu contested the claim, saying that the crackdown on illegal pool cars would resume once the extended deadline ended.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          A skylift in operation during the Stephen Court fire. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Fire services officers brought a 54-metre tall skylift from Behala to Babughat on Sunday afternoon to assess whether it could be kept outside the river traffic guard.        
	We are sure that the skylift that is currently kept at Behala fire station can be shifted to Babughat so that it is quickly available for rescue operations in the heart of the city. However, we need the permission of the army first, said an officer from the fire services headquarters.         
	The army is the custodian of the plot earmarked for the relocation of the skylift.        
	We wrote to the army a few days back seeking permission to keep a skylift outside river traffic guard, added the officer, a part of the team that conducted the 10-minute inspection, after which the skylift was taken back to Behala fire station.        
	According to sources, if the permission is granted, the hydraulic platform would be kept in a shed by the side of the road. The other working skylift of the department is kept at Sector V.        
	The firemen were criticised for the delay in bringing skylifts to Stephen Court last Tuesday when people jumped to death.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girls suicide on Metro tracks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girls suicide on Metro tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An 18-year-old girl committed suicide by jumping in front of a Metro Railway train at Sovabazar-Sutanuti station around 7.40am on Tuesday.        
	College student Rimpa Das, a resident of Bagbazar, had left her handbag on the platform before jumping on the track. Inside the bag was a piece of paper in which the girl had scribbled her landline number and made a plea to convey the news of her death to her parents, said an officer.        
	The news reached the girls family around 8.30am. Rimpa as usual had left home around 7.10am for her tuition class, said cousin Anju Kesh. She was the only daughter of her parents who wanted to marry her off quickly. But Rimpa wanted to complete her studies first.        
	Neighbours said Rimpa had a relationship with one of her college friends but her family was against the relationship. Family sources, however, denied knowledge about any such affair.        
	Metro services were disrupted for around 40 minutes. Normality returned at 8.18am. Till then, trains plied between Kavi Nazrul and Maidan, said a Metro spokesperson.

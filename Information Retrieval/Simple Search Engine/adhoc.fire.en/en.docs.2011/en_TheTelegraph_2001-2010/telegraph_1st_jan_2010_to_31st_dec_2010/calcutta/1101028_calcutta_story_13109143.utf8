The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Snag rerun delays AC Metro
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Snag rerun delays AC Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Disruption in Metro Railway continued on Wednesday, with an air-conditioned rake running late by half an hour during a round trip following a snag in the braking system.        
	The snag was detected while the south-bound train was entering Gitanjali (Naktala) station around 9.52am. The train ran slower than the usual speed for the rest of the journey and reached Kavi Subhas (New Garia) station 11 minutes behind schedule at 10.08am.        
	As the problem persisted, technical experts ran a preliminary check and allowed the rake to start its northward journey. The train reached Dum Dum 15 minutes behind schedule at 11.05am. The delay in the round trip totalled 26 minutes, said a Metro official.        
	Each of the two AC rakes runs a round trip daily.        
	Once the rake reached Dum Dum, we sent it for maintenance. We are trying to make it available for service by Thursday, the official added.        
	The Trinamul-backed Metro Railway Workers Congress, headed by Madan Mitra, organised an agitation in front of Metro Bhavan during the day, blaming the CPM-backed union for the recent snags in Metro. The CPM-backed union is causing the snags to tarnish the image of our leader, said Mitra.        
	We have formed a four-member team pulling in personnel from the operations department. The team will keep a vigil on Metro establishments after duty hours, said Mitra.        
	Woman ill: Moina Das, 37, fell unconscious on a Metro train after it left Rabindra Sadan around 9.17am. Das was escorted out of the train at Netaji Bhawan station and taken to a hospital nearby.

                      Visual testament of human beliefs                    With over 21 years of experience as a photojournalist, Fawzan Hussain has travelled extensively across India and has done several international assignments. He specialises in the documentary style of photography. The genesis of Faith, the ongoing series of photographs by Hussain, happened when the artist was at the crossroad of turning 40. Advised by his friends and well-wishers to start looking towards the path of religion, he was offered several options by them: praying, going on pilgrimage, performing Haj and so on. These suggestions led Hussain to discover the concept of faith in different religions and regions. He travelled around and documented mankinds association with faith and discovered how each in their own way expresses their belief. The works on show have the power to amaze or shock the viewer and, occasionally, even touch them to the depths of realisation. The photographer comes across simply as a silent spectator to the scene, not making judgments but simply documenting. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts and Tasveer.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Fawzan Hussain When: Till April 27; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre, 36C, S. P. Mukherjee Road

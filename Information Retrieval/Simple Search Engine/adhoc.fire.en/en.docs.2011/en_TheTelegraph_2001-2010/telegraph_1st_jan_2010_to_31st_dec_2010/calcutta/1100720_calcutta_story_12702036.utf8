          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court has given police two weeks to come clean in a robbery case where the victim went to the local police station to lodge a complaint, only to find the culprits chatting with the cops.        
	Shantanu Roy Chowdhury, whose fuel pump at Sodepur on the northern fringes was robbed at gunpoint twice in four days last month, had moved court on July 14 seeking an investigation into the alleged cop-criminal nexus at Khardah police station.        
	Based on his petition, the single-judge bench of Justice Jayanta Biswas summoned North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Rahul Srivastava to court on Monday and asked him to file an affidavit on the case within two weeks. The affidavit should also state what action has been taken so far against the culprits, the judge said.        
	The order brings into sharp focus the mounting cases against police inaction in the city and its fringes. Around 300 such cases are pending in the high court, sources said.        
	Roy Chowdhury said his fuel pump at Panihati More, near Peerless Nagar in Sodepur, was first robbed on the night of June 26.         
	An armed gang snatched Rs 2 lakh from the cash counter around 1am. When my employees and me went to Khardah police station to lodge a complaint, we were shocked to see the robbers there. The cops refused to accept my complaint, he alleged.        
	The gang struck again three days later, this time in broad daylight. On June 29, around 11 am, the same group of criminals came to my fuel pump again and took away Rs 1.7 lakh. They then taunted me, saying the cops wouldnt take any action against them after getting a share of the loot, Roy Chowdhury alleged.        
	On July 1, the gang came calling at the fuel pump owners house and allegedly threatened to abduct his wife and sister if he failed to pay 25 per cent of his monthly profit to them. I immediately approached the superintendent of police but no action was initiated, alleged Roy Chowdury.        
	That forced him to turn to the court for redress in the curious case of cops and robbers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Win-win even when KKR loses   Tourney of good times lifts the mood
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Win-win even when KKR loses
   Tourney of good times lifts the mood
          SHRADHA AGARWAL AND KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                          IT HAPPENS HERE ONLY WHEN IPL HAPPENS: Shah Rukh Khan and Mehr Jessia Rampal on the ramp at the post-match fashion show on Saturday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                        
	Kolkata Knight Riders may not have done much for the citys cricket morale but it sure has lifted its party mood. The swing season that usually dies in February has been given a fresh lease of life  and a never-before high  by the IPL Nights.        
	Shruti Arora had bid bye to the party circuit as the Celsius began to soar in early March. Then on March 14, the first IPL Night happened followed quickly by another on March 16. Three more in April and she was hooked. There are many like her in the city who have been bitten by the bug of good times, out of turn, out of season.        
	Partying with the likes of Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra, Arjun Rampal and Shilpa Shetty means that a star-starved (and star-struck) city is living out its big Bollywood fantasies.        
	The IPL Night has taken partying to another level in town, said party regular Ratul Sood, attributing much of it to the SRK factor. Film stars led by Shah Rukh, cricketers and models all mingling with the local party crowd has given rise to a new, never-seen-before spunk.        
	This heady mix has drawn the likes of Chandni Rawla, 26. At the Dublin after-party on Saturday night, she and her friends stuck around till dawn and it was worth the wait. For the SRK factor, of course.        
	Oh my gaaawwwd, she screamed, hours later. Shah Rukh stepped out of the private enclosure at 5am and I actually shared the dance floor space with him! I even bumped into Arjun Rampal several times since we were standing quite close, gushed Chandni, who has attended three IPL post-match parties.        
	Though all the post-match action is happening at ITC The Sonar Calcutta, the party spirit has invaded most nightclubs around town. I usually dont go out on Saturdays but the IPL Nights have sparked off a new spirit. All the starry action is addictive and partying has suddenly become a big part of my routine, smiled Indrani, 25, a Shisha and Roxy regular.        
	But it isnt just the young hunting for their film-fashion-fun fix, with a good part of the crowd at Pala and Dublin from the 45-plus age bracket. We were surprised to see people from all age groups at the party, said Dev from Dev R Nil who showcased a design collection on April 1. Designers Anamika Khanna and Kallol Datta were also flooded with entry requests for their shows, from a cross-section of people.        
	People are even going party shopping, not just summer and shaadi shopping, added Dev. A typical shopping list for her includes high heels, cute clutch and designer dress. For him, a graphic tee was a must.        
	At the after-party, no one loses. Not even the cricketers who have lost at Eden. After a few drinks they forget everything and enjoy themselves through the night, said DJ Harish who mans the console at the Dublin parties.        
	Those who do get to enter the exclusive rock-till-dawn parties at Dublin manage autographs, cellphone photographs and a whole lot of starry-eyed moments. Even Harish had his moment on Saturday when Chris Gayle enjoyed his music so much that he asked the DJ for a CD.        
	So, how long after KKRs last match on Monday will the city rock on? Not much longer, warned DJ Harish. This party peak is just because of IPL-SRK-KKR. Soon, itll be back to business as usual.

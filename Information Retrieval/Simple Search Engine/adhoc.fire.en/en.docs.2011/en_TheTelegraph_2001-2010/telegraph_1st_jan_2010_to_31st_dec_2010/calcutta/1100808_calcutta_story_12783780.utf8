										      silly in the city                                  
	I watched Inception recently and I cant tell my reality from my dreams.         
	For example, I dreamt that I was sleeping next to my favourite pillow and dreaming. Within that dream I was dreaming that my favourite pillow and I were attached to each other by some sort of a wired contraption and we were part of the same dream and that after a while we sort of changed places but not really because I became my pillow, and my pillow, I.         
	But I was dreaming still. Whose subconscious was it exactly? Mine or my pillows? We had exchanged our personalities within the dream, but did that mean that we had exchanged our subconsciousnesses? Was my pillow doing the thinking for me, and I for my pillow? Who is the dreamer, I or it? The battle is on.         
	I told my pillow famously, or it could have been my pillow telling me: Youre waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You cant be sure where it will take you. But it doesnt matter because well be together.         
	Then I realised something with a shock. There was more dreaming going on. This dream was about some distant music, the echo of the ringtone of my mobile phone precisely, something which I keep hearing in my waking hours too, when the phone is not ringing.        
	As it became louder and louder, I realised that I was standing before an infinite progression of dreams, the way it happens when you stand between two mirrors and look at yourself. Though I didnt know if I was looking at myself or my pillow. And even if I had become my pillow, did it mean that my pillow had become me? But this was not the time to indulge in existential angst. It was just horrifying to feel that I could only get drawn in more and more into mine or my pillows dreams. Even if I was not I, I had to snap out of this multiplying, menacing maze and get back to reality.         
	So of course I smashed one of the mirrors in and to my great joy found myself back in my bed lying next to my pillow. I began to think how silly it was of me to think that I had become my pillow and showed what a shabby opinion I really had of myself and couldnt I find a better object to become, and if Freud was fundamentally sound or not, when suddenly a more chilling thought struck me.         
	What if I was still dreaming? (Whats the most resilient parasite? An Idea.)         
	Remember at the beginning I had told you that I had dreamt that I was lying next to my pillow? (I had kept that part deliberately understated.) So now that I feel that I am lying next to my favourite pillow, how do I really know if its for real or not? The bed looks so much like my bed, but my dream looked exactly like this too.         
	Fled is the music, do I wake or sleep?         
	I am waiting for the spinning top to wobble and fall.         
	And who, after all, is I?         
	But I do know that Mamata Banerjee is for real.       CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA (CHANDRIMAABPMAIL.COM)

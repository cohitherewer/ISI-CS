The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Buddha locks up fire report
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Buddha locks up fire report
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                              
	The Stephen Court probe report seems to have become a state secret since being signed, sealed and delivered at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees office over three weeks ago.         
	From the Trinamul-run Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to the Left Front-run fire and police departments, the joke doing the rounds is that the S.N. Roy Committees report is for his eyes only.        
	The chief minister is being so secretive about the report (submitted on July 2) that we have not been able to procure a copy of it despite approaching his office several times. We cant decide the future of Stephen Court unless we get the report, complained mayor Sovan Chatterjee.        
	Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee also claimed to be in the dark about the report.I was informed about some of the findings but am yet to receive the full report. I have had a talk with the chief minister and he has promised to distribute copies of the report soon, added Chatterjee.        
	Metro had revealed on June 22 how the report holds the fire department as responsible as the caretakers of Stephen Court for the loss of 43 lives in the March 23 blaze. The report also nails unionism in the fire services department  there are as many as 17 employees associations  as the prime reason for its inefficiency.         
	So what could be the reason for the chief ministers office not circulating the report? Only Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee knows what the SN Roy Committee has written. The various agencies tasked with ensuring there is no rerun of the Park Street tragedy are still waiting to know the recommendations, said a senior official at Writers Buildings.         
	Nobody from the chief ministers office was available for comment.         
	A joint committee of the CMC, police, CESC and the fire department has been in charge of 18A Park Street since the blaze. But little has changed for the residents desperate to move back in.        
	I am homesick. I request the state government and the CMC to speed up whatever they need to do and allow us to return to our apartments, pleaded Geetanjali Jolly, who has been living in a rented apartment at Ballygunge Place over the past four months.        
	None of the residents of the fire-ravaged sections of Stephen Court  blocks I and II and the fifth and sixth floors of block III  has been allowed to return on safety grounds. As of now, only six families stay in the unaffected parts of blocks III and IV.         
	Reconstruction of the damaged portions can take place only after the joint committee gives permission.        
	According to officials of the CMCs building department, the committee can decide what to do only after receiving the probe report.        
	At least two meetings of the joint committee were cancelled because we didnt have the report, said a senior CMC official.

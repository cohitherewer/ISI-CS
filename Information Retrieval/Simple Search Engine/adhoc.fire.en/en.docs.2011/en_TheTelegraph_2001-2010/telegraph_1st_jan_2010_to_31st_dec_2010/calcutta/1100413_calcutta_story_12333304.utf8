                      Communicating with art                    Art speaks a truly global language. It articulates our need to heal, reveal and transform. It transcends our ordinary lives and lets us imagine what is possible and what is not. It creates a dialogue between individuals and communication between communities. It allows us to see and listen to one another. Art is also extremely personal, whether one is an artist or a viewer. An artist uses mediums and colours to express himself, hoping that viewers are moved by his art. At the same time, what a viewer perceives, understands or interprets from a particular work of art is intensely personal to him. Art also has the power to inspire, influence and evoke emotions in viewers hearts and establish a connect between the artist and viewer. It is this unique equation between the creator and the viewer that has been captured in The Voices of the Canvas, the ongoing art exhibition. Participating artists include Prokash Karmakar (a painting by him appears here), Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Suhas Roy, Bratin Khan, Subrata Das, Shyamal Mukherjee, Sukanta Das, Samir Paul and Atin Basak.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minus equipment and efficiency, disaster team itself a disaster
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                        SOUL STREET SCORCHED
  Minus equipment and efficiency, disaster team itself a disaster            DEVADEEP PUROHIT AND ZEESHAN JAWED                                             
	Calcuttas hip n happening street witnessed a fire disaster on Tuesday that was as much the doing of an ill-equipped fire services department and poor co-ordination between departments as the callousness of Stephen Courts caretakers.        
	Smoke billowed out of the top floors of 18A Stephen Court till 11pm, around nine hours after flames were first spotted on the fourth floor, with firemen unable to confirm whether the fire had been finally put out.        
	I dont know what they have been doing all these hours. They dont move a bit without instructions from their superiors, who are equally clueless, said J. Dasgupta, a resident of flat 6A on the top floor of the massive building with landmarks like Flurys, Peter Cat and Music World on the ground floor.         
	Around 5.30pm, she and her husband, K. Dasgupta, were pleading with the firemen to use the staircase of the adjacent block to reach the top floor even as a man claiming to be a senior fire services official approached her for details of occupancy in the building.         
	I need to submit all these details to my saheb (boss). We need to prepare a report, the bespectacled bald man, in a kurta and trousers, said.         
	The Dasguptas had no option but to share with him whatever details they had even as flames engulfed their flat.         
	A group of firemen, leaning against the parked fire tenders at the open courtyard, stood motionless at the rear of the building as a blast rocked the area.         
	LPG cylinders are bursting in the flats on the top floor. The upper floors are full of smokeIt is difficult to reach the root of the flames, said a fireman, pleading helplessness.         
	The water-soaked khaki uniform and a handkerchief around his nose, of course, meant that he had attempted to reach the top floors through the rear of the building. Some of his colleagues continued trying to make their way up through the spiral stairs along Block 3.         
	Dont you have masks? asked a resident who joined the Dasguptas in the courtyard.         
	I have been witnessing this operation since afternoon. They dont have proper equipment, they arent trained either, said J. Dasgupta, seething.         
	Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee and Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of the fire services department, contested allegations about the lack of preparedness of their department as they rolled out details of the scale of the firefighting and rescue operation, which started at 2.25pm.         
	The duo said 41 fire tenders with over 280 firemen fought the blaze with the help of the latest equipment  two Bronco Skylifts, one 70 meters tall and the other 54 meters, and 20 new-generation bowsers (fire tenders).        
	According to fire control room records, the fire call came at 2.15pm and two fire tenders from the departments headquarters on Free School Street reached the spot at 2.25pm.         
	The flames were first spotted on the fourth floorThe strong breeze pushed them towards the northern side and the upper floors of the building. Full-fledged firefighting started only after the skylifts reached the spot at 3.30pm, said Rajeev Biswas, an employee of YWCA, adjacent to 18A Stephen Court.         
	Neither the fire minister  one of his kind in the country as no other state has a fire ministry  nor officials of his department would, however, admit any fault at their end.         
	We had to get the skylift from our depot in Sector V in Salt Lake. Besides, we had to face heavy traffic while we were on our way to Park Street, said a fireman.         
	The approach to the affected building was not smooth either as the cops sealed off Park Street only at 3.10pm although both police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and special commissioner R.K. Panchnanda had reached the spot by 2.45pm.        
	It was a clear case of lack of co-ordination between the two departments (fire services and police). There was no point in keeping Park Street open for vehicular movements, said an employee of an eatery on Middleton Row.         
	Lack of co-ordination and absence of leadership were visible through the day, as lower-level firemen looked helpless while trying to carry out multiple tasks  rescuing trapped people from the building and co-ordinating with the cops and the civic authorities.         
	The arrival of the two skylifts added to the confusion as the firemen dithered over whether to deploy it to fight the flames or rescue trapped people. Then, the firemen had another trouble to tackle  cutting off the tree branches to open the lift.         
	They didnt have any electric saws, which delayed the use of the lift. The ladder could be opened only after some firemen used an axe to cut off the branches, said a bystander.         
	Manpower constraints were also apparent in the operation, which stretched beyond nine hours. A source in the fire services department said out of 4,000 sanctioned posts, the department had only 2,050 fire operators.         
	Fire operators are the main people who enter the fire site, douse the flames and rescue people. As new recruitment have been stopped, almost 80 per cent of them are above the age of 45. You need younger people in the force, said the official.         
	Lack of proper training to groom the firemen was cited as another reason for the poor show. Until two decades ago, firemen were required to follow a gruelling routine involving regular drills and other activities to keep them fit and trained.         
	There would be a rope drill where the firemen would be trained to rescue people from highrises just with the help of a rope. I can challenge that none of them would be able to do that now; otherwise so many people could have been saved today, said the official.

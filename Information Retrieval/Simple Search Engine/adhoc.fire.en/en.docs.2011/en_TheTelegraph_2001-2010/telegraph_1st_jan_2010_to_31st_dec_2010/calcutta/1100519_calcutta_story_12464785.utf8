The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Under sniper fire in Bangkok hotel
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Under sniper fire in Bangkok hotel

	A businessman from Alipore was in the line of fire in Bangkok last week. On his return after attending a family wedding there, he recounts his brush with bullets for Metro, on condition of anonymity              
	Place: Dusi Thani hotel, Bangkok        
	Time: 5.30pm (local time)        
	Date: May 14        
	I was in the room of my cousin, the would-be-bride. As she was waiting for her mehndi to dry, we were discussing whether the family had taken the right decision by sticking to Bangkok as the destination for this destination wedding.        
	Suddenly, we heard a shot. We thought it was a cracker or a mini-explosion. The reflex action was to duck and lie flat on the floor of our room, number 1234 on the 12th floor.        
	I instructed my cousin to crawl towards the bathroom for extra cover. I had barely managed to crawl behind a wardrobe when we heard the second shot. Sniper shots, I told myself.        
	It struck me that our curtains were not fully drawn and the lights were on. I crawled to the window, drew the curtains, crawled back and switched off the lights.        
	After a while I ran out of the room to raise an alarm. More shots rang out in other rooms in the same wing, all facing the road. We began evacuating the rooms. The gunshots continued.        
	By the time the hotel security arrived, the firing had moved to the lower floors. The hotel shut down all its entry points and darkened the lobby. We were told to lie low or head for the basement. The firing became sporadic and then stopped. The night was long and anxious.        
	Next morning at 6.45am, I tiptoed out of the hotel through the back gate and walked through what looked like a war zone towards Holiday Inn, where my wife and children were.        
	Back in Calcutta, I have been telling people about my horrific experience and yet some have asked me if Bangkok is now safe to go to for the summer holidays!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | She does it with show of hands
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      She does it with show of hands
          OUR BUREAU                                          
	The password at Maharashtra Bhavan on Sunday was transparency as Mamata Banerjee went about proposing names for the top civic posts and then getting them approved by her councillors through a show of hands  including a few reluctantly raised ones from the back benches.        
	We are a transparent party and I believe in transparency. Let the names of the mayor, deputy mayor, chairman and leader of the Trinamul in the CMC be proposed by our party, declared Mamata, dwarfed by a larger-than-life portrait of herself.        
	Then, I will ask all of you councillors present here to say whether you agree to the partys proposals. If theres any difference of opinion, you are free to express that. Let there be no hide and seek.        
	She was talking down to the 95 newly-elected Trinamul councillors only because she was on the dais  along with some party MPs, MLAs and close associates  while her civic army was seated below.        
	Opening the batting for Mamata at 6pm was Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition, who went straight into the slog overs announcing dozens of names for the expert committee to be headed by ex- mayor Subrata Mukherjee.        
	While the final ratification was by Didi, there were inputs from various people around her, was all that a confidant would let on about how the 76 names were chosen.        
	Expert committee out of the way, it was time for the proceedings to be thrown open to the floor of the house  in this case Maharashtra Bhavan, off the Hazra-Lansdowne crossing. Trinamul MLA and state party president Subrata Bakshi was called upon by Mamata to name the Trinamul leader in the CMC  Manzar Iqbal. On cue, Iqbal climbed the dais and was told by Mamata to propose the name of the new mayor of Calcutta.        
	Sovan Chatterjee, blurted out Iqbal. Time for Mamata to take charge, again. Sovan, you please come to the stage. Now I want you (councillors) to raise your hands if you support him as the mayor.        
	The hands went up spontaneously and the claps rang out loud. The mayor-selects first task at hand was to propose the name of his deputy mayor.        
	With Mamata by his side, Sovan named the councillor from ward 28, Farzana Alam.        
	Silence.        
	Raise your hands if you support her, urged Mamata.        
	Most hands went up, but not all. A back-bencher even had his hands in his kurta pocket.        
	You are free to express your opinion if you dont agree. The names are being proposed by the people here (on the dais) but it is your decision (on the floor) that counts, she stressed.        
	All hands up.        
	Not taking any more chances, Mamata took the mike. Our next announcement will be the CMC chairman. I propose Sachchidananda Banerjees name. Are you supporting him? All hands up. Quick.        
	Those waiting for Mamata to name the members of the mayor-in-council must wait a little bit more. Firhad (Bobby) Hakim, Dipu Das Thakur and Tarun Saha will work as deputy leaders till the other announcements are made in the next few days, she said, passing the mike to Subrata Mukherjee.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata had finalised the top civic posts in consultation with Partha Chatterjee, the minister of state for shipping, Mukul Roy, and Subrata Mukherjee over the past three days.        
	As for the expert committee, the names have been landing on her table for weeks if not months. Some, like those from the world of art, cinema and theatre have been picked because of their personal equation with Mamata, said a former civic board official. Some have been picked on the basis of their track record in their areas of expertise, while others have been picked as if to fill a quota.        
	And many did not have a clue about making it to the E-list even after it was out.

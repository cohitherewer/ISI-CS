                      Sculpted stories                    Though consistent in his predilections to raise a concern, to convince and to render the poetic space which holds his bronze sculptures, Tapas Biswas expresses himself with a calmness, subtlety and quiet confidence that is distinctively his own. Inscriptions in Bronze, the ongoing solo show of his sculptures, features works that celebrate his cerebral potency and deep, primal energy. Despite the human effort, the electrical power, casting and other mechanical means used to create them, his sculptures are essentially simple structures of metal and grid, endowed with profound meaning. The world that the sculptor imposes on his images is a closed world, a world at rest and yet, a world of infinite duration  a blend of intimacy and decorum that stands as a unique example of the sculptors verve and language. Within the relatively quiet frame of every work is intense activity, a narration and nuances; its architecture dwells not in the particularities of place and telling, but in the amplitude of connections and emotions that attend a tale.

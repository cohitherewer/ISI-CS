The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Divider parts pose risk on airport artery
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Divider parts pose risk on airport artery

	The bases of metal dividers on VIP Road that had been flattened by speeding vehicles more than a year back are still protruding from the carriageway, posing a threat.        
	The dividers were laid about 18 months ago to create a lane for airport-bound vehicles. But speeding trucks soon started ramming into the dividers, bending the metal structures out of shape.        
	The dividers also caused more snarls than they eased and hence police decided to abandon the project, said an officer. The metal railings, however, were not uprooted. Their bases stick two to eight inches out of the tarmac in at least 50 spots on a 1km stretch of the airport artery, between Kaikhali and gate No. 1.         
	Motorcyclists run a greater risk of mishap than motorists. If a biker fails to spot any of the metal protrusions and rides over it, there will be an accident. He will be flung on the ground and run over, said Aniruddha Dutta, who commutes the stretch on a two-wheeler.        
	Senior police officers admitted that the remnants of dividers could turn fatal. The traffic department of the North 24-Parganas police has written to the public works department asking it to uproot the dividers, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.         
	I will try to expedite the process, he added.         
	PWD officials denied receiving the letter. The police first installed the dividers without our permission and damaged the road. It is their responsibility to ensure that the road is in good condition after the dividers are removed, said Debashis Ghosh, the executive engineer of Barasat Highway Division I.         
	We have not received any letter from the police asking us to uproot the dividers, Ghosh added.        
	He, however, promised to uproot the dividers if asked by the police.

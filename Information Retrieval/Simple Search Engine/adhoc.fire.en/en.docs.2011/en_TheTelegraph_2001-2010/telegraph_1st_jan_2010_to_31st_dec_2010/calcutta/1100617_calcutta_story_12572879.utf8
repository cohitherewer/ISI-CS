The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court asks for HS papers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court asks for HS papers
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court has asked the state Higher Secondary council to produce the physics and mathematics papers of a student who has filed a petition expressing unhappiness over her scores.        
	Anamika Bhaduri, who appeared for HS 2010 from Shri Shikshayatan School, has scored 6 and 20 in physics and mathematics but more than 60 in the other subjects.        
	The bench of Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay and Justice S.K. Chakrabarti on Wednesday asked the council to produce the two answer scripts on June 28. Anamika has not been asked to deposit any amount to the council for the production of the scripts.        
	Basabi Roy Chowdhury, the lawyer who appeared for Anamika, said her client had scored 66 in physical science and 78 in mathematics in Madhyamik.        
	But her HS scores in physics and mathematics are 6 and 20. In the rest of the subjects she has scored more than 60 per cent. She also stood first in the LlB-LlM entrance test of Sikkim University. Such a bright student cannot score such low marks in two papers in the HS, the lawyer told the bench.        
	The councils lawyer, Biswarup Bhattacharya, submitted that it would be difficult for his client to produce the answer scripts.        
	But the division bench, after hearing both sides, said it wanted to verify whether the answer scripts of the petitioner had been properly evaluated and asked the council to produce the papers on June 28.        
	A lawyer representing the council said several disgruntled students moved court every year after the publication of Madhyamik and HS results, seeking orders for production of their scripts. In most cases, the marks remain unchanged.        
	The council had recently questioned the high courts authority to ask for answer scripts, prompting a three-judge special bench to clarify that it was within the courts right to ask any exam-conducting body to produce papers. The bench also ruled that exam authorities had the right to ask petitioners to deposit a sum for production of answer- scripts.

                Pradip Mondal, 35, allegedly shot his 30-year-old wife Anjana in front of their three children after an argument in their Basanti Devi Colony home in Salt Lake on Thursday. Pradips 15-year-old son and daughters aged seven and three described to police how he shot their mother. Cops said Pradip had been convicted in a dacoity case a few years back.    The Bar Association, Bar Library Club and Incorporate Law Society withdrew their decision to boycott the courtroom of Chief Justice M.S. Shah on Thursday after the high court administration accepted their proposal to hold condolence meetings to mourn the death of lawyers from 3.30pm instead of 4pm.    Lieutenant-general Bikram Singh took over as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Command in Calcutta on Thursday. He was director-general of staff duties in the defence ministry.     The Union minister of state for shipping, Mukul Roy, launched renovation, upgrade and beautification of Bhootnath ghat (renamed as Rabindra Ghat) near the Nimtala ghat on Thursday. The programme has been undertaken by Calcutta Port Trust.

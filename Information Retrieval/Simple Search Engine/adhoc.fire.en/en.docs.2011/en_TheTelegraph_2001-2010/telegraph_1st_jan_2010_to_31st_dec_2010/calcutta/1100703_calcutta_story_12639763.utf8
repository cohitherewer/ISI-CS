          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The 12-member team headed by former chief secretary S.N. Roy that was probing the Stephen Court fire submitted its report to the chief minister at Writers Buildings on Friday.        
	Roy said the report stated how the fire started and the lapses and recommended steps to fight such fires. Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee said he was not given a copy of the report and the chief minister would decide whether it would be placed in the Assembly.        
	A high court division bench on Friday rejected the bail plea of Stephen Court caretaker Tarun Bagaria.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pool car turns turtle
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pool car turns turtle
  - Eight-year-old hospitalised after collision in Rajarhat          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Anupam Jhuri        
	Six students, aged between four and 11 years, were injured when the pool car they were travelling in overturned after being hit by a bus in Rajarhat on Monday morning.        
	Eight-year-old Anupam Jhuri, who suffered serious jaw injuries, has been admitted to a private hospital off the Bypass. The rest were released after first-aid. All of them are students of National English School, Rajarhat.        
	Bikash Sardar, the 19-year-old driver of the Tata Magic ferrying the children, has also been admitted to hospital. The car was allegedly not registered with the Pool Car Owners Welfare Association.        
	We have seized the bus from a garage in Chinar Park in Rajarhat but the driver is missing, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	The Tata Magic, headed for the Rajarhat four-point crossing, was plying down the Rajarhat-Basanti Expressway connector with the children from Bhojerhat in South 24-Parganas.        
	While the car was approaching Jamalpur, a private bus on route 211, coming from the opposite direction, hit the drivers side. The car rammed into a tree and turned turtle, recalled Abdul Gazi, a witness.        
	Local residents rushed to the spot and rescued the trapped children. Those inside the car, apart from Anupam, were Sarmistha Byne, 11, Sayan Byne, 7, Satwik Ghosh, 4, Yasmin Gazi, 6, and Himadri Ghosal, 10.        
	They were taken to a local nursing home from where Anupam, a student of Class II, was shifted to the Bypass hospital. Anupam was sitting in the middle of the rear seat and was hurled back under the impact of the crash. He suffered jaw injuries which doctors said were serious, said the boys uncle Sukhendu Ghosh.        
	Four-year-old Satwik Ghosh, numb with shock, said he was sitting beside the window and tried to crawl out after the vehicle overturned.        
	One of the guardians usually accompanies the children but there was no one today, said Satwiks mother Sonali.        
	In an attempt to rein in illegal pool cars, the government on Monday asserted that all small vehicles ferrying school students would have to apply for permits by January 31.        
	If the papers are in order, we will issue them permits by February 15, transport minister Ranjit Kundu said. He made it clear that after January 31, intensive raids would be carried out against the vehicles not applying for permits.

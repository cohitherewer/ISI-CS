The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt to cough up for plot payment delay
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt to cough up for plot payment delay
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday directed the state government to compensate at the current rate a woman whose five-cottah Bypass plot was acquired in 1988 and realise the extra payment from the officials who had delayed the disbursement of the money.         
	Laxmirani Pan had moved the court alleging that she had not been compensated for the plot at the EM Bypass-Rashbehari Connector intersection, which the government had acquired for the East Calcutta Development Project, because of callous and negligent acts of some state government employees.        
	Justice Debasish Kargupta directed the principal secretary of the state land and land reforms department to identify those responsible for the delay in paying the compensation and deduct the extra amount that the government would have to pay from their salaries.        
	The judge also asked the government to pay Laxmirani Rs 5 lakh, which she had to spend on litigation. This, too, would have to be deducted from the salaries of the officials responsible. If they have retired, then the amount would be deducted from their pension.         
	If the state had compensated Laxmirani in time, it would have had to shell out Rs 6 lakh. But now it will have to pay more than Rs 20 lakh since the price of the plot has gone up, Amit Pan, the lawyer who appeared for Laxmirani, said.        
	The government had acquired the plot on January 14, 1988, under the West Bengal Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act, 1945, which was amended on April 1, 1997.         
	The amendment resulted in revision of the compensation rate. The rate of compensation was reduced for land acquired for projects related to public interest.         
	But the collector, on January 12, 1998, sent a notice to Laxmirani asking her to produce the papers of the plot so that she could be compensated under the non-amended act. Laxmirani handed over the papers to the collector on January 19, 1998, and the process for release of compensation started, said the lawyer.        
	After two years, the government realised that it had made a mistake by promising compensation on the basis of the non-amended act.        
	On May 5, 2000, the collector issued a second notice to Laxmirani and asked her to produce the papers once more so that the compensation could be fixed on the basis of the amended act.         
	Challenging the validity of the second notification, Laxmirani moved the high court.        
	Her case had come up for hearing before Justice Kargupta recently.        
	The judge on Monday set aside the two proceedings and asked the government to start proceedings for paying the compensation at the current market rate.

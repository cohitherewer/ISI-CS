          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Three officials of Westside department store, including the operations manager, have been arrested following a complaint accusing them of driving a 21-year-old trainee to suicide.        
	Rabin Jain, who had joined the store three months ago, was found dead on Monday morning off the railway tracks between Akra and Nungi in South 24-Parganas.        
	The Westside management accused Rabin of thefts.        
	Rabins brother Pratik lodged a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station against operations manager Biswankar Dutta and two deputy managers in the womens clothing section, Avijit Singh and Ajoy Das.        
	Rabin, a resident of Bhairab Mukherjee Lane in Ultadanga, worked in the womens clothing section of the Camac Street store.        
	We arrested Singh, Das and Dutta on Monday night on charges of wrongful confinement and abetment to suicide. They were produced in court on Tuesday and have been remanded in police custody, said a senior police officer.        
	Akra residents found Rabins body split into four parts.        
	On September 5, after the store had shut down for the day, Singh, Das and Dutta allegedly held back Rabin and accused him of stealing Rs 100.        
	When the trio noticed an anomaly in the books on Sunday night, they grilled Rabin and made him write a confessional statement. On another piece of paper, they made him write his resignation letter before letting him go, the officer said.        
	The Westside management issued a statement, saying: Rabin was involved in a few thefts at the billing counter managed by him. He even confessed to the crime and submitted his resignation. It was at his request that the company didnt take up the matter with the local police station.        
	The police said that while the managers were questioning Rabin around 11.30pm on Sunday, Pratik had called up the store and was told that his brother was in a meeting. After that the family failed to contact him.        
	On Monday morning, Rabins father Tarun received a call from his sons mobile. The caller asked him to come down to Akra  on the Budge Budge-Sealdah section.         
	Tarun went there and found his son dead.        
	Truck theft arrest: Police arrested six persons on the outskirts of the city on Monday night and Tuesday morning for stealing a flour-laden truck after beating up the driver and his help near the Howrah truck terminal on Kona Expressway on August 26.        
	The six have been remanded in police custody for seven days.

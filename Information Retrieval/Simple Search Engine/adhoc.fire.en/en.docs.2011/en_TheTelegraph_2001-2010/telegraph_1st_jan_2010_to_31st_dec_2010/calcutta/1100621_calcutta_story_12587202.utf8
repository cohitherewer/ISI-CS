The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata plans station
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mamata plans station

	A new suburban railway station will be built near Ballygunge station, railway minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Sunday.        
	The planned station, between Ballygunge and Park Circus stations of Eastern Railway, will be built at the railway yard adjoining the Bondel Gate level crossing, at the intersection of Bondel Road and Picnic Garden Road. The station will be named Bahadur Shah Zafar.        
	The station, along with a market complex, will usher in development in the area. Since the number of passengers is increasing, there is a need to upgrade infrastructure, Mamata said, while flagging off two local trains between Sealdah and Canning and Sealdah and Sonarpur and work on a nursing college at Majherhat.         
	There is a need to ease the congestion at Sealdah and Howrah stations. In Mumbai and Delhi, new suburban stations are being built to reduce pressure on bigger stations, the minister said.        
	Railway officials said Indian Railway Construction Company was conducting a survey to identify the site of the proposed station and work out other details.        
	It will be a modern station with facilities like escalators, Internet kiosks and a food mart, said P. Guha, the divisional railway manager (Sealdah). According to railway officials, a suburban station costs around Rs 10 crore to set up.         
	The station would help residents of Picnic Garden and its surrounding areas, said a railway official. The railway yard would be shifted.         
	Mamata also announced the setting up of a new diagnostic centre near Kankulia level crossing, between Ballygunge and Dhakuria stations. Railway land is lying unused there. The diagnostic centre will help the poor, she said.        
	On the shortage of Metro Railway rakes, Mamata said new coach manufacturing units would be built to solve the problem. The Perambur coach factory has to get equipment from abroad to build a coach and it takes a lot of time. So the railway must be self-sufficient in manufacturing rakes, she added.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Jewellery worth lakhs and cash have been stolen from two city homes while the residents were away.         
	Diamond jewellery worth over Rs 3 lakh and Rs 13,000 were burgled from a Keyatala Lane flat around Wednesday noon while the owner, 53-year-old Sarala Devi, was out shopping with her 70-year-old help. Sarala has been living with the help in the flat since her husbands death several years ago.        
	Ornaments worth about Rs 2 lakh and Rs 25,000 were stolen from a flat in Garia while the residents were in Jalpaiguri.        
	Bhaskar Mukherjee, a 30-year-old trader who lives in the ground-floor flat along with his elder brother and his wife, returned on Wednesday morning and found the main door locked from inside.        
	He entered the 1,200sq ft flat through a window at the back whose iron grille had been wrenched off. In a complaint lodged with Jadavpur police station, Mukherjee said the cash and jewellery were kept in a cupboard.

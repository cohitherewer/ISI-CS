The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fare hike on talks table
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fare hike on talks table
  - Govt hides hand as operators demand ticket rise amp; tax slash        A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	A section of transport operators has demanded a fare hike while another has called for a slash in sales tax on diesel charged by the state, all to cushion the blow of the fuel price rise.        
	The operators on Tuesday afternoon conveyed their demands to transport minister Ranjit Kundu, who chose to keep his options open.        
	I am neither ruling out a fare hike nor committing to it, Kundu said. I have heard out the operators and will meet them again. We will assess the impact of the price hike and take a decision soon.        
	The bus and minibus operators have given the government 10 days to state its stand.        
	If the state does not do anything to help us tackle the fuel price hike, we will be forced to take buses off the road, said Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.        
	Bus operators led by Trinamul MLA Swarnakamal Saha, who is also the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate, told Kundu that the diesel price in the city had gone up by Rs 6.36 per litre since the last fare hike on August 1, 2009.        
	Every owner has to bear an additional monthly expenditure of Rs 9,000 per bus following the hike in fuel prices, Saha said after the meeting.        
	The bus operators demanded that the government reduce its sales tax on diesel, which now reads 19.47 per cent.        
	The tax could be slashed, leaving the fares untouched. But the minister ruled out the option, Saha told Metro.        
	Minibus operators, on the other hand, demanded a 20 per cent hike in fares, approximated to the nearest rupee.        
	Fare hike is a must in this situation. If the existing fare for a certain distance is Rs 5, it should be Rs 6 in the new structure. Similarly, Rs 6 will be Rs 7 and so on, said Abashesh Daw, the general secretary of the Minibus Coordination Committee.        
	Taxi operators, too, demanded a fare hike, proposing a Rs2x+6 formula where x is the reading on a digital meter. The existing formula for taxi fare is Rs 2x+2.        
	We want the lowest fare (for the first 2km) to be raised from Rs 22 to Rs 26. If the digital meter reading is 25, the revised fare should be Rs 56, said a member of the Calcutta Taxi Association.        
	Taxi operators had earlier threatened to go on an indefinite strike from July 8 if the government did not increase fares by next Monday.        
	The minister asked them to desist from taking such a step as talks are on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Doctors deal double blow
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Doctors deal double blow
        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Patients battling everything from cancer to snakebite lost a second lifeline on Sunday with junior doctors of National Medical College joining their SSKM counterparts in a ceasework, crippling services at both facilities.        
	Kanan Pandits family had hired an ambulance to bring her to SSKM from Ghatal in West Midnapore, over 100km away, only to be denied admission.         
	She was bitten by a poisonous snake on Saturday and taken to the sub-divisional hospital, which referred her to SSKM. We have just learnt that the doctors here are on strike, relative Sibaram Mondal told Metro.        
	Mamata Dutta, a 38-year-old suffering from breast cancer, was also advised to go elsewhere. There are only two senior doctors on duty in the emergency ward. They advised us not to wait here for long, said brother-in-law Ranjan Kumar Dutta, desperately looking for alternatives.        
	One of the possible options  National Medical College  had by then shut its doors with over 120 junior doctors protesting four colleagues being assaulted by a patients relatives in the gynaecology ward on Saturday night.        
	The assault took place because the doctors were allegedly late in informing the family of a woman who had given birth about the sex of the newborn, the principal of the medical college, R.N.Chattopadhyay, said.        
	The junior doctors held a meeting with the hospital authorities over lack of security on Sunday morning but it ended in a deadlock.         
	Around 600 junior doctors at SSKM have been on strike since Saturday morning over the same issue.        
	Officials said it was impossible for state-run facilities like National Medical College and SSKM to function without junior doctors. Every day at least 500 patients come to SSKM. On an average, 100 patients are admitted, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM.        
	The junior doctors appeared determined not to call off the strike unless their long-ignored grievance about security was addressed. Security must be beefed up. Not more than two persons should be allowed inside a ward with a patient, said Dilip Dutta, the president of the Resident Doctors Association at SSKM.         
	The doctors intend running a parallel outpatients department in front of the administrative building on Monday. We will put up a tent there. Anyone who doesnt receive adequate care in the OPDs can visit us, Dutta said.         
	Health department officials expressed concern over the simultaneous ceasework. We have spoken to the hospital authorities. We hope the ceasework will be withdrawn, said principal secretary M.N. Roy.

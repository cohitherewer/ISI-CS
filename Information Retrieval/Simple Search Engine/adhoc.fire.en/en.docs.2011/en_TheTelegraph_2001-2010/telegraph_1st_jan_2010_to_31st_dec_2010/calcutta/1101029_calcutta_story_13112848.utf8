The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Board set to shift office
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Board set to shift office
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Madhyamik board will soon start shifting to Salt Lake from the building off Park Street that has been its home since 1951.         
	The construction of our eight-storey building, Nibedita Bhavan, at Karunamoyee in Salt Lake is nearing completion. We hope to inaugurate it next month, said board president Mamata Ray.        
	The date of the inauguration is likely to be finalised after a clearance from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has been invited to open the building.        
	The board currently operates out of the rented six-storey building at the Park Street-Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road crossing. Once our Salt Lake campus is complete, the administrative departments will be shifted there in phases, said Ray.         
	According to the plan, the current office will continue to house some departments.         
	Space problems over the past few years have forced the shift. With the increase in number of Madhaymik examinees, the boards workload has also increased. We now need a bigger space to manage the huge number of answer scripts, said a board official.        
	Over 9.5 lakh candidates took the Madhyamik this year. The number was around 6 lakh in 2006.        
	All answer scripts have to be stored for at least six months after the examination.        
	According to the official, a bigger strong room with modern security facilities is needed to keep the answer scripts. Also a more modern record section is needed to cope with the pressure.         
	Three small rooms serve as the records section in the existing office of the board, said an employee.        
	A full floor will be devoted to the records section in the new Salt Lake building, he added.        
	The new building will have a well-equipped strong room and spacious conference rooms, said another official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ex-students speak up for school
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ex-students speak up for school
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The alumni of La Martiniere will appeal to the acting board of governors of the boys school to make public the findings of its inquiries into the controversies rocking the campus.        
	In the 21st century, we can no longer take shelter under the veil of dignified silence, said Ashit Luthra, an old boy of the school, speaking at the press conference organised by The Association of La Martiniere Alumni (ALMA).        
	Luthra also said the alumni would request the board to modernise the school system and introduce new rules and facilities.        
	The alumni were eager to disassociate the institution from certain individuals to save the name and reputation of the school. The principal is a paid employee of the school and is not the representative of the school. The board is the representative, said Avik Saha, an advocate of Calcutta High Court.        
	According to the representatives of ALMA, that included green activist Bonani Kakkar, doctors Ronen Roy and Darius Anklesaria, and president of the association I.S. Bhandari and golf administrator Brandon DSouza, linking the death of Rouvanjit Rawla to the caning he had received in school was far-fetched and needed a probe.        
	We are not defending the principal, but everyone should be given a fair trial, said Saha. Anklesaria and Roy urged that the scope of the inquiry be broadened to look at the social circumstances of Rouvanjit. We demand that the law is implemented fully, added Luthra.        
	According to the alumni, dragging the school into a controversy that involves a few individuals is not the correct way forward. It is affecting the children in the school as well, said Saha.

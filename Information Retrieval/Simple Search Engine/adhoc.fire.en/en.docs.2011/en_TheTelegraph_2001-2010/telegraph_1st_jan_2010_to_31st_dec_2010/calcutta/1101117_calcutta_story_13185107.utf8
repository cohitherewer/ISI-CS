          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A nationalised bank has lodged a police complaint stating that at least 24 people who had taken home loans had deliberately defaulted on repayment.        
	Cases of cheating and forgery have been registered against two on Tuesday. An officer said the fraud amounted to Rs 23 lakh in the two cases.        
	The accused had approached the Posta branch of State Bank of Hyderabad for home loans. Both submitted false documents, said an officer. In all 24 cases, the loans were sought against non-existent plots or flats.        
	Once all 24 cases are filed, the fraud may run into crores.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | BBD Bag building faces safety test
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      BBD Bag building faces safety test
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          Stephen House where firefighting norms are violated                                  
	A team will visit Stephen House on Saturday to inspect safety measures in the BBD Bag building where a fire broke out last Sunday.        
	The team comprising representatives from the fire department, CESC, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Hare Street police station will submit its report to the special additional commissioner of police, Banibrata Basu.        
	If the buildings owner fails to implement the teams recommendations, an FIR will be lodged against him. We will also appeal to the court to keep the building shut till proper safety measures are put in place, said fire department officials.        
	Metro published a report the day after the fire broke out in a bank in Stephen House, highlighting how neglect of safety aspects had turned the landmark into a tinderbox.        
	A fire department official at Writers Buildings said: An unofficial report filed by the team that visited the building states that the condition there is very bad. A disaster is waiting to happen.        
	The electrical wiring inside the building is decades old and haphazard. There is no estimate on the number of air conditioners on the premises.        
	We have heard that illegal constructions have been made inside the building blocking the corridors. If a fire breaks out, people may get trapped, said a building department official of the CMC.        
	Stephen House has 200 offices employing around 1,000 people. There is no tenants association here. Nobody has ever taken any initiative to install fire-fighting equipment, said an employee of a share trading firm housed in the building.        
	The structure was built more than 80 years ago by Arathoon Stephen, who also built Stephen Court on Park Street where an inferno in March claimed 43 lives.

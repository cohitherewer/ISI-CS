	If the price of apples and oranges left a bitter taste in your mouth last year, sweeten your mood this summer with mangoes. An unexpected spurt in flowering in mango trees in Bengal and other states has raised hopes of a price slash for the king of fruits this year.         
	Traders at Mechhua fruit market  the largest wholesale fruit market in eastern India  said despite a price hike for almost all fruits, they were hopeful that mangoes this summer would not be dearer than last year.         
	According to market sources, the average retail price of mangoes in city markets would be between Rs 30 and Rs 40 per kg. Last year, the price of some varieties of mangoes had touched Rs 50 a kg.         
	We have received reports that largescale flowering has taken place in Malda, Murshidabad, North 24-Parganas and Hooghly districts as well as in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, said Mohammad Sohrab, the president of the Mechhua Wholesale Fruit Merchants Association.         
	Even if five per cent of these flowers turn into fruits, Calcutta markets will be flooded with mangoes from June, he added.        
	Mango trees generally flower every alternate year. According to farmers, 2009 was expected to be a good year but the mango crop in Malda was damaged by a Norwester in May, causing a 25 per cent shortfall in output, which pushed up the price.         
	This year was expected to be a lean year but belying all estimates, almost all mango trees burst into blooms in the first week of February, said farmers.         
	Ranajit Samanta and Subrata Basu, horticulturists with the West Bengal Food Processing and Horticulture Corporation, attributed the unnatural flowering to the erratic weather. Fruit trees are most sensitive to weather and climate changes, pointed out Samanta.        
	West Bengal produces 5.85 lakh metric tonnes of mango in a year. Malda tops the list, followed by Murshidabad, North 24-Paraganas and Hooghly.         
	Calcuttas transactions in mango trade from June to August is over Rs 40 crore daily, said Sohrab.         
	Gulabkhas hits the market in the second week of April and the mango season ends with the arrival of Fazli in August.

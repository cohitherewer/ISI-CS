                      And the night shall be filled with music...                    Come winter and Indian classical music aficionados from all corners of the globe congregate in the city to be part of the annual Dover Lane Music Conference, considered to be the countrys most prominent music gathering. This conference has now been taking place for over five decades (it started in 1952). With outstanding nocturnal performances and subsequent beginning of the new day etched deep into many attendees minds, this conference is equally popular among musicians for the unique opportunity they get to perform and soak their souls in music. This years inaugural programme, beginning this evening at 7 pm, is dedicated to the memory of the great sarod maestro, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, who passed away in June last year. Todays programme features sarod recitals by Anindya Banerjee, Shiraz Ali Khan, Kamal Mallick, Alam Khan and Aashish Khan. This years festival is presented by Desh, sponsored by Anandabazar Patrika and The Telegraph, and supported by ministry of culture, Government of India.

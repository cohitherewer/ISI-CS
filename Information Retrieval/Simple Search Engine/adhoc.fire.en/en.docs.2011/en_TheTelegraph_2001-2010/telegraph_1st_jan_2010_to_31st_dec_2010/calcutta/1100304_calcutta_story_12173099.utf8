          MOHUA DAS                          Rowan Williams, the archbishop of Canterbury                                  
	The archbishop of Canterbury will visit Calcutta this Puja. Rowan Williams, the principal leader of the Church of England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion, will spend two October days here during a two-week private visit to India.        
	Canon Joanna Udal and Sue Park, two of the archbishops administrators from the Lambeth Palace  his official residence in London  had come to Calcutta in October 2009, when Ashoke Biswas, the bishop of Calcutta, and Sunil Caleb, the principal of Bishops College, met them to plan the archbishops visit.        
	I met the archbishop at the Lambeth Palace last month and he said that he would visit our city soon. He seemed interested in Bishops College, the oldest ex-Anglican college in India, and also in the social action programmes of the church here, Biswas told Metro on Wednesday.        
	The tentative dates of his visit are October 12 and 13, which coincide with Durga puja. It will be an interesting time for him to visit Calcutta, the bishop smiled.        
	Apart from being the highest-ranking non-royal in the United Kingdoms order of precedence and the Primate of All England, Williams is also a member of the House of Lords.        
	Calcutta is likely to be the first stop in his travel itinerary, which includes Patna, Ranchi, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and Thiruvananthapuram, where his wife Jane was born.         
	Bishop House in Calcutta is awaiting confirmation of the archbishops travel plans from the Lambeth Palace before chalking out his schedule.        
	We will hold a civic reception and an all-faith meeting. The archbishop will spend a day at Bishops College and visit our hospice centres in Behala, such as Florence Nursing College and Shanti Nivas, an old-age home, said Biswas.        
	Rowan Douglas Williams was born in south Wales in 1950 and was enthroned the 104th archbishop of Canterbury on February 27, 2003.

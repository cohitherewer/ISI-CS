          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Kaushik Pal, who was arrested on Tuesday for taking Rs 25,000 from a woman suffering from renal failure after promising her a kidney, told police that he had failed to arrange a donor for her.        
	A man was willing to part with his kidney but the organ was unfit for transplantation. I had no option but to run away with the money, an officer quoted Kaushik as saying.        
	According to the law, only a relative of a patient in need of kidney transplant can donate the organ.        
	Sleuths said Kaushik had struck another organ deal for Rs 1.1 lakh. He had brought a donor for medical tests to the Loudon Street clinic from where he was arrested. The duped woman spotted him in the clinic, said Damayanti Sen, joint commissioner, crime.        
	Officer said Kaushik and wife Swapna had sold a kidney each for Rs 1.2 lakh to pay back the family debt.

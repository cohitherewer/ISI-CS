The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Beyond simple thinking
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Beyond simple thinking
                                Raza at a book launch in the city (picture by Aranya Sen); one of his works being shown in Jaipur(below)                          
	Sayed Haidar Raza, 88, may have formed the Progressive Artists Group in 1947 with the likes of M.F. Husain, Francis Newton Souza, Akbar Padamsee and S.K. Bakre, but he is not in agreement with his controversial fellow traveller, often described as the Barefoot Badshah of Indian contemporary art, when it comes to Bollywood.         
	Husain may have gone fida over Madhuri Dixit and made the film Gaja Gamini with the actress in its lead, but the elitist Raza, who has lived in Paris for a good part of his life, has no time for this popular genre of film-making that is big news even in the West.        
	Frail of health and somewhat feeble, Raza, who, is on one of his annual visits to India, was in Calcutta recently for the opening of the Bhopal-based artist Akhileshs exhibition at Akar Prakar and for his current show at Jaipur. Wearing a black suit and a sky blue sweater underneath on a rather warm evening, the artist spoke his mind in a brief interview.              
	Has contemporary Indian art come of age?         
	Indian contemporary art has reached a high standard for the past 20 to 30 years. During the British regime teachers insisted on realism. But eyes were not what mattered most to Indians, inner perception did. Indians often work in a state above simple thinking. In many spheres intelligence is not everything. One has to go beyond that.         
	I was a student in Maharashtra in the 1930s. I was with the JJ School of Arts for three years. In those days the famous art critics Roger Fry and Herbert Reed used to say that although Indian artists were competent they were weak in perspective and anatomy.        
	Now Indian artists have reached a standard recognised all over the world. They are often sell-outs. Not that sale is the only thing that matters.              
	Have we gained enough self-confidence to support excellence?        
	At least some of us have. People will come to realise that Gaitonde, Jamini Roy and Amrita Sher-Gil are as important as Miro and Chagall. There is only a handful of people who think in a different way and can see this. It is their opinion that matters. In London not even 10 per cent of the artists are worthy of interest today.              
	What do you think of Bollywood being presented as Indian culture per se? Even the government is doing it.        
	Bollywood is an offshoot. It is popular culture. I dont have a high opinion of Bollywood. I never sought government support. At Gorbio in the south of France I have set up the Raza Mongillat Culture Centre. Apart from 60 works of mine, other French and Indian artists too hold shows here. There are performances of Indian and French artistes and people are full of enthusiasm about them. You should do the right thing. The Mahatma did the right thing.                    SOUMITRA DAS

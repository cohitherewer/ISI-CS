          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A small-time realtor who had allegedly opened fire to drive away tenants from an Elliot Lane house on January 19 was arrested in the Esplanade area on Thursday.         
	Police said a revolver was seized from Mohammad Arshad.        
	City detective chief Damayanti Sen said Arshad had been absconding since Elliot Lane residents lodged an FIR against him with Park Street police station shortly after the firing. Sleuths picked him up after coming to know that he had returned to the city and was roaming in the Esplanade area.        
	The police said Arshad had wanted to scare away the tenants of the Elliot Lane building, which he wanted to demolish and erect a highrise in its place. Arshad was also involved in an extortion racket in the Esplanade area, said an officer.

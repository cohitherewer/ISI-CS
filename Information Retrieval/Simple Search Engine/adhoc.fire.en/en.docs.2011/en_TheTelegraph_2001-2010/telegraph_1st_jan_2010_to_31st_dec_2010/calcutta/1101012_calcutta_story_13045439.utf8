                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen accused gets interim bail
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A vacation division bench of the high court on Monday granted conditional and interim bail to Sanjay Bagaria, a key accused in the Stephen Court fire. Bagaria, a joint director of Stephen Court Ltd which looks after the building, had been arrested in August in connection with the March 23 blaze that killed 43 people.         
	The vacation division bench, comprising Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Mrinal Kanti Chowdhury, granted Bagaria bail till November 9 and asked him to confirm his bail by then from the regular division bench of the court, which is now closed for Puja.        
	If Bagarias bail is not the confirmed by the regular division bench, he will be taken into custody again, said a lawyer.         
	Bagaria was appointed a joint director of Stephen Court Ltd in 1999. On March 9, 2010, much before the fire, he had resigned from his post, Bagarias lawyers claimed in court.        
	The public prosecutor, Ashimesh Goswami, opposed the bail plea and said: He is an influential person. The investigation into the fire will suffer if Bagaria is released from jail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | East lags behind rest in race for IIT
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      East lags behind rest in race for IIT
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                       
	Eastern India is still lagging behind Bombay, Madras and Delhi zones in terms of producing successful candidates for premier engineering schools in the country, the results of the IIT-JEE revealed on Wednesday.         
	This year, 13,104 students have made it to the 15 Indian institutes of technology (IIT), Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (IT-BHU), and the Indian School of Mines (ISM), Dhanbad.         
	Of them, 1,481 are from the IIT Kharapur zone, which includes Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar, said A.N. Samanta, the chairman of JEE at IIT Kharagpur.         
	Bengals contribution to this figure stands at 571.         
	Anumula Jithendar Reddy from the Madras zone topped the all-India merit list. Vipul Singh of Ranchi, who came fifth, emerged as the topper from the Kharagpur region, from where 59,039 candidates had taken the entrance test.         
	Bombay zone has thrown up the maximum number of successful candidates followed by Madras, Delhi and Kharagpur this year. Roorkee, Kanpur and Guwahati trailed the Kharagpur zone both in terms of success rate (percentage of successful candidates out of total examinees) and contribution to the merit list.         
	There has been a marginal improvement in the eastern zones contribution to the merit list and success rate, but the increase is hardly significant, said an official of a pan-India training institute.         
	Records available with the IITs show that 11.3 per cent of successful candidates are from the east this year, compared with 9.24 per cent in 2009. Similarly, the success rate has gone up from last years 1.77 per cent to 2.5 per cent this year.         
	But the increase cannot be solely linked to improvement in performance as the number of seats in the IITs has gone up from 8,295 last year to 9,509 for the 2010 session.        
	According to experts, one of the main reasons for the poor performance of Bengal students is the mismatch in the state board and IIT-JEE syllabi. The West Bengal board syllabus is oriented more towards the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination (WBJEE). That is one of the reasons why fewer students crack IITJEE from the state, said Tarun Naskar, a professor in the engineering faculty at Jadavpur University.         
	The other reason, say experts, is lack of awareness about the exam among students and schools. Also, coaching facilities are better in other zones, because of which a huge number of aspirants migrate out of the eastern states.        
	Most of the students from the districts who do well in HS do not even attempt IITJEE. They say they are not cut out for it. But that is not true. The schools should be more encouraging, said the official of the training institute.         
	The IITs will conduct counselling for students to choose their institute and preferred course online for the first time this year. The counselling will begin on Thursday.

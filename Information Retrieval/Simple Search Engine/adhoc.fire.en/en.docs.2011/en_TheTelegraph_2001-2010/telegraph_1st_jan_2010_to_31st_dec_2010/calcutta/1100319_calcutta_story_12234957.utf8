                      Music and lyrics                    Lots of new music, fresh lyrics and some good times are promised in The Right Stuff, a concert where Bertie Da Silva sings his new compositions. Berties music has grown exponentially over time and his friends have teamed with him every now and again to add dimensions to his music which takes it to internationally acceptable levels. The songs to be presented this evening were composed over the last two months, songs with a different feel, opening up another side of the man. Some of the songs have acquired the quiet mellowness of one coming to terms with life. Others rip nastily at the meaninglessness or the sadness of it all. And then Bertie goes back to his older songs and invites Amyt Dutt to play along with the rest of the band: Willie, Sooman, Suraj and Anindya. Amyt taps into the raw guts of the music, tearing out amazing passages and then pieces of searing and passionate intensity. Presented by Someplace Else and t2.                  Event: Songs by Bertie Da Silva When: Today; 9.30 pm onwards Where: Someplace Else, The Park

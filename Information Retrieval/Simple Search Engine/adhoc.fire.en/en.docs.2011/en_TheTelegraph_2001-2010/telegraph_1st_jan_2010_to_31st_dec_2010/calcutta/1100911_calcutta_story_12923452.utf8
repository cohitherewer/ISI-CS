The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Branded: a standstill state
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Branded: a standstill state

	Kaalo haath bhenge dao, gunriye dao.        
	Such a pity the language of protest has not changed in Bengal in half a century, though the world outside has.        
	When the students screamed at us and hurled abuses during the 52 hours that they held us captive on campus, I wondered where we were, in which period.        
	As an executive council member, I have been gheraoed on over 20 occasions since 1998. But this was striking because never had the reason to crush our black hands been so difficult to comprehend.        
	When we had raised the library fine from 5 paise a day to 50 paise in 2001 or the tuition fee from Rs 20 to Rs 200 a month in 2003, the gheraos had been almost as long or longer, but then there was scope for debate. The role of the government, the role of the institution, the plight of a section of students  the fee hikes could have been debated from various points of view and a debate is always welcome in an academic institution.        
	But what were we to discuss this time? Whether or not to make Jadavpur University more secure?        
	We want to install CCTV cameras so that the students are safer, but they are breeding conspiracy theories  we want to crush the unions, we want to snoop on their activities.        
	If those are the reasons cameras are installed, passengers might refuse to take the Metro and our students might as well stay away from South City Mall.         
	Are these the students we have trained? Then why are their ideas so archaic? Is it a problem with our state? Or is it just a few misled students?         
	I wonder because I have a little student growing up at home. My daughter, who is in Class VI, said Baba, chhuti pele? when I finally returned from the university on Friday evening, more than two days after I had left home. The teardrops in her eyes were more of relief.        
	Her mother stood behind her at the door, silent.         
	I may have even snapped at her when she repeatedly called me to find out if I was all right. There were people older than me, suffering more than I was. There were four ladies too.        
	Computer Sciences Nandini Mukherjee had wanted to attend a seminar in Midnapore and then return to be gheraoed. The students did not let her go.        
	The phone was our only contact with the outside. At the conference hall at Aurobindo Bhavan, there was a scramble for chargers every now and then. There were only a few of them.         
	We put two chairs side by side to make a sleeping arrangement for Wednesday night. There was one sofa and a senior teacher got it by consensus. On Thursday, we got a cloth mat from somewhere.         
	It was too cold if the ACs were on and there were too many mosquitoes if we switched them off. At one stage, it became so unbearable that I pulled down a curtain and wrapped myself in it.        
	But for the non-teaching employees, we would not have had the toothpaste and brush or the medicines that some of us needed. There were many who had a history of high blood pressure and sugar.        
	The university guesthouse supplied our meals, but appetite we had little. The strain of being seated, or uncomfortably reclined, for hours on end had taken its toll.        
	On Thursday morning, when the student representatives came to us, we thought sense may have dawned on them. But they had taken us for granted. They knew Bengal doesnt lack precedent of the authorities buckling under pressure.        
	On Friday, we were not expecting them to let us go because we were determined to sit out the protest.        
	A standoff straight out of the turbulent 60s and 70s. Such a pity our youth are still trapped in the past.        
	Parthapratim Biswas, 
  a teacher of construction engineering at JU, was among those gheraoed by students for 52 hours    
	JU gherao lifted  
	Jadavpur University students freed the 15 executive council members on Friday evening after confining them for almost 52 hours following an assurance that they would have a say in where the security cameras are installed on the campus. The vice-chancellor said cameras would be installed at certain spots even if students objected.

                      Anniversary exposition        When Sri Aurobindo founded his Ashram in November 1926, he   entrusted its full material and spiritual charge to the Mother.   Under her guidance, which continued for nearly 50 years, Sri Au  robindo Ashram grew into a large, many-faceted spiritual communi  ty. The Mother was totally devoted to the work of the Ashram and left   behind her a stunning legacy of wisdom, knowledge and realisation.   However, it is a little known fact that the Mother was also an artist of   the Impressionist school and that her work was exhibited in Paris   along with that of many eminent artists of that period. Founded in   January 1995, Galerie La Mere is named after her and was set up   with a vision to showcase a unique odyssey, where art attempts to   trace its origins while seeking newer and more novel styles, facets   and experiences. La Mere Annual 2010, the ongoing group exhibition   of paintings, also marks the completion of 15 years of the art gallery.   Featuring works by veteran masters as well as promising artists, the   show brings together some of the best creative endeavours of con  temporary times. Participants include Ramananda Bandyopadhyay,   Jogen Chowdhury, Anita Roychowdhury, Shanu Lahiri, Subrata Gan  gopadhyay (a painting by him appears here), B.R. Panesar, Rabin   Mondal, Partha Pratim Deb, Sanatan Dinda, Kishore Chatterjee,   Ashoke Mullick and Subrata Chowdhury.

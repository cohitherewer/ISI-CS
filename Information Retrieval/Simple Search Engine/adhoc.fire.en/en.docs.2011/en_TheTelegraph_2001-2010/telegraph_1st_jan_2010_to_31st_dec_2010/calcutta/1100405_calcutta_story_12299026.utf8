The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | High scores prompt tech varsity review
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      High scores prompt tech varsity review
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The West Bengal University of Technology has decided to review its examination system following a revelation that students of private engineering colleges are scoring higher marks than those in reputable tech institutes.        
	Data collected by the university  the 100-odd private tech colleges in the state are affiliated to it  show that the success rate of its students are better than those studying at premier institutes such as IIT Kharagpur, Jadavpur University and the Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur.        
	The trend has left the university concerned as all engineering institutions across the country follow more or less the same syllabus conforming to the stipulations of the All India Council for Technical Education.        
	Its not that we want more students to fail but I feel we should find out whether there is anything wrong in our evaluation process, vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Sengupta said on Saturday.        
	He was speaking at the inaugural session of a three-day conference on educating engineers at the Sir JC Bose School of Engineering at Mankundu in Hooghly.        
	If there is a flaw in our system we need to fix it immediately so that it is on a par with the system followed by other institutions. Or else, our students will not be able to compete with other engineers in the job market, Sengupta said.        
	Citing figures gathered by his university, the vice-chancellor said as many as 15 per cent students at IIT Kharagpur failed in mechanics every year, the highest number of failures in a subject at the institute.        
	At JU and the Biju Patnaik University of Technology in Orissa, the failure rates in mechanics are 22 and 32 per cent, respectively.        
	In the West Bengal University of Technology, on the other hand, less than eight per cent students fail in mechanics. The trend is similar in mathematics, electronics and physics as well.        
	What does it indicate? Sengupta asked the teachers of private engineering colleges at the conference. I hope you will cooperate with us to maintain our teaching and evaluation standards on a par with the other institutes.        
	The vice-chancellor also announced that the university would made students participation in NSS and NCC a must from the 2010-11 session.        
	The scores in NCC and NSS will be considered during the evaluation of a students overall performance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sen warns of weeks wait for normality
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sen warns of weeks wait for normality

	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said on Sunday that the states power woes would not end before a month. After a high-powered meeting at Writers Buildings on Monday, power minister Nirupam Sen hinted that the torment could last even longer.        
	Power cuts will continue throughout the month of April given the existing condition of the power plants. We expect the power situation to improve in May or June, said Sen after briefing Bhattacharjee about the demand-supply mismatch in the power sector.         
	So, the communist government is clearly depending on the weather gods for a drop in temperature with the onset of the monsoon and the resultant lowering in demand for the power crisis to be resolved.        
	Earlier in the day, Sen held a meeting with Coal India Limited chairman Partha Bhattacharyya, a team of railway officials  led by A.K. Gupta, the chief operations manager of Eastern Railway  and senior officials of the power department to address the issue of coal supply to the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd plants.        
	Last weeks slide in power generation at five WBPDCL plants  from an average of 3,000 MW to around 2,600MW  has been linked to a dip in coal supply, which depends on the co-ordination between Coal India and the railways.         
	All of us agreed on setting up a joint inspection committee for smoother supply of coal and better utilisation of rakes, said Sen.        
	The high unloading time of rakes at the plants and the poor condition of tracks leading to the Sagardighi plant were also discussed. The inspection committee will meet at periodic intervals to review infrastructure arrangements to enable smooth coal supplies, said the power minister.        
	The issue of quality of coal came up during the meeting, but Bhattacharyya pointed out that power plants in other states were achieving around 90 per cent plant load factor with the same quality of coal. The issue is related to the condition of the plants. The new units of WBPDCL have 90 per cent plant load factor while at Bandel and Santaldih, it is much lower, admitted Sen.        
	Apart from sorting out coal supply, the minister said that the government was trying to import power from central power utilities.

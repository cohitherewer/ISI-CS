  - Youth abducted in Howrah, kingpin held after release          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A Sector V techie in his mid-20s was abducted in Howrah last week while he was headed home to Thakurpukur in a taxi and released a day later after his family paid a ransom.        
	The youths father had lodged a police complaint that he now wants to withdraw after being threatened by the abductors.        
	Mohammad Raju, wanted for nine murders and abductions besides narcotics and arms cases, was arrested in Ashoknagar in North 24-Parganas for the kidnap after the techie returned home. The three men Raju named as his accomplices are absconding.        
	According to police sources, the youth, a systems engineer in a multinational telecommunications company, and his friend took a shared taxi from Sector V to Howrah around 9pm on January 20. He was abducted by the gang while returning home from Howrah in another taxi.        
	The first ransom call was made within minutes of the abduction. The gang demanded Rs 10 lakh but when the youths father said the family did not have that kind of money, the amount was scaled down to Rs 5 lakh and then Rs 1.5 lakh over the course of several phone calls on January 21, the sources added.        
	North 24-Parganas police superintendent Rahul Srivastava said: On January 21 morning, the engineers father tried to lodge a complaint with Thakurpukur police station and was sent to Bidhannagar (East) police station, where a general diary was registered. The ransom calls were traced to the engineers cellphone. The caller changed the place where he wanted the money to be handed over several times.        
	The gang released the techie early on January 22, said sources, after receiving the ransom. Cops, who suspected Raju to be involved in the abduction, picked him up within hours. He has been remanded him in police custody in connection with a narcotics case.        
	During interrogation, Raju allegedly confessed to the abduction and named his accomplices.         
	On January 22, the techies father went to Bidhannagar (East) police station and requested officers to withdraw the case, as his son was safe. The youths colleagues said the family had been threatened with dire consequences if they did not withdraw the case.        
	The youth was in office on Wednesday. He and his family members refused to speak about the incident.        
	Although the engineer was abducted in Howrah, we have started the case. But his relatives are not cooperating, which is hampering our probe, said Srivastava.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Tuesday refused anticipatory bail to Ramesh Bhattacharjee, who had entered La Martiniere for Boys on June 23 allegedly pretending to be a representative of the HRD ministry.         
	Bhattacharjee, accompanied by Anthony Arun Biswas and Dilip Dutta, had asked the school authorities for a report on the death of Class VIII student Rouvanjit Rawla.        
	A ministry official later lodged a police complaint against the trio.

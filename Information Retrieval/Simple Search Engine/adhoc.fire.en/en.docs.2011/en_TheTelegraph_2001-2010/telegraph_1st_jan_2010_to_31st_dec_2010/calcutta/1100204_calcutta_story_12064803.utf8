                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The City Diary
                An armed gang snatched the cellphone of a 54-year-old man and shot at him near Kamalgazi, on the southern city fringes, late on Tuesday. Baren Bhowmik, admitted to a Bypass hospital, was returning home when three youths on a motorcycle snatched his cellphone. When Bhowmik protested, one of them shot at his right leg.     A Barasat court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Goffar Mollah, an accused in the Vedic Village flare-up case. However, the bail plea of another accused, Hasanur Jawed, was granted. The government has removed Ratan Aich from the post of public prosecutor in the case. It was during Aichs tenure that Khude Alam, another accused in the case, was granted bail. The police would soon move the high court seeking cancellation of Khudes bail.    Dipankar Banerjee, who identified himself as a human rights activist, was arrested on Wednesday in connection with a placement fraud case. Sreejit Das, the owner of a placement firm who had been arrested earlier, told police that Banerjee was the mastermind.    The Petroleum Dealers Association met home secretary Ardhendu Sen on Wednesday and sought a probe into the recent dacoities at petrol pumps.    In the report Climber falls to death, published in Metro on February 3, a comment by Amitava Sens neighbour was wrongly attributed to climber Parthasarathi Dutta. The error is regretted.

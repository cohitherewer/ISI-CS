The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The potholes on the way to our tech dream
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The potholes on the way to our tech dream
          [+uc('Indias most famous IT company has promised to start construction of its Calcutta campus within six months or probably before. But only if the necessary infrastructure is in place.   Hours after Infosys CEO   S. Gopalakrishnan spelt out the rider on Monday, minister Gautam Deb, the man behind land acquisition for New Town, said the infrastructure can be put   in place in two months.   Metro prepares a   ground report from an apparent wasteland that   the Bengal government wants to convert into a tech hub to figure out what the necessary infrastructure could mean, the opposition   it may face and the realistic time-frame for work to begin')+]                          The road now and the plot where the IT hub is supposed to come up. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                                                            
	Infosys needs: A wide road up to its 50-acre plot from the main arterial road. Besides connectivity, the road is essential for any heavy construction.         
	Problem: The road to the IT hub  where Infosys and Wipro are to set up shop  was supposed to be a six-lane expressway. It is now four-lane till the 100-acre Uniworld housing project and two-lane up to the Wipro plot 2km beyond.         
	There is no road at all leading to the Infosys plot.        
	Hidco claim: We will ensure all the infrastructure for the Infosys premises, said an official.        
	Trinamul stand: Supporters of the party have so far prevented Deb-led Hidco from taking possession of the land on which the road has to be laid. Many of those who owned the land have not accepted their compensation. They will resist any construction, said Asok Naskar, the chief of the Patharghata gram panchayat.         
	Time frame: Hidco officials claim the work on the road will start within a fortnight. But none of the officials can say when they expect to finish the job.         
	Contractors who have worked at New Town earlier say a six-lane road till the Infosys plot will take over six months to build even without any land dispute.               
	Infosys needs: Uninterrupted power         
	Problem: Landowners in Chhapna mouza under Patharghata panchayat have refused to let Hidco install the high-tension poles essential to transmit power to Action Areas II and III.         
	Hidco is said to have made 16 attempts to install the towers but in vain.         
	Hidco claim: We are working 24x7. We will be able to provide the power required for Infosys, said a senior official.        
	Trinamul stand: The landowners are adamant. We have tried to convince them but failed. They want more money, said panchayat pradhan Naskar.        
	Time frame: The impasse is almost two years old now. With Mamata Banerjee threatening a Singur-style agitation in Rajarhat, it is anybodys guess how much longer it will continue.         
	A Hidco official said: Installing the poles will require a big crackdown by the police and the district administration. The government will not take that risk months before the elections.                
	Infosys needs: Running water and sewer lines         
	Problem: Thirty households at Baliguri village, which own about 20 acres (1,200 cottahs), have prevented work over the past year. The families, from whom the land was acquired at Rs 13,500 a cottah in 2003, are now demanding Rs 3 lakh a cottah.         
	Hidco claim: The IT sector is a priority. Hidco will do everything within its limits, said the official.         
	Trinamul stand: For two years we have resisted Hidco whenever it has tried to take possession of our land. They cannot take land for a few thousand rupees from poor farmers and sell it for crores. We wont allow them to strike even a single nail into the land unless the poor get what they are demanding, said Trinamuls Naskar.         
	Time frame: Hidco has failed to start work in seven years. Pipes and construction material are lying in a heap in the area for over a year now.         
	Six months? Well...                    TEXT: ZEESHAN JAWED

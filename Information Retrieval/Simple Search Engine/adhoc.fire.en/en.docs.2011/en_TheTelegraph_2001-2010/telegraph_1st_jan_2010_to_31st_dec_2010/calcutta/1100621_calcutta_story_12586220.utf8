                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fatal fall of patient
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Rushma Khatik, a 21-year-old Howrah resident, allegedly jumped off a fourth-floor window of Marwari Relief Society Hospital in Chitpur, where she was admitted with cold and fever on Thursday, early on Sunday.        
	The hospital authorities had alerted Rushmas family members and police at dawn after failing to trace her. The body was found on the terrace of an adjacent temple. Firemen brought her down.         
	Family members alleged that Rushma was thrown out of the window after she died because of medical neglect. Around 10pm on Saturday, she spoke about returning home. Why will she kill herself a few hours later? asked Ram Babu Mali, a relative.        
	The hospital authorities declined comment. A hospital source said none of the four nurses on night duty in the fourth-floor ward where Rushma was admitted saw her get up. A window facing the temple terrace was open. She was mentally disturbed from the time she was admitted to the hospital, added the source.        
	Padma Adhikary, a 55-year-old patient in a bed adjacent to Rushmas, said: She used to shout that her father, mother and brother had died and she too would die soon. Rushmas parents and brother are alive.        
	Residents blocked Rabindra Sarani from 9am till noon claiming that it was the fourth suicide at the hospital in a year and the authorities were to blame for them.

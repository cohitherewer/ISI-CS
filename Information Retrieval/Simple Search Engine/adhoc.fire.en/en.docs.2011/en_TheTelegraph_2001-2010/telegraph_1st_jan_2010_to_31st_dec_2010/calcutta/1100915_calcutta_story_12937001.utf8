The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Con caper from car to chopper
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Con caper from car to chopper
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The stamped acknowledgement of a letter to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees office was one of the calling cards of a Calcutta conman who played catch-me-if-you-can with the cops after allegedly defrauding everyone from his employer to the Sikkim government of Rs 30 crore.        
	Police have pieced together a long list of frauds committed by New Alipore resident Rajesh Agarwal, a.k.a. Rajesh Jhunjhunwala, since he was arrested at Rangpo on the Sikkim-Bengal border on August 9 while fleeing that state disguised as a labourer.        
	Rajesh, in his 40s, had allegedly posed as a tea planter and floated an unregistered company called Jhunjhunwala and Sons to bag a contract to run a state-owned amusement park in Gangtok that was inaugurated by President Pratibha Patil in April.        
	According to sleuths, the bounced cheque for Rs 1.7 crore that Rajesh had issued to the Sikkim government was just the tip of his iceberg of fraud.        
	Ramesh Kumar Bajoria, a city businessman who had employed Rajesh as a manager, was the first to file a police complaint against him in December 2008. The complaint with Beniapukur police station mentioned how Rajesh masqueraded as a tea planter who had fallen on bad times and requested Bajoria for a job. Once he was appointed, he started pilfering lakhs from his employers mineral water company, said a senior officer of the crime branch.         
	Rajesh, who the police suspect changed his surname to Jhunjhunwala in 2006 through a court affidavit to escape detection, allegedly befriended Bajorias business acquaintances even as he set about forging documents and misappropriating funds.        
	The police have found out that he used forged papers to prove that he was the co-owner of Sonali tea estate in Jalpaiguri district with a regional office at 209 AJC Bose Road, which actually houses the offices of Bajoria and his car dealer friend Anil Dewan. Fortunately for the bank, he fled the city just when the loan was about to be sanctioned, an investigator said.        
	By then, Rajesh had duped Dewan into selling him two used sedans  a Hyundai Sonata and a Honda Accord  for a combined price of Rs 10.5 lakh. The cheque bounced, prompting Dewan to file a complaint in early 2009.         
	Rajesh later sold one of the cars to a Lucknow-based acquaintance of Bajoria for Rs 2.5 lakh. He sold the other car to a Siliguri resident. Both vehicles have been recovered.        
	Rajesh returned to the city after a hiatus earlier this year and got cracking, this time as an aviation entrepreneur eyeing a helicopter service in north Bengal and Sikkim. On March 3, he sent an expression of interest to the chief ministers office for operating a helicopter service from Bagdogra to Darjeeling, Cooch Behar and Sikkim. The official stamped acknowledgement  a routine practice at Writers Buildings  became Rajeshs tool for his next trick.        
	On April 9, he sent two women masquerading as executives of his company to the Senco jewellery showroom at Entally to purchase 50 gold coins. The women told the staff that their boss would pay for the gold later and that they could verify his credentials by visiting his city office. A couple of Senco representatives did meet Rajesh and came back convinced that he was a big client, said an officer.         
	The two women visited the showroom again the next day to collect 50 more coins. On April 19, Rajesh issued a cheque to Senco for Rs 13.7 lakh, which bounced.         
	The conman who has confessed to thinking he could do no wrong is now staring at a long jail term.

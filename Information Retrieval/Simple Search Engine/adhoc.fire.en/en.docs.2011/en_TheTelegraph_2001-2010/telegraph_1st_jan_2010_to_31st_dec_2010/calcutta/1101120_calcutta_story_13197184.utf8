The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Singer robbed on train to Puri
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Singer robbed on train to Puri
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Singer Haimanti Shukla and her sister were allegedly robbed in an AC 2-tier compartment of the Puri-bound Sri Jagannath Express in Orissa early on Friday.        
	Shukla lodged a complaint with the Puri Government Railway Police, stating that a cellphone, cash and ornaments, together worth Rs 20,000, were stolen from her bag while she and the other passengers in the coach were asleep.         
	I woke up around 3.15am, hearing the shouts of some co-passengers, who said they had been robbed of their valuables. I found my bag near the washroom. The cellphone, money and the ornaments inside were missing, said Shukla.        
	A railway official, however, said Shukla was the only passenger in the coach who had lodged a complaint.        
	The singer also claimed that there were no guards on the train, a charge the officials denied.

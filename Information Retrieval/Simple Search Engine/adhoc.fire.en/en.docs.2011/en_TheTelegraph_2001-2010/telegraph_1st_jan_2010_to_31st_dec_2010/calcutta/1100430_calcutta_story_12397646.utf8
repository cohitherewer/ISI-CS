The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Big fight for small car pie
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Big fight for small car pie

	The small car market in the city is on a steep growth path, expanding 35 per cent in the first quarter of 2010 compared with 8 per cent in the same period last year.        
	Fuelling this growth is a slew of new and refurbished models from a number of auto majors, including Volkswagen, Ford, Chevrolet and market leader Maruti. With steady increase in the number of first-time car buyers from 24 per cent last year to 32 per cent this year, according to the JD Power statistics, the market is set to expand even more.        
	One noticeable change is how two-wheeler owners are entering the A2 segment directly. First-time buyers are opting for the Rs 3 lakh-plus category instead of sub-compact cars, said S.N. Burman of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, who was in the city to launch the refurbished WagonR.        
	To cater to this market, the company has spent Rs 300 crore to give its best selling car after Alto, WagonR, a facelift. The spruced-up WagonR, with new chassis and interiors is priced at a competitive Rs 3.29 lakh (base model).         
	Other players like Chevrolet and Ford are also pricing their models aggressively. The base model of Beat is available at Rs 3.34 lakh and Figo at Rs 3.49 lakh (both ex-showroom, Calcutta). The base model of Polo from premium marque Volkswagen sells at Rs 4.42 lakh.        
	And there is more in the pipeline with Maruti set to unveil another hatch in June followed by the debut of Toyota Etios late in the year.        
	Our new hatch is going to create a new segment in A2 altogether, said a Maruti spokesperson. The consumer will thus have 24 models to choose from, ranging from the Alto to the premium Jazz and Fabia.        
	Gagandeep Singh of General Motors said: Calcutta is not just a small car market but a price sensitive one as well. With the Beat we have a demand for 950 cars per month but right now we have an allocation of 480 cars. So there is a waiting period of 45 to 60 days.        
	Figo, Fords trump card in India, is expected to turn the companys fortunes in the east. Currently, the east contributes five per cent to Fords national sales figures.        
	With Figo, I would expect that to rise to about 8 to 10 per cent, said Michael Boneham, the company president.        
	The Polo, which was launched nationally, in February, is seeing a healthy advance booking.         
	Cost of ownership often determines the Calcutta customers choice.        
	I would like my car to be frugal in terms of fuel consumption and maintenance. Its no use buying a big brand if cost of spares is going to be phenomenal. Desi brands like Maruti score in this regard, said Tuhin Ganguly of Salt Lake.        
	Perhaps taking a cue from such customer sentiments, Ford and Chevrolet are not only working on their dealership and workshop penetration and localising their components but also trying to reduce cost of maintenance.        
	While General Motors is luring customers with its Chevy promise of 3 year warranty or 100,000km, Ford has lowered cost of ownership in terms of service intervals, cost of periodic maintenance, cost of repairing damaged parts by about 7 to 17 per cent from the prevailing competition rates.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC truck rams into three cars
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CMC truck rams into three cars
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Calcutta Municipal Corporation garbage truck lost control after suffering a flat tyre and jumped over the divider before ramming into three cars in the other lane of the Park Circus-Bypass connector on Thursday afternoon.        
	The axle of the Tata 407, which was on its way to Dhapa to dump garbage, broke under the impact of the collision with the divider. The driver fled after the mishap.        
	No one was injured but the accident could have been fatal had the truck overturned and crushed any car, said an officer of the Parama Investigation Centre.        
	A crane towed away the truck and the damaged cars. Traffic at the busy Bypass rotary was disrupted for around 30 minutes.        
	Among the cars damaged was a Honda Accord of Surendra Kunche. We were proceeding towards Park Circus down the connector and were in front of Milon Mela when the truck suddenly mounted the divider and hit a taxi to the right of us. It then rammed into our car and a Tata Sumo, recalled Kunche.        
	None of the owners of the damaged cars has lodged a police complaint.

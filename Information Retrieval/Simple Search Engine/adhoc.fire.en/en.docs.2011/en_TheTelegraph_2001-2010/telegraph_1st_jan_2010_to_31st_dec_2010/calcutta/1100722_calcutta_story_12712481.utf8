The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro, auto escape from clogged roads
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro, auto escape from clogged roads

	Anil always takes a taxi to a job interview. In Calcutta on Wednesday, the Siliguri resident did not need long to realise that taxis were best avoided if he wanted to reach his prospective employers office in Sector V on time.        
	The youth headed straight for Park Street Metro station, a stones throw from his hotel. I am banking on Metro and autorickshaws to get me to the interview on time, said a worried Anil.        
	He was not alone. Commuters who dont use Metro went underground in thousands as the martyrs day rally clogged most roads in the city.        
	At 12.15pm, the queues for tickets at Sovabazar-Sutanati station reached almost the stairs. All four counters were open. On any given Wednesday only two are open.        
	The passenger count today is more than on a normal day, said an employee at the counter. By six in the evening, Metro Railway had ferried 4.5 lakh passengers against 3.2 lakh on an average day.         
	The trains were operated at six-minute intervals. However, in the morning there was some delay as the doors of the coaches could not be closed because of the crowd, said a Metro official.        
	At most stations, the gates to the platforms were kept open to allow easy movement, with officials keeping a tab on ticketless travellers.        
	I waited for a bus on Chittaranjan Avenue for a long time, before taking Metro. My son had an exam today and I have come to take him home. Metro seemed more far more useful than a bus today, said Jharna Mukherjee, a homemaker.        
	Megha Singh, a marketing professional from Mumbai who is visiting the city, said: I had gone to meet friends near Chandni Chowk. There was no other transport option except Metro.        
	She walked from Chandni Chowk to Park Street to catch a Metro. I couldnt enter Chandni Chowk station. The queue for tickets stretched to the streets, she said. I have never seen Mumbai so crippled because of a political rally, she added.        
	Many Trinamul supporters also took Metro to reach the rally venue sooner, flags or badges setting them apart. I heard a Metro official scolding a supporter because of the extra work that the rally had inflicted upon the officials, said one commuter.        
	At Chandni Chowk and Esplanade, where the number of passengers was the highest, rail police employees were seen managing the crowd.        
	Around 1.30pm, a cop was seen removing a single slipper from near the rails, after a train left the platform. A man managed to squeeze in but one of his slippers fell off, laughed the cop.        
	The coaches got less crowded got lighter beyond Kalighat on the Kavi Nazrul stretch and beyond Girish Park on the Dum Dum stretch.

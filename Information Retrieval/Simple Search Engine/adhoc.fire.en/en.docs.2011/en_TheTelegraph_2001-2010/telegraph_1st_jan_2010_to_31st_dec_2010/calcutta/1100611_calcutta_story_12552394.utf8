                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fatal fall for techie

	A 26-year-old software engineer from Hyderabad died after falling off the balcony of his 11th-floor flat at Koch Pukur, in the Calcutta Leather Complex area, on Thursday evening.        
	Sources in the investigation team said circumstantial evidence suggested that Raj Shekhar had committed suicide but sleuths have not ruled out the possibility of murder either.        
	We have sent the body for post mortem. A case of unnatural death has been started. The exact cause of death will be known after we get the post mortem report, said Ranendra Nath Banerjee, the additional superintendent of police (rural), South 24-Parganas.        
	He, however, added that no suicide note was found in the three-room apartment where Raj Shekhar used to stay with five of his colleagues.        
	The cops have learnt that the youth, who came to Calcutta around eight months ago from Hyderabad, was working as a software developer with a global IT major, which has its office in Rajarhat.        
	His room-mates have told us that he did not go to office today as he was feeling unwell, said an officer.        
	The guard of the building where the techie stayed told the cops that he had rushed to the lawn after hearing a loud thud around 5.20pm.         
	The guard found the youth was lying with his face down. He was rushed to a local hospital where he was declared dead on arrival, said an officer.        
	One of Raj Sekhars friends said on condition of anonymity that the engineer had been depressed since returning from a vacation recently. Raj Sekhar apparently did not tell his friends where he had spent his vacation.

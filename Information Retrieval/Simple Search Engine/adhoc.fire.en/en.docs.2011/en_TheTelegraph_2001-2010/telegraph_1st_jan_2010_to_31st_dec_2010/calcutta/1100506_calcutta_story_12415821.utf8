The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Burqa grounds a Boeing
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Burqa grounds a Boeing
  - Cabin crew mistake Russian homemaker for hidden man          SANJAY MANDAL AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                          Irbaieva Elieanora at the airport before leaving for Dhaka on Wednesday evening                                        
	A woman in a burqa eating without lifting her veil was added to the list of highly suspicious activities aboard an aircraft when a Calcutta-bound flight from Delhi made a priority landing on Wednesday, ringed by gun-toting commandos.        
	The woman who grounded SpiceJets Delhi-Calcutta flight SG-208 in this high-alert scenario turned out to be a Russian homemaker accompanying her carpet-trader husband on a business trip to Dhaka via Delhi and Calcutta.        
	Co-passengers said cabin crew took plus-size Irbaieva Elieanora, 32, to be a man hiding under a burqa after she failed to respond to a query in English  a language she has little knowledge of  on why she was eating without lifting her veil. Husband Aslan Bekov Artur, seated on the other side of the aisle, couldnt clear the confusion either despite his smattering of English and some sign language.        
	Air traffic control received an SOS from the flight deck around 10.45am, seeking priority-landing status and special ground security because of highly suspicious activity on board. The aircraft was then flying over Gaya in Bihar. We immediately contacted the CISF and all security arrangements were made, said an ATC official.        
	As soon as SG-208 touched down at 11.23am, commandos closed in on the aircraft and officials radioed the pilot to taxi the plane to the isolation bay, where Irbaieva and Aslan were escorted out by CISF personnel for interrogation. The Boeing 737 then returned to the parking bay for the other passengers to disembark.        
	A search of the Russian couples belongings revealed nothing suspicious and their papers, including passports and visas, were found to be in order.        
	A passenger seated near the couple, who had occupied seats 25A and 25F, said he did not notice the duo doing anything that could have triggered a security scare.         
	City-based trader Brijesh Agarwal, who was on the flight, said he heard someone uttering the word hijack and panicked. Thank god, it was just a rumour. The crew should have handled this situation better, he added.        
	SpiceJet officials downplayed the incident, saying miscommunication and the state of high alert in the aviation sector contributed to the confusion.        
	All cabin crew are under instructions from the Bureau of Civil Aviation to keep an eye on any kind of abnormal activity. The woman wasnt responding to questions and kept her face hidden throughout, which triggered the security scare, an airline official said.        
	The Russian couple finally emerged from the airport managers room at 2.30pm, relieved that the drama had ended without them missing their evening flight to Dhaka. Airport officials said Irbaieva and Aslan left for Bangladesh by an Air India Express flight at 6pm.        
	A CISF official quoted Aslan, 37, as saying that he had visited India seven times earlier but had never faced any problem despite language being a hurdle. He also said that his wife was from an orthodox Russian Muslim family where women were not allowed to show any skin in public.        
	The superintendent of police of North 24 Parganas, Rahul Srivastava, said the incident was recorded at the Airport police station but not investigated because no complaint was lodged.

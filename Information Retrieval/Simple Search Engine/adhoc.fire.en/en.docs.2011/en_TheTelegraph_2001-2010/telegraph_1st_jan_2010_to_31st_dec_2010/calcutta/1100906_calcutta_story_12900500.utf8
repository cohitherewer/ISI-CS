	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee flagged off 17 new pairs of suburban trains, which would ply in the Howrah and Sealdah sections of Eastern Railway, at Howrah station on Sunday.         
	The trains include the Howrah-Seoraphuli, Howrah-Baruipara, Howrah-Serampore, Howrah-Bandel and the Bandel-Memari locals in the Howrah division and the Sealdah-Barrackpore, Sealdah-Naihati, Sealdah-Habra, Sealdah-Dankuni, Sealdah-Krishnagar, Naihati-Ranaghat and the Canning-Sonarpur locals in the Sealdah division.        
	After flagging off the trains, Mamata announced that the railways would offer a job to anyone who provides information about an attempt to disrupt trains. She said she apprehended attempts to sabotage train services before Puja. About the large number of vacancies in the railways, she said: The process for recruiting 24,000 railway personnel is underway.

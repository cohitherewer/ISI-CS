          RITWIKA MITRA                          COLOURS OF LIFE: Students of La Martiniere for Girls at the Art Mela. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	For a Class XII student being asked to put aside her books and paint instead seemed strange at first. But once Riddhika Majumdar sat with her friends on their school ground and started drawing, she felt relaxed and happy. Class XII science means a lot of hard work! Its blissful to stop studying for a while and indulge in something creative. I have always loved painting! she said.        
	Riddhika was not the only one enjoying her time under the sun. Students of La Martiniere for Girls, right from KG to Class XII, gave vent to their creativity at the Open Air Art Mela held on campus last month. The event was held as part of the schools 175th anniversary celebrations.        
	Through the paintings, we would like to know whats going on in a childs mind. So, they were asked to draw whatever they liked, said Prasun Roy, the art teacher of the school.         
	Another objective of the event was to bring students out of the confines of the classrooms. Its so much fun! Drawing with friends reminded me of my childhood, gushed Anupriya Chakraborty, another Class XII student.        
	From the conventional landscapes and sketches to the unconventional drawing of geometric patterns, painting the English alphabet or just spraying colours on paper, the art mela saw students expressing their mind in different ways. The best pictures will be published in the school magazine. Some will be displayed on campus.         
	The finest works usually come from students who do not have a formal training in painting, said the principal, Hilda Peacock.         
	To me, it is a chance to show how much I love life. I am spraying the colours of life, added Sanjana Mimani, a Class X student.

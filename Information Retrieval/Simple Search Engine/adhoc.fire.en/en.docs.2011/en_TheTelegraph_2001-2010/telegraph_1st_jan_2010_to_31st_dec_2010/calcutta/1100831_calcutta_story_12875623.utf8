The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | BJP pads up for street politics
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      BJP pads up for street politics
          OUR BUREAU                               brick by brick                  stick by stick                    D FOR DESTRUCTION: BJP activists attack Victoria House on Monday afternoon. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya		    
	To be seen, block a thoroughfare. To be heard, hurl some bricks and smash some glass. To be felt, threaten to return for more.        
	The marginalised BJP in town played textbook street politics from Bengals pages of protest on Monday when a few hundred supporters blocked a key crossroads for around an hour and went on the rampage smashing windowpanes of a heritage building.        
	Protest against power tariff hike was cited as the official reason behind BJPs demonstration for which the party did not even take the necessary permission from the police headquarters.         
	The vandalism of the activists and the voices of their leaders, however, made their main objective clear: an attempt to make the partys presence felt in Bengal politics.        
	CR Avenue was choked as BJP supporters demonstrated on the road and the ripple effect of the blockade was felt throughout the central business district.        
	What do the parties gain by inconveniencing people and destroying public or private property? asked the owner of a shop on Bentinck Street as the snap protest outside Victoria House forced traders to down shutters.        
	The history of politics in Bengal is ripe with answers to this question. The fortune of the Left parties soared in Bengal as they successfully turned Calcutta into a city of rallies.        
	Though Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister-in-waiting, has asked her supporters to steer clear of disruptive politics now, Trinamuls track record is dominated by D for Disruption.        
	Former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray, who was at the helm at Writers between 1972 and 1977, admitted that Bengal has a history of disruptive politics and all parties must share the blame.        
	I still remember that I arrested more Congressmen than CPM activists for being involved in hooliganism, said Ray.        
	On August 20, BJP supporters damaged parts of Bidyut Bhavan and injured one of the security guards while protesting power tariff hike in Salt Lake. Five party activists were arrested.         
	The protests near Victoria House on Monday afternoon once again proved that arrests have failed to be an effective deterrent as the ability to disrupt gets rewarded with more political mileage.        
	The incident was unfortunate and uncalled for. Windows were broken and employees cars were damaged. There could have been more damage had it not been for the ample police presence, said a CESC official.        
	A senior Calcutta police officer told Metro that nine BJP activists were arrested on charges of assaulting policemen and damaging property during the hour-long demonstration, which left five cops injured.         
	But the leaders were unfazed and egged on the activists, most of whom were ferried from Howrah and Hooghly to cause chaos in the heart of the city.        
	What our activists did today was justified. We have every right to protest if the electricity tariff is hiked at regular intervals, said BJP state president Rahul Sinha.        
	He also blamed the policemen for beating up party supporters without any provocation.        
	Some of our party activists had pelted stones in self defence when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees trigger-happy policemen attacked them, alleged Sinha, who took charge of the party after BJP drew a blank in the state in the last Lok Sabha polls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | DNA report likely next week
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      DNA report likely next week
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The results of DNA sequencing of the unidentified victims of the Stephen Court blaze could be available by next week, officials at the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory officials said on Friday.        
	The DNA sequencing is proceeding on a war footing. We are expecting the results by next week, said laboratory director C.N. Bhattacharya. Fifty samples have been collected from 11 bodies and their claimants.        
	The authorities had decided to conduct the DNA test as the 11 bodies were charred beyond recognition and there were more than one claimant for each.        
	Laboratory officials allayed initial fears that the samples collected from the burnt and decaying bodies were not suitable for DNA sequencing.        
	The samples sent by SSKM Hospitals forensic department would help identify the bodies. Tissues have been successfully collected from the charred samples, said an official.         
	Fire probe        
	Officials of the state forensic department said on Friday that they were still in the dark about the cause and origin of the March 23 fire at Stephen Court that killed 43 people.        
	As of now, an electrical short-circuit is believed to be the cause of the blaze but we are not sure about the origin. The samples collected from the two gutted floors are being analysed, said an official.        
	What has baffled police probing the blaze was the location of the lift in Block II when the fire broke out. We spoke to some residents and they said it was stuck between the third and fourth floors. Its strange why the lift got stuck there. Forensic experts are looking into it, said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.        
	The cops had claimed a day after the tragedy that a short-circuit in the lift might have caused the fire. Some residents said the lift had not been maintained for a year, the officer added.        
	There were also reports of sparks from a welders torch igniting the blaze.

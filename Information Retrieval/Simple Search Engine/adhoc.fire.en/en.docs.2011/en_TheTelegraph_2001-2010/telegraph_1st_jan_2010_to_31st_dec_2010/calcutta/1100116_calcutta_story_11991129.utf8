The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cooler weekend in sight
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cooler weekend in sight
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The mercury is set to dip by a couple of degrees over the weekend after two consecutive days of relatively high minimum temperatures, with the north wind gaining in strength and the moisture content in the atmosphere declining.        
	The humidity level will come down over the next couple of days. The mornings would be foggy but the sky would remain clear for the better part of the day, dragging down the mercury, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Saturdays minimum temperature is likely to be 13 degrees Celsius.        
	The mercury was on the rise since Thursday when the minimum temperature touched 15.9.        
	The upswing was because of the cloud cover caused by excess moisture in the atmosphere, Debnath said.        
	The cloud cover caused a drizzle in several parts of the city on Wednesday evening. An active western disturbance and strong winds from the Bay of Bengal were adding to the moisture content in the air across south Bengal.         
	The moisture trapped the heat closer to the surface and blocked out the cold, dry northwesterlies, resulting in a rise in the temperature.        
	A scientist of the Noida-based National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting said a lower moisture content and a rejuvenated northerly and northwesterly flow would help restore the January chill in Calcutta and its neighbourhood over the next few days.        
	A fresh western disturbance is expected to arrive around the middle of next week, further aiding the cooling effect, he added.

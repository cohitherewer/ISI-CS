The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suicide on Metro tracks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Suicide on Metro tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 33-year-old woman killed herself by jumping in front of a train at Jatin Das Park Metro station on Friday evening, leading to disruption in services for almost an hour. Police said Tanushree Dutta, a resident of the Ultadanga railway quarters, jumped before a Dum Dum-bound rake at 4.06pm and was killed instantly.         
	An officer said Dutta, who worked in a private security firm, had been suffering from depression since her divorce five months ago. Duttas parents said on Friday she had left home saying she was going to work. But she did not turn up at her office, said an officer.        
	Metro services were normalised around 5pm. Till 5pm, we could operate trains only between Kavi Nazrul and Tollygunge in the south and between Dum Dum and Maidan in the north, said a Metro official.        
	This was the first suicide on the Metro tracks this year; last year Metro had recorded 10 deaths.         
	 Blockade: Around 500 residents blocked Rabindra Sarani at 1.15pm on Friday over water shortage in the area. At 3.35pm, around 500 supporters of the West Bengal Primary Teachers Association blocked RR Avenue over the PTTI issue.         
	 Correction: The report HC for simple IIT cut-off, January 7, mentioned the petitioners chemistry score as 42 instead of 52. The error is regretted.

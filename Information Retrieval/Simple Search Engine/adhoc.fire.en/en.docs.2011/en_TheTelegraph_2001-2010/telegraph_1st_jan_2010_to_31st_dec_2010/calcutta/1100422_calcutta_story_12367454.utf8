                      Digitised creativity                    By far the most exciting development in the realm of art in recent times, digital art is any art that uses the methods of mass production or digital media. The impact of digital technology has transformed traditional activities such as painting, drawing and sculpture. Post Production, the ongoing show of works by Sayak Mitra, Sunil Chandra Pal and Sujit Karmakar, bears witness to the way digital art has influenced mainstream artistic practice. The works on show find the three young artists using conventional images in an urban context, applying techniques of digital art to emphasise their message.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 18hr trip in eight days
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      18hr trip in eight days
          SANJAY MANDAL                          HOME AT LAST: Medical researcher Ambarish Dutta, who arrived minus his baggage, is happy to be back with his son				                                 
	Snow in Europe and smog in Delhi through the holiday week stretched a US-based professors journey home from 18 hours to eight days while a researcher stranded in the UK finally arrived on Wednesday, only to find his registered baggage missing.        
	If geography professor Sujoy Chakraborty and his family braved a flight cancellation, a long wait for rebooking, several airport delays and a fog-forced flight diversion before reaching their destination, medical researcher Ambarish Duttas ordeal continued even after landing in the city.        
	After all the trouble I have been through in the past week, I was desperate to be back in my hometown and meet my wife and little son. But Air India has spoiled the trip for me by misplacing a bag that contains gifts for my family, Ambarish, 40, told Metro on Wednesday evening.        
	Not only that, Ambarish was allegedly made to queue up for an hour at the city airport to lodge a complaint about his missing bag. The officials who received the complaint were unhelpful to say the least. I was so disappointed by their attitude, he said.        
	An Air India spokesman blamed confusion in Terminal 3 of Delhi airport for the airlines failure to put Ambarishs bag  along with the registered baggage of 57 other passengers  on the connecting flight to Calcutta. We are making arrangements for these bags to be brought to the city on various flights, he added.        
	For 50-something Sujoy, his wife and son, the holiday trip to their hometown seemed to go horribly wrong the moment British Airways sent a text message saying that their flight from Philadelphia to Heathrow on December 19 stood cancelled because of heavy snowfall.        
	I was supposed to meet Planning Commission officials in Delhi on December 22, after which we were to come to Calcutta for Christmas. With my plan in jeopardy, I tried to access the airlines website for more information but the page wouldnt open. I then tried calling customer care, only to find the lines jammed, recalled Sujoy.        
	When he contacted his travel agent for a rebooking, Sujoy was told that there was a heavy backlog and he would have to wait. The agent later called to say that he had managed three tickets on a British Airways flight scheduled for December 24 with connecting flights to Delhi the same evening and Calcutta on December 26 morning.        
	After arriving at Heathrow on Christmas Eve, the Chakrabortys waited four hours at the airport before boarding a Delhi-bound flight, little knowing that worse was to come.  
	 ldquo;As luck would have it, our flight (scheduled to land at 1.30am) was diverted to Hyderabad because of heavy fog over the capital, rdquo; Sujoy recounted.  
	On landing at Hyderabad around 4am, the family was taken to a hotel along with the other passengers, where they were told that the crew wouldn rsquo;t be allowed to fly till late on December 26 because of flight-duty time limitations. ldquo;I couldn rsquo;t believe our luck. That meant we would miss our connecting flight to Calcutta from Delhi. Worse, we needed to pay an extra Rs 24,000 to book Delhi-Calcutta tickets for the next day, rdquo; Sujoy said.  
	After finally reaching Delhi around midnight on December 26, the Chakrabortys went to a friend rsquo;s house to rest for a few hours before taking a flight to Calcutta on Monday. ldquo;I have spent 18 years in Philadelphia, which also receives snowfall, but never have I faced such harassment because of bad weather, rdquo; he said.  
	 ldquo;It seemed like a never-ending journey, rdquo; added his wife.   
	Like the Chakrabortys, researcher Ambarish missed spending Xmas with his wife and son in Calcutta because of a snow-induced flight cancellation.   
	 ldquo;I was booked on an Air India flight to Calcutta via Delhi on December 20. After travelling nearly 200 miles to reach London from Exeter (Devon), I waited at Heathrow for 14 hours, only to be told that the flight had been cancelled, rdquo; Ambarish had told Metro over phone.  
	He had then joked about ldquo;making it home at least by the end of the year rdquo;.

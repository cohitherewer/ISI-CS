The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU convocation split for security
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      JU convocation split for security
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Security concerns linked to the Maoist threat have prompted Jadavpur University to break with its tradition of holding its day-long convocation at a stretch on a single spot.        
	The university this year has decided to split the programme  scheduled for December 24  into three parts, to be held at various venues.        
	We need to break the convocation into three parts for a number of reasons. Security is one of them, said registrar Pradip Kumar Ghosh.        
	Sources said the threat posed by the alleged involvement of some of the students in the Maoist movement had prompted the authorities to scrap the old system.        
	Till last year, the convocation used to be held from 11am to 5pm at an open-air theatre on campus, adjacent to the railway tracks.        
	Given the political turmoil, itll be difficult to ensure security for such a huge gathering at the open-air theatre for such a long period, said a teacher. More than 4,000 people are expected to attend the convocation this year.        
	Officials said the inaugural programme, lasting an hour, would be held at the open-air theatre. Governor M.K. Narayanan, also chancellor of the university, will attend only the first session. We need to cut short the chancellors stay because of security reasons, said a source.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HS marks in numbers and words
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HS marks in numbers and words
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The 2010 Higher Secondary examination marksheets will look a little different from previous years. Among other things, marks obtained in each subject will be spelt out in words along with the usual numerical figures.         
	Every year we receive requests from a large number of students for giving their marks in words on the marksheet. We found out that some foreign institutes ask for such a marksheet, said a senior official of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education.         
	The measure also aims at lowering the chances of tampering with the marks on the marksheets. Chances of tampering will be less if the marks are written both in figures and in words, the official said.         
	The full marks and minimum pass marks of each subject will be mentioned in the front of the marksheet and not on the reverse, as was done earlier.

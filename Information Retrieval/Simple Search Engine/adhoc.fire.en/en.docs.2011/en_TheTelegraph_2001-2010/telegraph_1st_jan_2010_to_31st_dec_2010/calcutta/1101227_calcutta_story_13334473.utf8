The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | River water to cut wastage
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      River water to cut wastage
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is planning to resume the supply of unfiltered water in an attempt to check the colossal waste of filtered water that costs the civic coffers Rs 4 lakh daily.        
	Calcuttans are in the habit of using filtered water to wash cars and buildings, and also for other purposes such as gardening. Use of filtered water is rampant in construction, too. For all such chores unfiltered water can be used. So we have taken up a scheme to revive the supply of untreated water, said mayor Sovan Chatterjee.        
	Engineers in the civic water supply department said around 100 million gallons of filtered water  the average daily output of Garden Reach waterworks  are wasted every day. Translating the loss into monetary terms, an engineer said: It costs Rs 4 lakh to produce and supply 100 million gallons of filtered water. And setting up a plant that can produce such a huge amount of filtered water calls for an investment of Rs 500 crore.        
	The supply of untreated water was stopped in most parts of the city in the early 1960s.        
	The authorities will have to spend over Rs 12 crore on revamping the network for supplying unfiltered water, which will include repairing or revamping the pumps and desilting the conduits.        
	Much of the network has not been in use since the supply was stopped. Of the seven pumps at Mullickghat station, with a combined capacity of 80 million gallons a day, only three are in working condition. At Watgunge station, one of the three pumps is in order.

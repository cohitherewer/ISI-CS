	Can any parent vouch that he/she has never felt the urge to slap the child? I would like them to answer keeping in mind that their child needs to grow up to be a responsible citizen who knows right from wrong, and then consider the plight of a teacher who handles 40 such kids with their usual boisterous behaviour.           
	We all believe in our rights and not our duties. We all feel that everyone else  the state, the school and others who have some authority  possess a magic wand to solve our problems.           
	The school, it seems, must be a place with roses minus the thorns. But life is not like that. The faster we learn to cope with adversities, the better prepared we can be to face the obstacles in life.           
	As a father of a six-year-old, I would like my son to be able to decide for himself what is right and wrong and to face adversities at the earliest. I would also like to be his friend and know whats happening in his life. This communication cannot be left to school or teachers alone.           
	A life has been lost. The law I am sure would take its course and resolve the controversy. But the school has thousands of pupils who are still studying there. This controversy affects them so there is an urgent need to prevent the issue from becoming a scandal.           
	Jayjit Ganguly,
  Address not given               Cup craze: Apropos Brazilian beauty in football city..., June 17, even after shooting in the city for Love Aaj Kal, Giselli Monteiro (picture above) has not fully comprehended Calcutta. The city is football crazy. The city remains engrossed in almost anything  from films to politics to sport. One moment it will throng a film shoot, the next moment it will get busy with elections. Then theres T20 and IPL for KKR city. So, when its the football World Cup, how can the city not get involved (picture below) ? Calcutta loves participating in others joys as it hardly gets an opportunity of its own!   
	Amrita Mallik, Salt Lake
                                        
	Apropos She does it with show of hands, June 7, the procedure adopted by Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee (raising hands) to seek consent for top civic posts from new councillors was ridiculous. It was also undemocratic. Mamata should have arranged for a secret ballot for the councillors.           
	I was also astonished at the number of advisers she has packed into advisory committees for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Salt Lake municipality. Such a move is bound to create confusion among the councillors. As the proverb goes  too many cooks spoil the broth. I wonder how far the set-up of the CMC and the Salt Lake municipality is viable and how long they can work efficiently and transparently.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                      
	Apropos Winds of change to cool Writers, June 2, one wonders what purpose would be served by air-conditioning the Mahakaran. It would only increase the consumption of electricity. The babus would snooze in the cool comfort for longer periods, especially during summer. Attendance might go up, but work culture will remain pathetic as usual. Instead of installing air-conditioners, it would be better if the babus were given summer vacation, just like schoolkids.             
	A.S.Mehta,
  New Alipore                     
	It is good that the government has accepted the necessity of providing ACs at Writers. Such facilities should also be extended to district and block-level offices. Hopefully, the ministers have thought this over before giving the nod for Writers.           
	Ranjit Sinha,
  Mohan Garden                               
	Apropos Winter date with Aussie attraction, June 28, it is a wonderful initiative of the Alipore zoo authorities to procure kangaroos. The marsupials will enhance the attraction of the zoo. This initiative is also very timely as the zoo just lost two chimpanzees in a matter of months.             
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park                               
	My heart reaches out to the family of Rouvanjit Rawla (School squirms in boy death glare, June 10). I have studied in a convent school in the Hills in the late Seventies and can confirm that we were subjected to corporal punishment and getting caned was a regular affair. However, in those days there was no agency where one could go and seek help.             
	When I was in Class VIII, my teacher had beaten me black and blue for a flimsy reason. My parents took up the matter with the principal but no steps were taken against the errant teacher. I hope and pray that Rouvanjits family gets justice and the guilty are punished. Otherwise people have to live with the scars or, in some cases, face death.           
	Nisheeth Bijawat,
  Address not given                     
	Since the death of Rouvanjit Rawla, there has been a lot of discussion on corporal punishment. Punishment is needed in schools but not caning or beating. Punishment may be in any form that does not lead to humiliation.           
	In Rouvanjits case, besides the teachers, the parents may also be responsible for driving him to suicide. The parents are claiming regular humiliation of their son by the teachers. Why did they not take action earlier, which could have saved a precious life? Parents tolerate everything if their child is studying in a reputable school. The students are even forced by parents to perform beyond their capabilities. The pressure at school and at home forces some students to resort to desperate acts, including committing suicide.           
	Raj Bagri,
  Ho Chi Minh Sarani                     
	Corporal punishment should be totally abolished. Any type of punishment in the school leaves a scar on the minds of students. I still remember the canning that I had received at St Georges College, Mussoorie. I havent got over it even today. That a school like La Martiniere would resort to corporal punishment was unthinkable. As the school has got a bad name because of the corporal punishment controversy, the bishop should ask the principal to step down.           
	Sanjay Agarwal,
  Shambhu Nath Pandit Street                     
	My two children study at La Martiniere for Boys and I am an ex-student of the school. I have been following closely the tarnishing of the image of my alma mater and the school of my children, who are not enjoying this either. Contrary to the claims of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) that the school is unfit for children, my kids enjoy school and cherish their teachers. It is painful and disturbing to see how discipline in the school (and at home) is being undermined in the name of the fancy corporal punishment in a 175-year-old institution.           
	Thanks to my great school, I have turned out very well in life and I thank all those teachers who guided me and disciplined me when needed. I would like my children to turn out like me and be proud of the school like I am.           
	Surojit Bose,
  Address not given                     
	I am totally against corporal punishment. Some teachers get easily impatient. They must remember that children are naughty by nature. It is the duty of teachers to rectify their mistakes. Teachers who continue with archaic methods of handling disobedient students do more harm than good. Unfortunately, corporal punishment appears to have become an obsession with a section of teachers dedicated to disciplining students. Love and affection can inculcate discipline too.           
	Atif Ayaz,
  Serampore, Hooghly                               
	Apropos How Ray got his Goopy, May 25, I feel that despite possessing enough potential to emerge as a highly successful actor, Tapen Chattopadhyay was rarely exploited by Tollywood directors. It required the master in Satyajit Ray to appreciate the qualities of Chattopadhyay and the latter also reciprocated by portraying Goopy Gyne with elan. Acting in the same frame with the legendary Rabi Ghosh was no mean feat but Chattopadhyay did it with confidence and conviction. Chattopadhyay will remain immortal in the hearts of all true-blue Bengalis as Goopy Gyne.

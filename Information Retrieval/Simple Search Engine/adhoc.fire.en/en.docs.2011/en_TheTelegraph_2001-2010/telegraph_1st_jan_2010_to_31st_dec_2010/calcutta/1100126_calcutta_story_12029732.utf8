                    Tiger territory                                              A strikingly beautiful and regal animal of the wild, the Royal Bengal Tiger is a highly adaptable feline whose main habitat is among the hot, steamy mangrove swamps of the Sunderbans. Unfortunately, the tiger population in its forests have dwindled over the years, with no more than 1,000 tigers remaining at present. Bengal tigers have been hunted heavily by poachers for their fur, and their body parts are sold as medicine in India and abroad. Due to the impact of climate change, the ecology of the Sunderbans also stands under threat; a fact that could prove disastrous to its surrounding urban centres. Thus, besides poaching, tigers are also facing a threat to their survival due to environmental changes, making the need for their protection even more vital and urgent. Conservation efforts are on by various national, international as well local agencies to protect the Bengal Tiger, most notable among them being Project Tiger, a nationwide project to help the preservation and conservation of tigers in the wild. Featuring stunning images by sone of Indias finest nature photographers, The World of the Royal Bengal Tiger, the ongoing photography exposition, attempts to highlight the importance of protecting this amazing species. Hosted by Sanctuary Asia, Bengal Tiger Line and Wildlife Conservation Trust to commemorate the International Year of the Tiger 2010.

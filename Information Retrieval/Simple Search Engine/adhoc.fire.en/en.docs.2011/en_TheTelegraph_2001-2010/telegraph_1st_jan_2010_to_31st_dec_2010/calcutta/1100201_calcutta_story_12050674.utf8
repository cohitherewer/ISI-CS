The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Back-up blot after blackout
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Back-up blot after blackout
          KINSUK BASU                              
	The villain of the night-long blackout at the 34th Calcutta Book Fair was not so much the overloaded transformer that tripped as the team of organisers that knew this might happen and yet didnt have a back-up ready.        
	The West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation (WBTPO), responsible for infrastructure at Milon Mela, had warned the Publishers and Booksellers Guild about the possibility of a power failure because of excessive load but didnt arrange for a back-up because it received no reply, sources said.        
	The guild, on the other hand, was aware of the power requirement rising over that of last year with the addition of stalls but didnt bother checking with WBTPO officials whether the infrastructure was adequate to handle the extra load.         
	A post-mortem on Sunday revealed that the guild had brought a stand-by transformer to the fairground but didnt install it.        
	We have had an almost 25 per cent increase in the number of stalls over last year, and each participating bookseller or publisher has asked for more power this time. The food court has added to the load. Its difficult to arrive at the exact requirement but the load factor varies from day to day, the vice-president of the cash-rich guild, Suprakash Basu, told Metro on Sunday.         
	So why wasnt a back-up ready? We hope things will be fine from now on, was all that Basu would say.        
	Post-mortem over, the blame game continued.        
	The WBTPO claims it had informed us about the possibility of a power trip and mentioned the need to arrange for diesel generators. Irrespective of whether the guild gave the green signal, why didnt they ensure that the back-up was ready? asked a senior member of the guild who is no longer a part of the executive panel.        
	Sources said the guild and the WBTPO were equally responsible for the communication gaps that led to the blackout at an event close to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees heart and visited by thousands of book lovers every day.        
	The arrangements made by the WBTPO were basic at best. A new 1,500 KVA transformer was installed but it generated 1,250 KVA, which was inadequate, said an official.         
	Power was restored around 6am on Sunday, after two meetings to find a permanent solution. The idle transformer was installed and generators brought in for the remaining days of the fair.        
	State industry minister Nirupam Sen also instituted a 72-hour probe.        
	Prof Bipan Chandra, the chairman of the National Book Trust that organises the World Book Fair in New Delhi, said Pragati Maidan had never faced any such problem.        
	The World Book Fair is the largest of its kind in the country and we maintain very clear communication with the India Trade Promotion Organisation, which looks after the infrastructure, he added.

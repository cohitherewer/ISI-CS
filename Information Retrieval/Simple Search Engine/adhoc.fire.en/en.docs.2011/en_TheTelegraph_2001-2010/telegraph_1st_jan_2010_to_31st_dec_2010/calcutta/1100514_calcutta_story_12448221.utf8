                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lifestyle lure as murder motive   Murder tangle 
  - Cops dig up dual life of Liluah woman accused of killing relative          PRONAB MONDAL AND SUBHAJOY ROY                                      
	Murder accused Manisha Patel was just another Liluah homemaker bringing up a child and caring for her family until frustration over her lifestyle got the better of her, say investigators.        
	Her husband Tushar Patel has told us that his wife longed for luxuries they couldnt afford. They lived in the same house but were not on talking terms lately, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station, a day after 39-year-old Manisha was arrested in Bihar for the murder of south Calcutta homemaker Chetna Sanghvi.        
	But Manishas in-laws, who share the couples two-room flat on the third floor of Gujarat Mansion at Rabindra Sarani in Liluah, said they were unaware of this allegedly darker side of her personality.        
	To us, she was our three-and-a-half-year-old grandsons mother. There was nothing unusual in her behaviour, rued father-in-law Vinod Patel.        
	Manisha, a cousin of the victims husband, wouldnt even have been on the investigators radar had she not left behind her bag in the Sanghvis first-floor flat after the crime.                                      
	She and her two accomplices were returning to Howrah when Manisha realised that she had forgotten to pick up her bag. Going back to get it would have been futile because they had slammed the door shut from outside and didnt have a key to the automatic lock, an officer said.        
	The bag contained a receipt in Manishas name for her life insurance premium along with her cellphone. Her call records led them to identify 22-year-old Rajib Das, who works in a jewellery shop at Bagri Market in Burrabazar, as one of her accomplices. Both were traced to Rajibs ancestral home in Vaishali district of Bihar on Wednesday. The third accused, Raju, is absconding.        
	The police have learnt that Manisha had approached the Sanghvis for money earlier to set up a catering business, only to be rebuffed. That she went to the Bhowanipore flat again on Monday with two accomplices indicates that the murder might not have been a spur-of-the-moment thing, said an investigator.        
	An officer quoted Tushar as saying that he only knew that his wife was frustrated over their financial condition.         
	What about her association with Rajib? She has been going out of home frequently of late but I dont know who she has been meeting, Tushar told the police.        
	Colleagues of Rajib confirmed seeing an older woman coming to the shop to meet him. But Manishas brother-in-law Snehal Patel said he never noticed anything suspicious in her behaviour. In any case, both Tushar and I would leave home early and return late.         
	The only one in the Patel home who still doesnt know about Manisha being arrested is her son. My nephew has been asking about his mother. We have told him she is in hospital, said Snehal.              Monday afternoon: Manisha Patel tries to convince her cousins wife, Chetna Sanghvi, to lend her Rs 2 lakh to set   up a business. Accomplice Rajib Das is seated next to her   in the dining space of the Sanghvis Bhowanipore flat  Chetna replies that she and her husband dont earn enough from their Burrabazar gifts shop to lend money, prompting Rajib and Manisha to lunge at her. The duo try to throttle   the homemaker, causing her to fall from the chair              Chetna is dragged to her bedroom by Rajib, who   pins her down on the bed with his knees on her chest.   He and Manisha then strangle her to death  Duo leave after slamming the door shut but forget to take   Manishas bag, placed on a wooden rack. They flee to Vaishali in Bihar but cops trace them, thanks to Manishas bag

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Powder scare grounds trio
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Powder scare grounds trio
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Three Japanese scientists were barred from taking a Bangkok-bound flight from the city on Wednesday afternoon as they were carrying a powder-like substance in a packet that warned that the contents might explode at high temperatures.         
	Scientists Takayukr Rsogar, Takahasar Arzhzro and Hayakana Tokztaka  who work with a Japanese firm in Haldia  were scheduled to take a Jet Airways flight to Bangkok on Wednesday afternoon.         
	While going through the security check at the airport, the trio told airline officials about the powdery substance they were carrying.        
	The airline officials alerted CISF men who asked the scientists to open their luggage and show them the packet. After seeing the warning on the packet, the CISF personnel asked the three to step aside. They informed the bomb disposal squad to run a check on the packet, said an airport employee.         
	Officers from the squad took the packet to an isolated place and ran the series of check on it.         
	After completing the tests, the squad officers declared that the packet did not contain explosives, the airport official said. But by then, the flight that the scientists were supposed to take had left.         
	Jet Airways said they would accommodate the trio on a subsequent flight but would not allow them to carry the powder-like substance in their hand baggage or in their checked-in luggage.         
	We dont want to take any chance. They can send the packet by air cargo, an official of the airline said.

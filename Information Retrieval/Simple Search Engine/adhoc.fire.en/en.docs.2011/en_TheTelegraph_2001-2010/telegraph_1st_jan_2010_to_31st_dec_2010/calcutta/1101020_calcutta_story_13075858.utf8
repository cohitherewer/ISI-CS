The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sparks trigger mid-air scare
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sparks trigger mid-air scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Calcutta-Frankfurt flight with 152 passengers and 13 crew members made an emergency landing at the city airport two hours after take-off on Tuesday when sparks forced the pilot to shut down one of the engines mid-air.        
	Officials said the Lufthansa A330-300 hovered over the airport for nearly an hour to burn fuel and lighten the aircrafts weight before making the emergency landing.         
	Passengers on the plane, however, didnt escape a heavy landing because of the sudden descent from a height.         
	Fortunately, the plane was close enough to fly back to the city on a single engine. Things can get out of hand if the second engine also malfunctions, said an aeronautical engineer.        
	The Lufthansa aircraft had taken off at 1.10am and was near Varanasi when the right engine developed a snag, prompting the flight commander to switch it off. The aircraft, which was then flying at an altitude of 28,000 feet, soon descended to 18,000 feet.         
	As soon as the pilot sought an emergency landing, all necessary arrangements, including ambulances, fire tenders and other safety measures, were made. The flight landed safely at 3.15am, an airport official said.         
	An official statement from Lufthansa confirmed that the aircraft circled the skies above the city airport to burn fuel prior to the emergency landing. This was done in accordance with standard safety procedures, the statement added.        
	A passenger on the flight said some of his co-passengers saw sparks coming out of the right engine mid-air. They immediately brought it to the notice of the cabin crew, who passed on the message to the cockpit. All of us were very, very scared, said the passenger, a resident of Washington who was in the city for Puja.         
	Lufthansa said the pilot was aware of the sparks before being alerted by the passengers, which is why the engine was shut down. But there was no fire or smoke. Even the in-flight fire extinguishing system was not activated, said the German airline.        
	According to the statement, the A330-300 is equipped to handle such emergencies. This aircraft can safely fly even with one engine shut off. It is also designed for safe landings with one engine, the airline added.        
	The aircraft was later grounded for repairs and the passengers taken to various city hotels. They were brought back to the airport on Tuesday evening and put on another flight to Frankfurt via Mumbai and Delhi.        
	The city airport has had more than its share of emergencies in recent months, including one where a plane cleared for landing was forced to do a go-around to avoid running into one on the runway. A few days after that incident in August, the runway turned pitch dark for nine minutes because of a generator glitch.

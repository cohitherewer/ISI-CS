The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Swelter alert for weekend
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Swelter alert for weekend
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The swelter is feared to continue through the weekend with the Met office radar failing to pick up any hint of rain or storm in the next 48 hours.        
	The weather is unlikely to improve significantly over the weekend. There could be a cloud cover but we dont foresee rain or Norwester for at least the next 48 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The cloud cover might help keep the mercury in check but could also push up the humidity, adding to the discomfort. For the humidity to climb down, the city needs rainfall. That is unlikely in the next few days, said an official of the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	The maximum humidity on Friday was an oppressive 91 per cent. The maximum temperature climbed down to normal but the minimum  28.7 degrees Celsius  was four degrees above normal.        
	The high humidity is the result of a low-pressure trough running through Bihar and Jharkhand which has been sucking moisture from the Bay of Bengal, said an IMD official.        
	The power situation on Friday was as bad as in the past few days but officials are expecting a respite over the weekend because of a drop in demand .        
	Demand on the weekend will naturally be less and hence, the shortfall too would come down, said an official in the power department. However, its likely to be back to square one from Monday.        
	The days peak demand shortfall in the CESC areas was 250MW while the rest of the state reeled under a deficit of 425MW. Power cuts in the city and the districts added up to around two hours in the evening.        
	A CESC official blamed the disruption to a deficit in the grid. We needed to import much more to meet the demand that crossed 1,600MW.

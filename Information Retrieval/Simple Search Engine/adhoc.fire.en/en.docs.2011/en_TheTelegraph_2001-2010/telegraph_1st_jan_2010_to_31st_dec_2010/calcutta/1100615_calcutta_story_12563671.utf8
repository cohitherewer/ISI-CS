                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A school in the spotlight
  - UNDERSTANDING THE TWIN CONTROVERSIES ON CAMPUS                                              
	La Martiniere for Boys was set up in 1836. The school at 11 Loudon Street, has been rocked by twin controversies  the suicide by a Class VIII boy and the abetment-to-suicide case filed by his father against the principal and four teachers, and the arrest of a teacher accused of demanding a bribe to promote a Class IV boy.        
	Metro, having spoken to both sides over the past few days  culminating in a meeting with principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi on Monday evening  answers the most frequently-asked questions today.        
	What is the Rouvanjit Rawla case?        
	The Class VIII student was found hanging in his Alipore home on February 12 four days after he was caned by the principal for bunking class.        
	On the day he died, Rouvanjit had been hauled up for indiscipline  he had allegedly carried and burst stink bombs in class  and his parents had been summoned by the principal on the next day of school (February 15).        
	On June 7, Ajay Rawla, Rouvanjits father, filed a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station accusing the principal and four teachers of torturing his son, administering corporal punishment and driving him to his death.        
	What is corporal punishment? Is it banned?        
	Corporal punishment involves rapping on the knuckles, being made to run on the school ground, kneel down for hours, stand up for long hours, sit like a chair, being beaten with a scale, pinched and slapped, child sexual abuse, torture, locking up children alone in classrooms, electric shock and all other acts leading to insult, humiliation, physical and mental injury, and even death.        
	The Supreme Court banned corporal punishment for children on December 1, 2000. Calcutta High Court banned corporal punishment in February 2004.        
	The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009 under Clause 17 specifies that no child shall be subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment and whoever contravenes that shall be liable to disciplinary action under the service rules applicable to such person.        
	What did the school do after the boys death?        
	The school conducted an internal probe after the principal admitted to the board of governors that Rouvanjit had been caned four days before his death. The board found the principal guilty of corporal punishment and, going by the rulebook, warned him. A repeat offence would mean suspension and a third offence would mean termination.        
	Why have things exploded over the past week?        
	On June 7, Ajay Rawla lodged an FIR with Shakespeare Sarani police station accusing the principal and four teachers of abetment to suicide for misbehaving with and torturing Rouvanjit. Rawla also wrote to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights that constituted a probe team to conducted an investigation on campus last week.         
	What has the national commissions probe team found?        
	The commission, after speaking to Rouvanjits classmates and others, has concluded that corporal punishment was a common practice at La Martiniere for Boys and caning by the principal a regular affair. The probe team said it would recommend the suspension of the principal and three other teachers, pending police investigation. It would also recommend radical changes in the way the school is run including the need for democratisation of the administrative process.        
	Are the panels recommendations binding?        
	No they are not. But they can build up pressure on the school to take appropriate action and also guide the police and the state administration.         
	What are the police doing?        
	The detective department has taken up the case and is probing whether there was any link between Rouvanjit being punished in school and his suicide. The sleuths have spoken to family members and friends of the boy. They will next meet some teachers of the school and then question the accused.        
	What is the principal saying?        
	Sunirmal Chakravarthi said on Monday he was sorry for having used the cane but there was no link between Rouvanjits punishment in school and his suicide.         
	What is the Sanjay Smart case?        
	Sanjay Smart allegedly demanded a laptop in November 2008 from Partha Pratim Banerjee, father of Class IV student Srijan to promote him. He had apparently sent text messages to Banerjee: Can you give me a laptop with Internet connection, I will be in constant touch with you and I can provide exam question papers.        
	Banerjee first complained to the principal  but not in writing  and then filed an FIR with Shakespeare Sarani police station on April 2, accusing Smart of denying him promotion and the principal of shielding Smart. Banerjee wants rehabilitation of his son Srijan who should be taken back and promoted to Class V.         
	What did the school do about it?        
	After the police case was lodged, a probe was conducted by the principal who felt that though the teacher had denied the allegation, the finger of suspicion seemed to point at him and so further investigation was required. Smart then went missing but moved anticipatory bail petitions that were rejected.        
	What did the police do?        
	The Shakespeare Sarani police tracked Smart down, arrested him on May 17 and produced him in Bankshall court.        
	Where does the case stand?        
	Smarts judicial custody was extended on Monday till June 28. He is now in Presidency jail. If proved guilty, the teacher accused of extortion and criminal intimidation can be sentenced to a three-year jail term.        
	What is the principal saying?        
	Smart was suspended as soon as we got a report from the police following his arrest, clarified Chakravarthi.       Chandreyee Chatterjee and Jhinuk Mazumdar

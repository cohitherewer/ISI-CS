The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The art of making art
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The art of making art

	No thing succeeds without marketing these days, and Khoj International Artists Association has successfully packaged experimental art for the consumption of the global market.        
	Khoj, part of the global Triangle Arts Trust, celebrated its 10th anniversary with the launch of the KhojBook on Saturday evening at the Harrington Street Arts Centre.         
	The heavy, lavishly illustrated and well-produced tome is a collection of essays on art practice in India from 1997 to 2007. In keeping with Khojs agenda, it covers not only established artists but promising, younger artists from all the country as well.         
	The book is edited by Pooja Sood, the director and curator, Khoj, who was present at the launch.         
	Paula Sengupta, the secretary of Khoj Calcutta, spoke on the workshops and residencies in this city in which artists from all over the world have participated. Not that all the artists it invited from abroad for residencies have been that hot, but its Baruipur workshop was innovative.         
	The book was launched by Sujata Sen, the director of British Council, Calcutta. She said many Khoj members have been assisted by the Charles Wallace grants.         
	The Ford Foundation and Goethe-Institut are among the institutions that have funded the book project. Khoj has found out the art of making art.         
	Glossy flier        
	All publishers have their monthly newsletters, fliers, advance publicity mailers to tell the book reading public at large about their existing and forthcoming books, activities and events. While some have it in electronic forms, which is cost-effective, others spend a neat sum trying to make the communication attractive. Seagull, the city-based publisher, is known for its beautifully designed catalogues, done by proprietor Navin Kishore himself. There are some hardpressed publishers, however, who will finish their task in drab, two-colour, 2-page fliers.         
	Niyogi Books has started a quarterly, four-colour, glossy publication called Reading Corner (picture right), which is a combination of information on their forthcoming publications, a photo gallery on their book launches, a guest column by one of their authors and a review of one of their books. Does that ensure objectivity?        
	That is another question, but Reading Corner seems to have a little more reading material than the usual publicity materials handed out by different publishers. We plan to extend it to include more news from the publishing trade, says Bikash Niyogi of Niyogi Books.         
	The issue in hand, dated February 2010, came to Book Bazaar in May. Lets hope the next one comes earlier.         
	Yet more love...                  
	Fancy meeting a would-be author at the Jaipur Literature Festival in February and then meeting him again in mid-May as a published author, ripe with over 2,000 copies sold of his debut novel. That too on love.         
	Ahmed Faiyaz, a management consultant by profession, has penned Love, Life and All That Jazz, sitting in Dubai where he works for the government during the day and pens novels in the evenings.         
	Love, Life  is yet another attempt to fictionalise urban contemporary youth angst with seven friends who have passed out of college and go about their lives. Need to know more?         
	This book is different from the IIT/IIM literature in the sense that it is about ordinary students who after college are trying to make sense of their lives, said Faiyaz at the launch of his book at Oxford Bookstore on Thursday.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Officials of the West Bengal University of Health Sciences in Salt Lake on Monday admitted their fault in the fiasco involving the results of the postgraduate entrance examination held on January 24.         
	The results were declared on Saturday and revised on Sunday, resulting in several candidates being awarded lower ranks compared with the first list.        
	A committee  comprising the universitys dean of the medicine, S. Dasgupta and registrar Santanu Banerjee, and the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, Pradip Mitra  has been set up to probe the fiasco. The panel will submit its report in 15 days. Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra has asked for a copy of the report.        
	On Monday, around 200 doctors gathered outside the university to protest the goof-up. Sayantan Banerjee, an MBBS from RG Kar Medical College, told Metro: The university cant play with our careers.        
	The protesters submitted their demands to vice-chancellor Pradip Deb, who admitted that answers of Set D question papers were not checked properly initially because of a glitch. He said a more detailed list was put on the university website on Monday.

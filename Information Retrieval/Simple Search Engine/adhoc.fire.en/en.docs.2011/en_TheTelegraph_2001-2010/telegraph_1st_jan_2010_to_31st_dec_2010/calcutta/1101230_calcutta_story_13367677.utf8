          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	North 24-Parganas police on Wednesday handed over to bank officials a 10-point guideline on security upgrade after three heists, 14 ATM break-in attempts and several instances of cash being snatched from customers over the past year.        
	The meeting between cops and bank officials was the second in six months. It was called after some banks failed to take steps to upgrade security.        
	The guideline lays emphasis on electronic surveillance, installing multiple-point alert systems and scanning movement of visitors.        
	We insisted that the banks increase the number of security guards and install cameras at the busy branches, said a senior officer. The guideline also spells out steps to protect the vault and establish direct contact with the local police station through dedicated telephone lines.        
	We convened the meeting so that the bank security systems are upgraded soon, said Dhrubajyoti Dey, the acting superintendent of North 24-Parganas police. Bank officials said funds shortage was a problem in upgrading security.

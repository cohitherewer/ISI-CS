The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fake-permit trail leads to trader duo
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fake-permit trail leads to trader duo
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A printing press owner and a rubber-stamp maker were arrested on Wednesday for supplying fake RBI stationery and seals to one of the key operatives in the counterfeit bus permit racket.        
	Kamalendu Chowdhury, the owner of a printing unit on Surya Sen Street, had supplied 10,000 fake challans with the embossed RBI logo to Janardhan Garai, arrested last month for selling forged bus permits.        
	We examined his order register and found Garais name on the list of clients. We also seized the computers that were used to make the fake challans look like the original RBI ones, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.        
	Based on information provided by Chowdhury, the police arrested Shankar Prasad Mitra on the charge of making fake RBI rubber stamps for Garai.        
	With the duos arrest, the number of arrests in connection with the fake route permit racket has risen to 10.        
	Chowdhury claimed to have accepted the printing contract after Garai submitted a letter purportedly issued by the RBI, authorising him to place an order for challans on its behalf. But Chowdhury failed to show us the letter. He claimed to have misplaced it, said an officer of the detective departments anti-cheating wing.        
	Mitra told the cops that he agreed to supply RBI seals to Garai because he knew him well.         
	Mitra said he did not suspect Garai of wrongdoing because he had worked for him on several occasions. He claimed to have no idea about the racket but we have evidence to prove that both he and Chowdhury helped Garai despite knowing he was forging permits, the officer said.

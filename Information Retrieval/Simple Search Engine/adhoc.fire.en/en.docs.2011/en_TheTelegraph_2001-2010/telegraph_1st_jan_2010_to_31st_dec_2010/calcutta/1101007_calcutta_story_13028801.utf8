                      A fishy affair                    It all started when chef and t2 columnist Shaun Kenworthy wrote an article in t2 on cooking traditional Bengali fish in Mediterranean style. After being inundated with a barrage of hows and whys, Shaun joins Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta at Kewpies restaurant for a cook-out with select guests. Presented by t2, this hour-long workshop will see Shaun stir up a fishy affair, Mediterranean style, while Rakhi will prepare the same fish in traditional style. Sample the best of both flavours!

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The probe into the theft of 100 kg of silver from a Burrabazar jewellery workshop three days ago has led to the arrest of a former employee and two others, including a woman.        
	The cops recovered 71 kg of the stolen silver from the womans house in Bally.        
	I got to know around 11.30am that 71 kg of the 101 kg of the stolen silver had been recovered. I have all the papers that need to be submitted to get the silver back, said Shiv Kumar Bhatter, the manager of Bhatter and Co on Kalakar Street.        
	Sheets of pure silver, worth around Rs 36 lakh, were stolen on Wednesday, less than a week before Dhanteras. Police said the sheets were carried away, possibly in gunny bags, between Monday midnight and Tuesday dawn. Only two employees of the Bhatters, Tulsi Singh and Ankush Sharma, were in the factory then.        
	Ankush is missing while Tulsi was found in an unconscious state. Tulsi later told the police that someone had sprinkled powder on his face, following which he passed out.        
	The police said they had zeroed in on Pankaj Rai, who had worked in the workshop for a few days. He broke down during interrogation and admitted to the crime. Pankaj revealed the name of an associate, Kishore Jahangir, who was picked up from a hideout in Howrah, said Damayanti Sen, the joint commissioner of police, crime.        
	The sleuths learnt about the woman, Lily Chakrabarty, from the duo.

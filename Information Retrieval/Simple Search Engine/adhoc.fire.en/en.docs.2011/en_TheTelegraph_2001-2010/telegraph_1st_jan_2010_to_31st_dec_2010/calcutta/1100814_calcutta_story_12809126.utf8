          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 20-year-old hawker was arrested on Friday for allegedly tricking a 14-year-old girl whom he had promised to marry into kidnapping the three-year-old son of her employer.        
	Policemen spotted the three in front of New Market in the morning and took Mohammad Iqbal Mollah into custody. His father was also arrested for helping him.         
	The girl, who works as a domestic help, had set out with her employer Mohammad Sahadullahs son on Thursday evening, saying that she was taking him for a stroll, and headed for Mollahs shanty near New Market. Mollah, who is married, did not let the two return to the traders flat in Didar Bux Lane in Taltala.         
	Around 10.45pm on Thursday, Sahadullah, who deals in leather goods, lodged a complaint with New Market police station stating that his help had disappeared with his son Hibban.        
	I suspected Iqbal because I had seen him talking with our help several times. Moreover, Iqbals fruit juice shop near our house was shut in the afternoon, said Sahadullah, sitting in his first-floor flat in a housing complex.        
	Investigators found out the number of Mollahs cellphone from other traders and tried to call him but found the phone switched off. Using cellphone tower data we confirmed that Iqbal was in the central part of the city, said an officer.        
	During interrogation, the girl told us that Iqbal had promised to marry her. When she wanted to return to Sahadullahs house with Hibban, he did not let her, said Tripurari, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

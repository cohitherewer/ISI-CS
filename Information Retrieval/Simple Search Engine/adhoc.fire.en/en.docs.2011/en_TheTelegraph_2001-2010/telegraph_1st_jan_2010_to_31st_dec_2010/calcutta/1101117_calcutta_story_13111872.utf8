The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Zoo facelift by winter
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Zoo facelift by winter

	Alipore zoo has started an ambitious makeover, as part of which it will get a nature interpretation centre, a 200ft wide glass panel for the tiger enclosure, a food court and a multi-tier parking lot in the next few months.         
	A dilapidated structure built in the 1880s on the Alipore campus is being overhauled to set up the nature interpretation centre, which will have large touch screens and screens for audio-visual presentations.        
	We want to change the image of Alipore zoo as a venue for family get-togethers and picnics in winter. The zoo would rather welcome animal lovers who want to observe wildlife in peace. Students should attend a session at the nature interpretation centre before visiting the enclosures, said zoo director Raju Das.        
	The 75ft-high toughened glass panel will replace the iron mesh through which tigers are viewed now. The other side of the enclosure will continue to offer a view of the tigers in the open.         
	We decided on the glass panel after consulting experts. There is no threat to security. A full-grown tiger weighing around 250kg and running at 25 miles per hour can damage the glass. So we will create a hump in the enclosure that would serve as a speed-breaker should a tiger try to run at the glass, added Das.        
	Zoos in Australia and Germany and other countries use glass to showcase big cats.        
	Zoo insiders said two Indian companies that specialised in toughened glass had been asked to submit detailed proposals for the project. The glass panel and the other changes are expected to be in place by January, according to Das.         
	The food court is being constructed at the northern end of the 45-acre campus following green building norms. Once it is ready, food stalls that are spread across the premises will be removed. The move is expected to minimise littering.        
	Also in the offing are two aviaries, a facelift for the reptile home and a souvenir shop where a monkey enclosure now stands. Tickets  the price of each will go up from Rs 20 to Rs 30  can soon be purchased online, said an official.         
	The zoo authorities have planned the parking lot on 2.5 acres beside the aquarium. It will be built on a public-private partnership basis. An aero-bridge will link the lot with the zoo, added the official.

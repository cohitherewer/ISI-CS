	The two-year-old Calcutta Business School is set to launch a management programme for executives, on the lines of the course offered by its illustrious neighbour, IIM Calcutta.        
	The Bishnupur B-school, set up by the Marwari Balika Vidyalaya Society, plans to offer the 15-month executive MBA programme from the next academic year. We would start with 30 students and plan to increase the number of seats to 60, said Subir Chowdhury, a member of the board of governors of the institute and a former IIM Calcutta director.         
	The course fee would be Rs 9-10 lakh. The fee for the flagship two-year postgraduate diploma programme is Rs 7.2 lakh.        
	The institute, which started classes in 2008 with 27 students, will hold its first convocation on May 19.         
	Emami Industries, Eveready Industries, HDFC, HSBC, IFB Industries and ITC Infotech are some of the companies that recruited students from the campus this year. The average annual salary was Rs 4 lakh and the highest Rs 5.5 lakh.

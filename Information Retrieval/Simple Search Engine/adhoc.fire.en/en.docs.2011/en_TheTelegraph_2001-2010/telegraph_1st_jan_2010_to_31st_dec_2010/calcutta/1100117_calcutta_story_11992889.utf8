	The Prime Minister on Saturday lauded St Xaviers Calcutta for providing progressive all-round education to the rich and the poor, cutting across all faiths.        
	I am honoured to be in these august environs that have produced many great sons of India, Manmohan Singh said at the closing ceremony of the 150-years celebration at St Xaviers.        
	The Christian fathers helped those they taught to become well-rounded and cultured human beings. Their students were given the great gift of rational thought. This I think is the most important reason why St Xaviers has sent forth to the world so many outstanding citizens of India who have become leaders in their respective fields. India does not need blind faith. We need rational thinking and a scientific temper to counter dogmas and ideologies, stressed the Prime Minister.        
	Thousands comprising Christian fathers, teachers, students and alumni of St Xaviers Collegium had converged on the Park Street campus on Saturday afternoon. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, governor Devanand Konwar, Fr Provincial George Pattery, Rector Fr George Ponodath, Fr Felix Raj (principal of the college) and Fr Jerome Francis (principal of the school) were on the dais.        
	Singh paid homage to the Jesuit fathers who familiarised themselves with Indian languages and customs. I have been told by some alumni of St Xaviers that they were taught by Belgian Jesuit priests who were erudite not only in European culture but also in Sanskrit and Bengali.                  The painting by Paresh Maity, celebrating the Jesuit spirit of Rabindranath Tagore, presented to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by alumnus Aveek Sarkar on behalf of St Xavier rsquo;s      
	He referred to the luminaries the institution has produced, such as J.C. Bose and Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, and another very distinguished old boy of St Xaviers and a great son of India, Jyoti Basu. Our thoughts and prayers are with him (Basu). We wish him a speedy recovery, the Prime Minister said.        
	On behalf of St Xaviers  its students, its teachers and the reverend fathers  Aveek Sarkar presented a part of the schools history to the Prime Minister. The Xaviers old boy referred to Singh as Indias first Jesuit Prime Minister because he has fought against the grain of accepted knowledge and conventional wisdom.        
	The gift was a painting by Paresh Maity capturing Tagores moving piece about his teacher (during his brief stint as a student in Xaviers about 100 years ago), a Spanish priest called Father Peneranda. The work, apart from being an arresting visual beauty, celebrates the Jesuit spirit of Tagore.        
	Praising Xaviers for its inclusive approach to education, Singh highlighted his governments attempt to ensure universal access to education for achieving inclusive growth. I wish to see every child in our country becoming literate over the next decade. We must aim for 100 per cent literacy across India, he stressed.        
	Singh hoped that children in future did not have to endure what he had gone through  walk miles to go to school.        
	The chief minister expressed the hope that the proposed second campus of the college, set to come up off the Bypass, would start functioning soon.        
	Highlighting the Jesuit philosophy, Father Ponodath said: Education for us is not a profession, its a vocation. Its a prayer. Students are not just numbers, but precious gifts given to us.        
	The spirit of the institutions motto Nihil Ultra (Nothing Beyond) was exemplified by a choir comprising school and college kids singing Seemar majhe aseem tumi, orchestrated by alumnus Debojyoti Mishra.                    RITH BASU AND CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

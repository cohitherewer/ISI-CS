The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citys Cinderella code sets in
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Citys Cinderella code sets in

	The coach would be a pumpkin again/ Her horses mice/ Her coachman a rat/ Her footmen lizards/ Her clothes would become just as they were before...        
	The clock strikes 1.40am on Saturday night at Shisha. There is a scramble for the last drink five minutes before the bar is shut. DJ Girish announces his last track for the night. The crowd choruses one more, one more. Shhhhh. The citys Cinderella hour is over.        
	The first weekend after the 2am curfew code came into force at nightclubs, Calcuttas party people were spared their coaches turning into pumpkins. The music died, the night went dry but the party had to go on.        
	Lets go home and carry on, said Nishant Patni, 26. Cool, said Naman, Abhishek and Shreya.        
	Soon, almost everyone in every nightclub around town was making new plans. Did someone have the keys to the apartment? Was there a stash of booze at home to keep the night alive? How about a long drive towards Rajarhat and then coffee at a CCD?        
	The night was young for Calcuttas fun crowd, so used to dancing and drinking far longer into the night at party addresses than in any other metro.        
	A few weeks ago, midnight was just the beginning, the time when I would be calling up friends to find out where they were headed. But now, with the nightclubs and even dhabas closing by 2am, we are not only leaving early to party but also thinking of other ways to party post-2am, explained Nishant.        
	The story was the same for Saurav Kapoor. When the 22-year-old student walked into Roxy at The Park with his gang at 1am, the party was just getting started. He suddenly realised he had just an hour to go and so made a dash for the bar. Calcutta was the only city where people could live it up till early morning. We will just have to hit the road after this, said Saurav.        
	Camera in hand, young Puja Basu was clicking away happily with her friends, when asked about plans past the curfew hour. People can just move to someones house and carry on drinking, she shrugged.        
	Moving from disc to drawing room was the order of the night when the lights came on at 1.45am in Tantra. Park Street is the place to be in on weekend nights. Now with the shutters down early, we plan to shift the action to a house party, said Shreyanka Mazumdar, headed towards the Bypass for one.        
	A few planned poker or board games, too. We are thinking of going back to my place and playing poker or maybe Monopoly. To stop my friends from ransacking my fridge, Im going to order pizzas. House party will be the new trend and with it, home delivery and takeaway, smiled wedding planner Chitvan Jaipuria on Friday night at Shisha.        
	Not everybody had plans to party till dawn. Im going home to sleep, said 24-year-old Diya Guha, at The Basement at Samilton Hotel. Roxy regular Rinita Dutta added: I look forward to living it up on Friday and Saturday nights but with no place to go to after 2am, Im going home.        
	The grumbles and groans were audible at The Park. I think its very sad. We Calcuttans are so used to having late nights and this was something I could boast about to my friends in Mumbai and Delhi, said couture jeweller Raj Mahtani, seen leaving early.        
	We have suffered a loss of nearly 35 per cent (because of the 2am rule). Calcuttans get into the party groove post-midnight and so everyone is heading to house parties, said Rajnish Rao of The Park hotel.        
	Its just a matter of time before the city learns to start partying earlier in the night, felt Arvind Bhatnagar of Shisha. With the restriction in place, I am sure everyone will begin partying by 10pm.

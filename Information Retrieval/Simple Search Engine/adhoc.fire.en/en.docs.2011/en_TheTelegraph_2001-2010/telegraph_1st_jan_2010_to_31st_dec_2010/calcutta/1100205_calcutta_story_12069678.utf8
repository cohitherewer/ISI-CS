	Calcutta High Court is scheduled to give its verdict on Dubai don Aftab Ansaris appeal against capital punishment in the American Center attack case on Friday, more than four years after he was put on death row.         
	Ansari and six others convicted of attacking the American Center on January 22, 2002  five policemen died in the firing  had challenged the legality of the judgment by late sessions judge Basudeb Majumdar on various grounds, including that the trial was conducted by another judge.        
	Majumdar allegedly received death threats after pronouncing the verdict on April 28, 2005, and died of a heart attack less than two months later. The first hearing on Ansaris appeal wasnt held until July 22 last year, ostensibly because several judges had backed out of the case after hearing about the alleged threats to Majumdar.        
	The division bench of Justice Asim Kumar Banerjee and Justice K.D. Mukherjee completed the proceedings on January 14 this year. The duo had asked for the secured chest containing all evidence to be reopened during the review.         
	Ansari has also been awarded life imprisonment in the Khadims abduction case.

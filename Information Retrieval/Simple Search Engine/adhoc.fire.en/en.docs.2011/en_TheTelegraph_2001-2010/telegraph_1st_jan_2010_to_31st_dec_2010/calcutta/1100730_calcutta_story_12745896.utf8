          A STAFF REPORTER                          Visitors take a look at the sports exhibits on display inside the Commonwealth Express. (Amit Datta)                                  
	A train chugged into town on Thursday carrying with it the magic of sport and the mystique of science.        
	Calcutta station (Chitpore) is the second stop in Bengal after Kharagpur for the Commonwealth Express, which is on a 101-day journey across the country to raise awareness about the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi and the infotech revolution in the hinterland.        
	The 11-coach exhibition  five for the Commonwealth Games and six for infotech  will be open to the public from 10am to 8pm till Saturday, after which it will leave for Durgapur.        
	The train, which began its journey in New Delhi on June 24, is a joint venture between the department of information technology and Eastern Railway. The sports coaches contain replicas of famous sports memorabilia, along with a hall of fame and models of the Games venues.        
	As many as 15 Arjuna Award winners and Olympians were felicitated for their contribution to sport on the first day of the exhibition.        
	This is a unique attempt to promote sport and IT together. Infotech can be an integrating factor for our country and we want to spread this message through the Commonwealth Express, said divisional railway manager T. Guha.         
	The IT exhibition aims to make people aware of the advantages of the common service centres (CSCs) that are being opened in villages to take Internet to the rural masses.        
	More than 5,000 CSCs are already functioning in villages across Bengal and many more are set to come up over the next six months, officials said.        
	Ashis Sanyal, senior director in the ministry of information technology, said: Villagers no longer have to travel to towns and cities to procure important documents such as land records. They can now access such information easily at the CSCs.        
	The science exhibition across six coaches has been laid out in such a way that visitors can use the interactive format to glean whatever information they need about infotech. The idea is to highlight the user-friendly aspects of IT.

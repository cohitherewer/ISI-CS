The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Colour culprit in street food faves
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Colour culprit in street food faves
          JAYANTA BASU                                             
	The lip-smacking fare sold on the street often looks as good as it tastes because of poisonous add-ons, recent tests by three agencies have revealed.        
	From Rs 20-per-plate biryani to colourful cut fruits, many of the food items sold cheap on the road are adulterated. We gorge on them thinking that we have bagged a good deal but the contaminants cause long-term damage to the body, said Krishnojyoti Goswami, a biochemist attached with Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan and the state director of the National Referral Centre for Lead Poisoning in India.        
	A lead-based, carcinogenic dye called metanil yellow is used to make biryani, sweets and some other food items yellow instead of the permitted colour, tartrazine, which is more expensive, added Goswami.        
	Apart from the lead poisoning referral centre, Central Food Laboratory and the food technology department of Jadavpur University found toxic elements in street food samples collected from the city.        
	According to the experts, pieces of fruit sold by hawkers are a hotbed of harmful chemicals such as Rhodamine B, copper sulphate, lead acetate and lead nitrate. These are used to make the fruit slices more appealing.        
	Hawkers even admit to the practice. I have added colour to the sliced fruits like every body else. It only makes the fruit look fresh and I do not think it will have any ill effect on health, said a middle-aged hawker named Rahmatullah, a stones throw away from the CMC headquarters on SN Banerjee Road.        
	The adulterators do not even spare milk. Samples collected from the supply by local milkmen contained thrice the permissible level of lead.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), which is responsible for taking to task those who sell sub-standard food in the city, can do little with the current infrastructure, said mayoral council member (food adulteration) Partha Hazari.        
	After taking charge of the department, I found that the civic body has 26 food inspectors, each of whom, on an average, collects three samples every month. Even the three samples cannot be tested immediately as the CMC laboratory apparently can test only a sample a day, shared Hazari with Metro.        
	Most of the time, the food inspectors claim that they are spreading awareness but that is difficult to verify, added Hazari.        
	Even if high level of adulteration is detected, few are punished. According to CMC sources, complaints were lodged against 70 food vendors since 2007 but only five could be prosecuted.        
	The situation is almost the same in the rest of the state, including the city fringes. Food samples from areas outside the CMCs jurisdiction, are sent to the laboratory run by the state government on Convent Road.        
	We found 15-20 per cent of the samples to be adulterated. However, samples were not always drawn properly. Toxic dyes meant for textiles such Rhodamine B or Vegetable Green end up in food, said Nirmal Pramanik, a retired government food analyst.        
	According to sources, fewer adulterated food items are being detected now with the state laboratory not having enough funds to collect samples properly.

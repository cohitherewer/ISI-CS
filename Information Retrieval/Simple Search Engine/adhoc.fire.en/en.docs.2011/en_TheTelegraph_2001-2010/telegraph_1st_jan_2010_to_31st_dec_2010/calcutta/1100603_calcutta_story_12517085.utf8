The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Township treble for Trinamul in a year
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Township treble for Trinamul in a year
  - WOMEN OUTNUMBER MEN IN SALT LAKE BOARD BUT HOT SEAT STILL IN DOUBT          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Hot seat hopefuls: (From top) Krishna Chakraborty, Anupam Dutta, Sabyasachi Dutta. (Sudeshna Banerjee)                                        
	After conceding the MP and the MLAs seats in the area last year, the Left Front has now lost the Salt Lake Municipality for the first time since the civic body was formed in 1995.         
	The Trinamul Congress wrested the board by a margin of 16-9 on Wednesday, improving its tally more than threefold from the five seats in its kitty during the last term.        
	The underdeveloped areas added to the planned township provided the Left a fig leaf, accounting for as many as five of the nine seats it managed to retain. When these seats go, we will be wiped out, Ila Nandi, vice-chairperson of the outgoing Left Front board and wife of former MP Amitava Nandi, told the other women councillors of her party in the wake of the landslide defeat.        
	Nandi winning ward 17 by the biggest margin in Salt Lake  primarily on the strength of the bheri votes  was small consolation for the partys defeat. Even Mahisbathan (ward 1) slipped out, showing all is not well in the traditional red bastions.        
	Overall, women were in the majority across party lines with nine out of the 16 Trinamul seats and five of the nine Left Front seats going to them. Women tend to treat their wards like their families, said CPMs Sashwati Mondal, who retained her seat. Her Trinamul counterparts said they owed their success to one woman  Mamata Banerjee. Eleven seats in Salt Lake were reserved for women this year.        
	So with women outnumbering men in the board, will one of them get the chairpersons seat this time? Nobody knows for sure despite the equation reading 14 out of 25 in favour of women.        
	The township was in the throes of a controversy after the Left Front denied a ticket to chairman Biswajiban Majumdar from ward 15, provoking an outburst. Though he was pacified, the public spat might have cost the party dear. Ward 15, traditionally known as the chairmans ward, did not return CPMs handpicked candidate Jyotirbhushan Dutta.        
	Sudhir Saha wrested the seat. He has experience on his side. The outgoing leader of the Opposition in the municipality, Debashish Jana, is also in contention having won a tough battle. But the forerunners seem to be the Dutta duo Sabyasachi and Anupam  who won from wards 6 and 7 respectively. Sabyasachi is the Bidhannagar town Trinamul president and the youth wing secretary. Anupam is the partys state committee secretary.        
	But there is a dark horse in the race in the form of Krishna Chakraborty, a debutante from ward 3, for whom the sitting councillor had to vacate her seat. Chakraborty, a former state Youth Congress general secretary, is a Mamata aide and was named by her to contest that seat.

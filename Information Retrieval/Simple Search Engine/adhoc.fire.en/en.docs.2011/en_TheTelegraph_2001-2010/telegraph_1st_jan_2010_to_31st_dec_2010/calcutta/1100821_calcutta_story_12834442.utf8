The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Red signals road chaos
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Red signals road chaos
  - Traffic system goes on the blink, rally amp; rain add to mess          OUR BUREAU                           Vehicles stand still on the choked Park Street flyover on Friday afternoon.   (Amit Datta)                                              
	A signalling system out of sync with the volume of traffic and a traffic-stopper political rally left arteries across the city choked throughout Friday, forcing many commuters to get off their vehicles and walk to their destinations.        
	The recently introduced automatic signalling system failed to cope with a sudden surge in traffic at key crossings, the chain-effect slowing down vehicular flow to a crawl in and around the central business district.        
	Things came to such a pass that the traffic department was forced to revert to the manual operation of signals in an attempt to rein in the road chaos on a rainy day.        
	The signals on several arteries such as Central Avenue, JL Nehru Road, AJC Bose Road and APC Road had to be switched from the automatic to the manual mode.        
	In the intervening time, the signals were kept on the red blinking mode. This led to traffic chaos across the city, said a senior officer of the traffic department.        
	In the automatic system, signals change at a fixed, pre-programmed interval. In the other system, cops change signals manually after gauging the traffic flow.        
	To add to the mess, the signals at some crossings  such as Vivekananda Road-Amherst Street, Rabindra Sarani-MG Road, CR Avenue-Ganesh Chandra Avenue  went on the blink, leaving cops clueless on how to manage the rush-hour traffic.        
	All traffic guards in the city have been asked to send reports on how and why the situation went out of control. Based on their inputs, well try to fine-tune the automatic signalling system, said an officer.        
	If the signalling system failed commuters in the morning and then again in the evening, the afternoon traffic was thrown haywire by a Congress rally and a monsoon drizzle.        
	Around 700 party supporters marched from College Street to Hazra  through SN Banerjee and JL Nehru Road  to commemorate the birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi.        
	While the rally was passing through Nirmal Chandra Street, vehicles came to a halt on CR Avenue in a ripple effect. That forced us to switch the signalling system in parts of central Calcutta to the manual mode, said an officer.        
	At several crossroads, cops were seen guiding traffic by waving hands  the practice Lalbazar wanted to abolish by introducing the automatic system.        
	With vehicles either standing bumper-to-bumper or moving at a snails space, many commuters were forced to get off and walk in the rain.

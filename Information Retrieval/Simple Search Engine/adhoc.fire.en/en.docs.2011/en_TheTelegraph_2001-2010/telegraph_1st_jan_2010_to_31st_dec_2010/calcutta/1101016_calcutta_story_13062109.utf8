                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Nothing in the world compares to this
  - A first-timer admires creativity amp; community feeling, a veteran rues loss of heart but cant resist it										                        Swastika Mukherjee with Adriana, wife of Chad Cummins, at Barisha Youth Club on Ashtami. (Pabitra Das)				                                 
	Chad P. Cummins, director, American Center, a judge for CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja on Ashtami, on his first Puja in town:              
	I knew that Durga Puja was a special time for Calcutta but I was not aware of the full implication of the festivities. By the time I came to Calcutta last year, the Puja was over. So, this is my first experience of Durga Puja and I must say that I have become a fan.        
	The openness of the Puja  the fact that everyone is welcome to participate  is what is the most endearing quality. It is a reflection of how open the people of Bengal are and how welcome they make you feel.        
	I am glad that I got the opportunity to be a judge for the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja  it gave me the opportunity to go around the city and be part of all this.        
	The only other puja I saw was at Park Circus, which I inaugurated. They had recreated the White House. It was really neat.        
	My favourite of all the finalists today would be Barisha Youth Club. Santoshpur Lake Pally would come a close second both in terms of creativity and the parameters of the true spirit of the Puja.        
	The nature theme adopted by Barisha Youth Club and the message about environmental protection that they sent out appealed to me the most and they followed most of the True Spirit Puja norms.        
	Lake Pally had a very open pandal and was very colourful. I really appreciated the fact that they protected the greens by building a platform over the park and then built the pandal. They also had clean and accessible rest rooms.        
	But all of them have been really impressive in terms of the kind of creativity involved. From the little pujas to the big ones, all have shown tremendous creativity and that is what will stick with me.        
	If anyone says Durga Puja it will remind me of the creativity.        
	The other thing that Durga Puja will bring to mind is the community feeling. Ceremonies like these are very important even today as it creates an opportunity for people to get together and foster community feelings.        
	Durga Puja is a unique event. I have been to almost every continent and nothing compares to it. In other parts of the world the festivities mostly happen during the day or early evening. It is never this festive late at night or early in the morning.        
	The traffic was a bit of a deterrent while I was coming back from a friends place around midnight but I got to see Puja in full swing. Women are all dressed beautifully, wearing special saris. There are so many young people out on the road and everyone has a big smile on their face.        
	I may not be here during Durga Puja next year, but I would tell everyone that if they are near Calcutta during Puja then they must visit.        
	(As told to Chandreyee Chatterjee)

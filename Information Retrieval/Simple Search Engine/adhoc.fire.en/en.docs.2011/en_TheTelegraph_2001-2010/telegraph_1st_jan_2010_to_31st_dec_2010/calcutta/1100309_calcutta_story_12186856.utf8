The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man who sells tales with atta and dal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Man who sells tales with atta and dal
          ANASUYA BASU                          Chetan Bhagat talks to city students. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Books are a boring product, says the writer who has changed the face of Indian publishing.         
	Chetan Bhagat, whose latest book 2 States is selling a copy every two seconds, feels that the challenge is how to make books interesting for todays youth, who have so many choices to spend their money on.        
	His titles  5 Point Someone, One Night the Call Centre, The 3 Mistakes of My Life and 2 States  have sold over a million copies each. If you sell a thousand copies, you break even, if you sell 10,000 copies, yours is a best-seller, but I sold more than 10 times over, and a copy of 2 States is selling every two seconds, the IIT-IIM alumnus said recently while interacting with the students of the Bengal Institute of Business Studies in the city.        
	While Bhagat attributes the success of 2 States to Indians loving love and marriage he also stresses on innovation.         
	5 Point... is a book by, for and about Indians, he pointed out. Besides, the pricing also helped. Chetan says he had asked his publisher Kapish Mehra of Rupa, How low can you keep the price? He knew he was selling to students and couldnt price it above Rs 100. Mehra said Rs 95 and the price hasnt been revised since.         
	With One Night... we tried 10-second MTV ads but that didnt work, confessed the banker-turned author. For The 3 Mistakes... Bhagat decided to host the launch at Big Bazaar.         
	I told Kishore Biyani [of the Future Group] that I wanted my books to be sold beside the atta and dal counters. It paid off and how.         
	With 2 States, it was a distribution mania. We had 40 people visiting bookstores and delivering copies the night before the launch, he said.        
	Right from writing the book, editing it, choosing the cover, handling the publicity, I handhold all the way, said Chetan. So what is his success formula?        
	Awesomeness (i.e. his books) = Innovation x Execution x Marketing.         
	If I, E or M is 0 then A = 0

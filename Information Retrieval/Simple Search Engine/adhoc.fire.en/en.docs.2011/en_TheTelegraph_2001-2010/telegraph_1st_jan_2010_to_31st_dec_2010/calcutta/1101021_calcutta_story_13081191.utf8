The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | I thought we would suffocate in there
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      I thought we would suffocate in there
                                      
	I was standing near the ladies' section in the third compartment when the train shook violently. Smoke filled up the compartment and I thought we would all die of suffocation right then. I feel I was extremely lucky to have escaped from the jaws of death.

	How can they play with the lives of so many people? Accidents involving Metro trains have become the norm. Thankfully no lives were lost but a big accident is just waiting to happen.

	Twitterverse buzzed through the day on the Metro derailment, the tweets ranging from concern to indignation to resignation at the sorry fate of the citys lifeline

	Metro rail in which used to be the pride (of the city) is in (a) shambles. Not a single day (do) we have a smooth journey. Railway minister jago!

	Inside tunnel in Metro today... people panicked. Why auto evacuation voice announcing system not installed even in 2010?              
	Humerian (TheHumerus)         
	I cannot but feel dejected to see the Metro in this state.

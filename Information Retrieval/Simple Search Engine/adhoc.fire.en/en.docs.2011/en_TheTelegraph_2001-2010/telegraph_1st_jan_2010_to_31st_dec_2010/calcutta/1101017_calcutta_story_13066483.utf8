The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Return of the little girl who was denied the bonti
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Return of the little girl who was denied the bonti
                              BIPASHA BASU                            
	Saturday was my mothers birthday and I gave her a big surprise by coming down from Mumbai.        
	I really have to say that theres nothing bigger than my parents for me. My parents are my god. They have introduced me to God and Puja and given me birth. So theres nobody bigger than my parents. Not even God.        
	I am just being honest. This is the way I think.        
	But this time it was really very special because I got to attend Durga Puja in Calcutta after eight-nine years. The last time I was here during Puja, John and me were here, and it got really crazy.        
	We really did not enjoy much and we were confined to the house because it was so crowded. From then on I realised that I do not enjoy Puja as much as I used to enjoy it as a child.        
	But then this time it was my mothers birthday too and it was an additional incentive. So I decided to come and enjoy the festivities, even if it was just for a day.         
	I remember, as a child I used to really look forward to the four days of the Puja. It (Sharadiya Sammilani, Ekdalia) was our parar puja and we used to be active from 4am.        
	Every one of us had our work cut out. Aamar kaaj chhilo chandan pesha... grinding the lal chandan and the sada chandan.        
	I was very little and I was not allowed to cut fruits and vegetables with a bonti.        
	But my elder sister Bidisha and my cousin sister Sudeshna, they were in charge of the phol-kata and shobji-kata.        
	Then there was the bhog distribution and giving flowers to everyone for anjali. We used to have a lot of fun.        
	We even used to go to Kumartuli to get the idol. Then, bhashaan-er shomoy amra jetaam.        
	The entire day we used to be so excited looking forward to eating good things, pocket money, new clothes it used to be a lot of excitement.        
	Even when I was living in Delhi, I used to come to Calcutta during Durga Puja. It was a very important part of my growing-up years.        
	The last few years my shooting dates have mostly coincided with the Durga Puja dates. Whenever I am in Mumbai during Puja, I go for the Debu Mukherjee puja (now steered by Rani) in Khar. Aami Ashtami-tey jai, anjali di, prasad aar bhog khai.        
	This time I had my film Aakrosh releasing on Ashtami. I prayed to God that the effort we all put behind the film yield some good results.        
	(As told to Pratim D. Gupta)

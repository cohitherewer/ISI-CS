The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic game: name same, vote zero
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civic game: name same, vote zero
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND TALAT SALAHUDDIN                                             
	Four reluctant dummy candidates propped up by parties to queer the poll pitch for their rivals in the May 30 civic election ended up scoring a duck because they decided not to waste their valuable votes on themselves.        
	Independent candidates Dipali Das, Dipali Nandi and Dipali Paul  all pitted against the Trinamul Congresss Dipali Das in ward 56  had signed their nomination papers along with Kartik Kumar Roy in ward 45 allegedly at the behest of the CPM and the Forward Bloc. But none of them were told whom to vote for.        
	I didnt campaign for myself but I did vote. I will obviously not tell you whom I voted for, smiled 43-year-old homemaker Dipali Das, who was selected to contest as an Independent from ward 56 in south Calcutta only because she was the Trinamul candidates namesake.        
	Just in case the presence of two Dipalis in the candidates list didnt confuse voters enough to benefit the CPM candidate, two more namesakes were added to the fray  Dipali Nandi and Dipali Paul. Voters side-stepped the Dipali triangle to elect Trinamuls Dipali Das by a margin of 4,000-odd votes.        
	I am not a political worker but the party (CPM) recently made me a member of a self-help group. So when they asked me to contest the poll, I couldnt say no. I even campaigned door to door. But when it came to voting, it was solely my call, said Dipali Nandi, a homemaker from Motijheel Lane in her 40s.        
	Dipali Paul, a resident of Pottery Road, was unavailable for comment but the other two dummy candidates admitted that they didnt have to spend a rupee from their own purse to contest the polls. Local party leaders paid the nomination fees of Rs 500 each and also got a few posters and leaflets printed, the duo said.        
	So how did it feel to see their faces staring out of posters pasted on walls in the run-up to the elections? I honestly didnt take it seriously, said the dummy Dipali Das, whose husband Ashok is a Trinamul worker.        
	The most reluctant of the four zero-vote candidates was 52-year-old Kartik, a migrant from Hazaribagh who runs a tea stall on Canning Street. Bhola Sonkar, a Forward Bloc leader of the Burrabazar area, had allegedly fielded Roy as an Independent against the Congresss Santosh Pathak in ward 45.         
	Sources said Sonkar had put up as many as eight Independent candidates against Pathak in a bid to eat into his vote share but the Congress candidate still won.        
	Officials of the State Election Commission confirmed that the four zero-vote candidates in this years civic election didnt vote for themselves because no ballot was cancelled in wards 56 and 45.

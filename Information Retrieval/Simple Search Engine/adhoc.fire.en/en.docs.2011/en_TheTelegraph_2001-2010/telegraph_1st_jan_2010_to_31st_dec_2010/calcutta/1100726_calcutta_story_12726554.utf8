The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old man murdered at home, finger at mason
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Old man murdered at home, finger at mason
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Gour Mohan Sarkar                                  
	A retired railway employee was found murdered with a deep wound on his head on the second floor of his three-storeyed Baithakkhana Road house in north Calcutta on Sunday morning.         
	Preliminary investigations suggest that Gour Mohan Sarkar, in his mid-70s, was killed by a mason who had been working in the house for the past three months.        
	Police said the mason, identified as Manoj, was absconding. Cash and jewellery kept in a locked trunk on the first floor were missing.        
	Sarkar lived in the house with wife Kalpana. The cops said Kalpana had gone to a nearby market around 8.30am, after Manoj entered the house. My husband was on the second floor with the mason. I served them tea before leaving for the market, an officer quoted Kalpana as saying.        
	On returning home around 9.30am, Kalpana found the door leading to the the first floor open. A trunk in which the Sarkars used to keep some cash and jewellery was lying on the floor in one of the rooms, its lock open.        
	I sensed something amiss as we never keep the trunk unlocked. As my husband could not be seen on the first floor, I went upstairs where I had served him and Manoj tea. The sight there was shocking. My husband was lying on his abdomen in a pool of blood. I immediately called up my daughter who lives nearby, Kalpana recalled.        
	The couples daughter Gopa Roy, who lives with her family in Patwar Bagan, rushed to the Baithakkhana Road house. She alerted her brother Sanjay, who runs a paper-box manufacturing unit on the ground floor of the Baithakkhana Road house but lives with his family in Belghoria, on the northern fringes of the city.        
	A medical examination revealed that Sarkar was hit with a blunt weapon on the back of his head. There was no sign of resistance. We suspect the mason had hit the victim with a hammer, said Biswarup Ghosh, the deputy commissioner of police (north).        
	The sleuths said Manoj was introduced to the Sarkars by another mason, Mohammad Idris, who lives nearby on Keshab Chandra Sen Street.        
	Manoj had been working in our house on and off for the past three months, said Sanjoy.

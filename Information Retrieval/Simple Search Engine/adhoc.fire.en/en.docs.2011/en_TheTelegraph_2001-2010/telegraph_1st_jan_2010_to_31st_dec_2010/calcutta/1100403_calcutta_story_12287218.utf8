The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safety-first scurry after fire 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Safety-first scurry after fire     Queries aplenty but cost a barrier
          POULOMI BANERJEE AND MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                              
	The Stephen Court tragedy has sent the complacent, cost-conscious Calcuttan scurrying for fire-safety safeguards he would consider either unnecessary or too expensive for his home or office until last week.        
	Electrical contractor Krishnendu Roys cellphone hasnt stopped ringing since the incident, with most of the callers asking how much an overhaul of their household electrical wiring with fire-resistant fittings would cost.        
	My team of eight services over 120 households in north and central Calcutta but we have never been so busy. The majority of the calls are for checking or redoing the household wiring, he told Metro.         
	Dealers in electrical goods and accessories confirmed that enquiries and sales had gone through the roof over the past week. Fire-proof cables and switches, which are more expensive than the regular ones, are definitely selling more, said Akhtar Ahsan, 79, at a shop in Wellington Square.        
	The demand for fire extinguishers has also shot up in the past seven days with enquiries and orders pouring in, mostly from residents committees of highrise buildings.         
	We have been receiving 20-25 calls every day. Before the fire, we would get a maximum of eight to 10 calls, said a supplier at Queens Mansion, adjacent to Stephen Court.        
	So has Calcutta finally woken up to fire hazards or is it just another wise-after-the-event phase?        
	The death of 43 people in the Park Street fire has left this city shaken like never before. People have realised it is better to eliminate the risks rather than wait for something terrible to happen, said Kankurgachhi resident Sumit Dutta, a retired state government employee.        
	But safety comes at a cost, and that remains the biggest barrier for a city littered with old, unsafe buildings that have never seen anything remotely resembling a smoke detector or a fire extinguisher.        
	The fire-safety awareness has, however, brought a frown to many a landlords forehead. Tenants will pay peanuts but still expect the building to be fire-proof, grumbled one on Camac Street, now forced to draw up a fire budget.        
	Not everyone is willing to put their money where their mouth is. Talking about fire-safety measures is one thing, paying for it quite another. I live on the fifth floor of an old building. I wrote to the other residents about the need to take care of the building, which has a wooden staircase, a creaky lift and a jumble of electrical wires in the common passage. I am yet to receive a response, rued a resident of Little Russel Street.        
	Buildings without any residents committees  Stephen Court hasnt had one for over a decade  or those that have been rented out are said to be the worst in terms of vulnerability to fire. Landlords unwilling to spend on safety measures are just biding time. So the onus is on us tenants to pressure them into installing fire-safety tools or make those arrangements ourselves, said a trader who lives in a north Calcutta tinderbox.        
	According to dealers in fire-safety kits, most of the enquiries are coming from housing complexes and offices. Pavlo Engineers, which retails 5kg multipurpose fire extinguishers for Rs 1,800 a piece, has received 50-odd calls in the past week enquiring about its range. Thats much more than we would get in a week earlier, said public relations officer Paramita Mandal.         
	Gunnebo India Ltd, whose regional office was in Stephen Court, has also reported a jump in business. Many hotels, resorts and companies have been calling up. Some are getting fire extinguishers installed while others want their systems checked and upgraded, said Sudip Chanda of the companys Minimax division. Not many residential complexes have contacted us, though, he added.         
	At Ceasefire, demand has gone up by 30 per cent since the Park Street fire. Some house-owners are asking for immediate installation of fire extinguishers. Gas-leak detectors are also in demand, said V.K. Tripathi, the regional manager of Ceasefire.         
	Awareness is still low among citizens about fire-safety tools other than extinguishers. Housing complexes need to invest in escape gear as well, which includes fire hoods and blankets. They are expensive but every complex should keep a few ready, said Tripathi.

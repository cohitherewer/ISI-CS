The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Faces of fear in battle zone
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Faces of fear in battle zone
          SANJAY MANDAL AND RITH BASU                                                      (From top) The ransacked ground-floor lobby of Peerless Hospital; the clinical pathology laboratory of the hospital; hospital employees inspect the damage caused by the mob. Pictures by Aranya Sen      
	Madhabi Devi, 50, in bed number 8129 of Peerless Hospital was in shock on Tuesday afternoon, several hours after mob fury had shattered the sanctity of the ICU.        
	I suddenly heard doctors and nurses shouting about a mob attack. They had barely drawn the curtains when a brickbat came crashing in, smashing the glass window, shuddered the critically ill patient. The doctors then started pulling our beds towards the centre of the room, away from the windows.        
	The mob rage that ravaged Peerless on Tuesday morning gave patients, doctors, medical and administrative staff members the shock of their lives and forced the hospital to stop taking in patients till basic repairs were carried out.        
	Amit Mukherjee, 40, who was in the emergency ward of Peerless nursing a broken leg, had not been able to sleep all night because of the pain and was dozing off when the first sounds of fury jolted him wide awake. A mob had entered the emergency wing and started smashing everything in sight.        
	We could hear glass shattering, other equipment being smashed and the shrieks of some nurses and other hospital staff members who had rushed out of the ward to help the accident victims being wheeled in, said Mukherjee.        
	Among the doctors in the emergency ward was Sudipto Mukherjee, who had rushed there soon after learning about the accident.        
	The first victim to be received by us was a boy of around six years. Minutes after he was pronounced dead, a blow landed on my head, then another on my back and after that a kick in the abdomen, he claimed.        
	Just as we were managing to pacify the crowd, a mob of youths barged into the hospital and started smashing things and assaulting people. The situation was life-threatening and so we fled and took shelter. Much later, police came to rescue us, he added.        
	According to Mukherjee, he recognised some faces in the mob as residents of the area who could be seen any given day near the hospital.        
	The security personnel had to shed their uniforms to escape serious harm. Our colleagues on the first two floors quickly slipped into ordinary clothes to save themselves, said a guard in front of the Netaji Subhash Ward.        
	But nothing could save the hospital and those trapped inside from the aftershock of the attack. Surojit Chowdhury, who had undergone an angiography on Monday, was shaking with fear when his father-in-law Subhrangshu Saha finally met him around noon.        
	The attack on Apex Hospital across the EM Bypass, and closer to Hiland Park, was just as vicious with three resident medical officers being beaten with iron rods, medical equipment smashed and cash and expensive medicines looted.        
	Sensing trouble we fled to the RMOs room but they dragged us out and beat us up, said Tapas Halder, one of the three resident medical officers at Apex in the morning.

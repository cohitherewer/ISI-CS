	The heads of Anglo-Indian schools in the city are to meet next week to draw up a set of guidelines on how to maintain discipline on the campus without being harsh on students.        
	Class VIII student Rouvanjit Rawlas father has blamed corporal punishment at La Martiniere for Boys for his sons suicide on February 12, triggering a controversy over students being allegedly caned in various institutions despite such methods being banned long ago.        
	The July 16 meeting, to be held at the St Thomas School auditorium under the banner of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools, will be attended by the principals of both La Martiniere institutions, St James, Don Bosco, St Xaviers, Pratt Memorial and 45-odd other city institutions.        
	There is a need to adopt a new set of positive measures to run our institutions smoothly. We are planning to take a final decision on this in our next meeting and then discuss the guidelines with the parents, said Gillian Rosemary Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School and the president of the association.        
	The suggestions include greater involvement of parents in academic and social grooming in school and comprehensive counselling sessions for students on the campus. Basically, the heads of schools will explore an entire gamut of options to achieve the objective of disciplining kids without compromising on the traditional values of these institutions, said a principal.        
	According to him, there is already a consensus on doing away with the system of disciplining students by writing notes for their parents in their diaries or scolding them for minor offences or harmless mischief. We have noticed that students suffer from stress if teachers act tough. Some students even begin to see education as a threat, the principal said.        
	J.K. Sen, the principal of Julien Day School, Ganganagar, on the northern fringe, said comprehensive counselling at all levels  students, guardians and teachers  was the only solution to the challenge of maintaining discipline without stressing the child.        
	But schools need to ensure that trained personnel are involved in the process of counselling. Each school must appoint at least one full-time counsellor, said Sen, also the director of the education and development wing of the four Julien Day branches in town.        
	The Friday meeting is also set to discuss whether parents would be willing to bear the extra cost of hiring trained personnel for counselling.        
	Simple moral science classes are of no use anymore. Kids need to be counselled properly on why they are asked to do certain things and not to do something else. We need experts for that, and there is a cost involved in getting their services, explained the principal of a central Calcutta school.

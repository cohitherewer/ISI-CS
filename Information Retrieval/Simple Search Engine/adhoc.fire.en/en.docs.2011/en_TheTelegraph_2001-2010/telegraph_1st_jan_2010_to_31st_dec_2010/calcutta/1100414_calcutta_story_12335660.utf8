The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two held with pistol, bullets
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Two held with pistol, bullets
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths were arrested in Beleghata on Monday night with a pistol of Italian make and 50 bullets.        
	Sujoy Sarkar and Sanjib Das, residents of the area, did not reveal during interrogation where they had procured the firearm and the ammunition, said police.        
	Policemen on patrol spotted the duo in their late-20s abusing a taxi driver in front of the civic bodys borough office near Beleghata police station.        
	Finding their behaviour suspicious, an officer tried to search the two. While he was being searched, Sanjib ran away but we caught him. The .32 bore pistol was tucked in his waist, under his T-shirt. We later found out that it was made in Italy, said an officer of Beleghata police station.        
	The two probably supplied arms and ammunition to the citys underworld. We did not find their names in the wanted list. We are verifying whether they are new to the citys crime scene, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Since they were carrying so many bullets, we suspect that the duo had planned to hand the ammunition over to others. Now, we would try to track down those who were supposed to buy or receive the bullets from the two, said an officer.        
	Sarkar and Das were produced in Sealdah court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody for seven days.

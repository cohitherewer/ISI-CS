The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bias cry against private colleges
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bias cry against private colleges

	The state higher education department and Calcutta University are independently probing an allegation by the Howrah Zilla Parishad that private colleges in the district are not granting fee waivers to poor students.        
	Colleges have to teach five per cent of its students free and waive half the fees of another 10 per cent of its students, according to an order issued by the state government.        
	The order is applicable for all private colleges as well as self-financed courses run by state-aided institutions.        
	Mina Mukherjee Ghosh, the zilla parishad sabhadhipati, recently wrote to higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Choudhury, alleging that many poor students were being deprived of college education because they could not pay the full fees. He urged the minister to take steps to ensure that they were not deprived.        
	This is a serious allegation. The institutions cannot violate this order. We are probing the allegation, said a senior official in the higher education department.        
	Action will be taken against institutions found guilty of not extending the free and half-free education schemes to deserving students, said the official.        
	Denying admission and free education to poor students may result in the withdrawal of the government no-objection certificate issued to the institution as well as the cancellation of their affiliation.        
	We have asked the Howrah Zilla Parishad to give us the names of the errant colleges so we can take appropriate action against them, the official said.        
	On the basis of the sabhadhipatis complaint, which did not mention the names of the colleges violating rules, the higher education department had written to Calcutta University asking it to inquire if any of its affiliates in the district was refusing admission to poor and meritorious students just because they could not pay the fees.        
	The CU undergraduate council has set up a one-member committee to find out if the zilla parishads allegation is true. The panel will also identify the colleges which have denied admission to poor students, said Tarun Patra, a senior teacher of Dinabandhu College in Howrah and a member of the undergraduate council.        
	Sabhadhipati Mukherjee Ghosh said the zilla parishad decided to lodge the complaint after several members had raised the issue at a meeting in December.

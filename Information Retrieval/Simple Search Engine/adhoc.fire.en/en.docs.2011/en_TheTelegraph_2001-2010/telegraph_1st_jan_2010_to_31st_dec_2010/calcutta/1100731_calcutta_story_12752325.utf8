          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A New Town land broker was arrested on Thursday on the charge of abetting the suicide of 79-year-old Prankrishna Mondal of Rajarhat, who was allegedly duped into signing the sale deed for 18 cottahs during a single-cottah deal.        
	Pijush Saha, a resident of Baguiati, was picked up from the Salt Lake office of his firm Nirvoy Merchant Pvt Ltd. The company is involved in land deals in the Rajarhat township.        
	Apart from abetment to suicide, Saha has also been charged with forgery and cheating.        
	Mondal was found hanging by the branch of a mango tree in his orchard in Baligori, adjoining Action Area III of New Town, on June 23 morning.        
	He had mentioned in his suicide note that some brokers had duped him into signing a sale deed and robbed him of his house and land.        
	Mondals elder son Chittaranjan had lodged an FIR against four persons, including Pijush Saha, said Mehmud Akhter, the sub-divisional police officer of Barasat. Among the other three accused, Sushanta Podder and Jayanta Mondal were arrested earlier. One accused is absconding.        
	Around a hundred residents of Baligori demonstrated outside New Town police station and tried to assault Pijush while he was being taken to court.

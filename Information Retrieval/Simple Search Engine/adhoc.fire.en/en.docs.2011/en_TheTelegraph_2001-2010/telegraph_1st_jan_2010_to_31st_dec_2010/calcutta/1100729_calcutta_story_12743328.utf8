                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boost for safe paints
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state pollution control board will buy lead-free paints worth Rs 1 lakh and distribute them free to Kumartuli artisans during the upcoming festive season.        
	This was announced by Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the board, after a meeting attended by around 50 idol-makers and representatives of paint companies on Wednesday.        
	We have decided to use lead-free colour to paint idols and are asking puja organisers to place orders for such idols. Continuous exposure to traditional paints, which are rich in toxic elements, cause various ailments said Mintu Pal, an idol-maker.        
	In 2008, only one idol had been painted with lead-free colour in the city. Last year, the figure had risen to 30.        
	The paint companies assured the board that they would make lead-free paints available in Kumartuli shops.

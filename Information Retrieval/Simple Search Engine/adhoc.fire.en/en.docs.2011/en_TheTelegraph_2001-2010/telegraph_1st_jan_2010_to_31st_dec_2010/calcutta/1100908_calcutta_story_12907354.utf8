The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Is it Trinamul? Is it Citu? Its both!   Day of tension, not violence
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Is it Trinamul? Is it Citu? Its both!     - Turf tussle between supporters and opposers keeps victims guessing          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE AND SUBHAJOY ROY                        RIGHT OF WAY: A Trinamul Congress bike brigade out to beat the bandh at Hazra on Tuesday morning.

	Soumalya Basu beat a hasty retreat this morning and returned home instead of venturing out for office when he saw a Trinamul rally approaching the Baguiati crossing.        
	Bhaskar Roy was pleasantly surprised to see that some red-flag toting young men were standing at the entrance of Dum Dum station and yet the railway services were normal.        
	Both Basu and Roy knew about yet another strike but did not care to check who the main sponsors of the 24-hour shutdown were. The rally convinced Basu that Trinamul had called the strike while Roy thought that the red-flag bearing brigade was there to ensure the smooth running of trains.        
	Our leader Mamata Banerjee wanted us to oppose the strike and so we deployed our people on the streets to block the Citu-sponsored strike, said Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi. As a result, the rules of the strike game saw a sea change on Tuesday with strike supporters often being outnumbered by those opposing it and the green-and-white flag more visible than the red.                                
	Citu supporters were even seen allowing vehicles to ply at places and there was no attempt to disrupt railway services. A senior railway official told Metro that not a single case of blockade on the rail tracks was reported all day.         
	The overwhelming presence of Trinamul supporters made it look like a Trinamul bandh. I learnt later that Citu had called the strike. But where were the cadres? I saw red flags but no bandh enforcers, said Soumalya Basu, who left for his central Calcutta office in the afternoon.

	Not just the absence of Citu supporters, their lack of muscle flexing came as a surprise to the handful of Calcuttans who had ventured out defying the shutdown diktat.        
	Metro even spotted Citu supporters standing as mute spectators when around 30 Trinamul activists got off their motorbikes and removed a road blockade put up by the bandh brigade near Technopolis in Sector V. They are doing all this to provoke us into retaliation. We are not going to fall into their trap, said Raghunath Pramanik, a CPM local committee member.        
	So was Citu changing its stripes? It is too early to conclude that they have shunned their violent ways. Todays restraint was due to the fear of a backlash from the minority community as the strike coincided with the auspicious Day 27 of the Ramazan month, said a professor of political science in Calcutta University.         
	There was no doubt about the massive Trinamul mobilisation to defy the strike. We were wary of what might happen if the strike supporters clashed with those opposing it. So, we had made special provisions in sensitive areas. But there was no major trouble, said a senior police officer, adding that only 43 people had been arrested in strike-related incidents. On most other bandh days, the count goes into the hundreds.        
	Though the Citu and Trinamul leadership differed on their assessment of the strike  spontaneous and successful said Citu, total failure claimed Trinamul  both agreed that the day passed peacefully.        
	But that was small consolation for all those whose daily lives were disrupted.        
	And at the end of yet another day lost, Citus general secretary Kali Ghosh said: There was no work in government offices, private establishments, shops, banks, industrial units and tea gardens across the state. People expressed solidarity with our issues.

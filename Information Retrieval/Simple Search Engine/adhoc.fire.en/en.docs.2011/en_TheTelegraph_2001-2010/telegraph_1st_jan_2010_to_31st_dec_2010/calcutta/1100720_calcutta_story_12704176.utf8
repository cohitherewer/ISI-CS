The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Career before cash for part-time gang
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Career before cash for part-time gang

	 Aspiring filmmaker Debdutta Vajpei is interning with an ad agency even as she pursues a degree in media studies from Bangalore. By the time she graduates, the Calcutta girl hopes to add more part-time work experience to her CV than most of her peers.         
	 For BEd student Sreya Banerjee, part-time content writing is more about sharpening her professional skills than about financial independence. She treats the Rs 8,000 that she earns every month as a bonus.         
	Tuitions for pocket money are pass, teens and 20-somethings of today are taking up part-time jobs not for the cash but to develop skills and build their rsums for the career battles ahead.        
	If the opportunity comes, money will follow. It is the experience that is more important. When everyone went home for vacations, I stayed back to work in an ad agency. It was not necessary but I did not want to waste time, explains Debdutta, 25.        
	Students not working part-time during their college years are seen as lazy, aimless or not motivated enough.         
	Nowadays you dont hear anybody saying that someone has taken up a part-time job because he or she desperately needs the money. Irrespective of whether you need the cash or not, zero part-time experience means leaving blank space on your CV, says a commerce student doing assignments for a chartered accountancy firm.        
	The pop picks among part-time jobs are those offered by media houses, NGOs and advertising agencies. If cash comes before career development, BPOs are the part-time employers of choice.        
	Most young part-timers in the city are undergraduates testing the waters before zeroing in on a career. Be it a three-month internship during the summer vacations or a year-long assignment for a firm willing to take in a student as a trainee, experimentation with choices is the name of the part-time game.        
	I am trying my hand at various things hoping this would help me make up my mind about what I would like to do for the rest of my life. I wont have this golden opportunity of experimenting once I start working full-time, says Suloghna Mukherjee, who tried both social work and journalism while pursuing her masters in sociology from Calcutta University.        
	Some make unconventional choices, knowing they have nothing to lose even if they choose not to take up a particular profession. Siya Chaudhury, who has just completed her plus-two from Loreto House, is dabbling in social work for a few months before leaving for the US. I just wanted to do something meaningful before deciding on a career, says the 18-year-old.        
	Psychologists say GenX not only parties hard but also works harder. The need to take up a part-time job may still arise out of inadequate pocket money but their awareness and motivation levels are high. Students are far more focused now than they were a decade ago. It is a very positive development, points out psychologist Mohormala Chatterjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fathers cry ends rail roko 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fathers cry ends rail roko
          A STAFF REPORTER                Shyamal Ghosh with his   son at Bamangachi
    
	A father on his way to a city hospital with his ailing son almost single-handedly removed a blockade that held up his train near Barasat for close to two hours on Friday, with railway officials and police allegedly nowhere in sight.        
	Habra resident Shyamal Ghosh and his two-year-old son were travelling on a Down Bongaon local which entered Bamangachi station in North 24-Parganas, around 35 km from the city, at 9.35am. A little earlier, a 50-strong group allegedly backed by the Congress had descended on the tracks demanding immediate arrest of a few criminals in the area.        
	The protesters put up posters at the station and blocked the Down tracks by placing a broken rail on them and planting flags on either side.        
	Holding his son in the crook of his arm, Ghosh got off the train around 10.30am with still no sign of the police or railway officials coming forward to end the rail roko.                                
	Witnesses later said Ghosh started screaming at the protesters to remove the blockade as his son was critically ill and had to be taken to a hospital for surgery.        
	But the protesters were chatting and made no move to remove the iron block. There were no cops around, recalled Prasanta Kundu, who runs a stationery shop on platform 1.        
	Ghosh also pleaded with the stranded commuters to join him in removing the blockade. Amar chhele osustho. Okey RK Kar-e niye jete hobey. Aapnara kichhu korun (My son is ill. He has to be taken to RG Kar hospital. Please do something), Ghosh was heard urging the crowd.        
	Again there was no response. In fact, one of the protesters laughed at him and shouted back: Aare ekhan theke jaan to moshai (Move away from this spot).        
	A desperate Ghosh then jumped on the tracks and started uprooting the flags. The metal bar, however, was too heavy for him. Looking at the commuters, he again shouted: If you dont come forward, how can I remove this? A few passengers, inert moments before, plucked up some courage and got down to help Ghosh.        
	Most of the protesters had dispersed by then. The few still there melted in the crowd and did not oppose Ghosh, said Netai Das, a hawker on the Bongaon-Barasat route.        
	It was around 11.15 that the tracks were finally cleared. A group of railway officials suddenly appeared and asked the driver to start the train, said Das. When contacted by Metro in the afternoon, the station master refused to comment.        
	A few local residents said the protesters were backed by Congress leaders. It was a fallout of a turf war between the Congress and the Trinamul, said a resident. Local Congress leader Sajal Dey, however, denied the allegation.        
	A railway official said some GRP men had arrived at the spot and were trying to persuade the agitators to withdraw the blockade.        
	Shankar Singha, the superintendent of railway police, Sealdah, said: I have sought a detailed report about the incident. No complaint was lodged till late on Friday.

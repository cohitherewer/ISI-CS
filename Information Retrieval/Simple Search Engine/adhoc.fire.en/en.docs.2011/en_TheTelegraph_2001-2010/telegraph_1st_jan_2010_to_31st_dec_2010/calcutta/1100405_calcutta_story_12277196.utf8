The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Retail guru on growth risk
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Retail guru on growth risk
          SUBHRO SAHA                          A Big Bazaar outlet in the city. Fresh produce retailers are hit by poor supply chain infrastructure                                  
	Its better to open two well-appointed stores than run 10 ill-done outlets around town and make a hash of it, feels international fresh produce retail expert John Baker.        
	A lot of retailers grew too quickly in India and I see things are no different in Calcutta. This becomes a serious problem in fresh produce retailing, since without a proper supply chain infrastructure, you are not giving your customers 100 per cent, Baker, in town recently to anchor a training programme for local fresh produce retailers, told Metro.        
	The foundation of a good supermarket selling fresh produce stands on the two legs of cool rooms and supply chain management, and this is often woefully lacking here, felt Baker, who walked into some city stores unannounced to have a clear grasp of prevailing logistics and gauge preparedness.        
	Baker, the CEO of Produce Marketing Australia, who brought with him more than three decades of experience in working with produce departments of retail chains across the globe, was the lead speaker at a workshop with representatives of retail chains such as Spencers, Reliance Fresh, Big Bazaar and More.        
	Conducted by the Washington state department of agriculture in partnership with the Washington Apple Commission, the fresh produce retail training programme was aimed at educating retail produce staff on merchandising and handling of fresh produce with Washington apples as a primary example.        
	This is the 11th country where we have developed this training programme and I have to say India has the poorest application of best practices by way of back-end preparedness, lamented Baker, who is doing similar workshops in Bangalore, Pune, Ahmedabad and Amritsar.        
	Sumit Saran of The SCS Group, which represents Washington Apple Commission in the subcontinent, concurred with Baker that the supply chain infrastructure, which included transportation, storage and distribution, was the main grey area for fresh produce retailers to ensure quality.        
	The lack of a clear-cut government policy for fresh fruits and vegetables has prevented the supply-chain infrastructure to evolve, and it doesnt help when imported fruits are stuck in ports for days, Saran points out. Ashok Kumar VB, chief manager, fruits amp; vegetables (east amp; north), Spencers Retail Limited, agreed there was room for improvement in supply chain management. Government investment towards augmenting infrastructure has started flowing in four-five years back, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bomb hoax at private bank
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bomb hoax at private bank
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A bomb scare gripped five HSBC branches across the city on Thursday morning after a call warning about blasts in the properties reached the BBD Bag (East) branch.        
	The call turned out to be a hoax but it affected banking operations in all five branches. The BBD Bag branch was the worst-hit as the services had to be suspended for more than three hours.        
	The other affected branches were on Theatre Road and Ramani Chatterjee Street (Gariahat) and in New Alipore and Kankurgachhi.        
	Police said W. Jones, the administrative manager of the BBD Bag branch, received the call at 10.20am.        
	The call came from a PCO on Brabourne Road. A male voice, speaking in Hindi, said bombs had been planted at five HSBC branches in the city, said joint police commissioner, headquarters, Jawed Shamim.         
	Close to 80 per cent of the 350-odd employees were in the branch when the call came.        
	Our disaster management system was activated and the employees were evacuated within minutes. The police and the bomb disposal squad arrived soon, said Yenten Lama, CEOs representative, eastern India, HSBC.        
	Scared employees stood outside the branch waiting for the search to be over. I had just settled in my seat when I heard an alarm go off. Suddenly the security staff instructed us to leave the premises. Its only when we stepped out that we came to know about the bomb alert, said a customer care executive of the bank.        
	Transactions in all seven branches of HSBC in the city came to a halt because their online systems were interlinked. The authorities claimed offline transactions could be processed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Car runs over cops
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Car runs over cops
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A speeding car ran over two policemen keeping vigil on VIP Road from a vantage point on the Rajarhat Expressway flyover as part of a safety drill for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy on Sunday evening.         
	Assistant sub-inspector Babul Karmakar, 38, and constables Prabir Bandopadhyay, 48, and Parameswar Pandey, 43, were getting a birds eye view of traffic below the flyover, ostensibly unaware of the dangers of being perched on a bridge down which vehicles hurtle at high speed.         
	Around 6.20pm when the light was beginning to fade, a red Alto (WB02J 4927) coming from the Rajarhat side rammed against the trio, killing Karmakar and Bandopadhyay on the spot and leaving Pandey critically injured in the head and spine.         
	The car, with airline employee Debojwal Gupta at the wheel and friend Shampa Bhattacharjee next to him, turned turtle after hitting the railing of the flyover but both were rescued. Shampa, 26, was pulled out unconscious and admitted to a private hospital.        
	Police quoted witnesses as saying that Debojwal, who suffered minor injuries, was guilty of rash driving.We intend booking him for culpable homicide (not amounting to murder). He has blamed a mechanical snag for the accident. We have asked for the vehicle to be checked by experts as well as an alcohol test on him, said superintendent of police Rahul Srivastava.        
	Assistant sub-inspector Karmakar was transferred to the North 24-Parganas police headquarters from Howrah with a promotion barely two months ago. Bandopadhyay was a constable in the enforcement branch, like Pandey.        
	Prosenjit Biswas, who was in a tea stall under the flyover when the accident occurred, said he heard a screech, a thud and a bang before looking up to see one of the victims almost hanging by the railing. I ran up the bridge to see the car belly up. It was scary, he recalled.         
	The chief ministers convoy finally sped down VIP Road around 7.35pm.        
	The bridge takes a sharp turn at the highest point, which makes speeding all the more dangerous, according to the police.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bar council plea
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bar council plea
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The state bar council has requested its national counterpart to defer the deadline for filling up forms by law graduates to appear in a test, clearing which would earn them the licence to practise in courts.        
	The state council wants the deadline, which lapsed on October 31, to be extended by a fortnight as many candidates were apparently unaware of the need to sit for the test.        
	We have requested the Bar Council of India to extend the deadline till November 15. But there is no reply yet from the national body, Saradindu Biswas, a member of the executive committee of the state council said on Thursday.        
	The test is scheduled for December 5. Around 2,000 students from across the state, who have obtained the five-year LLB degree in the 2009-2010 session, are expected to take the test.        
	This is the first time the national council has made it mandatory for law graduates to clear the test, to be considered eligible for practising in courts.        
	The state bar councils have opposed the move. Recently, the representatives of all 15 state councils had condemned the decision at a national seminar in Calcutta, attended by national council chairman Gopal Subramaniam.

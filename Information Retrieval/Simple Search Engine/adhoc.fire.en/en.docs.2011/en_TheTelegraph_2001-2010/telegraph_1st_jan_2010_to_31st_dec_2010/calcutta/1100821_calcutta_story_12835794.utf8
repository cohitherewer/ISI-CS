          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Police have started raids on drug peddlers across the city after an expos in Metro on the trade in banned items.        
	Police sources said around 300 peddlers were arrested in the Sealdah, Beniapukur and Park Circus areas during the raids that started on Wednesday night following an order from police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	Initially, we are focussing on drug-peddling points around schools and other educational institutions. More than 200 purias (small packets of drugs) have been seized, said detective department deputy commissioner (special) Vishal Garg, who is supervising the raids.        
	Metro had on Thursday highlighted how the drug racket operated in the city under the nose of the police and where the purias are freely available (see picture).        
	Teams from Beniapukur and Taltala police stations and the anti-narcotics department of the detective department jointly raided places around Pratt Memorial and St James schools on AJC Bose Road.        
	The raids are being conducted in two phases  from 6.30am to 10am and from 3pm till late in the evening. We are also conducting surprise raids after midnight, said an officer of Beniapukur police.        
	Officers said people from across the city used to gather in alleys around St James School to snort or inject drugs. We had complained to police several times, said an official of the school.        
	Places around College Street, SN Banerjee Road and Bowbazar would be raided soon. There are several educational institutions in these areas, said an officer.

	Four shops were damaged in a fire that broke out at Metro Plaza at dawn on Friday.        
	Guards at the Ho Chi Minh Sarani mall with over 200 shops noticed flames on the second-floor around 4.30am and alerted the fire brigade and the traders association.        
	Five tenders reached the spot within 15 minutes and managed to control the fire by 5am.        
	Firemen said an iron that had been kept on through the night in one of the damaged shops probably sparked the flames.         
	The mall authorities, however, blamed a short circuit for the fire. The main switches of all the shops had been turned off at night and only the passage lights were on, said Aroon Shahani, a member of the traders association.        
	The flames charred two clothes shops on the second floor. A dcor shop opposite them and goods in an electronics shop on the floor below also sustained extensive damage.        
	Malls sources estimated the damage at Rs 1.5 lakh. Glass panes on the ceiling near the dome and on either side of the first-floor landing had to be broken to allow the smoke to dissipate.        
	The mall had adequate fire protection measures in place, said an officer of fire services.        
	Metro Plaza opened on Friday evening after receiving clearances from the authorities.

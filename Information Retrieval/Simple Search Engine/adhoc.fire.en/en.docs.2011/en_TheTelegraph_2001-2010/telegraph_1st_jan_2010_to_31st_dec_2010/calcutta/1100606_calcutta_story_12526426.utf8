The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Theatre looks for small space
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Theatre looks for small space
                            Srikumar Banerjee, the chairman of Atomic Energy Commission and the secretary of the department of atomic energy, was awarded the Raja Ram Mohan Puraskar 2010 on May 22 at Nazrul Manch. Conferred annually on the birth anniversary of Raja Rammohun Roy by Ram Mohan Mission, this honour acknowledges contribution to science and includes a cash award of Rs 5 lakh, a citation and a gold medal.   Mahasveta Devi was given the Ram Mohan Mission Award 2010, a cash prize of Rs 50,000 and a citation for her literary and social achievements.   Weavers Studio is trying to recreate the proscenium				                                       
	A proposed grant of Rs 25 lakh from the ministry of culture has sparked off a scramble among theatre groups to create independent units or studio theatres (spaces equipped to handle performances for small audiences). What this may actually mean in the long run could be a rash of unequipped halls that would primarily benefit the owner. And since such halls will attract a select few, rather than the unpredictable audience of large halls, it could also trigger plays cued only to the problems, experiences, tastes and ideals of a certain kind of people.         
	Rangakarmee for instance has taken possession of a hall with minimal facilities at 61 Prince Anwar Shah Road, hoping that the grant would help them to develop it into a 100-seater studio theatre-cum-rehearsal room.         
	Those who are not aware of the grant are also building such spaces. Creative Arts Studio, which opened at 23 Gobinda Banerjee Lane, Tollygunge (opposite the Tipu Sultan Mosque), is rather small and uninspiring. But young theatre director and actor Ramanjit Kaur, who has financed this venue, has fitted it with lighting grid and sound equipment. Apart from screenings, readings and performances the 35 to 40-seater studio with greenrooms or restrooms and a fully furnished kitchen, could be used for national and international research/residency projects and workshops, she says.         
	We didnt know about the grant, but it is certainly welcome, says Ramanjit.         
	Groups usually more comfortable in large auditoriums are also trying out new spaces. Spandan recently presented Ek Ruka Hua Faisla at the Weavers Studio at Ballygunge Place trying to recreate the proscenium by sectioning off floor space into a stage embellished with lights and props they had brought in.         
	April 16 saw the Harrington Street Arts Centre host its first theatre show, Wire, by Jadavpur University Department of English in a large, three-side open performance area. We are open to theatre, especially by the young, says owner Noni Khullar. However entry will be by invitation.               
	Tagore for young                  
	Old familiar faces will have little space at the celebration of Tagores 150 years organised by Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre, where the focus will be on the new talent. Thanks to Holly, Bolly and Tolly, a time may come when the young are clueless about the wealth of Tagores songs, so we need more public events and contests to attract children and young adults, says director Jayanta Sthanapati.        
	 The year-long Tagore fest with a budget of Rs 28 lakh is expected to seek out a new generation of singers through a national Rabindra Sangeet contest for school and college students. Recitation of Tagores poems will be the theme of another national competition for students. Four scholarships totalling to Rs 3 lakh will be awarded for two years. Preliminary rounds to begin at district levels from June.         
	There will be monthly seminars. Film shows on Tagores stories and novels; a multilingual theatre festival; program of audio dramas based on Tagores works and agores dance dramas are in queue.         
	Green light error                  
	In Calcuttas lawless streets you cannot even trust the green light meant for pedestrians, who often have to wait interminably for the flow of vehicles to stop for a couple of seconds.        
	When this green light is flashing and you think that it is safe enough for you to cross the road, you can never be sure that some vehicle will not suddenly steal up on you and turn you into meat paste. And not just early in the morning before the policemen return to duty, but well after 10am as well.        
	In some roads in the BBD Bag area, the signal for pedestrians does not work at all. So you never know when to run across and when to stop. There are no alternatives. Ask any copper close by, and he will readily agree with you. Yet at every street corner a womans voice drones on the public address system: Remember somebody is waiting for you at home If only the police would.

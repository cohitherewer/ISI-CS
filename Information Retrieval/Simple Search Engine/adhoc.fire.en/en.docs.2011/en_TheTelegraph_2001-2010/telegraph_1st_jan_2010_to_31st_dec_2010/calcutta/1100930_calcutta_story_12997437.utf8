          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          A crowd outside the high court after the employees strike was called off. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	The seven-day-old strike by high court employees was adjourned on Wednesday, sources attributing the move to discontent among the staff over the uncertainty about getting salaries before Puja.        
	The agitating employees, however, said the ceasework was called off for the time being to honour an appeal from Chief Justice J.N. Patel.        
	Leaders of the five employees unions of the court, pressing for the implementation of a revised pay scale, met the chief justice in the afternoon.        
	The courts Puja vacation starts on October 7 and had the strike continued till then, the employees would have had to go without two months salaries. In the Puja month, the employees get a months salary in advance because the vacation continues for around 30 days. The high court will reopen on November 8.        
	It was the prospect of being denied two months salaries during Puja that actually prompted the leaders to call off the strike, said a member of a union.        
	A leader of one of the unions said the agitation would resume on November 18 if the government fails to honour its commitment and implement the special pay scale by then.        
	In the evening, high court registrar-general M.P. Srivastava said: Just now I have received letters from all five associations. They have informed me that they are adjourning their ceasework till November 18.        
	Representatives of the Congress-backed Lawyers Association met the chief justice during the day and requested him to ensure that the court sat during the Puja break to make up for some of the days lost.        
	We have requested the chief justice to take steps so that the court can function during the Puja vacation, said Uttam Majumdar of the association.        
	The CPM-affiliated Democratic Lawyers Association, too, criticised the employees for calling the strike on Puja-eve.        
	The leaders of the employees associations slammed finance minister Asim Dasgupta for setting a condition for considering their revised pay scale. Dasgupta had on Tuesday sent a note to the court administration saying the employees demand would be considered only if the strike was called off.        
	The chief justice asked us to ignore the matter (Dasguptas condition) and open the court first, said Saibal Ghosh, the general secretary of the Calcutta High Court Employees Welfare Association.        
	The high court employees enjoy a special pay scale though their salaries are paid by the state government.        
	In 2007, then Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar had set up a committee comprising three judges and two state government representatives to fix a fresh pay scale for the court employees. The committee submitted its recommendations in 2007 but the government is yet to act on it.

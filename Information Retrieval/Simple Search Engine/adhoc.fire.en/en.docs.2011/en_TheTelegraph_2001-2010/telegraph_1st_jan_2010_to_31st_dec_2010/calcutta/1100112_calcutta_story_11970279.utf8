The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Commonwealth man at Basu bedside
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Commonwealth man at Basu bedside
          POULOMI BANERJEE                                    
	When I hear Jyoti Basu is sick, I feel sick myself, said Tanzanian leader William F. Shija at a dinner hosted for him on Saturday.         
	Shija, who is the secretary-general of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Associations, the first African to hold the position, said: I had met Basu when I was in Calcutta in 2007. He gave me a lot of wisdom. He has a lot of knowledge on the prospects of India.         
	On Monday, the Tanzanian leader was taken to the ICCU of the private hospital in Salt Lake where Basu has been admitted since January 1.         
	When asked about what he liked about Bengal at the dinner  hosted by businessman Sundeep Bhutoria  Shija spoke about the leadership of the state and Calcuttas wonderful hospitality.         
	In 2007, I had gone on an extensive tour of the Indian Museum, which helped me understand the history and background of India, he said.         
	Shija, who is on his second visit to Calcutta, is no stranger to India. I studied at the Indian Institute of Mass Communication in New Delhi (in 1979-80). Back then, Delhi was more spacious, there were no flyovers or underground trains; there were fewer people. Life was slower, he said.         
	Shija is disappointed that a milk booth he frequented as a student has disappeared. I used to buy buffalo milk from there every morning that would last me through the day, till dinner, he smiled.         
	Shija, who has a PhD in mass communication from Harvard University, thinks his background in the subject and teaching (he taught media studies in Tanzania) helped his political career.         
	He sees the Commonwealth as an opportunity for countries with a shared past to be different together and yet learn from each others expertise.        
	My aim is to ensure that members are fully informed about the activities of the Commonwealth Parliament and encourage technological growth of the members, among other things, he said.         
	Asked about being the first African to be elected the secretary-general of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Associations, as well as Barack Obamas election as US President, Shija said: It is justice, yes but I got this post after competing against the other candidates, it was not conferred upon me. So I think, everyones opportunity is here.        
	Shija is on an official visit and would be in India till January 16.

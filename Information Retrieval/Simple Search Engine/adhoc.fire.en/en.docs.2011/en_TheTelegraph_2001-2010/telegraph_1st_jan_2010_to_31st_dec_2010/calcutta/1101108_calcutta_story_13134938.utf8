The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bypass bother survives   change of traffic guard
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bypass bother survives   change of traffic guard
                                            Motorists defy lane rules in the absence of dividers            A car takes a U-turn, banned at this point            State police dividers are still being used as city cops don rsquo;t have enough of them            Police posts stand empty            Motorcyclists without helmets; in the 
  background are illegally parked vehicles      
	Traffic woes on the EM Bypass to the south of the Ruby rotary remain the same even more than a month after policing on the 5.5km stretch was handed over to the city cops in an attempt to rein in vehicular chaos on the artery. Metro drove down the road from Ruby to Garia and encountered the same problems it had faced till September 30, when the state police were in charge of manning traffic on the stretch        
	Parking peeves        
	All types of vehicles remain parked illegally on either side of the stretch, especially the eastern flank between the Patuli crossing and Garia, throughout the day and the night.        
	The owners and the drivers just need to pay the police and get an unauthorised parking space in return. For a large vehicle, such as a truck or a bus, the monthly fee is Rs 600. There is no fixed rate for smaller vehicles, with violators getting away by coughing up Rs 100 whenever they are caught by police.        
	Earlier, we used to pay men in khaki. Now, we have to grease the palms of men in white. The fee has increased by Rs 100 since the October 1 change of guard but we dont mind paying the amount since we can park here at ease, said a truck driver who parks his vehicle along the stretch almost daily in the morning.        
	Banned vehicles        
	Slow-moving vehicles like rickshaws and cycle-vans, banned on the high-speed corridor, enjoy an unhindered access to the Bypass, slowing down traffic. All the drivers need to do when intercepted  a rare occurrence in any case  is to pay Rs 5 to the cop.        
	The rickshaws take sudden U-turns and slow down traffic. The rickshaws primarily ferry passengers from residential areas along the Bypass to Kavi Subhas (Garia Bazaar) Metro station and the Bagha Jatin railway station. After Calcutta police took charge we expected things to improve. But nothing has changed, said Biplab Maiti, a bank employee and a resident of the Baishnabghata-Patuli township.        
	Absence of cops        
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu had cited lack of manpower of the state police as the main reason for handing over the responsibility of manning traffic on the 5.5km stretch to the city force.        
	Bypass regulars, however, havent noticed any improvement in police deployment since October 1  key crossings are still without cops and traffic police posts are mostly empty. The few men in uniform who can be seen on duty often turn a blind eye to violations.        
	Overloaded and banned two-stroke autos still ply on the Bypass and bikers still dont bother to wear helmets. Where median dividers have not yet been erected, vehicles frequently jump lanes and take U-turns.        
	I was one of the first persons to have been booked for not wearing a helmet on October 1 afternoon, after Calcutta police took charge. But now I understand it was a publicity stunt. The situation is back to square one, said Aniruddha Bagchi, a resident of Kalikapur.        
	Official version        
	We have assessed the problems and will address them soon. We are still short of enough guard rails and traffic posts. We are yet to provide adequate place for our officers to sit while on duty. However, the process of road-marking and erecting median dividers is on. Things will be different from next month, said an officer of the south-east traffic guard which is in charge of manning the Ruby-Garia stretch.        
	Although the Bypass is under our jurisdiction, the adjacent roads, such as the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector, are still under the control of Bengal police. When we try to book offending vehicles, they simply speed off to Bengal police areas. An auto stand packed with the banned two-stroke vehicles is located bang at the Kalikapur crossing of the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector. Deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee said more guard rails would soon be set up. His officers will soon meet their counterparts in South 24-Parganas to tackle problems arising out of area demarcation.

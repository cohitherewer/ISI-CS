                      Arts initiative                    The only experimental dance company in Eastern India, Sapphire Creations has always striven to develop an organic, radical, dynamic and alternative idiom of movement. With a forte for innovation, the ensemble is fresh, young and exudes a ready awareness of contemporary global concerns. Sapphires work approaches issues of gender, art, relationships, society, polity, consumerism and HIV through a global perspective, South Asian sensitivity and an experimental body stylistic. To connect with art, artists and people in general, the group now launches its Quarterly Arts Series, providing a platform to young artists from various disciplines and celebrating the achievements of renowned masters. This evenings launch programme begins with Emotica, a solo dance recital by Ankita Dutta Gupta, which recounts the journey of an individual through the vagaries of life; from the protection of the mothers lap into the real world. Next, Paramita Saha will present the choreographic piece Four Point Something, a quizzical exploration of four theatrical moments and how they rearrange themselves into various thematic structures. Finally, Kalamandalam Piyal will present a lecture-demonstration on body alignment and ancient Indian traditions, where he will reveal the undiscovered contribution of Natyasastra to the growth and proliferation of organic performing arts in South-east Asia.

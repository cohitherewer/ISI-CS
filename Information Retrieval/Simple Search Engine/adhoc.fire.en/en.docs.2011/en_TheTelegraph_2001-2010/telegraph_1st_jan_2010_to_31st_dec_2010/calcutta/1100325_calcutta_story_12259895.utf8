The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Snag-hit skylift amp; fire engines   stay idle as building burns
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Snag-hit skylift amp; fire engines   stay idle as building burns
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                                  
	A snag-ridden skylift stood idle at the Free School Street headquarters of the fire department as people trapped in the blaze at Stephen Court on Park Street, a shout away, died waiting for two useable skylifts to arrive from Sector V and Behala.        
	The number of casualties in Tuesdays inferno might also have been less had the four out-of-commission fire engines parked on Free School Street been ready for deployment, admitted fire department officials.        
	It was a case of so near and yet so far, said a tired official returning to his quarters after fighting the blaze for more than 15 hours.         
	A lot of lives could have been saved if we had at least one hydraulic skylift at our disposal as soon as the fire at Stephen Court was reported at 2.15pm. The skylift would have reached the spot in less than 10 minutes and we could have evacuated trapped people. At least those who panicked and jumped to their death from the higher floors could have been rescued, he added.        
	According to officials, a skylift would also have solved the problem of the water jet of the fire engines not reaching the fourth floor in the crucial first hour of the operation.        
	The skylift in the fire brigade headquarters can reach up to a distance of 54 metres to evacuate people and fight fires. It was commissioned in 2006 and used to combat the fire at Nandaram market in 2008 but has been out of service for over a couple of weeks.        
	By the time the two other skylifts reached Park Street from Sector V in Salt Lake and Silpara in Behala, it was 3.30pm, almost one-and-a-half hours since flames were first spotted on the fourth floor of the building.         
	Four of the persons trapped in Stephen Court had died jumping off the higher floors till then, while several more were charred inside the building.         
	In a congested city like Calcutta with highrises all around, a skylift is the most important firefighting equipment, according to experts. But the state fire department has only three such skylifts, of which the one at the headquarters has suffered a breakdown. One the two working skylifts was inducted into the fire brigade only two weeks ago.        
	According to fire department records, snags were detected in the skylift at the headquarters on March 8.         
	So why hasnt it been sent for repairs? We have informed the fire services minister and senior officials about the malfunctioning skylift but there has been no response from them. The hydraulic system has been giving us trouble for sometime now, said a member of the team that fought Tuesdays blaze.        
	When Metro visited the fire department headquarters on Wednesday afternoon, the skylift was parked on the premises along with four fire engines. A thick layer of dust covered the engine.         
	This is just one of the many firefighting tools that do not work, said a fireman with a shrug.        
	Minister Pratim Chatterjee, who has been busy questioning the safety of the Rs 32,000-a-seat IPL Club Lounge at the Eden Gardens, said one skylift out of three being out of order was not a big issue. The skylift has developed some snag and the parts are not available here. We have two more skylifts that did a very good job on Tuesday, added the minister.         
	A senior official said the skylift broke down because of poor maintenance. Whenever such equipment is purchased, the norm is to sign an agreement with the manufacturer for annual maintenance. Experts conduct periodic maintenance and issue a certificate. But the fire services department hasnt entered into any such agreement with the manufacturer of the skylift.        
	The new skylift was imported from Finland for Rs 8 crore after three top officials made a trip to that country. It is being kept in the fire station in Sector V apparently because of lack of space in the headquarters.        
	The story of the fire departments inefficiency does not end here. It has more fire engines than drivers. We have 22 vehicles, of which four are out of service. For the rest of the 18 engines, we have 12 drivers. All the other posts are vacant, said an official.

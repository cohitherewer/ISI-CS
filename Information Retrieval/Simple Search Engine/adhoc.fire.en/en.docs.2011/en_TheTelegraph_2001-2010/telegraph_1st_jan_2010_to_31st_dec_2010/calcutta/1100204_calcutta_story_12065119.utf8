	Arunava Chanda is a seasoned quizzer. But for the Class VIII student of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, answering questions on the East India Company and the Raj, surrounded by relics from the era in the Victoria Memorial compound, had a charm of its own.        
	Statues of British rulers like Warren Hastings stared down at us, as we racked our brains for the answers, he said.        
	Arunavas team, along with teams from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, La Martiniere for Girls (LMG), Daulatram Nopany Vidyalaya, Frank Anthony Public School and Ballygunge Government High School made it past the prelims to the finals of a history quiz, titled Incredible India, on January 9.         
	The quiz was a part of an exhibition of paintings from Victoria and Albert Museum (V amp;A), London, on Indian life and landscape by western artists from 1790- 1927, organised by British Council, V amp;A and Victoria Memorial Hall. Conducted by Barry OBrien, the quiz, focussing on the period 1790 to 1947, included seven rounds, on personalities, monuments and events.                           Silver Point School (top) and Stepping Stone montessori (above) celebrated their annual functions on January 9 and 10 and on December 17, respectively. Silver Points theme was the Indian freedom movement. Anjan Dutt was the chief guest at Stepping Stones programme. Pictures by Aranya Sen and Saradindu Chaudhury        
	While LMG easily identified the portrait of Lady Canning, DPS Ruby Park was quick to fill in the clues in the crossword puzzle round, recognising James Hickey as the founding editor of Bengal Gazette and Bal Gangadhar Tilak as the founder of the patriotic Marathi newspaper Kesari.         
	Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan won the quiz, winning a Rs 1000 gift voucher. DPS came second, after giving the winners tough competition till the end. They won a Rs 500 gift voucher. The prizes were given away by actress Churni Ganguly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Revolution a daily event
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Revolution a daily event
										      BOOK BAZAR                        The cover of Dilip Simeons Revolution Highway				                           
	A novel about the Naxalite movement saw academicians Hari Vasudevan, Kavita Punjabi, Supriya Chaudhuri and Sibaji Bandyopadhyay come together at Starmark recently as Dilip Simeon launched his first attempt at fiction, Revolution Highway, published by Penguin.         
	It took Simeon, a former teacher of history at Delhi University, 15 years to write the novel. I was not equipped with the technical knowledge of English literature, so it took a long time to write. Yet fiction was the only way to evoke the truth of the era. As a historian, it was necessary to have a record of those times in a manner that was readable or accessible, said Simeon, who now runs the Aman Trust, an organisation aimed at reducing conflict.        
	Supriya Chaudhuri, who had witnessed the Naxalite movement when she was a student at Presidency College, found Simeons novel satirical. Those times were shrouded in a desperate earnestness. But Simeons book has a satirical reflection as though one cannot look at these young idealists without the absurdity of their position, said Chaudhuri, a professor of English literature at Jadavpur University.         
	Simeon said he wrote it with an affection of distance and it took him 40 years to acquire that distance. Besides, he said many of his comrades from Calcutta were satirical about the movement even then. It was a surreal mixture of horrific and ludicrous things, said Simeon, adding that the satire wasnt a conscious effort.        
	For Sibaji Bandyopadhyay, professor of cultural studies at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, reading the novel was like reliving myself. The year 1968 rang too many bells in my head. There was nothing in the novel that I didnt know.         
	Answering to the criticism that Revolution Highway doesnt raise a question, Simeon said it raises the question of the notion of revolution. Bandyopadhyay said: Here was a fine revolution if we had the trick to see it. It is the trick of seeing it that is important.         
	For revolution is not an episodic moment but a part of everyday experience.

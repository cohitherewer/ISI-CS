The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tolly cheer for colour purple
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tolly cheer for colour purple
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Spot music director Shantanu Moitra, film-maker Aniruddha Roy Choudhury and June among the KKR cheerleaders at Eden on Sunday. (Pabitra Das)                                  
	Team Tolly turned out in modest force to spur the colour purple to victory. Metro records the highlights of the action in the lower-tier of the club house.        
	Juhi vs Katrina        
	Shah Rukh could be sighted only now and then but that didnt prevent June from noticing  and noting  how youthful the KKR boss looked.        
	The actress and her gang didnt get a closer view of King Khan but the arena came alive when word reached that Juhi Chawla was coming down. Police wont allow more people in the Club Lounge as the structure is not certified. So she is coming to meet her guests, said someone.         
	Taking her place beside Usha Uthup, the chirpy KKR co-owner kept her trademark smile on. She had reason to do so with Rahul Dravid departing seconds earlier, leaving the Royal Challengers tottering at 73 for 5.        
	As the crowd chorused Ganpati Bappa/Dhoom dhadaka, Juhi joined in immediately. But when the same group switched to the team anthem Korbo lorbo jeetbo re, Juhi clasped her hands and shouted: Pehle jeetne do, phir chillao bhaiya (Lets win first, then you can shout).         
	When Royal Challengers mascot Katrina Kaifs name was announced over the public address system, someone sang Jee karda bhai jee karda/Tenu jhapiya pawa jee karda (from Singh is Kinng) and got a mock warning from Tollywood producer Manu Malhotra. Try mat karna, bahut pitega (Dont try, youll get beaten up).        
	She is my favourite, too. How can a match (and loyalty to the home team) change that? asked Tollywoods rising star Hiran. Thankfully, Juhi had left by then.        
	Cakewalk vs nail-biter        
	Some may like their T20 cricket going down to the wire but KKRs last-over win left many in the Tolly stand a tad disappointed. They let it drag. We should have won overs ago, grumbled veteran actor Barun Chanda.         
	Purple vs black        
	The change in shirt colour got a thumbs-up from music director Shantanu Moitra. It suits women more, smiled the Aal izz well melody-maker, watching pretty young things in purple.         
	The verdict from jewellery designer Nilanjanaa Chakraborty, sporting a purple tee? This colour is lucky indeed. Its won us two in two.        
	Fan of the match        
	Usha Uthup in her purple and gold kanjeevaram was the cheerleader-in-chief. I also got this made for the IPL, she said, pointing to her trademark bindi in the KKR colours.

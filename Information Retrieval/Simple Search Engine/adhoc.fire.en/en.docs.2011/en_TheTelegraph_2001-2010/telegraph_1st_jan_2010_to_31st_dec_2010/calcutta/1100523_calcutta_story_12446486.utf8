   The British engineered and manipulated the Anglo-Indian community, says Peter R. Moore

	The East India Trading Company was anxious to consolidate its position in India and actively encouraged, with financial incentives, inter-marriage with the indigenous population. This artificially-created hybrid, English-speaking community was encouraged by the myth of kinship to consider itself the British foot-print in India, which could be relied on implicitly to govern its ever-increasing territories and to command its native armies. 
    
	This community that would be related by blood to Indians, speak their language fluently, accustomed to local climatic conditions, resistant to local illnesses and infections, would regard India as their home and yet be unshakeably loyal to their British origin.
    
	From 1639 to 1791 the community prospered and its members held the highest positions in the service of the Company. The princely houses of the Rajput, Maratha and Jat martial races of India were allied through marriage with the European officers of the Company  a proud heritage indeed, one would think.
    
	In 1791 the descendants of slaves and mixed-race mulattoes in the distant Caribbean island of Haiti rebelled against French colonial rule there. This alarmed the East India Company, which feared that East Indians would mutiny similarly and join the natives. Lord Valentia proposed a law requiring every East Indian father to send his children to England, whence they should not be allowed to return in any capacity. Orders were issued to exclude Anglo-Indians from positions of importance.
    
	The real reason was the directors vested interests. All appointments to the Companys service lay within the gift of the directors in London. Increasingly, the relatives of employees in India were being locally appointed without reference to Leadenhall Street, thereby reducing opportunities for the directors to exercise patronage. 
    
	It led to measures calculated to politically, economically and socially repress the community by forbidding overseas travel for studies and barring them from employment. The resultant inequities led to chronic unemployment, economic disablement and political disempowerment of a large section of the community. 
          
	The Companys rule ended upon Queen Victorias proclamation as Empress and India came under the direct rule of the Crown. Anglo-Indians who paid a heavy price for their mixed ancestry were recognised by Lord Canning whose reconstruction of government included affirmative action for the community in the expanding administrative infrastructure. The result was that, up to Independence, Anglo-Indians virtually ran British India, especially its vital communications and transportation services and myriad other bureaucratic functions.
    
	Anglo-Indians volunteered to serve in the British and Indian armies in every great war in proportionately higher numbers than comparative communities. Lieutenant-General George Fletcher MacMunn wrote: This mixed race, which gets so complicated as the generations roll on, is a serious problem, for the name Anglo-Indian covers so many varying elements and stages, but its military record is by no means negligible and the memorials for the World War in the schools of India, mostly in the hills to which such boys go, contain just as sad, and in proportion, just as numerous tablets to young lives lost as do the schools in England.

	Post-1857, volunteer military units were raised by the recruitment of country-born, domiciled Europeans, or Eurasians of military age, the bulk of them employed in Indias railways. Many rationalised their loyalty to Britain upon the reality of their mainly British or European patrilineal ethnic descent and a sentimentally idealistic, if unappreciated, notion that they were answering the Call of the Blood in the mother-countrys hour of need. Being identified with the ruling class was also a survival factor. 
    
	Nearer the truth was their underlying fear of a repetition of the brutal slaughter at Indian hands during the Sepoy Mutiny; an episode ignored by British and Indian historians, each for their own reasons. By the late 1930s, the Auxiliary Force (India) was a largely Anglo-Indian affair and, in 1947, their strength was almost 30,000.
    
	As history unfolded, Britains betrayal of this cynically engineered community became increasingly unveiled. As their usefulness receded, they were increasingly denied equality, the superior services were barred to them and they were abandoned to their own fate.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday expressed the need for a high-powered committee to monitor the implementation of the midday meal scheme in the 1,201 primary and junior schools in Calcutta.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice B. Bhattacharya said: The state government should constitute a high-powered committee to monitor activities related to the supply of midday meals.        
	The bench held that the committee should file a report to the government every three-four months on the progress of the midday meal scheme. The court gave the state two weeks to declare its stand on the proposal.        
	The state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had filed affidavits in the court blaming lack of infrastructure for not being able to implement the scheme properly. Both had admitted that the meals were not being distributed properly in 70 per cent of the free primary and junior schools in Calcutta.         
	The lawyers appearing for the state and the CMC said their clients were trying to build infrastructure.        
	Education Chapter, an NGO working with schoolchildren, had moved the court alleging that the government and the civic body had failed to implement the programme.

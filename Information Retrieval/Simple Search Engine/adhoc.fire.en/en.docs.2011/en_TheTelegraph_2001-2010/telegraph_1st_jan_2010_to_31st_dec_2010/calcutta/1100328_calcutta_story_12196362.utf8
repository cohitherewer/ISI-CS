                                The Scottish cemetery in Calcutta and George lsquo;Robin rsquo; Anderson                           
	It is not possible to read the inscriptions on the broken and decaying markers at the 185-year-old Scottish cemetery just south of Park Street. But as I was leaving, I met a couple from abroad whose story was heartwarming.         
	In her effort to find out where her 16-year-old younger brother had been buried, a 94-year-old Scotswoman, Nora Duncan, had sent the two to Calcutta. Duncan and her family did not know what had happened to the remains of George Robin Anderson, a Merchant marine cadet on the S.S. Benalder, who died in 1936 while unloading goods at Calcutta Port.         
	On hearing of the Scottish Calcutta Heritage Trust set up last year by Scottish Lord Charles Bruce, to survey, record and restore the Scottish cemetery, Duncan wrote to him. She was soon informed that Robin had been buried here.         
	Duncan then commandeered her great nephew Roderick Dale and his wife Karen to come to Calcutta to find the grave, ensure that it was properly marked and offer prayers on behalf of the family. As we gathered around the grave, Rev. Andrew Simick of St Pauls and St Andrews churches, offered prayers and gratitude that the lost had been found.         
	The Scottish cemetery is but one of many historical properties in Calcutta that should be treasured and restored, not just for Calcuttans, but for the world.                           John A.

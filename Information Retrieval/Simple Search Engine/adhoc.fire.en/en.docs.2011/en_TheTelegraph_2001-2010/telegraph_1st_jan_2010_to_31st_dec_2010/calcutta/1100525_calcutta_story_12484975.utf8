                      Summer screenings                    Summer in Calcutta does not compare to summer in Germany. But movie lovers in town now have a chance to beat the heat for a while and experience the far less torrid summer of Europe, by watching the ongoing screenings of films on the summer season. To be screened today is Sommer vorn Balkon (Summer in Berlin; 5 pm) and Im Juli (a still from it appears here; 7 pm). Directed by Faith Akin, Im Juli is about Daniel, a straight-laced physics teacher who never does anything unusual. His students thumb their noses at him, the barkeepers ignore him in all of the hip joints he frequents and even his permanently spaced-out neighbour has a better social life. But his drab existence as a teacher changes all of a sudden when he falls head-over-heels in love with Melek, a beautiful girl, and spontaneously decides to follow her to Istanbul. Daniel sets out for the long trip from Hamburg to Istanbul together with his crazy friend July, who sells jewellery and has always secretly worshipped Daniel. On this wild odyssey through south-eastern Europe, he discovers a new self. He is beaten up, seduced, robbed and busted by Turkish border guards. Yet Daniel learns to fight for his happiness. After his long journey he finally realises that the laws of physics do not always apply in the real world.

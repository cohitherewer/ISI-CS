The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Play by kids for adults
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Play by kids for adults
										      YOUNG METRO                            Participants at a two-day inter-school fest organised by Don Bosco, Liluah, on July 16 and 17. Fourteen schools participated in the junior events, while 12 battled for the top honours in the senior school section. But ultimately, the hosts were the overall winners in both the sections. Bosco Strings and Bosco Grooves were the most eagerly awaited  events.   The final day ended with a guest performance by the band Orchids.

	They were all child actors starring in a play meant ideally for adults. Portraying juvenile delinquents with elan, these children often made the audience wonder if it is better to shield children from crime or to make them aware of the darker sides of the world.         
	The play in question was Aal Izz Well, written and directed by Raja Bhattacharya. It was presented by Subham  a child-theatre group based in Beadon Street  at Minerva Theatre at 6.30 pm on July 9. Its central theme revolved round the plight of young offenders in correctional homes.        
	The actors were much appreciated for their spontaneity. Amidst minimal but colourful setting, they enacted the lives of Bikash, Banku, Sanjay and other residents of the correctional home.        
	The dialogues, interspersed with songs, helped delve into the minds of these young offenders who craved for a normal life, a loving home, regular school and a secure community.         
	Please stop and think who is responsible for the way we are. Couldnt you be good and let us be good too? the child-choir asked the audience.         
	Bhattacharya claims his characters are based on actual case studies. Instead of trying to help these children, the correctional homes makes them feel worse. The children live here in total neglect and are often the victims of exploitation, he said.         
	I had to convince the children and their guardians that the role play would not adversely affect them, he said.         
	But schoolteacher Sovona Banerjee, one of the audience, was not convinced. It is difficult for children to distinguish between real life and fiction. They identify with characters and get upset. I saw a child in the audience react sadly to a dead person, she said.

	A champion coach was at The Heritage last week to share his bag of cricket tricks with champions in the making.        
	Students of the host school and National High School, which won the TTIS Crickzz Tournament in April, turned up in numbers to learn all they could from Dav Whatmore, the former World Cup winning coach of Sri Lanka and the current coach of Kolkata Knight Riders, when he came calling on July 14.         
	The day started with the student cricketers interacting with Whatmore, who had represented Australia in seven Tests and an ODI before honing the skills of the likes of Sanath Jayasuriya and Aravinda DSilva.        
	We had net practice for over an hour. Whatmore was very encouraging and ready with advice and suggestions. He corrected my batting technique, said Abhradeep Ghosh, who was the acting captain and opening batsman of National High School in its final match against St Lawrence High School in the TTIS tournament.        
	Whatmore told us anecdotes from his cricket career. He asked us to persevere with the sport despite the pressure of studies, added Abhradeep.        
	Amit Prasad, another member of the National High School squad, said: Whatmore advised me not to bend my shoulder while batting as that would make it difficult from me to tackle in-swing balls. The coach also asked the teenager to watch clips of cricket greats to improve his technique.

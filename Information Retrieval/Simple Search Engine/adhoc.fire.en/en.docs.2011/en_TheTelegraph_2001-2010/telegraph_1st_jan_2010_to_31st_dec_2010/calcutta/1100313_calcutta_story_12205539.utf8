The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Joka tweak to placements 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Joka tweak to placements 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, will switch to a new placement system from the next session for its largest-ever batch.        
	The number of students to be sent for summer internships next year will swell to 462  286 students took part in the final placements this year  so more companies would have to be brought to the Joka campus and the process is likely to stretch for more than a week.        
	IIM Ahmedabad, where student intake has also gone up, tried a new model this session, under which the placements were done on weekends for over a month.        
	We are working on a new format but have still not finalised it. We expect to introduce the format during the summer internship placements of the 2010-12 batch, said an IIM Calcutta source.         
	According to him, improvement in the economic situation  reflected in better deals for budding managers this season will make the experiment with a new model easier.         
	Unlike last year, when the institute struggled to place the batch, this years final placements were completed in five days and the compensation packages were back to the pre-downturn heights. The average annual domestic salary was Rs 15.32 lakh, up from last years low of Rs 12.7 lakh. Though it was Rs 16.4 lakh in 2007-08, we think this years average is good enough, said a placement cell representative.         
	Finance remained a preferred sector with 37 per cent of the 286 students who sat for the placements opting for it.        
	We have had a very good response from the Slot Zero finance companies. Five Rs 1-crore-plus offers were made by international banks, said Prafulla Agnihotri, the chairman (placements) of the institute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU examiners feel heat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU examiners feel heat
  - Blueprint to ensure results on time         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	College teachers who refuse to evaluate answer scripts of Calcutta University (CU)s undergraduate examinations or delay submission of corrected scripts will face disciplinary action from this year.         
	The university authorities have directed affiliated colleges to take prompt action against errant examiners in a bid to avoid delay in publication of results.        
	CU officials will keep in touch with the heads of 140-odd affiliated colleges during the exam season to ensure teachers are penalised for laxity.         
	Till last year, college principals were not always kept in the loop when teachers refused to examine answer scripts or submitted results late.         
	Under the new plan, the CU authorities will inform the principals as soon as a teacher refuses to check answer scripts. The governing bodies of the college concerned will record the teachers refusal and hold an emergency meeting to examine the grounds of refusal.        
	The governing body will submit a report to CU. If the university finds the reasons cited by the teacher unsatisfactory, the college will have to take prompt and appropriate action against him, said a source in the universitys undergraduate council.        
	The teacher will first be served a showcause notice but the college authorities can also defer his increment for neglecting exam-related duties. The same procedure and penalty are applicable if a teacher fails to submit corrected answer scripts in time without a valid reason.        
	Teachers will not be allowed to neglect examination-related duties. Prompt action will be taken against them if they cite a vague reason for not performing their duties properly, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of CU.        
	The BA, BSc and BCom Part-III exams have started while the Part-I and Part-II exams are slated to begin this month. Nearly 3.5 lakh students will write the universitys undergraduate exams this year.

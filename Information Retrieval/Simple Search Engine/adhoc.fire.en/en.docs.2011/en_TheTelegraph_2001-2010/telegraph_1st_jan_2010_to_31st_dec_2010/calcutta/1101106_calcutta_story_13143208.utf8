The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Executive held for rape
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Executive held for rape
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A marketing executive of a private company was arrested on Friday on the charges of raping a 25-year-old married woman and threatening to upload on the Internet her pictures he had taken on his cellphone.        
	Police picked up Prabir Dey, who is married, from his home in Barasats Hridaypur. He has been remanded in jail custody till November 18.        
	Dey, in his mid-30s, has been slapped with rape, cheating and impersonation charges. We have seized his cellphone. He has also been booked under the Information Technology (IT) Act as he had committed a crime using his cellphone, said an officer of Barrackpore police station.        
	Dey had allegedly been having an affair with the woman over the past two years. He promised to marry her if she was ready for a divorce, said an officer.        
	Trouble started when the woman came to know that Dey was married. She told him that she would tell his wife about their affair. Dey then threatened to upload her pictures, which he had taken on the sly with his cellphone, on the Internet if she opened her mouth, the officer added.        
	The woman lodged a police complaint when Dey demanded money from her, saying he would show the pictures to her family members if she did not pay up.        
	This is a serious offence and we are conducting a probe. If the accused is found guilty under the IT Act, he could be imprisoned for up to three years and/or slapped with a fine of up to Rs 2 lakh, said an officer. Rape is punishable with a jail term of not less than 10 years.                                      
	Proving the accused guilty under the IT Act should not be difficult because a number of SMSes sent by Dey are stored in the womans phone.

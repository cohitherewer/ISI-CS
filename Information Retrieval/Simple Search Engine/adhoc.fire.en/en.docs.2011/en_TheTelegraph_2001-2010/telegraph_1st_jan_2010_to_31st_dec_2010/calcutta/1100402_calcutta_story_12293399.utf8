                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Errant son shames father

	Head teacher Sasanka Shekhar Ray spent his last day in school soaking in the adulation and his first day in retirement ruing the unwanted attention coming his way as Debojyoti Rays father.        
	I feel ashamed to be known as his father, said Ray, who retired from service on Wednesday.        
	The Garia resident heard the news of Debojyotis arrest for his alleged involvement in the Ballygunge Circular Road shooting while watching TV on Thursday afternoon. I last saw him 10 days ago but how would I know that police were looking for him? He wasnt close to me anyway, he told Metro.        
	Ray said he felt sorry for his wife, who has broken down completely.        
	According to the retired teacher, Debojyoti was an intelligent boy who fell into bad company and gradually distanced himself from the family. We have a physically challenged daughter who is four years younger than him. We needed to give her extra attention, which he never tried to understand, revealed Ray.        
	But didnt he try to reason with his son? I sent him for counselling sessions with a doctor but that didnt work. For him, his friends were everything, said Ray.

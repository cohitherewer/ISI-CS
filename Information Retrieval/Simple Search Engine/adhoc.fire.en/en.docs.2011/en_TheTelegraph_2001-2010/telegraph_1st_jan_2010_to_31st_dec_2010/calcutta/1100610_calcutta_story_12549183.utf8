	A maximum temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius and a dysfunctional air-conditioning system notwithstanding, children of Kidzee and Genius Kids put up a brave performance at Madhusudan Mancha on Monday at the fifth annual programme of dance school Aaddya Kala Tirtham and NGO Prayas, organised by dancer Avirup Sengupta.        
	The students of the Garia, Santoshpur, Kasba and New Alipore branches of preschool Kidzee and play school Genius Kids also staged various dance numbers.         
	We were told only late in the afternoon that the AC was not working. We even had to cut short some of the events as the heat was too much for the kids, said Sengupta.         
	Though cries of the children were audible from the wings, they enjoyed themselves once on stage.        
	Clad in bright costumes, they swayed to Phule phule dhole dhole, Itni shakti humey dena data and Nachle ve from the film Ta Ra Rum Pum, the sweltering heat forgotten, though some kept trying to rush from the stage directly into the arms of parents.                     Youngsters participate in a dance programme organised by the Dhiman Sankar Presentation Group to celebrate the birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam at Gyan Manch on June 3.

	It was an effort to keep them on stage. I wish the event took place after the weather cooled down a bit, said a harassed parent.        
	Sengupta, with his troupe from Prayas, staged four dance numbers, including an Odissi dance recital performed to Dheem ta dhare from the film Thakshak and a fusion of Odissi steps to the music of Celine Dions My heart will go on.         
	Prayas, started by Sengupta, grooms underprivileged children in Odissi, Manipuri and neo-classical dance forms, to help them take it up as a career.         
	We put in over two months practice for todays programme. We could have performed so much better had the hall been cooler, said Chandra Mondol, a Class X student and a performer from Prayas, who wants to take up dance as a career.         
	The guests included Odissi dance exponent Alokananda Roy, fashion designer Agnimitra Paul and industrialist Sanjay Budhia.

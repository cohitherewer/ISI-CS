The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Immersion show better but river bleeds
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Immersion show better but river bleeds
          JAYANTA BASU                                                   
	One river, 1,500-plus idols  Dashami has again taken a heavy toll on the Hooghly, turning it into a sea of flotsam in the span of a night.         
	The effort to adhere to the high court-endorsed immersion rules may have been better than in previous years, but the sheer volume of waste dumped into the waters between late afternoon and midnight on Sunday ensured that the river didnt make for a pretty sight the morning after.        
	Metro accompanied a West Bengal Pollution Control Board team to 11 ghats on either side of the river to come up with a top eight on the basis of immersion load and pollution-control performance this Dashami.               
	RAMKRISHNAPUR GHAT         
	Plus: The highest number of immersions in Howrah took place at this ghat but it was also the cleanest and the best managed one. The arrangements were adequate and functional with workers and local residents working in tandem to keep the immersions hassle and pollution-free.         
	After each immersion, the idol would be dragged  many of them had ropes tied around the middle  to the shore for workers to dismantle them and neatly keep the structures in a heap by the side of the ghat.         
	Minus: The only sore point was hay floating in the river. Ragpickers looking for recyclable material were to blame for this. Next year we will try to take care of this problem as well, promised Debasish Ghosh, mayoral council member in the Howrah civic body.         
	Rating: First         
	BABUGHAT         
	Plus: One of the two Dashami destinations that bore the bulk of the immersion load, Babughat had by far the most elaborate arrangements on Sunday. Boats belonging to various agencies, including police and Calcutta Port Trust, patrolled the waters as immersion got underway. Vats were placed at all the immersion points for flowers and other puja accessories to be dumped before the idols were sunk.        
	A contingent of Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Port Trust workers was deployed at the ghat with mayoral council member Debasish Kumar overseeing the arrangements. Local boys would jump into the water after every immersion to take away the recyclable materials from the idols, while a thick rope encircled the immersion zone to prevent the immersed structures from floating away.         
	Minus: Fragments of idols floating in the waters accumulated by the side of the ghat as the evening wore on, not only dirtying the river but also reducing the space for immersion. Lack of co-ordination between various agencies meant that the civic squad didnt know what the Port Trust team was doing and vice-versa. Green activist Subhash Dutta, who was supervising the Port Trust workers, blamed the police for some of the floating idols drifting away. They cut the ropes without consulting anyone, he complained.         
	Ragpickers enjoyed a free run, littering the ghat with police looking the other way.        
	Rating: Second                 
	GWALIOR GHAT         
	Plus: As many as 533 sets of idols were immersed here on Sunday night, more than at Babughat. The necessary arrangements were in place  security, designated immersion points, vats for dumping puja paraphernalia and plenty of workers and volunteers.         
	Minus: As in Babughat, the arrangements didnt quite translate into adherence to the immersion norms. The bamboo frames of the idols were found floating away like driftwood even as the queue for immersion grew longer.         
	Rating: Third               
	DOI GHAT         
	Plus: The waters looked relatively clean at this ghat near Watgunge with the number of immersions being much lower than at other destinations. Security was strict despite the low activity. Residents of the area were seen helping clear the debris from the waters.        
	Minus: Many bamboo structures floated away during high tide with ropes not being used to earmark the immersion zone.         
	Rating: Fourth               
	Kumartuli Ghat        
	Plus: The location of the ghat  close to the idol-makers hub  means there is a ready market for recyclable parts. With no shortage of divers to remove the immersed idols, the process of cleaning the waters after immersion was quick for the most part. The low immersion load also helped.         
	Minus: Lack of proper arrangements for immersion.         
	Rating: Fourth               
	Bagbazar Ghat         
	Plus: All idols were first tied with ropes so that they could be easily dragged to shore. Proximity to Kumartuli and the presence of the recyclable bounty brigade ensured a quick clean-up.         
	Minus: Very little official initiative to make immersion hassle-free.         
	Rating: Fifth               
	Nimtala Ghat         
	Plus: The effort to adhere to norms was visible, though the CPM and Trinamul help booths did turn it into a battle of one-upmanship rather than a genuine attempt to check pollution. The number of immersions was much less than at other large ghats.        
	Minus: Parts of idols and bamboo structures drifted away with lack of co-ordination between workers engaged for keeping the waters clean.         
	Rating: Sixth               
	TELKAL GHAT         
	Plus: Low immersion load with mainly idols of family pujas being brought for immersion.         
	Minus: Almost no arrangement was made with even the lighting being inadequate. One idol was taken in a boat and immersed midstream, making it almost impossible to recover the structure. This is apparently the trend in many smaller ghats.         
	Rating: Seventh              
	SHIBPUR GHAT         
	Plus: There was not much to recommend this Howrah ghat except the presence of local divers who scoured the waters for recyclable puja paraphernalia, keeping the waters cleaner than they would otherwise have been.         
	Minus: For around 100 metres, the river itself looked like a floating garbage vat. Garlands and other puja materials floated in the water along with the idols before settling at the base of the jetty. The PCB team said the structures left in a heap could float downstream during low tide, polluting a larger stretch of the river.         
	A country boat with a lone policeman was the only face of river security.         
	Rating: Eighth               
	SARADAMANI GHAT         
	Plus: Nothing         
	Minus: Everything. The river resembled a waste dump.         
	Rating: Eighth               
	RATANBABUR GHAT         
	Plus: Nothing         
	Minus: Everything.         
	Rating: Eighth

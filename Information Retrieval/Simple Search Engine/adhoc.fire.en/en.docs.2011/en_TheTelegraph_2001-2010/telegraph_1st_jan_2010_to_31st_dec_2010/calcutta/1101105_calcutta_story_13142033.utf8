The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | High-rise lesson on how to fight fire
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      High-rise lesson on how to fight fire
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          The shed on the 15th floor of City High that caught fire on Wednesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	City High could avert death and damage and set an example for other high-rise buildings on Wednesday night because basic firefighting arrangements were in place at the Prince Anwar Shah Road address.         
	An open flame, possibly a cracker or a diya, had set alight a fibre shed covering an electrical duct on the 15th floor of the apartment block. Within minutes, thick black smoke spread to rest of the building, sparking a stampede-like situation as hundreds of residents tried to get out.        
	The flames would have left a trail of destruction had firefighting facilities not been there, according to the firemen who put out the blaze using equipment stocked by the residents association.        
	The firefighters could immediately draw water from the buildings reservoir after reaching the source of the flames. We did not even have to use water from the tanks of the fire engines, said Bishnu Prasad Dhar, the in-charge of Kalighat fire station who led the firefighting operation on Wednesday night.        
	The water jets of the fire department only reach up to 40ft. A sky-lift can take as long as 25 minutes to start working. Carbon monoxide was spreading fast. Had there been a delay in fighting the flames, the consequences could have been disastrous, said Dhar.         
	The only casualty at City High on Wednesday night was the fractured ankle of an elderly resident who had slipped on a wet staircase.         
	The apartment block was a part of The Telegraphs Festival of Joy which stresses on fire-safety measures to ensure a safe, accident-free Durga Puja.         
	In a city that has witnessed Nandram and Stephen Court fires, City High sets a good example. Other high-rise buildings should emulate it, said a senior fire department officer.         
	Fire safety is high on the priority list of City High, whose residents include actress and MP Satabdi Roy. The fire drills and regular replenishing of the water reservoir paid dividends on Wednesday night.         
	We have a water reservoir of 250,000 litres that is always full. There are fire alarms, smoke sensors and sprinklers on all the floors, said Pradip Kumar Roy, the president of the City High Owners Welfare Association.         
	The building has 180 apartments out of which 140 are occupied. The residents body spends about Rs 3 lakh annually on maintaining the equipment and refilling the extinguishers.        
	The nozzle gates on the half landing of the floors can be used to draw water from the reservoir if there is a fire, said Roy.         
	There are, however, hurdles that the residents with their best intentions cannot overcome. A common passage is being used for parking. The front part of the complex has been sold to establishments. If there is a big fire, the fire engines will not be able to access a major portion of the building, said a resident.

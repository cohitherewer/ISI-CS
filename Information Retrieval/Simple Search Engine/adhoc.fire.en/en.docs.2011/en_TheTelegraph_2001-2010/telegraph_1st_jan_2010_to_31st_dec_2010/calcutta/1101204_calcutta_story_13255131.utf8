                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fire scan on   seat of power
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The state government has finally decided to put its house in order while it continues with the crackdown on fire-prone buildings.        
	A high-level meeting on Friday decided to revamp the fire-safety measures and practices at Writers Buildings, dubbed a tinderbox by the fire minister himself.        
	The meeting was chaired by chief secretary Samar Ghosh and attended by fire minister Pratim Chatterjee, home secretary G.D. Gautama, police commissioner G.M. Chakrabarti and senior officials of the public works and fire departments.        
	The seat of power has seen at least nine big and small fires since August 2008. The biggest one in recent memory broke out on August 7, 2008, in the offices of the fire and municipal affairs departments.        
	The latest fire was reported on November 18, following a short-circuit in the air-conditioner in the room of Rinchem Tempo, the women and child welfare secretary.        
	The meeting decided that a team comprising representatives of the fire department, PWD and BSNL would inspect all blocks. A mock drill will be carried out on December 18 to check the efficacy of the existing measures and evaluate the performance of the firemen, police and PWD staff.        
	It will be the duty of the employees to ensure that all fans, lights, computers and air-conditioners are switched off before they leave office.        
	A team consisting of fire, PWD and police representatives will inspect all departments after office hours.         
	If the team finds a light or a computer on, the employee responsible for turning it off will be reported against the next day, said an official who attended the meeting.        
	Its dangerous to keep electrical gadgets running in empty offices, the official pointed out.        
	Fire minister Chatterjee said the wires would be replaced and sensors and alarms for smoke and fire installed in every room.        
	What if the chief minister is found smoking inside his office? I cannot comment on that. You better ask the chief minister, said Chatterjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salute a city that cares and shares enough to build a giant book wall
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Salute a city that cares and shares enough to build a giant book wall
										      
	Day 5   328,000 (and counting!)                          
	 Sumit Agarwal, 19, struggled to climb the City Centre steps but he just had to add his share of books (65 of them) to the wall. I dont consider my difficulty in walking a problem. So many kids dont have access to education. That is a much greater problem, said the boy with cerebral palsy.        
	 Souhardya Ganguly, a Class IV student, who came to give to the cause of education, got a lot more in return. Just as he parted with his favourite Sherlock Holmes and poetry books, he discovered an unread Enid Blyton Sea of Adventure in the book wall. He promptly picked it up and sat down to read. I will finish it here, he declared.        
	The Aviva Great Wall of Education, presented by The Telegraph, brought out the best in Calcutta over five days  a Calcutta that cares, a Calcutta that shares  and so the book count at the City Centre (Salt Lake) soared past the Delhi mark of 123,000 and towards a 400,000 high.        
	By the time the wall-building endeavour was halted on Sunday evening, the count read 328,000 with books still being collated and counted.        
	The spirit of giving was the clear winner. The spirit that drew three generations of a family, Kamala Chakraborty, 72, daughter-in-law Krishna, 44, and granddaughter Piyali, 14, to the wall with 150 books.        
	The spirit that saw M.C. Saha come with 208 primary level books, register them and slip away, even refusing to be photographed. He was there for the cause, not the cameras.        
	Or Prasanto Roy, 50, who had no qualms bargaining for a cause, convincing shops on College Street to sell him scores of primary-level books at a subsidised rate.        
	The spirit was so infectious that Raima Sen, a star guest on Day 1, sent 60 books on Day 3 and another 90-odd on Day 4. My parents are very protective about their books but they have almost emptied our bookshelf for the wall, said the actress.        
	The spirit of the Street to School movement even inspired a bunch of underprivileged children, from the NGO Alok Pathshala, to show up with their old school books. We have come to help, said the kids who know about the power of words.        
	Sunday saw the city descend on City Centre with carrybags, suitcases, duffel bags and cartons full of books, braving both swelter and shower. Swapnil Bose, 3, and his cousin Anweshan, 6, were there from Naktala to give away their storybooks and textbooks. So what if its raining? This is the last day and we had to give our books, said Anweshan.        
	A.K. Sahu, 72, was there with 150-odd books. Most of them belong to my grandchildren but some are my engineering books, smiled Sahu, leaning on his walking stick.        
	No wonder Vishal Gupta, the director of marketing, Aviva India, said at the closing ceremony: I would like to give a big hand to all the citizens of Calcutta.... It is more than a number. The figure is symbolic of the fact that people have come all out for a cause.        
	No wonder Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of Calcutta University and chief guest at the closing ceremony, praised Calcuttans for their commitment and said: This initiative will contribute to providing access to education to everyone.        
	The books collected over the five days will be distributed among children who cannot afford to buy books by the Paschim Banga Sarva Shiksha Mission, Save the Children India and CINI Asha.        
	Among the schools, South Point School was the largest contributor with 15,533 books, followed by Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, with 10,658.        
	But the single Snow White book placed by Shivika Goenka, 6, was just as valuable. I have read this book many times, now some other baby can read it, she said.        
	There were stars galore on all five days, but what shone the brightest was the determination to make a difference, however small. From Prithviraj Laha, for instance. The 14-year-old student, paralysed waist down, was carried to the wall by his father. If I can go to school in a wheelchair why cant I come here to give books? said Prithviraj. This should be an annual event so that I can keep giving books to the children who need it most.  
	calcutta count gives little champs a reason to smile            
	 ldquo;Let rsquo;s make the great wall of education the strongest wall, rdquo; urged actress Rituparna Sengupta at the closing ceremony on Sunday evening. ldquo;We discard a lot of books randomly, but by contributing to this cause we can bring a smile on the face of so many kids. I have brought my son along hellip; he has so many books, he needs to know that there are many who don rsquo;t have any and he needs to share, rdquo; she said, adding young Ankan rsquo;s textbooks, encyclopaedias, storybooks and comics to the wall.               
	Two-year-old twins Vanshika and Varnika Bihani were all smiles as they added five books to the wall towering over them on Sunday.                     
	Swastika Mukherjee, Class V, Carmel HS. The Tolly actress parted with a Better English textbook from her childhood among 16 books belonging to her daughter and her. ldquo;Though I am very attached to these books, I am gladly parting with them as they will reach children who really need it, rdquo; she said, before writing about the wall on her Facebook wall: ldquo;... great wall of education... feels super good 2 b a part of it... Kolkata rocks! rdquo;                
	Writer Amit Chaudhuri donated Journeys in the Night, a collection of short stories. ldquo;This initiative has taken the books out of their fixed location mdash; libraries and bookshops. This should move to different parts of the city and map the city through books, rdquo; he said.                   
	Nabaneeta Dev Sen came with copies of her Chhotoder Golpo Songroho. ldquo;I am not surprised at Calcutta rsquo;s count hellip;. Calcutta is interested in books and in sharing them with others, rdquo; said the writer, accompanied by social worker Sundeep Bhutoria, who donated a yet-to-be released Bengali edition of Harry Potter and some Sunil Gangopadhyay books.                
	Kantha revivalist Shamlu Dudeja came with 800 books, of which 200 were her own copies of the New Countdown Series. ldquo;This is my gift to the children on Teachers rsquo; Day, rdquo; she said.         DAY 1
  Inaugurated by governor M.K. Narayanan and Mithun Chakraborty, the Aviva Great Wall of Education, presented by The Telegraph, saw Raima Sen and many a concerned Calcuttan donate books for children in need at City Centre (Salt Lake).

  Barry O rsquo;Brien and students of Loreto House set the tone. Babul Supriyo dropped by. Tin Can staged a street play, Jaago, on the need for education. The wall grew.
  Book Count: 58,100  DAY 3
  The trickle turned into a steady stream. Sunil Gangopadhyay, Roopa Ganguly and Bertie Da Silva spent time at the wall. Bagbazar Multipurpose Girls rsquo; School presented a skit.
  Book Count: 100,700  DAY 4
  The stream became a deluge as the city stepped up to beat Delhi rsquo;s book count of 123,000. June, Kiran Uttam Ghosh and Purbayan Chatterjee did their bit. Taki House Multipurpose School for Boys staged a play.
  Book Count: 178,600   DAY 5
  It was pouring books as the wall witnessed   final-day frenzy. Amit Chaudhuri and Nabaneeta Dev Sen, Swastika Mukherjee, kantha revivalist Shamlu Dudeja, Nilaanjana Chakraborty and Rituparna Sengupta showed up. The curtains were brought down by CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.
  Book Count: 328,000          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE, JHINUK MAZUMDAR AND MADHURIMA CHATTERJEE

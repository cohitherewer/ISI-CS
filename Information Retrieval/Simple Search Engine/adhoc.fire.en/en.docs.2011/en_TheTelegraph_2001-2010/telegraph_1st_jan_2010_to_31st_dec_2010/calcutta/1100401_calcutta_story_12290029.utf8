                      Melifluous music beyond borders                    I heard an Angel singing/ When the day was springing, / Mercy, Pity, Peace/ Is the worlds release.        Aldous Huxley had once said, After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music. Music is the undisputed monarch that establishes its reign with its magic sepulture. It cuts across all barriers and establishes its supremacy. In these turbulant times, we need the inspiration of music to help fulfill the dream of world peace. As often said, a pamphlet, no matter how good, is never read more than once. But a song is learned by heart and repeated over and over. To celebrate the cross border peace and charm of music, Broadcast Worldwide hosts a musical concert, Tonight Together. The show brings together one of the most talismanic and venerated pop singer, Najam Sheraz from Pakistan, a known pop singer and one of the upcoming voices in Bollywood. Along with him, the scintillating Indian singer Usha Utthup and the most elegant Banglasedhi singer, Elita Karim, are all set to mesmerize the audience with their music that transcends the barriers of borders.

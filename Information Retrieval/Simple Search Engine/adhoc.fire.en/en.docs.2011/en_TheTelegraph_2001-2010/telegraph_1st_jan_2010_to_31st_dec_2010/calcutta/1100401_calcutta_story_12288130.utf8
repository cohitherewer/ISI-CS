                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Power for Stephen Court
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Power supply is set to be restored to parts of Stephen Court on Thursday after CESC installed two transformers in the building, replacing three old and defunct ones.        
	The transformers installed on Wednesday will provide electricity to blocks III and IV. Another transformer is likely to be set up on Thursday but electricity to blocks I and II would not be restored soon, said a CESC official.        
	Once offices and flats are provided power, we would inspect the load capacity and the electricity consumption by each. Flat owners will be issued specific guidelines after that, added the official.        
	On Wednesday, civic workers demolished portions on the fourth and fifth floors of Block II that were in danger of collapsing.         
	Two residents, Devraj Sharma and Mahendra Golcha, moved the high court during the day seeking an order allowing more than two people to enter the ravaged building for more than 20 minutes to retrieve valuables. The judge would hear the matter on Thursday morning.        
	Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy handed over copies of the original building plan and the assessment register of Stephen Court to the city polices detective department on Wednesday.        
	Scientists conducting DNA tests on Wednesday said their work was being hampered by poor quality of samples, shortage of reagents and inadequate information provided with blood samples drawn from victims relatives.        
	Victim Bhagyashree Dhalis body was handed over to her family members on Wednesday.

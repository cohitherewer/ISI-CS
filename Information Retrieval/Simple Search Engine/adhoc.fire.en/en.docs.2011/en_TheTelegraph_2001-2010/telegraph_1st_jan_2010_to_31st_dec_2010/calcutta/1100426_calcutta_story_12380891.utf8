The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Iqbal, playing at a classroom near you
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Iqbal, playing at a classroom near you
  - Schools screen movies with message for children to take the cue about life and times          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                                  
	 Iqbal. Showtime: 10.30am. Playing at: The Heritage School        
	 Gone with the Wind. Showtime: Noon. Playing at: Modern High School for Girls        
	 Sarkar Raj. Showtime: 2pm. Playing at: Lakshmipat Singhania Academy              
	Children have a favourite new tutor in class with films being used on a regular basis to teach, groom or sensitise students and also encourage innovative thinking.        
	So if Heritage is screening Iqbal to teach students about setting and achieving goals, Modern High girls are learning about the American Civil War from Gone With the Wind and Lakshmipat Singhania is using Sarkar Raj to explain the socio-political effects of a dam construction (see box).        
	We believe in innovation in classroom teaching. Retention is higher among children in case of a visual medium. Sometimes, the kids themselves suggest films that are relevant to a particular lesson, says Meena Kak, the principal of Lakshmipat Singhania. The biology teacher, for instance, screened Anand in a class on cancer.         
	For teachers struggling to keep students interested in drab textbooks, a topical film is just what the doctor ordered. Films are an effective medium to communicate lessons to children because sometimes textbooks are so drab, admits Devi Kar, the principal of Modern High.        
	But the idea is not to simply run a film in the classroom, points out Kar, but to pick particular portions. Teachers must plan their lessons in advance. Else the students will lose sight of the purpose of the screening.        
	At Calcutta International School, films are being used to hone creative skills and for counselling. We show them certain movie clippings and then ask them to write the conclusion as they would interpret it. This helps in cognitive development of the children and hones their writing skills as well. We then show them how the film-maker has interpreted it, says Anuradha Das, the principal.        
	In keeping with the filmi twist to classroom teaching, the Modern Academy of Continuing Education (MACE), under the aegis of Modern High School, organised a seminar on acting, psychology and education conducted by veteran actor Mohan Agashe in the city recently. The thrust of the seminar  attended by representatives from South Point, Heritage, Calcutta International, Ballygunge Siksha Sadan and the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy  was on combining acting and psychology with education.        
	Psychologists working with kids are all for the cinema-classroom combine as children have a strong identification with films. Counselling psychologist Salony Priya uses clippings from Iqbal to set goals, Lagaan for leadership training, and To Sir, With Love to talk about communication gap.         
	The audio-visual media helps us communicate with those in the 12-20 age group, points out Priya, who works with Heritage, DPS Megacity and St Xaviers Institution.         
	But some teachers sound a word of caution about the real boundaries of reel lessons. A film can be used as a take-off platform and help enhance the quality of teaching. But it cannot be an alternative to text-book teaching, says Amita Prasad, the middle school coordinator at Modern High.

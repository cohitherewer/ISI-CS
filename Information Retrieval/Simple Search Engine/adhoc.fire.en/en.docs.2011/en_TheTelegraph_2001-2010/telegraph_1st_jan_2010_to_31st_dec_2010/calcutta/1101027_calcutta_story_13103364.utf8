	A Burrabazar sari trader returning home with a friend after dinner was shot dead in Howrah around 12.15am on Tuesday.        
	Manoj Bhansali, 24, was apparently riding pillion on his friends motorcycle when two bullets went through his skull about a kilometre from his home on Narasingha Dutta Road. The friend is missing.         
	A trader from Jamshedpur who buys saris from Bhansali had accompanied the duo to dinner. Bhansali and his friend had dropped Manish Khemka at Howrah station from where he took the Hyderabad Express.        
	When Khemka, 32, reached Kharagpur, Manojs brother Virendra called him up to inform about the murder. Khemka said he rushed back.        
	Virendra, 22, said their mother had called up Manoj around 11.45pm to ask when he would return home. He had said hed be back in 15 minutes. When he did not I rang him up again but there was no response. The phone kept ringing.         
	Virendra called Manoj again at 12.30am. An officer of Bantra police station received the call and told him to come near Shyamashree cinema on Netaji Subhas Road. Manoj was lying in a pool of blood when Virendra reached the spot. The police found two empty cartridges nearby.         
	The police said residents informed them about the murder after hearing two gunshots.         
	Khemka told police he had never before seen the friend Manoj went out with on Monday night. I dont even know the friends name. They were travelling on his red Pulsar, he said.         
	Additional superintendent of police (town) Sukesh Kumar Jain said on Tuesday evening the police were still clueless. We are probing all possible angles, he said.        
	Manojs father Sekhar Chand, in his mid-50s, said the family did not have enmity with anyone. Manoj was born and brought up here (on Narasingha Dutta Road, under Bantra police station, about 3km south of Howrah station). We are in the sari business for generations.         
	Sekhar Chand lives in a 2,000sq ft flat with his two sons and wife Lila Devi, 48. He has two daughters who live elsewhere after marriage.        
	Every day, Sekhar Chand and his family had their dinner together after the sons returned from their Burrabazar store. That is why mother had called bhaiya last night, sobbed Virendra.        
	With Manoj and Virendra, Sekhar Chand, too, went to the store every day but he usually returned home early.

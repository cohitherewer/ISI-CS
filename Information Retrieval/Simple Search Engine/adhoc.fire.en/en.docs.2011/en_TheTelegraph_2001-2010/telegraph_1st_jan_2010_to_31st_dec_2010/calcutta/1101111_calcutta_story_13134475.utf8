The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Buyers lose iPad battle at home
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Buyers lose iPad battle at home
          MADHURIMA CHATTERJEE                          Vaibhavi Gupta and her brother Varenya pore over the iPad at home. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Yashovardhan Gupta had set his sights on the iPad, primarily as a work tool, since its launch in April this year. He finally managed to get one from the UK, shelling out 529 (Rs 38,000 approximately). But forget work, the 28-year-old Calcutta businessman is now glad if he gets to touch his iPad once a day, thanks to the comic tussle for the tablet computer that ensues in his home.         
	I hardly see it! is the pet peeve of iPad owners in the city, as the stunner from the Apple family soars up the popularity chart despite not being launched in India yet.        
	From toddlers to grandmas, anyone who comes across the iPad is going gaga over the gadget, leaving the buyers smiling grudgingly.        
	I bought the 32GB Wi-fi iPad as it can be used to chart project trends. Its a great GPS device and helps me navigate to places where I can set up factories. But little did I know how sporadically I would get to use it! smiles Yashovardan.        
	The Alipore residents mother uses the iPad to Skype with extended family members or play Farmville on Facebook, while his father needs it to make lists and maintain accounts for his sisters wedding.        
	Then my brothers kids want it to play Shuttle Park, of course! Sometimes I wonder whose iPad is it anyway, sighs Yashovardan.        
	Its worse for three-and-a-half-years-old Vaibhavi Guptas mother  she needs her daughters permission to use her own iPad.        
	Once I am back from work, my daughter grabs the iPad. I dont know how she learnt to use it but now she is hooked. She does not let anyone else get near it. From listening to nursery rhymes and playing games to watching Chhota Bheem and listening to bedtime stories, it is her constant companion, says Ruchika Gupta, 34, the marketing head of a PR firm.         
	After hearing about her plight, Ruchika says her friends have hidden their new iPads from their kids for fear of losing the ownership battle.        
	The iPad sometimes comes between newly-weds too, as 27-year-old Richa Sethia Mohta found out after her father got one for her from Dubai as a wedding present.         
	Do I get to use it? Whenever I want it, my husband, Shantanu, insists he has work to do on it. Its funny how serious he gets about it. Hes either reading, writing, surfing or playing Bingo on it. Honestly, most people will forget to use the iPad as a work tool very soon.        
	Richa feels the iPad is so much fun that it is distracting. There is an application called Talking Tom, where a virtual cat repeats everything you say in a high-pitched voice and purrs and sleeps. My friends had a blast with it at a party and now a friend of mine calls me every day to talk to Tom!        
	The pull of the iPad is evident from the rush for add-ons at the city Apple stores.        
	Though the iPad is not available here, many get it from abroad and come to our store for the add-ons. We have sold more than 1,500 iPad accessories since its international launch, says Sanjay Chordia, the owner of Imagine, Apples premium stores at the Salt Lake and Rajarhat City Centre malls.        
	The gadgets easy user interface, Wi-fi Internet access, more than 2 lakh fun applications like Talking Tom, Beer Counter and Blind Date Screener, and its multiple uses, from ebook reader, music and video player, GPS device/tracker to gaming tool and organiser, have made it indispensable, adds Chordia.        
	He hopes the iPad will be made available in the city soon as requests are piling up. Till then, iPad owners, learn to grin and share the Apple of your eye.

	A pedestrian jumped into the Hooghly from Vidyasagar Setu on Thursday afternoon. Police said he might have drowned.        
	The man in his 30s could cross the toll plaza and walk till the middle of the bridge though pedestrians are not allowed on it. He asked two cleaners the direction to AJC Bose Road and was told to move straight. Suddenly, one of them saw him climb the railing and jump into the river, said an officer.

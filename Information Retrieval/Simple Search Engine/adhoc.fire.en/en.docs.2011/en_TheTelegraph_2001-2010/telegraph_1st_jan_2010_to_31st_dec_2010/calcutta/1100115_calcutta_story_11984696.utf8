The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro drain saves woman
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro drain saves woman
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A middle-aged widow who attempted suicide by jumping in front of a train at Chandni Chowk station on Thursday morning landed in the drain between the rails and escaped with injuries though coaches passed over her.        
	When the driver moved the Tollygunge-bound train backwards, the 49-year-old was found lying unconscious in the narrow channel with injuries on her face and three of her fingers ripped off, said police.        
	The woman, who hails from Halisahar in North 24-Parganas and works as a help in a traders house on CR Avenue, was admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.        
	Minor surgeries had to be performed on her face and three of her fingers amputated, said a doctor.        
	The woman, who has been working as a help since her husbands death 19 years ago, was depressed about her two sons not finding permanent jobs, said another employee of the trader. Her elder son is unemployed while the younger one is a barber.        
	Of late, she used to talk aloud to herself and about absurd things. Our employer had arranged for her to see a doctor but she refused to do so. Even today morning, I joked that if she did not consult the doctor, we would send her to a mental hospital. She left the house an hour later and went to Chandni Chowk station, said Jai Narayan Mishra, another employee of the house.        
	The suicide bid around 11.40am disrupted trains for 20 minutes. Services between Kavi Nazrul and Maidan and Girish Park and Dum Dum were not affected.

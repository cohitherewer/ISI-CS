                      Suffering, the spring of human virtues                    Since the beginning of human history, womens lives have been repressed, exploited and dominated by men. Madhabi of The Mahabharata represents womanhood, perpetually demeaned, desecrated, debauched and deflowered to fulfil the desires and ambitions of men. Her story is a tempestuous journey of a woman confronting a hierarchy that is steeped in moral pretence and demonic in its desperation for status and power. Yet, this evenings production of Madhabi offers more than just a feminist statement. Expectant in love, acquiescent in duties, subservient to hierarchy, Madhabi has all but lost her own identity. She is duty-bound to her father and her lover, but none care for her or are aware of her emotional needs. The outside world batters her, but her soul, triggered by shocking acts of inhumanity, transforms her from being agonistic and indifferent to triumphant. More importantly, the trials of her life and her responses to them give us a chance to discover the boundless goodness endowed in each of our hearts. Drama: Bhisham Sahni. Adaptation, music and direction: Swatilekha Sengupta. Performance: Rudraprasad Sengupta, Debshankar Halder, Parthapratim Deb, Sumanta Ganguly and Sohini Sengupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 50 miss train, blame railway 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      50 miss train, blame railway 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Subrata Halder after boarding the Shalimar-Lokmanya Tilak Express. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Around 50 people who had booked berths on the Howrah-Mumbai Mail missed the train on Wednesday morning after being wrongly informed by the railway authorities about the departure time.        
	A protest by the group prompted a reluctant railway to accommodate most of the people on two other Mumbai-bound trains. The rest sought a refund which the authorities granted.        
	We have ordered an inquiry, said an official.        
	The mail train, which used to leave Howrah at 8.15pm, has been departing at 5.30am since the May 28 Jnaneswari Express tragedy, which forced the authorities to ban the movement of passenger trains on Maoist-affected stretches from 10pm to 5am. The ban has been extended till January 6.        
	The aggrieved passengers, however, said when they called the toll-free railway enquiry number 139 to check the status of the Up Mumbai Mail, a recorded voice said the train would leave at 9.30pm.        
	The computer-generated status sheet, too, said the actual/expected departure time was 9.30am.        
	I had called 139 and was told that the train would leave Howrah at 9.30am, said Subrata Halder, a resident of Durg in Chhattisgarh. When he and his son arrived at the station around 8.30am, they learnt that the train had left three hours before.         
	Halder rushed to the enquiry but the employees allegedly shouted him down, saying they couldnt be bothered if he had missed the train.        
	The staff sat up only when the other passengers  around 50, according to Halder  arrived and said they had been misinformed by 139. They made several calls and some senior officials came rushing and assured us that alternative arrangements would be made, said Mumbai resident Prakash Bhosle.        
	Railway sources said 16 passengers were provided berths on the Gitanjali Express that left Howrah at 1.40pm and another 12 on the Shalimar-Lokmanya Tilak Express that left at 3pm.        
	Eleven passengers got their refund. Those who bought e-tickets would get their money back soon, said an official.        
	Those who boarded the Lokmanya Tilak Express said the authorities did not provide them with food, resting place or money to travel from Howrah to Shalimar.

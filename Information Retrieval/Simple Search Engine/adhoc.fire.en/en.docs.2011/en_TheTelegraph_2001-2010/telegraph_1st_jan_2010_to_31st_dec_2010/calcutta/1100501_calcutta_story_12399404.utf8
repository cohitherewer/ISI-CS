	Calcutta High Court on Friday allowed Sajid Nadiadwala to screen Housefull in West Bengal but without the controversial song Apni toh jaise taise, originally from the 1981 blockbuster Laawaris.         
	Justice Nadira Patherya, however, stayed the operation of her order till May 3 after a request by Nadiadwalas counsel. His lawyers later said they would move an appeal before a high court division bench on Monday.         
	The court is giving liberty to the maker of Hindi feature film Housefull to screen in halls without using the song Apni toh jaise taise, which was used in Prakash Mehras film Laawaris, the order said.         
	This interim order will continue till June 30, said the judge and directed the parties to file affidavits and replies.         
	On April 28, Puneet Mehra, the son of Laawaris maker Prakash Mehra (who also wrote Apni toh jaise taise), and composer Anandji had dragged Nadiadwala to court for the alleged copyright breach.         
	Nadiadwala told the court he had bought the song rights from Saregama, while Mehra and Anandji claimed that the music company didnt hold the rights to the song in the first place.         
	In Housefull, the song  easily the catchiest number of the Shankar Ehsaan Loy soundtrack  features Akshay Kumar, Arjun Rampal and Ritesh Deshmukh on a boys night out with Miss Sri Lanka Jacqueline Fernandez gyrating in a midriff-exposing shiny purple number.

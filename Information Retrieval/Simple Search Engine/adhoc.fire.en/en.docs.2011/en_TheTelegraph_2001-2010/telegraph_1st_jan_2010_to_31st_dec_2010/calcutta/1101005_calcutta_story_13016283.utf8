The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ireland eyes business in town
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ireland eyes business in town
          SUBHRO SAHA                          Irelands ambassador Kenneth Thompson in conversation with Metro. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	Ireland is keen to engage Calcutta in business ties across sectors, after supporting local NGOs and education projects for the poor here for decades.        
	We are conscious of the fact that Calcutta has the strongest Irish connection among Indian cities, but we have never really done justice to that chemistry. Its time for a course correction, since we believe that the needy image is only a caricature of this wonderful city, Kenneth Thompson, the ambassador of Ireland to India, told Metro on Monday.        
	Dairy and agriculture, information technology, pharmaceuticals and life sciences, telecom, financial services and higher education are some of the domains where Ireland is confident of achieving meaningful business collaboration with counterparts in Bengal.        
	As a first step, the third-largest island in Europe with a population of 4.4 million is opening a diplomatic window in town on Tuesday, with Keventer Agro chairman M.K. Jalan taking over as honorary consul of Ireland. Jalan was earlier the honorary consul of France.        
	There are around 50 Irish enterprises with presence in India at the moment, mostly clustered in Bangalore, Pune and Delhi, and the ambassador feels Bengal will be on the biz roadmap of Ireland Inc soon.        
	We are in dialogue with Irish dairy tech giant Keenan for possible sharing of technology, which can increase milk yield in cows by 30 per cent, said Jalan, whose company is also in talks with Kerry, another Irish dairy and food tech firm, exploring collaboration avenues.        
	Ireland is credited with having an advanced dairy technology, with every cow having a passport to monitor relevant details. Software for various services and medical equipment are other areas where the diplomat expects handholding with the state.        
	The Loreto Order and the Christian Brothers came to this city back in 1841, and we have been supporting Sister Cyril and some voluntary outfits for many years. We feel this state is now ripe for us to move on to a new plane, Thompson stressed.        
	To explore collaboration routes in higher education, a team from the Trinity College, Dublin, will visit Calcutta soon, while the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland, is also sending a delegation to work with Indian doctors. The land of WB Yeats, James Joyce and George Bernard Shaw will also focus on boosting cultural ties with Calcutta, the ambassador said.

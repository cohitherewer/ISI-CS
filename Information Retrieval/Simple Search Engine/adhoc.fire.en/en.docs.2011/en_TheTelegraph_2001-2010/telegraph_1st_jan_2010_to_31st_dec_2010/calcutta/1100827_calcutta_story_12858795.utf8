										      Dear Mother -Jeanette Petrie                        Petrie at Nandan on Thursday. (Aranya Sen)				                           
	New York-based Jeanette Petrie is one of the makers of the film Mother Teresa that is being screened at Nandan              
	When my sister Ann and I started making the film, we thought it would take us a year to complete. It took us five years, 1982 to 1987. She had already won the Nobel Prize by then and everybody knew her. Yet few people really knew her as a person.        
	She is called Mother Teresa of Calcutta, but she worked all over. She is really Mother to the whole world. I met Mother in New York through my brother who is a priest. He had worked with leprosy patients in India for 25 years and Mother had sponsored him.         
	Mother was so warm. She was very easy to be with, very direct. It took some time for us to get her to agree to let us film her. We did some interviews and used them in the film.        
	Mother would say that to understand her work, one had to do the work. So we volunteered to work before the shoot. We shot in 10 countries and five continents.        
	Mother also said: Show Gods love in action. This is what the movie does  shows Gods love in action.        
	Another thing Mother often said was: If you want to know what you can do, come and see.        
	The movie premiered in the UN General Assembly. When Mother saw the film, she said: Its complete.                    
	Tribute on celluloid         
	The third edition of the Mother Teresa International Film Festival 2010 opened at Nandan on Thursday with Petries Mother Teresa.         
	Presented by Signis, Nandan and Unesco, with the support of the Archdiocese of Calcutta, Missionaries of Charity and Catholic Relief Services, the four-day festival will screen over 15 films from seven countries.         
	The festival will then travel to other cities across India and abroad. These movies will also be shown in all Metro stations in Calcutta for three days, said festival director Sunil Lucas.       As told to Poulomi Banerjee

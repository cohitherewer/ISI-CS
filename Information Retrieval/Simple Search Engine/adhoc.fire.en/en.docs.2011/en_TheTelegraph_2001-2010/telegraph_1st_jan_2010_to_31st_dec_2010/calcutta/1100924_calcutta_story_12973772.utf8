          OUR BUREAU                          People remove debris after a landslide in Shimla. (PTI)                                  
	Bengal has finally woken up to the woes of tourists from the state stranded in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, deputing two ministers to visit the landslide zones and speed up efforts to evacuate them.        
	Sports minister Kanti Ganguly and civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee left for Uttarakhand on Thursday even as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee declared that his government had initiated rescue efforts on a war footing.        
	Some tourists of our state have been stranded in various parts of Uttarakhand. We are very worried about them and are making efforts to quickly bring them back. I have sent two of my cabinet ministers to the spot and asked tourism minister Manab Mukherjee to co-ordinate, said Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.        
	The government has formed a six-member team of mountaineering experts, including Everest climbers Basant Singh Roy and Debasish Biswas, to help trace three trekkers missing in Uttarakhand.        
	Anal Das, N.P. Rao and Arun Adak were part of an eight-member team from Howrah Golabari who went missing while heading towards Badrinath via Kalindi Pass.         
	Climbers Singh Roy and Biswas are scheduled to leave for the rescue mission on Friday morning.        
	Srikumar Mukherjee, who boarded a 5pm flight to Delhi, said his brief was to ensure that tourists from Bengal were given priority in rescue efforts.        
	Metro had reported on Thursday about groups of tourists being stranded in remote locations of both Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh without adequate food for more than four days.         
	Gautam Kundu of Baghajatin, whose parents and sister have been holed up at Debi Resorts at Sangla in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh for five days, said the hotel had run out of food. My parents have been surviving on biscuits since last night. My eight-year-old sister has high fever. Since there is no electricity, cellphone batteries cannot be charged either, rued Gautam.        
	Mamta Chaudhary, the deputy commissioner of Kinnaur, told our Shimla correspondent over the phone that 109 tourists from Bengal were stranded at Sangla. They have been asked to shift to government guesthouses if they run out of money, she said.        
	Lalbazar has opened helplines  033-22145486, 22145087 and 22144031  to convey information received from families of the stranded tourists to the authorities in those two states. Those whose family members are trapped can call up 09958196862 and 09412054085 to find out if they have been rescued.

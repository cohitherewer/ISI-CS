  - A month later, shared tales behind tears          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE AND SUBHAJOY ROY                          Prithwish Ghoshs father Pankaj during the meeting on Friday. (Anindya S. Ray)                                        
	A group of strangers united in grief got together on Friday for a cathartic heart-to-heart on dealing with the loss of a loved one in the Stephen Court tragedy exactly a month ago.        
	The informal group therapy session took place at the Picnic Garden apartment of Pankaj Ghosh, a retired civic body employee who lost his 19-year-old son Prithwish in the blaze.        
	We have all been through the most traumatic month of our lives. Every night my wife wakes up and cries inconsolably. I keep telling her that we are not the only ones  that there are others who have lost their near and dear ones as well. We have all decided to meet and share our grief, said Ghosh, whose son died within days of taking up his first job as a call centre executive with Wintech PC.        
	The 12-odd people invited to the three-room flat were all family members or friends of blaze victims employed with Wintech PC. They included Kashinath and Kusum Gupta, the parents of Amit Gupta, 22; Shankar Mondal and Sheikh Nur Islam, both friends of Richa Dutta, 22; Mithilesh Sharma, father of Aarti, 20; Ashok Sen and Manik Saha, relatives of Prateek Roy, 20; and Biswajit Roy, a brother-in-law of Bidyut Acharya, 21.        
	As they took their seats in the 10x10ft room that used to be Prithwishs till he left for office on March 23, the tales behind their tears flowed. My husband and I are finding it difficult to stay in our house, which is filled with memories of our son, said Amits mother Kusum.        
	Some of the participants said later that the two-hour session did help them in dealing with their grief.        
	 Group therapy is one of the best ways of relieving shared grief because each believes that the other will understand his or her pain, said psychologist Mohormala Chaterjee.        
	Towards the end of the session, the group even discussed the possibility of seeking compensation from the companies in which many of the 43 blaze victims worked.        
	At least 35 of the victims were employees of four companies  Microsys Technical Enterprises, Guru Ispat Private Ltd, Rawat Engineering Pvt Ltd and Wintech PC.        
	Lawyers said the families had the right to claim compensation from the companies because all of them died on the job. Compensation for death in harness is a fundamental right, said high court advocate Pradip Roy.        
	The quantum of compensation would depend on the status of employment, going up to Rs 12 lakh per family.         
	We are liable to compensate those from our company who died on the job. But ours was a 20-day-old company when the tragedy occurred. We might need some time to compensate the families, said Kush Kumar, one of the owners of Wintech PC.        
	Officials of Microsys that lost eight of its employees cited financial constraints. We were only two months old in the business when the fire took place. We didnt have insurance as the owner of the floor didnt give us the necessary documents, said Upendra Bharti, a senior company executive.        
	But Pradeep Rawat of Rawat Engineering, which lost seven staff members, said he would do everything needed to compensate our employees families.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More rain on horizon
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      More rain on horizon

	A short spell of thundershower cooled down the city and its neighbourhood on Wednesday evening and the weatherman kept alive the hope for more rain before the weekend.         
	The sky darkened over the city around 4pm. The drizzle that started an hour later developed into rain within 30 minutes, bringing down the mercury a couple of notches.        
	The maximum and minimum temperatures were both a degree above normal on Wednesday. High humidity of 45 to 90 per cent added to the discomfort factor.        
	The rain was on the radar. More rain or thundershowers are likely over the next couple of days. The evenings are likely to stay the same for 48 hours, said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore on Wednesday.        
	The high humidity making the daytime uncomfortable is largely responsible for the cloud cover and the rain in the evenings, said the chief meteorologist of a private agency.        
	According to the India Meteorological Department, a trough of low-pressure over Gangetic Bengal has aided cloud formation over the past few days. The trough also has an embedded upper air cyclonic circulation.        
	The temperature on Thursday would hover around Wednesdays levels unless it rains heavily in the afternoon or evening. Heavy rain for an hour or two could bring down the mercury for a day or two, said a Met official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Couple held for fraud
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Couple held for fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A couple have allegedly duped several realtors into paying more than Rs 1 crore as an advance for a Darga Road property.        
	The couple  Pranab Dey and Tripti, both in their 40s  were arrested in their Beadon Street home on Wednesday.        
	The five-storeyed house on a five-cottah plot that the couple had used as a bait to dupe the realtors was Pranabs ancestral property, police said.        
	We arrested the couple after four persons lodged complaints against them. Officers conducted a probe and found the couple had duped the complainants, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	The first to lodge a complaint was Rajeev Kankaria, who told sleuths on February 27 that he had paid an advance of Rs 5 lakh to the couple for the Darga Road house.        
	Kankaria alleged that the Deys had been evading him ever since he made the payment.        
	A couple of weeks later, Anil Mitra and Gopal Shroff from a realtor firm and Basanta Chowdhury, also a developer, lodged similar complaints.        
	The firm of Mitra and Shroff had paid Rs 76 crore and Chowdhury, Rs 21 crore.        
	The firm as well as Chowdhury had published advertisements in newspapers stating that anyone with a stake in the building and opposed to the sale might contact them within a specified period.        
	The Mitra-Shroff duo and Chowdhury came to know each other after reading the advertisements. Before lodging the complaints, they met and realised that they had been duped, said an official of the detective department.        
	All the complainants told the sleuths that they had wanted to raze the five-storeyed house and construct a residential highrise on the plot.        
	An investigating officer said: We are trying to find out whether the couple alone own the property or whether they shared the ownership with relatives.        
	Police, however, are yet to freeze the bank accounts of the accused. Pranab was the mastermind though the agreements with the complainants were signed by his wife.

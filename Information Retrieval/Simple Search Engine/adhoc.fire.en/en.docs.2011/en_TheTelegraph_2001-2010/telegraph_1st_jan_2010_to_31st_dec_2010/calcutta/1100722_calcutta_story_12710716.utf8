	The mood at Mamata Banerjees 30B Harish Chatterjee Street house through Wednesday was as varied as the gathering at her martyrs day rally.        
	The early hours were calm as a handful of party workers were seen moving around, arranging for cars and food packets for volunteers.        
	But the tempo changed as the day wore on, with Trinamul supporters pouring in from 9.30am. An hour later, the space in front of the Trinamul supremos house and office was cramped with supporters, all craning their necks for a glimpse of their leader before heading for the rally site at Esplanade.        
	Didir bari konta? Didi baritey achhen? (Which one is her house? Is she home?), were oft-asked questions as supporters from far-flung places passed by.        
	The scene inside Mamatas house was same as on any other day. She spent most of her time chatting with family members while keeping an eye on the TV. She offered her daily prayers and chatted with us, said a sister-in-law of Mamata.        
	The leader made a fleeting appearance at the door, in trademark crumpled sari, around 11.15am to see off the family members of those who had died in the police firing on July 21, 1993.        
	As the supporters surged in an attempt to touch her feet, Mamata shouted: Tomra berow, naholey pounchhotey parbey na (You all leave, or else you wont be able to reach the rally site in time).        
	Mamata emerged again two hours later, flanked by her brothers. Mother Gayatri Devi, her biggest fan, was at the door to wish her daughter luck. Ma is not well. So we are staying back with her. We will watch the rally on TV, said one of the sisters-in-law.        
	Mamata left home for the rally in her black Santro, accompanied by mayor Sovan Chatterjee, in a nine-car convoy around 1.20pm.        
	Once she left, quiet descended on the locality. The only noise was from television sets beaming the Mamata show live. The silence gave way to a hum as people started trickling in with the rally drawing to a close.        
	Mamata returned around 4.40pm. When will you go home? she asked the faithfuls on her way to her office next to her house.

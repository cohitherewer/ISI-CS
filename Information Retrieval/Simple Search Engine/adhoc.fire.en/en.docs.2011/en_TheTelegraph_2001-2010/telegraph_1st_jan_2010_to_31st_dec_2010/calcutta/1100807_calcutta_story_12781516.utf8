The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court seeks elders pay list
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court seeks elders pay list
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                               
	A high court division bench on Friday directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to prepare a list of people receiving old-age allowances in the 141 wards in the city and submit it to the court within three weeks.        
	The bench, headed by Chief Justice J.N. Patel, also asked the CMC to mention how many persons on the list had died since it had been drawn up and how much money the civic body had received from the Centre for this purpose.         
	The order followed an appeal by advocate Arunava Ghosh, appearing for the Congress councillor from ward 6, Suman Singh, who was made a party to the case on misappropriation of the elders grant. The petitioner is a resident of ward 6.        
	Ghosh told the court that that there was no provision for auditing the papers related to the old-age allowance funds the CMC received from Delhi.        
	The councillors make a list on the basis of applications made by elders and send it to the CMC for disbursement of the amount, he said.        
	He added that the Centre had asked the civic bodies to make the payments through money orders or banks.         
	On July 23, the same bench had directed the CMC to pay needy senior citizens their central government allowance of Rs 400 per month through cheque or money order.         
	The bench had issued the directive after the petitioner alleged that the CMC had been disbursing the allowance in the names of at least three residents of the area who had died.        
	The petitioner had requested the court for a specific direction regarding the payment of the elders allowances, and said that otherwise public funds would continue to be misappropriated.

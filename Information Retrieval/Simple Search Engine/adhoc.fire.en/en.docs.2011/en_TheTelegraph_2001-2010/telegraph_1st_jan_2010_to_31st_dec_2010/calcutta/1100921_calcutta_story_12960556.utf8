          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A second-year student of Heramba Chandra College threatened to set himself on fire inside principal Khagen Adhikarys office on Monday.        
	Nearly 100 students were protesting the principals refusal to admit some students whose names had figured in the merit list for admission to BA and BSc courses, when one of them opened a container filled with petrol and splashed the liquid around the room.        
	The student took out a match box and threatened to set the chamber on fire.        
	Some employees alerted Lake police station. Officers rushed to the college within minutes but by then the student and the rest of the protesters had fled.        
	The college authorities did not lodge a complaint. A student had sprinkled petrol in my chamber. But I do not know what was his intention, said Adhikary.        
	The college was shut down indefinitely after the incident. The campus has been on the boil since the authorities turned down a plea to admit all students whose names are on the merit list.

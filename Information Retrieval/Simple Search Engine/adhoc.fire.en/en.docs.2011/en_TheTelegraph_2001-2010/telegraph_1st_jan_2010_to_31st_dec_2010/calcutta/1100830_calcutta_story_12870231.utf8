The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sunday protest lesson for parties
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sunday protest lesson for parties
  - Residents blockade for road repair jolts Partha amp; PWD into action          SUBHAJOY ROY                          A PWD dumper fills up a crater at Thakurpukur on Diamond Harbour Road following the Sunday protest by residents. Picture by Bishwarup Datta                                        
	Around 100 residents of Behala achieved with a Sunday street protest what traffic-stopper weekday rallies by political parties fail to do  maximum impact with minimal disruption.        
	The three-hour blockade in Thakurpukur to protest the pathetic condition of the Kadamtala stretch of Diamond Harbour Road not only forced the local MLA  leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee  to rush to the site but also prompted the PWD to undertake emergency repairs on a Sunday.        
	The blockade from 11am till 2.30pm  prompted by two accidents since Saturday night  did disrupt traffic flow but police admitted that a traffic diversion through James Long Sarani solved the problem. Today being a holiday, there were no snarls as such. On a weekday, we might even have been forced to lathicharge the crowd, said a police officer.        
	So was the choice of day deliberate or just a coincidence?        
	Pintu Konch, among the 100-strong crowd blocking the thoroughfare, insisted that the protesters decided against hitting the streets on a weekday because that would have inconvenienced everyone.        
	Sunday was the best possible protest option for this common cause. We were not doing this to grab eyeballs but make the authorities aware of how dangerous this stretch has become, he said.        
	Trinamul leader Chatterjee, whose party is now trying to steer clear of street protests on Mamata Banerjees orders, took the moral high ground by calling road blockades a disruptive activity, irrespective of which day of the week it was staged.        
	 I welcome the initiative by the local people to demand better roads but a road blockade is not the way to do it, declared Chatterjee, who has organised and participated in several traffic-choker rallies in town.        
	The blockade was lifted after Chatterjee promised the protesters that he would ensure the craters on the road  two motorcyclists fell into a nearly 2ft deep crater on Saturday night and Sunday morning  were filled at the earliest.        
	A PWD team soon reached the site to carry out temporary repairs. The north-bound flank was opened to traffic even as patchwork started on the opposite side.        
	I will survey the stretch on Monday and do whatever it takes to restore the road to its normal condition, said a senior official of the PWDs south suburban division, which is responsible for the upkeep of that part of Diamond Harbour Road.        
	Officials cited unavailability of funds for the delay in repairing the road. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) was supposed to release funds for repairs long ago but is yet to do so. We had submitted an estimate of Rs 2 crore to the CMC in January but only Rs 70 lakh has been released so far, said a PWD official.         
	So where have these funds gone? We have started repairs along the stretch between Behala Blind School and the tram depot with that money, the official claimed.

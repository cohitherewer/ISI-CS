The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minister jumps the Infosys gun 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Minister jumps the Infosys gun 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	State housing minister Goutam Deb announced on Tuesday that Infosys had decided to set up a campus in the state, a development about which the state IT minister pleaded ignorance. The company refused comment.         
	The IT major, headquartered in Bangalore, is willing to buy a 50-acre plot at Rajarhat for Rs 1.5 crore per acre and the deal would be inked in a few days, said Deb, also the chairman of Hidco, the implementing agency of New Town.        
	Infosys has agreed to set up a campus here. I will sit with Debesh (Das, the IT minister) in a few days and work out the finer details. Let me be clear, Infosys is ready. We will do everything to ensure they come here very soon, added Deb.        
	Das, however, expressed surprise at the announcement. We are in constant touch with them, thats all I can say, said the IT minister.        
	This has been the standard answer from Das on the issue of Infosyss investment in Bengal since he assumed charge of the department after the 2006 Assembly elections.        
	A spokesperson for Infosys in Bangalore declined comment but a source in the company told Metro that it had not received a fresh proposal from the state government.         
	Infosys had first shown interest in buying land in Bengal in 2004 but backed out after Hidco quoted Rs 2.16 crore per acre. In 2008, Infosys and Wipro had signed MoUs with the government to buy 90 acres each in the 1,200-acre Kolkata IT Link project in Rajarhat, which was scrapped after the Vedic Village controversy.        
	The government had later offered 10 acres of land in Rajarhat to both companies, which they refused to accept. Last November, Wipro agreed to a government offer of 45 acres in Rajarhat. An IT department team had met Infosys officials in Bangalore last month to urge them to come to Bengal. They are still in two minds about setting up a campus in West Bengal, said a source in the IT department.         
	Deb reiterated in the evening that the deal would be sealed in a week. Within seven days, our officials will sit with Infosys and work out the details, said Deb.        
	Infosys will take our land. I am saying this on the basis of the discussions we had with them till now. Land price will not be an impediment in talks with Infosys, added minister.

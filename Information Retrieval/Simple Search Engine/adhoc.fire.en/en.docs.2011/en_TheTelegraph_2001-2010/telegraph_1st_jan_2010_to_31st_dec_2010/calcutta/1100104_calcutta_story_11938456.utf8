	A musical extravaganza on Sunday evening marked the silver jubilee of the St Xaviers College Calcutta Alumni Association (SXCCAA), which coincides with the institutions 150th year celebrations.         
	The programme, which started with a dance performance by students, featured Grammy-winner Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt on Mohan veena and Subhen Chatterjee on tabla. Bands Karma and Rhythm Express also entertained the 700-strong audience on the college ground.        
	The association aims to bring smiles to other faces as well. The alumni have adopted two Aila-affected villages in North and South 24-Parganas and want to add to the list, said a spokesperson.         
	The alumni are also collaborating with the Book Fair authorities, added the spokesperson.        
	The teachers who made the college are also part of the celebrations. Fr Albert Huart, Fr J. Malyekal, Fr Pat Eton, Fr Joe DSouza and Fr P.C. Mathew, were remembered on Sunday evening for their long service to the institution.        
	Fr Malyekal, the founder treasurer of the alumni association, recounted its formation: We modelled SXCCAA on Alsoc (the school old boys association). It was started in 1985, when former President Zail Singh attended the 125th anniversary celebrations.        
	Fr Felix Raj, the principal of the college and president of the SXCCAA, lauded the association for aiding the development of the institution.        
	Former Xaverians who were felicitated included Assembly speaker Hasim Abdul Halim, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and industrialists Sanjiv Goenka and Harsh Vardhan Neotia.

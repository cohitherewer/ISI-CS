          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                Schoolchildren interact with quizmaster Derek OBrien at the Puffin Quiz 2010. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                
	Did you expect to win when you reached the venue at 8.30 in the morning? quizmaster Derek OBrien asked the winners of Puffin Quiz 2010.        
	The only thing I wanted then was to sleep. I was up watching a film till 3.30 in the morning, replied Siddhant Agarwal, a Class XII student of Birla High School for Boys. Despite the lack of sleep, his three-member team proved too strong for their opponents, winning the quiz with a clear margin at the South City International School on November 12.         
	The eighth edition of the Puffin Quiz focused more on Indian and international literary works and authors. Such an initiative encourages children to read more, explained OBrien.         
	In keeping with the theme, the six rounds of the quiz were named after literary classics. The Three Musketeers was an option round, Rip Van Winkle required participants to identify the opening and closing lines from various books, Through the Looking Glass was a visual round, 20,000 Leagues under the Sea a general round, A Christmas Carol an audio-visual round and The Time Machine a buzzer round.         
	Questions ranged from asking the name of the novelist adjudged the best outgoing student by IIM Ahmedabad in 1997 to who wrote the introduction to Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdars Thakurmar Jhuli.         
	There were some hatke questions, too. The quizzers were asked to identify an error in the title of a recent film, I Hate Luv Storys. Its the spelling of storys. It should be stories, shouted participants from Don Bosco, earning a brownie point.         
	The finalists included Apeejay Park Street, Delhi Public School Mega City, La Martiniere for Girls, Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, and Don Bosco Park Circus.         
	This was a different kind of quiz. It tested our reading knowledge. And, one also had to answer out-of-the-box questions, said Class XII student Sarthak Chatterjee of Don Bosco Park Circus. While Don Bosco finished second, La Martiniere for Girls came third.         
	Besides the trophy, members of the winning team got a laptop each, the first runners up got X-box gaming consoles each while the second runners-up were given an I-Pod shuffle each. All participants received certificates.

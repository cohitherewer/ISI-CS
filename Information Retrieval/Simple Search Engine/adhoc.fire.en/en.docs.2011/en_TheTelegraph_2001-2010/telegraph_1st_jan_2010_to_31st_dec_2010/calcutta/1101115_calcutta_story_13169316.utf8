The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wage bill swells with eye on vote
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wage bill swells with eye on vote
  - Move to absorb contractual teachers        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	The beleaguered Bengal government has taken another step forward  or back  on the tightrope walk between vote bank and money in the bank by deciding to absorb 3,000-odd contractual whole-time college teachers.        
	The move aimed at winning back votes in the upcoming Assembly polls at a cost of crores to the overstretched state exchequer will not only result in a jump in the salary bill but also ensure that the teachers remain in service till they turn 60, like their counterparts in UGC-approved posts.        
	Sources in the higher education department said the pre-poll bonanza was likely to be notified this month, following the approval of the finance department.        
	In September, the government had extended similar benefits to 8,000-odd part-time college teachers, prompting allegations that the sops were intended to win back a community that was showing signs of switching sides after being a pillar of support for the ruling Left for decades.        
	The government has long been considering the contractual teachers demand that they be allowed to work till 60 years of age. The process to introduce a no-retrenchment clause in their job agreement is on. An order will soon be issued, said a higher education department official.        
	Of the 3,000-odd contractual whole-time teachers who will benefit from the move, most are working in colleges in and around the city.        
	A contractual whole-time teacher in the current system gets between Rs 8,000 and Rs 14,000 a month, which is paid by the college he/she works in.        
	Once the changes take effect, a teacher will get Rs 21,600 per month, the money coming from the state coffers.        
	The states additional annual outlay under the head of contractual whole-time teachers will be around Rs 80 crore.        
	The colleges are now at liberty to hire  as many as they want in each subject  and fire  whenever they want  contractual teachers, on their own.         
	With the government now agreeing to pay the salaries, the colleges will be required to take the higher education departments consent before hiring a teacher on contract. And once appointed, a contractual teacher cannot be sacked at will, said a higher education department official.        
	The governments decision has triggered concern among the 1,000-odd candidates who have cleared the State Eligibility Test (SET) or National Eligibility Test (NET) in 2009 and 2010 and are awaiting recruitment by colleges.        
	Our scope for employment will shrink once the government implements the changes, though we are better qualified than contractual teachers to teach undergraduates, said a lecturer-in-waiting who had cleared SET last year.        
	West Bengal Principals Council general secretary Anjan Kumar Sengupta, however, supported the move to protect the jobs of contractual teachers for the sake of students.        
	Contractual whole-time teachers play a key role in running undergraduate courses. Hence, their jobs need to be protected and they should get a higher pay, Sengupta said.        
	Colleges started recruiting whole-time teachers on a contractual basis a few years ago to introduce courses in some emerging subjects, such as business administration, computer applications, journalism, molecular biology, electronics and computer science, and bio-chemistry.        
	With the universities stipulating that the courses could not be opened unless there are enough whole-time subject teachers and the government ruling out creating more posts, the colleges had no option but to recruit teachers on contract and foot the salary bill.

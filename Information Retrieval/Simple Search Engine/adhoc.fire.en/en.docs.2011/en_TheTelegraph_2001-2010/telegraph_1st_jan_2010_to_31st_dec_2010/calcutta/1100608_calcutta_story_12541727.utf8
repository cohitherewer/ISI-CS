The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Game plan to survive Cup strain
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Game plan to survive Cup strain
  - City gears up for 64 matches  many at midnight  over 31 days          RITH BASU                                                  
	Abhijit Mukherjee, 40, a clinical research coordinator at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, on a 10am-to-6pm-shift, is practising power naps  a 45-minute rest with eyes shut in office every afternoon.        
	Kasba trader Rangal Gupta, 37, has got a fan fixed on the living room wall, directing the breeze towards the couch that will be his haunt for 30 evenings starting June 11. Up on the wall already is a points-table that the die-hard Cristiano Ronaldo fan will fill up at the end of each match.              
	With World Cup 2010 kicking off on June 11, soccer-crazy Calcuttans are making all sorts of adjustments to their game plan so that they dribble their way through an action-packed month of work hard and play harder.        
	Going by Fifas official website, most matches in South Africa are set for 7.30pm and 12 midnight IST, while a handful of group matches start at 5pm. But as the tournament hots up, most matches will kick off at midnight.        
	Mukherjee, who will be rooting for Kakas Brazil would make coach Dunga proud with his in-depth planning. He will go to work late on days when there arent starry matches starting at 5.30pm. On these days, Ill sleep a little longer in the morning and then work late in office. But I will watch every late-night match, he said.        
	Some games could stretch well beyond 2am once the knockout stage starts, with extra-time and tie-breakers coming into play.        
	The likes of techie Arijit Banerjee, 31, are resigned to missing the best matches live because of night shifts, forcing them to plan for the repeat telecast. My shift is from 8pm to 5am, so I will have to depend on the repeats for which I am preparing my body clock by sleeping less during the day now. Obviously, I wouldnt like to doze off when (Lionel) Messi buries the Jabulani (official ball) into the net, said the Maradona-Messi fan.        
	Fellow Argentina fan Arindam Kar, who has been watching World Cup matches since 1978, feels that it is best to make a proper plan as to which matches to watch and which to miss. One could switch off the TV set and nap when a Paraguay versus Slovakia match is on, explained the head of Medica Superspecialty Hospitals critical care department, adding that five to six hours of quality sleep will be good enough for football fans to survive the Cup weeks.        
	Doctors also recommend regulating the food and alcohol intake (see box) that usually goes with watching soccer matches late into the night and not overdoing things.

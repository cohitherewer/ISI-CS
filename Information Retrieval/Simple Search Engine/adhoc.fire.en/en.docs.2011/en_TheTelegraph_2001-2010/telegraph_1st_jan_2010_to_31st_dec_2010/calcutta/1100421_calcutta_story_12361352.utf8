                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Judge asks for Stephen report 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Damaged portions of Stephen Court being demolished                                  
	The high court on Tuesday asked the civic body to furnish details of its demolition work at the fire-ravaged Stephen Court within two weeks and give an estimated finish date.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is directed to file an affidavit stating details of the dismantling job.... The CMC will also have to inform the court how much time it requires to complete the demolition work, said Justice Girish Gupta in his order.         
	Tuesdays order followed a petition by some residents of the Park Street building.         
	Their counsel L.C. Behnai told the court that his clients had been kept in dark about the demolition job being conducted by the CMC inside their flats.         
	The CMC had assured the court that only a few portions needed to be dismantled. But the civic body has not finished the work till date, he said.        
	The residents of Block I of Stephen Court also moved one step closer to returning to their homes on Tuesday with the CMC allowing them to start work on their flats.         
	The CMC inspection team checked the building and allowed the residents of Block I to start rewiring the electric lines in their homes. They have to follow the guidelines given by the CMC, CESC and the fire department before they are allowed to move in, said Debasis Kar, the director-general (building) of the CMC.        
	Commercial establishments on the ground floor would have to undergo a few other checks before being allowed to start operations, Kar added.

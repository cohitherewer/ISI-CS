          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The number of judges at Calcutta High Court dropped to 28 on Wednesday with the retirement of the senior-most judge of the court, Justice Debi Prasad Sengupta.        
	The high court has a sanctioned strength of 58 judges. The number of pending cases is 3.25 lakh and growing by the day. But the central and the state governments are not showing enough interest in filling up vacant posts, said Sardar Amjad Ali, the president of the court bar association.        
	Justice Sengupta heard criminal cases. After his retirement, the court will face problems in hearing criminal cases, added Ali.

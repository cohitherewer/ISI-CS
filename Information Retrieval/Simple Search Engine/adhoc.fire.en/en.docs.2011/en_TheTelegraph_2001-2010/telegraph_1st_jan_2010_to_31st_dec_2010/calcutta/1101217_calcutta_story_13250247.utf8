The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Alumni offer to form Presi panel for excellence
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Alumni offer to form Presi panel for excellence
          SUBHAJOY ROY                                            
	Past pupils of Presidency have offered to form an advisory group of distinguished alumni to help chart a road map to excellence for the newly anointed university, lately in the news for all the wrong reasons.        
	Vice-chancellor Amita Chatterjee, a former student, is said to have given the nod to the initiative, which includes identifying talented teachers, upgrading syllabi and starting a series of annual lectures by top academicians from across the world.        
	Chatterjee confirmed having an informal talk with some members of the alumni association the day she took charge as Presidency Universitys opening bat on November 2.         
	They told me that they were trying to form a group that would give suggestions to upgrade the institution. It would be great for us if the distinguished alumni of the (erstwhile) college contribute to our growth, said the vice-chancellor, who had to face her first gherao by students barely a month into her new job.        
	Although those behind the initiative are yet to concretise the proposal, there seems to be a consensus among alumni about the need to step in.         
	Presidency alumnus Bikash Sinha, a former director of the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, wouldnt confirm or deny whether he was one of those approached to be a part of the proposed 25-member advisory group. But he did say that a constructive approach was required to restore the institution to its former glory.         
	A gherao is of no help. A constructive, positive approach is required to build an institution of international repute, Sinha told Metro.         
	Sinha may have been alluding to students who had held the vice-chancellor to ransom in her office room for three-and-a-half hours on November 30, crying conspiracy over their poor Part-I results and demanding a review.         
	A member of the alumni association said an official communiqu would soon be sent to those chosen to be a part of the initiative. We have verbally conveyed our plans to those who will be part of the advisory committee. They have given their consent, he added.        
	But will people based in different parts of the world be able to spare time to meet on a regular basis?         
	Finding a common date when everyone will be available is turning out to be very difficult. So we may split the group so that at least one half can meet at a specific time and place. We are also planning video-conferencing with distinguished former students now settled abroad, said the alumni association member.         
	The list of Presidency alumni with the credentials to be a part of the advisory group is a long one. From Nobel laureate Amartya Sen to English scholar Sukanta Chaudhuri, the alumni association has a constellation of academic glitterati to choose from for its 25-member panel.        
	If the vice-chancellor agrees, we can help request reputable teachers from other institutions to come and deliver lectures at Presidency, said a member of the concept group.         
	The alumni association has already made a proposal to create the post of a chair professor.         
	Many distinguished former students of the college had in the past expressed their desire to play a role in turning the institution into a centre of excellence. But the state government, with CPMs advice, always resisted such attempts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hospital cover-up for watchdog visit
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hospital cover-up for watchdog visit

	What was an empty room a day ago now resembles a laboratory, housing equipment allegedly belonging to other departments.        
	Calcutta Medical College and Hospital is pulling out all stops to cover up the sorry state of infrastructure of the physiology department in an attempt to earn the Medical Council of India nod for starting a postgraduate course.        
	A team from the central watchdog will visit the hospital on Wednesday to verify whether it has the infrastructure to start postgraduate courses in physiology and immuno-haematology.        
	A day before, the physiology department got a new laboratory with equipment allegedly hired from other wings of the hospital.        
	An empty room in the building housing the physiology department has been converted into a postgraduate laboratory. Equipment from the undergraduate and other wings have been installed there. A classroom has been given the look of a seminar room, said a source.        
	Utpal Dutta, the principal of the medical college, denied the charge, saying: We havent flouted any rule. The physiology department has all the infrastructure to start the MD course.        
	A senior official of the hospital, however, countered Duttas assertion: Forget the postgraduate course. We dont even have the facilities to run an undergraduate course.        
	Sources said the physiology department lacked key gadgets such as the computerised spirometer that measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled by the lungs and the ones used for amphibian experiments.        
	The authorities have ignored our repeated pleas to arrange for the basic equipment for experimental physiology, an official said.        
	Health department insiders said it had been the practice of all state-run medical colleges in the city to hire teachers and equipment from other institutions to meet the MCI criteria during visits by representatives from the watchdog.        
	On most occasions, the hospitals have succeeded in making the cut through such measures. The situation is back to square one once the experts leave the campus, said an official. Insiders in the the College Street hospital said the authorities were playing the same trick this time, too.         
	Principal Dutta said the postgraduate course in immuno-haematology, now offered by a handful of medical colleges in the country, will deal with transfusion medicine. The blood bank has been upgraded for the purpose, said an official.

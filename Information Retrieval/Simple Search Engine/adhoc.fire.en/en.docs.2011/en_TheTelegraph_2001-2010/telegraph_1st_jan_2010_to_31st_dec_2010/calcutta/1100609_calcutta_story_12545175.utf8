                      Destruction of the human mind                    The perceptive vision and execution of Swapan Kumar Mallicks art are direct manifestations of his intuition, imagination and intellect. However, as a painter, he is intrigued by the very metamorphic construct of the self, where the crumbling of a world social order can lead to extreme existential delusion. As a post-colonial subject, he also goes through the paranoia of a hybridised state of being and vehemently reacts towards a consumerist culture that inevitably results in a complete wreckage of everything humane. In his ongoing show, The Wreckage: decoding essence, delineating ethos, dissecting innocence, his art is a conjugation of traditional symbolism and contemporary jargons, in which his independent and innovative language of art connotes a broader vision through critical statements. His works are borne of an intrinsic metaphysical quality where he can easily amalgamate the common cult with his artistic avant-garde, swapping old and new images in making his statement. Thus, the very innocent embrace of love transcends into a lustrous commodity when the artist dissects the bare back of a young male into luxurious gadgets, credit cards, lubricating condoms, with a young girl hugging him as if with the desire to attain material pleasure only. Yet, there is in his works an invocation to visual pleasure that enunciates a responsive thought-process without simply fortifying the grotesque.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by Swapan Kumar Mallick When: Till June 9; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

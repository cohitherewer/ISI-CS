          DOEL BOSE                                One of the winners of the Mamraj Agarwala Rashtriya Puraskar receives her award from governor M.K. Narayanan                
	For the awardees of this years Mamraj Agarwala Rashtriya Puraskar, hard work and love for ones subject were the keys to success.         
	Held at Raj Bhavan on August 28, the award ceremony saw 96 meritorious students who had performed well in the Madhyamik, Higher Secondary, CBSE, ICSE, ISC, MBBS, Ll.B and CA examinations in 2010, receive certificates and cash prizes of Rs 5,000 each from governor M.K Narayanan.         
	The objective of the award, started by the Mamraj Agarwala Foundation in 1998, is to motivate young people to do better, said Saroj Agarwal, the secretary of the foundation.         
	The awardees are shortlisted through recommendations from the various boards conducting the exams.         
	One of the awardees, Agnishwar Mukherjee, an ex-student of DAV Model School, Durgapur, scored 95 per cent in his CBSE Class XII examinations and is currently pursuing his MBBS from MKCG Medical College, Berhampur. I stressed on fundamental concepts while preparing for the exams. This stood me in good stead, he said.        
	Subhendu Pandit, a former student of Ramakrishna Mission, Kamarpukur, came seventh in the Madhyamik examinations, with a score of 752. Group study in the hostel helped me greatly. The award is a big encouragement towards my future goal, said the youngster who aspires to be a doctor.        
	For Sarah Hafeez, who secured 97.25 per cent in ISC from La Martiniere for Girls, the award was a big surprise. I did not expect to do so well. My family never pressured me about studies. The relaxed atmosphere at home helped me study better, she said.        
	Governor M.K Narayanan spoke of the Mamraj Agarwala Foundations contribution in various fields.         
	Just as it has contributed in the health sector, the foundation has also gone a long way towards encouraging students to reach greater heights through these scholarships.

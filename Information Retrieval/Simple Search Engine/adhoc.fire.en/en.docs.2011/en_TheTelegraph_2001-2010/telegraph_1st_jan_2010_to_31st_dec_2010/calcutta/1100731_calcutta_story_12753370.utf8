The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twin rule riders for clean walls
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Twin rule riders for clean walls
          TAPAS GHOSH AND MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          A Trinamul wall graffiti for the CMC polls in May 2010                                  
	The only two laws that could have helped Mamata Banerjee translate her theme for a clean-Calcutta dream into reality no longer exist.        
	The West Bengal Prevention of Property Defacement Act 1976, which the Left Front government repealed in 2006 to give parties a free run on the citys walls, needs to be reintroduced for Mamata to stand any chance of reining in the graffiti gangs, including those of her party.        
	Then there is the amendment to the West Bengal Municipal Corporation Act in December last year that took the sting out of Section 202 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act. Till the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, cases for graffiti violations used to be registered under that section.        
	Mamata must do away with the amendment so that Section 202 stages a comeback, though that can happen only if Trinamul comes to power, said a senior official of the Election Commission.        
	Ironically, Trinamul MP Sudip Bandopadhyay was a recent beneficiary of the Left Fronts amendment. The high court dismissed a case of graffiti-without-permission against Bandopadhyay on the ground that the law under which it had been registered  Section 202 of the CMC Act 1980  is no longer in force.        
	Advocate Swapan Mallik, who represented the MP, insisted that Justice Asim Roys order be treated as a precedent in all other cases of graffiti violation pending in the courts. The high court alone has over 300 such cases.         
	Its a loophole created by the Left Front and used by everyone. All cases filed last year were under the CMC Act. So the offenders are now citing the West Bengal Municipal Corporation Act to go scot-free, rendering the CMC Act toothless, said a legal expert.        
	The state act was not applicable in Calcutta, Howrah and Chandernagore until the amendment took effect, overriding Section 202 of the CMC Act. The Congress and Trinamul didnt oppose the change, apparently because they would also benefit from it.        
	So how does Trinamul see Mamatas change of heart (and strategy)? Till Didi took such a strong stand, nobody in the party had paid heed to calls for graffiti-free walls. The issue has to be taken more seriously now, admitted a party MLA.        
	But a mere stand means little for the house owners who had filed complaints about their walls being defaced in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, only to see the authorities sit on them.        
	Beleghata resident Binoy Karmakar and three of his neighbours are among the many who have yet to hear from the authorities about the status of their complaints. Sunirmal Mitra of Sovabazar has given up trying to get justice. I spoke to many of my lawyer friends. They told me that till such time the Property Defacement Act of 1976 was brought back, there would be little chance of legal redress, Mitra, who works with a private bank, told Metro.        
	A senior Election Commission official said a blanket ban on graffiti was possibly the only way out. Anything other than a blanket ban would have loopholes for offenders to wriggle out, he added.        
	So would Mamatas promise of a clean Calcutta remain a pipe dream? As of now, the Trinamul-run CMC has the peoples mandate and Mamatas blessings but not the power to wipe the city clean. Maybe things will change after the Assembly elections, though that depends on whether Trinamul wins and its leader remembers her promise, said an official of the municipal affairs department.

	The Directorate General of Civil Aviation on Friday started a probe into President Pratibha Patils plane going off the radar minutes after taking off from the city airport on Thursday. Initial findings indicate a glitch in the monitor of the radar that was tracking Patils flight.        
	During the period the flight was off the radar, air traffic control officials were in touch with the pilot of the Presidents plane over Very High Frequency instruments. Hence, there was no safety hazard, said an official.        
	 Student expelled: The authorities of Heramba Chandra College on Friday decided to expel Chand Prakash Singh, who had allegedly tried to immolate himself during a student protest near the principals office. The college will reopen on Monday.        
	 Clash: Four students were injured when supporters of the SFI and the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad clashed over filing nominations for the students union elections at Vivekananda College in Thakurpukur on Friday.

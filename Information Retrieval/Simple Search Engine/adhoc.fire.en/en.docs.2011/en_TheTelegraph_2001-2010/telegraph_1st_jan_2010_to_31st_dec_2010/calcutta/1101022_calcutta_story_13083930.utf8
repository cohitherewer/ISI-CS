The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wheels of aftershock and autopsy   Many give Metro   a miss
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wheels of aftershock and autopsy     Many give Metro   a miss
          A STAFF REPORTER                          SPOT THE WEEKDAY CROWD: A coach with all passengers seated approaches Central station on Thursday afternoon. Picture by Amit Datta				                                             
	Riya Das, 32, was bracing for another morning battle on the Metro to get to work from Kalighat to Esplanade on Thursday. But that was not to be.        
	Imagine my surprise when I did not have to push and shove my way into a crowded compartment. Instead, I happily stepped into a coach that looked deserted compared with any given weekday, said the bank employee.        
	Then, it dawned on her that many regulars had given the Metro a miss the morning after the derailment of a coach near Central station. Not taking the Metro is not an option for me. Who will risk the traffic snarls and the rain above? she demanded.        
	Many Metro regulars did just that  ditch the underground for safer but slower transport options.        
	There was, roughly, a 20 per cent drop in passenger count on Thursday. One can only attribute it to the aftershock of the derailment, said a Metro Railway official.        
	The derailment did cast a shadow on almost all those taking the Metro on Thursday, with the horrible incident being the talking point for all those enjoying a smoother-than-usual weekday ride.        
	It was a welcome relief and looked like the good ol days of Metro, before it was extended beyond Tollygunge, smiled Amrita Ganguly, going to Park Street from Kalighat in a comfortably non-crowded coach.        
	Among those who did not dare risk a Metro ride on Thursday was Santanu Banerjee, a brand manager with a private firm. Earlier this month I was stranded in the tunnel near Sovabazar station when the train developed glitches. Yesterday, I went to the Metro station only to be told about the derailment. I could not risk delays and disruptions today and so took a bus to the central business district, he said.        
	Others were forced by their families to steer clear of Metro. I wanted to take the Metro but my parents insisted that I take a bus to Esplanade. They said anything can happen in the Metro now, said Chaitali Mukherjee, 22, a resident of Bansdroni.        
	Some Metro regulars were not even sure if full services had resumed on Thursday. I was under the impression that Metro was still running a truncated service, said Tanmay Halder at Dum Dum. My job forces me to rely heavily on the Metro but now I feel uneasy going into the underground. The services have deteriorated and the number of accidents and technical glitches is growing by the week, said the sales executive.

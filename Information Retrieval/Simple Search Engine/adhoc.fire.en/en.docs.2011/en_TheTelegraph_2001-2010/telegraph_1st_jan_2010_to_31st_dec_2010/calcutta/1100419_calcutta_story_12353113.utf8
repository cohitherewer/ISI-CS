                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Student found dead near tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Ajoy Das                                  
	A final-year student of Calcutta National Medical College was found dead beside railway tracks near Mathurapur station in South 24-Parganas on Saturday evening.         
	Ajoy Das, 23, was returning home to Raidighi after receiving news that his grandmother was ill when he is suspected to have met with an accident.         
	According to family members, Ajoy left the college hostel around 5pm on Saturday and took a Mathurapur-bound train from Sealdah around 6pm.        
	Raidighi is about 15km by road from Mathurapur station.        
	A stranger used the students phone to call up his younger brother Sujoy later in the evening.        
	The caller just said Ajoy was lying beside the rail tracks and was in very poor condition, said Biswajit Das, a cousin of the brothers.        
	By the time family members reached the spot, Ajoy had died and the Government Railway Police had taken custody of the body.         
	According to GRP officers, the body bore several injuries. He was probably hit by a train, said an officer.        
	I cant say anything till the post-mortem report is available, said Sankar Singh, the superintendent of railway police (Sealdah).         
	Ajoys friends said he was friendly and got along well with people. We did not notice anything unusual in his behaviour in the past five years. We are shocked at his death, said a friend.        
	Ajoy had failed in one of the papers in his last exam. He was scheduled to appear for a supplementary test. Many medical students appear for supplementary exams. It is very common, said another friend of Ajoy.

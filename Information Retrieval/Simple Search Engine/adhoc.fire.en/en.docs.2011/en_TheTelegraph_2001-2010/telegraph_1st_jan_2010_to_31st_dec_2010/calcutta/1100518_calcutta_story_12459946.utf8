The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boy held with firearms
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boy held with firearms
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 15-year-old boy was arrested while walking down a busy road in Bowbazar with a bag containing two firearms and cartridges on Sunday night.        
	Police said the Class VIII student, the youngest to be arrested with arms and ammunition in recent past, was rounded up following a tip-off. The boy was produced in the juvenile court in Salt Lake and granted bail. The magistrate granted him bail as his study might have been affected had he been sent to a correctional home, said an officer of Bowbazar police station.        
	Our preliminary investigation suggests the boy was a carrier. Someone handed him the consignment which he was supposed to deliver to another person in the locality, the officer added.        
	The boy told the police that he had been watching the final match of T20 World Cup between England and Australia in a club near his home in Bowbazar when a resident of the neighbourhood called him.        
	I went with the man who gave me a bag and asked me to hand it over to his brother who was waiting for me on BB Ganguly Street, the boy said.        
	Sleuths said they had been tipped off about the boy the moment he started heading for the spot where the bag was to change hands.        
	We found him walking down the left pavement of Eden Hospital Road and immediately intercepted him. We searched the bag and found the arms and the cartridges, said another officer of the police station.        
	The officers of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad who examined the boy said he had fallen into the trap of some local criminals enjoying political patronage.        
	It seems he was unaware of what was inside the bag, said an officer.        
	All political parties are trying to strengthen their arsenal before the civic polls. They are using various carriers to transport arms and ammunition to their hideouts, he added.

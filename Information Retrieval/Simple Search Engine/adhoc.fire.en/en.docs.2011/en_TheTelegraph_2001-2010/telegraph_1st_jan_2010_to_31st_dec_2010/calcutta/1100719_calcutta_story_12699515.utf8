                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Roach in Duronto food
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Fifteen passengers of the Mumbai-Howrah Duronto Express fell ill after eating lunch allegedly served stale by the trains catering staff. One of the passengers said there was a cockroach in his lunch packet.        
	Passengers of B2 and B6 coaches lodged a complaint against the food.        
	An official of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, which provides food on Duronto trains, said: We have ordered a probe into a complaint lodged by a passenger. There is apparently no case of food poisoning. Doctors attended to the passenger at Kharagpur but he said he was fine.        
	Railway sources said the lunch was loaded at Bilaspur.        
	The breakfast was fine but the problem was with the fried rice served during lunch. The food was stale, alleged Mohammad Imtiaz, a passenger of the B2 coach. Several others echoed the allegation.        
	One of the passengers found a cockroach in the fried rice, said Krishna Burman Roy, who was in B2.        
	A few passengers started vomiting while others were suffering from nausea. It was a horrible experience, said Sumita Das, another passenger.

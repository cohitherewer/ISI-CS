The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Meeting on airport flyover
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Meeting on airport flyover
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) met for the first time on Thursday to finalise the alignment of the proposed flyover to the airport.        
	The spot from where the flyover would take off would be decided after a joint inspection, said Sumantra Chowdhury, the additional chief secretary of the transport department, after the meeting at Writers Buildings.         
	Two sets of plans  one drafted by the AAI and another by the transport department  had been gathering dust for five months with officials concerned not meeting and deciding which one to execute.        
	According to the AAI plan, the flyover would extend 425m, from VIP Road to the airport premises. Another flyover would take off nearby and stretch to the new integrated terminal.        
	The transport department, on the other hand, had planned a flank of the flyover on Jessore Road.         
	The preliminary plan is to build a flyover from VIP Road dedicated to airport-bound vehicles. This will reduce traffic congestion on the road, said A.R. Bardhan, the secretary of the public works department (PWD). The land on which the flyover would come up belongs to PWD.        
	The final decision will be taken later. The cost for the Rs 200-crore project will be borne by the AAI, Bardhan added.        
	We expect to get the green light from the government soon, said R. Srinivasan, the airport director.

  Litter amp; leave poll army defiles schools          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                  (From top) Betel stains on a wall and the pathway at Modern High School for Girls; puffed rice and other leftovers litter Mahadevi Birla Girls rsquo; Higher Secondary School, and food packets, voting slips and empty water bottles strewn across a classroom floor at Shyambazar AV School on Monday.

	If Calcutta voted for change on Sunday, it did little to change the attitude of poll personnel who left their footprints of filth on schools across town that were used as ballot booths.        
	Several spick-and-span schools that recently underwent a summer-vacation makeover bore tell-tale signs of the poll plunder as authorities surveyed the damage the day after.        
	At Modern High School for Girls on Syed Amir Ali Avenue, walls sported betel stains, desks were daubed with ink, lac and wax, and scraps of paper and fly-infested food packets littered the tiled pathway.        
	We insist that our students keep their desks clean, and they do so. But poll officials have left the school in a mess. We had PVC sheets fixed to each door for notices but the poll officials chose to stick instructions on the polished wood instead, rued Devi Kar, the principal of Modern High.         
	The schools personnel officer, S. Sengupta, said he was contemplating sending the cleaning bill to the State Election Commission.        
	For Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, the invasion wont end until Friday. Our school was designated as a polling booth as well as a counting centre. I am told the toilets are already unusable. I shudder to think what the campus will look like by Friday, said principal Malini Bhagat.         
	A large pandal stands on the playground, reminiscent of the bamboo structure that had defiled the greens of National Library during the Lok Sabha polls last year. The grass has already been damaged, rued Bhagat.        
	Metros campaign to save National Library from the poll army had forced Delhi to later announce that the Alipore premises wont be requisitioned for any future election.        
	Shyambazar AV School and Scottish Church Collegiate School in north Calcutta also suffered the Monday poll blues with garbage strewn all over the campus, the classrooms littered with everything from cigarette butts to earthen cups, and the stink from the toilets unbearable.        
	We didnt have a choice when the election authorities asked for the school premises to turn it into a polling booth. But they should have at least cleaned the campus. Most of our cleaning staff are on leave because of the summer holidays; so we have had to spend extra money to hire people from outside to clear the mess, said Manoranjan Kumar Raptan, the headmaster of Shyambazar AV School.        
	The school reopens after the summer vacation on June 14, as does Modern High.        
	Scottish Church, scheduled to reopen on June 8, deployed a team of sweepers who spent two hours on Monday morning removing the garbage piled up in the four classrooms that were requisitioned.        
	Election officials paid the wages of only one sweeper. But how can one person clean this mess? We needed several people just to arrange the heavy desks that have iron frames, said a member of the cleaning team.         
	A couple of schools, however, did force the State Election Commission to foot the entire bill in accordance with the law, which states that a requisitioned premises must be restored to its original state. When a team of officials came for an inspection, I made it very clear that my staff must be paid to clean the campus, said Sunita Sen, the principal of Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan.         
	State election commissioner Mira Pande claimed her department would adhere to the law. We have issued standing instructions to the returning officers to restore the campuses to what they were.

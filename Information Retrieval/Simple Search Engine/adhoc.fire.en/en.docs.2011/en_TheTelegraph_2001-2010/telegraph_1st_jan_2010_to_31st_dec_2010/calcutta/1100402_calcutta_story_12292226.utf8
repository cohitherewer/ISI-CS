The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Subways to clear VIP clog
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Subways to clear VIP clog
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                          Pedestrians cross VIP Road at Baguiati                                  
	The congestion at three busy crossings on VIP Road is set to ease with the authorities planning to construct underpasses for pedestrians to cross the artery.        
	Work on the underpasses at Kestopur, Baguiati and Joramandir will start in three months and expected to be over in one-and-a-half years, a public works department official said.        
	The construction will be part of the project to build a 1.95km flyover along VIP Road, connecting Dum Dum Park and Teghoria.        
	PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said the Rs 2.5 crore that would require to construct the underpasses  each 75ft long and 15ft wide  would come from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.        
	The underpass at Kestopur will be dug a few yards from the bus stop while the one at Baguiati will be near the intersection used for pedestrian cross-over. At Teghoria, the subway will be constructed a few yards to the north of the electronic traffic signal.        
	On an average, around 100 people cross VIP Road per minute at Baguiati and Kestopur between 9am and 11am and from 6pm to 8pm on weekdays. At Teghoria, the figure stands at 30.         
	The rush-hour traffic density on the road has been calculated at 85 vehicles per second.        
	The congestion occurs because of so many people crossing the road. If over-the-road pedestrian movement can be stopped, traffic flow will be smooth, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	The traffic clog along the stretch is so much that it takes nearly half an hour every day to cover the stretch between Kestopur and Teghoria, said Saibal Chakrabarty, a software professional working at a firm in Salt Lake Sector V.         
	The Teghoria resident is looking forward to the completion of the underpasses for hassle-free ride to office and back home.

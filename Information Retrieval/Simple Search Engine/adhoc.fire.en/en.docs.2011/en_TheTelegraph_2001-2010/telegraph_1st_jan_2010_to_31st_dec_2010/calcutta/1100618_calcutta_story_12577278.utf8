	The high court on Thursday said a panel should be formed with representatives from various agencies to improve Howrahs sewerage system. A division bench, following a complaint by residents that multiple agencies are blaming each other for poor sewerage in Howrah, asked the civic body, irrigation department and other agencies to attend the next hearing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Risky ride in East-West corridor
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Risky ride in East-West corridor
                                              
	Two men died and 30 were injured last week when a truck carrying labourers overturned after skidding on slush on a road narrowed for the work on the East-West Metro in Salt Lake. The driver was jailed for the mishap. Metro drove along the East-West Metro construction site from City Centre to the Karunamoyee crossing and found many spots where mishaps might occur without any mistake by a driver.        
	Compressed course        
	A flank of the road has been closed to traffic and dug up for the construction of the elevated tracks of East-West Metro. As a result, vehicles moving in opposite directions are forced to share the 12ft carriageway. Minor mishaps are a regular affair because of the lack of space.        
	Slush from the construction site often spill on the road making it slippery and adding to the risk of accident. The stretches near City Centre, the Karunamoyee crossing, ILS Hospital, Mayukh Bhavan and Unnayan Bhavan are especially hazardous.        
	Last month, a car skidded on muck near Unnayan Bhavan and rammed into the tin barricade around the project site. The mishap, in which the driver was injured, was similar to the fatal one last week, said Chandan Maiti, a CMDA employee at Unnayan Bhavan.        
	Chancy channels        
	There are gaps in the barricades around the project site at three places to allow traffic movement from one flank to another. Vehicles, especially autorickshaws, make risky turns in these channels.        
	The passage opposite the Central Park fairground entrance often gets choked, causing long snarls. Trucks carrying construction material add to the chaos.        
	Two weeks ago, an autorickshaw hit my car after making a sharp turn through the channel. The road remains clogged during peak hours because the channels get choked easily, said Arup Chowdhury, a resident of DD block.        
	Cops, lights missing        
	North 24-Parganas police had trained around 50 East-West Metro employees to man traffic along the stretch. According to motorists, not more than five of them can be seen during the day and none at night or on holidays.        
	Making matters worse, most of the stretch is devoid of streetlights.        
	It is too risky to drive along this stretch with cops absent and large trucks plying in the dark. I take a de tour to my CE block home, said Soudip Mitra, a techie.        
	Pedestrian peril        
	The service roads and pavements on the stretch are hardly any better. The service roads are muddy and often blocked by parked cars. The pavements are broken or encroached upon by shops and shanties.        
	The stretch between Indira Bhavan and the Karunamoyee crossing is a nightmare for pedestrians with no streetlights and no pavements. Work on water pipeline has reduced the road width near Indira Bhavan. Pedestrians have no option but to walk down the middle of the road.              
	Official version: I will check whether the Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation (KMRC) men responsible for manning traffic are doing their job and whether mud is spilling on the road from the project site, said Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of Bidhannagar police.        
	Our employees man traffic 24x7. We regularly take the suggestion of police officers on matters related to traffic. As soon as we complete work on a stretch we restore it for smooth traffic flow, said a senior KMRC official.

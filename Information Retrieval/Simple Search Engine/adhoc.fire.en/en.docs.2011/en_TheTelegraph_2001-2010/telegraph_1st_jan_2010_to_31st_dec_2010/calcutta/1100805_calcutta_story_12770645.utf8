The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | BUDDHAS SHOWPIECE IS CRATER CAPITAL
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      BUDDHAS SHOWPIECE IS CRATER CAPITAL
  - Potholes pose as roads and slush replaces software as symbol					 					      Pothole Peril - TT For City                      Sector V College More              Sec V Technopolis		              Rajarhat Road		                          
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees showpiece tech town is resembling the state of his governance  lurching from one crisis crater to another.        
	The streets of Sector V are potholed beyond recognition  perhaps better than the chief ministers predicament which, many would say, is beyond redemption  and a nightmare for motorists.        
	Metro limped through the high-speed stretch to pinpoint the problem points.        
	Spot the road        
	Huge potholes  some over 12 feet in diameter  have replaced the road surface in front of Technopolis, at the Nayapatti crossing and between the Nayapatti crossing and the SDF connector. If this is bad, the stretches between Ayurveda More and College More and between the Webel and College More are worse off. Here, potholes  or rather trenches  apart, the road surface has been washed away.        
	Not just the traffic is in slow-mo mode. We are deferring visits of our executives from abroad because of the pathetic conditions here during the rains, said Soumya Ganguly, a deputy manager with an IT firm. What impression of the facilities in the city will they get if they pass through these wretched stretches, demanded Ganguly, who has stopped driving his car to office and switched to a taxi.        
	He is not the only one.        
	Clogged corridor        
	If the potholes dont trip you, the dug-up parts near College More  for the laying of water and sewerage pipelines  will. This two-year-long operation has shut down one flank, turning the five-minute ride from the Nayapatti crossing to Wipro into a 40-minute ordeal. The opposite flank is a congested cesspool. The traffic just does not move during rush hour, said a traffic constable at his wits end.              
	Pavement plight        
	With the roads waterlogged and clogged, a number of vehicles are rolling over the median dividers  crushing signboards screaming Beautiful Nabadiganta  and even the pavements, or what remains of them.        
	The footpaths are either dug up or being used by vehicles trying to avoid potholes and traffic snarls. Where are we supposed to walk? wondered Atryee Chatterjee, a management student.        
	Danger drive        
	The Rajarhat Expressway, near the Sector V side, has also been mauled. Stonechips are flying and the wheels struggling to get a grip. Its extremely dangerous, said Rupam Saha, on his bike.        
	Victim        
	Its tough to work under these poor circumstances. The authorities must take some serious steps soon, said Kalyan Kar, the secretary of the Sector V stakeholders association.        
	Official        
	All Sector V roads need to be repaired once the sewerage work is completed. We hope to start work next month, said an executive engineer of the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority.

	IIT Kharagpur organised a workshop on Robotics and Data Base Management System (DBMS), in collaboration with Directi, at GD Birla Sabhagar recently. Technical colleges from Calcutta, Kalyani, Jamshedpur and Bhubaneswar attended the event.         
	It gave the visiting students a feel of what they can expect at the IIT Kharagpur fest, Kshitij, to be held from January 28 to 31 next year.         
	For starters, the participants were shown glimpses of Kshitij 2010 through a power-point presentation. Ayushi Singh Rathore, the organising team head of Kshitij, said: This pre-fest workshop has been organised to give other students an idea on how to make a robot. It is also a way of encouraging them to display their technical skills in Kshitij 2011.        
	Suhrud Karandikar, a student of economics, and Pratyush Pande, a student of electronics and electrical communications engineering at IIT-Kharagpur, conducted an interactive session on autonomous robot-making.         
	They simplified technical terms like differential drive and autonomous line follower, enabling the audience to understand the subject better.         
	Shuttling between high school physics and complex terminology, the presenters kept the audience glued to their seats till the end of the presentation. The demonstration of the autonomous robot model won them a huge round of applause from the audience.         
	Robotics is a brilliant topic in itself. The presentation made it even more interesting, said Anshu Kumar, a second year BTech student of JIS College of Engineering, after the session.         
	Next in line was a written quiz on the robotics workshop. There were prizes for those who got their answers right. The participants were also informed of the events in the upcoming techno-management fest.         
	Representatives from Directi stepped in to throw light on DBMS. The IBM Technical Quiz Contest will be a new event in Kshitij 2011. The DBMS presentation will help students get a better insight into the event, said Harshvardhan Yadav, an IIT Kharagpur student and the head of finance at Kshitij.         
	Those giving correct answers during the DBMS presentation and interaction round were awarded T-shirts or books.        
	The workshop was very informative. I plan to participate in the Robotics round in Kshitij. The goodies up for grabs added to the fun-quotient of the event, said Soralina Paul, from Institute of Technology and Marine Engineering.

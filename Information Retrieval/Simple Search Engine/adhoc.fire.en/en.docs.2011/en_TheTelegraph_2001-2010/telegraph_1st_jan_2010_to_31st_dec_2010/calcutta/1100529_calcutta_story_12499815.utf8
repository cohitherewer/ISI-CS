                      Music from the South                    Music is one of lifes greatest pleasures that rejuvenates the weary soul. Calcutta used to be the prima donna of classical musical soirees, but times have changed and gone are those night-long musical conferences and the frenzy of the masses to listen to some of the legends gracing those venues and performing live. Only a handful of the organisations are still striving to hold on to the rich cultural heritage, presenting a potpourri of upcoming and well-known classical performers for the discerning listeners annually. Rasikhapriya is one such organisation that has been instrumental in spreading and popularising Carnatic music in this part of the country. An institution that needs no introduction, Rasikhapriya holds two separate series of programmes. Now on its 18th year, the mid-year series showcases the talents of upcoming artistes annually. The three-day festival which began yesterday features vocal recital by K. Gayatri (at 4.15 pm) accompanied by R. Raghul (violin) and Mannarkoil J. Balaji (mridangam) to be followed by vocalist Madurai T.N.S. Krishna along with V.V. Ravi on the violin and Kallidaikurichi S. Sivakumar on the mridangam at 6.30 pm today. On the concluding day tomorrow, the programme begins at 3.30 pm with Waves, the rhythm and melody ensemble by members of Layavinyas, to be conducted by N. Shankar. This will be followed by Dr Subhasini Parthasarathys vocal recital, accompanied by R. Raghul on violin and Mannarkoil Balaji on mridangam. The festival concludes with V. Shankaranarayanans vocal recital, with V.V. Ravi (violin) and Kallidaikurichi S. Sivakumar (mridangam).

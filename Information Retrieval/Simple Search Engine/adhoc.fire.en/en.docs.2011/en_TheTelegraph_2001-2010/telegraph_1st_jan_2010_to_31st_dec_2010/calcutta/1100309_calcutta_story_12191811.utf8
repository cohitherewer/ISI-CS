	Large parts of north and central Calcutta suffered prolonged power cuts on Monday afternoon, inconveniencing Madhyamik candidates in several schools on the last day of their exam.        
	CESC officials said a fault in the 33KV switchgear at the utilitys 240MW Titagarh generating station led to a partial collapse of the transmission network, necessitating loadshedding of 150MW. We immediately launched efforts to resume supply, said a CESC spokesperson.        
	Madhyamik examinees were among the worst sufferers as the disruption coincided with the test hours, when the mercury was at its peak.        
	There was no power at Peary Charan Girls School in Shyambazar during a visit by a secondary education board team led by president Mamata Ray. Students were inconvenienced but the supply resumed within 10 minutes, Ray said.        
	Power minister Nirupam Sen said the supply across the state was affected as several generation units collapsed for various reasons around the same time. Four units at Titagarh and one each at Santaldih and Sagardighi were out for a while today, Sen said at Writers.        
	The minister claimed there had not been any major disruption but reports suggest power cuts ranged between 60 and 90 minutes in north and central Calcutta.         
	Even a wing of Writers Buildings went without power from 12.07pm to 12.29pm but the PWD attributed it to a snag in the local grid.        
	Math muddle        
	A section of the examinees said question 13a (carrying four marks) in the Bengali version had mixed up the units, while 10b, of five marks, was from outside the curriculum.        
	State secondary education board president Mamata Ray admitted the error in 13a and announced that students would be awarded marks regardless of which unit they had used to solve the problem.        
	The allegation over question 10b, she added, has been referred to an expert panel.

                      Printmaking to print art                    The language of printmaking is soft, intimate and unobtrusive. Working with black and white or very few colours, a printmaker inspires power in his works through the effect of simple lines. In this medium, lines portray the moods of nature or the feelings of the heart; it can express wit, humour and pathos or even the flights of vivid, artistic imagination. Influenced and inspired by his stay in Lucknow as a student of Sufi literature, Shyam Sharma became interested in printmaking as a form of expression. Since then, he has devoted his entire artistic career to exploring and discovering the infinite possibilities offered by this fascinating medium. Whereas his earliest series of linocuts and woodcut lithographs shows the dilemma of an artist of the post-Independence era, his later works are more philosophical, even existential. Some of his works reflect life activities and its collaboration with nature through sensitive spectacles of wit and sarcasm. The ongoing show of his recent printworks is based on Indian culture and spiritualism. These prints reproduce through clay blocks with a collage of old manuscripts.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Jadavpur University teachers did not take classes to press for their demands on Wednesday, days after criticising students for disrupting campus activities by gheraoing the executive council members.         
	Nearly 650 arts, science and engineering teachers associated with the CPM-backed Jadavpur University Teachers Association took part in the two-day-long demonstration that included the ceasework. They want immediate payment of salary dues and raising of the retirement age.         
	The central government must release funds to clear our arrears and the state government should increase the retirement age from 60 to 65 years, said Partha Pratim Biswas, an executive council member and a teacher of the engineering faculty.         
	Biswas was among the 15 council members of the university whom the students had gheraoed for 52 hours last week to oppose plans to boost security on the campus by installing closed-circuit television cameras.         
	Classes in almost all the departments in the arts and engineering faculties were hit by Wednesdays ceasework.         
	Some honours examinations and several extra departmental (pass) ones had to be postponed. Not a single class in the international relations department was held on Wednesday, said Swati Bhattacharya, a third-year student of the subject.         
	Students who did not know about the ceasework returned home after coming to the university, said another student.         
	Some teachers took classes in the English department but the engineering departments were virtually shut down.         
	These are the same teachers who denounced our gherao of the council members. Now they do not mind bringing academic activities to a standstill, said Abhishek Roy, a third-year civil engineering student who is one of the two student members of the executive council.         
	The maximum number of classes was held in the science department. Despite the ceasework, several classes were held, said Sayan Patra, the general secretary of the science faculty students union.         
	Along with raising the salaries of the teachers, the sixth pay commission had recommended that the retirement age of teachers in state universities be raised to 65 years, similar to that in central universities.         
	Though the recommendations were made in 2008, they are supposed to be implemented with retrospective effect from January 1, 2006. But as the state government has not increased the retirement age, the Centre has not released the funds.        
	We have not received the arrears of 39 months, said a Juta member.         
	The teachers threatened to continue their agitation if the ceasework did not evoke any response from the state and central governments.

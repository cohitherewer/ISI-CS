          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A school teacher with a critical throat ailment has been allowed to use a microphone in class after seven years of struggle.         
	On Tuesday, the management of Gangapur Girls School in south Calcutta informed assistant teacher Soma Sadhukhan in writing that she could henceforth use a public address system in class.         
	Sadhukhan, in her late-30s, had moved the high court after the school management refused to allow her to use a microphone. Justice Dipankar Dutta, acting on the petition, directed the school education department last June to consider her prayer with sympathy. The judge also asked the principal secretary to look into the matter.        
	In October, the principal secretary directed the school management to allow Sadhukhan to use a microphone but to no avail. The principal secretary then issued a stricture against the school management, the lawyer representing the teacher told the high court on Thursday.        
	Doctors at NRS hospital and Calcutta Medical College and Hospital had said after examining Sadhukhan that she would lose her voice if she was not allowed to use a microphone. The authorities however had stuck to their stand that there was no provision to allow microphones till Tuesday.

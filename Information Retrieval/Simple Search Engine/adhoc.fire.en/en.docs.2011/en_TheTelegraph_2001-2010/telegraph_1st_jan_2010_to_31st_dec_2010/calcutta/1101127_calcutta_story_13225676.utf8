The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rule to rein in the cane
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rule to rein in the cane
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Bengal is poised to enact a legislation prohibiting physical torture and mental harassment of children in schools and providing for punishment to offenders, turning what was a mere set of guidelines into the rule of law.         
	A gazette notification was issued on November 24 to frame rules in accordance with the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education, 2009, which prohibits physical and mental harassment of children, education secretary Vikram Sen told Calcutta High Court on Friday.        
	This is the most decisive step yet by the government to prevent corporal punishment in schools that still speak the language of spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child.         
	In Calcutta, corporal punishment  banned by the Supreme Court a decade ago  came into sharp focus following La Martiniere student Rouvanjit Rawlas suicide last February after being caned and allegedly humiliated at school.        
	In 2008, eight-year-old schoolgirl Iftesham Chowdhury went into coma and didnt regain consciousness after her yoga teacher allegedly slapped her so hard that she rammed her head against a wall.        
	The states guidelines for schools on how to maintain discipline without resorting to corporal punishment have been in existence since 2009, but hardly followed in the absence of a law or mechanism to monitor compliance.        
	Education secretary Sen told the division bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice Asim Roy that the draft of the legislation had been sent to the law department. It will be later placed before academicians and other experts.        
	Although it wont be a criminal law with specific punishment for violations, legal experts said offenders could be tried and penalised under the IPC.        
	The bench advised the secretary to include a provision for the appointment of a qualified counsellor for each district to guide parents, children and educators. The central law has such a provision. Counsellors should be empowered to keep vigil on schools and visit parents and students, said advocate Tapas Bhanja, whose PIL against caning schoolchildren was the starting point for judicial intervention.

                      Into a virtual world                    In the modern day socio-religious context, technology and mankinds quest to a virtual godhood collide with religious myth, superstition and ritual. Faith is in a constant state of flux and a means of perpetuating disputes. In Who Are You, Defenders Of The Universe? Pakistani artist Mehreen Murtaza explores a brand new frontier of consciousness where todays electronic ether confronts time-honoured importance of religion and the sacred foundation of all things created. Her works provoke irresolvable mental collisions of the strange with the familiar. As an allegory of human life, Murtazas emphatic theatricality suggests an idealised landscape suspect for the misguided illusions of the Absolute. Her visual narratives intertwine a traditional background with popular culture. Absorbing both Sufi influences and the skewed logic of science fiction, her digital collages are a virtual world that harnesses intelligent fictions. Through her work, the viewer confronts the devastation and bereftness of religious iconography and symbols that hold us steady in the world. An atmosphere of subversion is borne directly out of todays socio-religious context, wherein modern-day computing and technology collide with religious myth, superstition and ritual. This exhibition is presented by Experimenter in collaboration with GreyNoise, Lahore.                  Event: Who Are You, Defenders Of The Universe?  a solo show by Pakistani artist Mehreen Murtaza.

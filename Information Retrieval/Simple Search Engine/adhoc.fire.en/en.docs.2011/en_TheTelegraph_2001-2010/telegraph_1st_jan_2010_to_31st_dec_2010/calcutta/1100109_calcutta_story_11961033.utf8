                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A study in culture contrasts
  - Mamatas date with screen glam, Buddhas with fine arts          OUR BUREAU                        Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee (top), Mamata Banerjee. (Anindya Shankar Ray, Amit Datta)				                                             
	Fine arts for him, pulp fiction for her. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee had a date with contrasting cultures on Friday evening.        
	The chief minister was surrounded by artists young and veteran at the unveiling of the 52nd National Exhibition of Art presented by Lalit Kala Akademi with the state department of information and cultural affairs. The aspirant to his chair was besieged by a bevy of Tollywood belles and boys at the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Tapan Sinha Memorial Metro Hospital.        
	Mamata couldnt stop smiling  or singing  as Team Tollywood took the stage to shower her with admiration and respect. From Rituparna Sengupta to Rituparno Ghosh, Ranjit Mullick to Rachana Banerjee, Debasree Roy to Indrani Halder, Jisshu to Jeet, they all sang paeans to the railway minister.        
	Mamata, on her part, kept referring to her guests as a galaxy, delivered a thanksgiving speech on the celluloid stage before joining the stars on a singathon of We Shall Overcome, in English, Bengali and Hindi.        
	Her arch-rivals cultural tryst was, in contrast, a sombre affair. Im very happy to be here to inaugurate this exhibition which is being held in this city after 25 years. Weve been in government for three decades and have always tried to promote art and culture in our state, said Bhattacharjee, after browsing through the exhibition gallery at ICCR.        
	The man who takes pride in his cultural credentials admitted that the state still lacked a proper set-up, but added: We will have our own modern art gallery, with the help of some corporates, on 10 acres of land in Rajarhat and a preliminary budget of Rs 500 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A para of music and its precious metal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A para of music and its precious metal

	Naktala and metal music is not an equation every man on the street will crack. Right in the heart of this bustling southern city suburb though lies an old-world para that takes its metal seriously. So much so that its named after the music it hails.         
	Over the past three years, Naktala Metal Palli (or NMP, as its founders and followers refer to it) has grown into a bona fide neighbourhood, critics be damned.        
	And what started with a handful of youngsters passionate about their music and musical idols has grown into a full-blown subculture where not just metal but all forms of original music are encouraged.        
	On March 31, the founders of the Palli  a close-knit bunch of about 10 young men released their first independent collection of metal music at Guitar Centre Tolly, off Anwar Shah Road. In characteristic DIY approach, the album  simply called Naktala Metal Palli Volume I  was released on NMP (the acronym for the Palli) Records.        
	Featuring five bands from Calcutta, one from Delhi, two acts from across the border in Bangladesh and one each from France and Finland, NMP Vol. I is a coming-of-age stamp for a music form still largely considered underground, even in the close-knit rocknroll fraternity in town.        
	The Palli itself got its name in 2007, off a stray comment in a band competition about the metal groups from the neighbourhood. Nitric Dreams and Amavasya had gone on to compete in the contest, when Gaurab Chatterjee, the drummer for Lakkhichhara and one of the musicians judging the competition, spoke of how both bands from the Naktala para played metal music, thus defining the area as metal palli. The sobriquet stuck.        
	Along with Rikterskale, the three mother bands founded the Palli the same year. In May 2007, NMP organised its first independent concert at the Naktala Banhi grounds, featuring Amavasya, Nitric Dreams, Atmahatya, Safire, Versus and YOG from Durgapur.         
	The show was a tribute to Moheener Ghoraguli founder Gautam Chattopadhyay, who hailed from the neighbourhood. We had no sponsors. We basically organised the show with subscriptions, donations and with help from our friends. But even without any advertisement, we had a turnout of over 700 people, recalls NMP president Roopam Chowdhury.         
	The next show was almost two years later, in 2009; a ticketed event at Yogesh Mime Academy. It was about this time that preconceptions of the Pallis bias towards metal were worked on: this NMP show featured folk-tinged rockers Jackrabbit.        
	Metal music remains a big part of our philosophy, but is not the sole genre of music we would like to put on our platform. So, we invited bands from other genres to be part of the NMP movement, which stands for original music, in any language or genre, explains Roopam.        
	With this motive, NMP was officially launched in 2008, with four bands enrolled in its roster so far: Kripa, Moshpit, Chronic Xorn and Flashflood. To build funds, these bands pay a monthly subscription of Rs 50 per member, while members of mother bands and core members pay Rs 100 each. The funds are for organising gigs on a regular basis.         
	Interests of these bands are handled by a core crew of six: Roopam as president handles management duties, Nilanjan Ghosh, himself a talented tabla player, is vice-president, Sudipto Johnny Sarkar is secretary, while Tushar Banerjee is assistant secretary. Subhajit Kar acts as treasurer, while Shovan Mukherjee handles production.        
	For the NMP Vol. 1 release, Surjo Mitra had handled photography, while the artwork was credited to Dwijendra Singh.        
	The independent album, released at Guitar Centre Tolly near the Anwar Shah Road-Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road intersection, features five bands from Calcutta  Amavasya, Rikterskale, Kripa, Moshpit and Chronic Xorn, along with 1833 AD from Delhi, Powersurge and Satanik from Bangladesh, Dehumanize from France and Godspit from Finland.        
	The album is distributed from a few well-known haunts of the citys young and musically-inclined: the Guitar Centre Tolly and Vibrations on Mirza Ghalib Street. Incidentally, it is free. Just pick up and taste the music, say the NMP gang.        
	On the anvil is producing bands: If up-and-comers approach us to record demos, we will bear half the production cost. And we will let them own their rights to their songs, says Shovan, who also plays bass with Jackrabbit.         
	The boys also plan to tie up with a live venue in town to offer more gigs to bands on their roster.  
	Naktala Metal Palli         
	Naktala Metal Palli (NMP) was founded in 2007, with members of three bands based in and around Naktala.  
	Despite its name, the Palli rsquo;s focus is not restricted to metal music. It supports original music of all styles and in any language.   
	The Palli came out with its first independent album NMP Volume 1 (picture right), released under its own label, NMP Records. It features five bands from the city, along with two bands from Bangladesh and one each from France and Finland. The album was released on March 31.  
	Plans are on to tie up with a few live venues in town to promote bands on the NMP roster.

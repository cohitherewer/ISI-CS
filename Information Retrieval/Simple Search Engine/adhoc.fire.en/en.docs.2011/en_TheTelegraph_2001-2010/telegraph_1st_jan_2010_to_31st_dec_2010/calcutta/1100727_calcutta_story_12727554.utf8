                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Birdie for bonding on the Royal greens
  - 360 golfers split into 90 teams to tee off at the four-day Telegraph Cup Golf 2010           A STAFF REPORTER                          GRANDMASTER OF THE GREENS: Bunny Lakshman Singh has been a regular since 1977                                      
	The monsoon may mean romance to some and relief to others, but for those wielding their irons on the greens it can only mean one thing  the signal for the birdies to bond with biz.        
	For, KKN presents The Telegraph Cup Golf 2010 in association with Senbo and Ballantines tees off at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) on Tuesday. The mercantile meet dates back to 1906 and has been played ever since at the Royal, except during the World Wars.        
	This time there are 360 golfers, who form 90 teams, comprising four members each. Such a big response is a reflection of the deep-rooted corporate culture in Calcutta. Its on a scale incomparable to the few entries we get in Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore. Even young entrepreneurs have realised the advantages of bonding over a game, said Brandon de Souza of Tiger Sports Marketing, which drives the tourney.        
	No surprise then that this years Cup has a new presenting sponsor, KKN, led by a 37-year-old. Were here to support the game. I think its great that people from small towns like Jamshedpur and Duliajan and Digboi in Assam come here for this four-day long party. Its as much about having fun as building ties, said Kausshik Kr Nath, the director of KKN Group of Companies.                        Kausshik Kr Nath: Tee-off for ties      
	The fun that started in 1906 with Geo Henderson amp; Co taking home  or office in this case  the Cup, saw Madhya Bharat Papers Ltd come out on top for the past two years. Teams expected to run them close this time include Tata Steel, McLeod Russel, Williamson Magor, dark horse GI Securities and new entrant The Sonnet.        
	When I first played for the Cup in 1977, it was strictly for corporates but now the game has branched out to include small businesses and individuals. Its also become a lot more competitive, said Bunny Lakshman Singh of Williamson Magor, a regular since 1977. At the same time, its all about having fun  after a game, you will find us hanging out at the Third Shamiana. It still generates the same excitement.        
	Recent changes in the format of the competition have also made things easier for many.                                
	The format is now scratch-stroke-play, which basically means that everyone is at the same level. We have created a way to bring in parity  for example, a pro like Lakshman Singh may be playing, but a person with a 9-handicap can drop his worst two holes and therefore stay in the game. Its a great way to create that bridge, said Brandon.        
	Also, the format allows the chairman of a company to play with the middle manager. It becomes a no-barriers kind of a game, he added.        
	The change in format has generated more interest and pushed up numbers. Six-seven years ago, there were around 200 golfers, today the count is 360. You dont have to be a top-notch player, even an average golfer has a chance to win, said M.M. Singh, the CEO of RCGC, referring to the turnout on the practice range the morning before tee-off.        
	But doesnt the rain play spoilsport? The Cup is associated with mid-monsoon and the monsoon spirit never dies. Also, 10 years ago, golfers would tee off in the puddle but improved facilities have improved chances of winning, said Singh.        
	Not convinced? Then hear out Jaydeep Chitlangia, the chairman of the organising committee Once during a game, it was raining and a small depression on the course turned into a rivulet. The caddie carried the golfer on his shoulders across the water and then returned for his bag, recalled the MD of Madhya Bharat Papers Ltd.        
	The Cup wraps up on Friday night with casuals and champagne, music and merriment taking over at the Oberoi Grand as city band Colours and DJ Akash take the stage.

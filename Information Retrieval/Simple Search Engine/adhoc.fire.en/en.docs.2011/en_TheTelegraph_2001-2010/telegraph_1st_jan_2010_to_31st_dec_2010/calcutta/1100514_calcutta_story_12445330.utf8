	Twenty-three boys going to school in a ramshackle private bus had a lucky escape on BT Road on Thursday morning when the vehicle smashed through the divider to the other flank and collided with a mini-van.        
	Arkaprabha Banik of Class II received eight stitches and Somnath Roy of Class IV one stitch on their heads. The two were sitting in the drivers cabin of the bus, which was carrying nine students more than its capacity of 14.        
	The mishap occurred outside the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) main gate, as the bus carrying students of Ramakrishna Mission Centenary Primary School tried to overtake a lorry loaded with cement. As the goods vehicle veered right, the other driver lost control. The bus first rammed into the divider and then crossed over to the other flank.        
	Witnesses said that if it did not collide with a three-wheeler mini-van coming from the opposite direction, it would have toppled over and the children inside would have sustained more serious injuries.         
	The bus and the lorry were coming from the Dunlop side. The bus driver lost control in the attempt to overtake the lorry, said Bimal Mondal, the driver of the mini-van, who was detained by police.        
	The driver of the lorry was also detained but the bus driver managed to flee.        
	An ISI employee who saw the mishap said: The condition of the bus was so bad that the front wheels came off after the collision. It is a miracle that there was no loss of life.         
	The incident is a reminder of how parents are forced to depend on private transport operators, who often flout road norms in the absence of checks by the government.        
	Arkas father Subrata Banik said parents of the boys who travelled on the bus had repeatedly asked the operator to maintain it better, but to no avail. The bus was not fit to ferry children. But we did not have a choice, said Subrata.         
	Transport department guidelines prohibit passengers from sitting in the drivers cabin. The guidelines also stress the need for adequate space for passengers to move inside the bus. The vehicle that met with the accident, however, had an extra row of seats in the middle to accommodate more students.         
	The transport department is responsible for ensuring that all vehicles that ply are road-worthy. But the safety of the citizens is being compromised by rampant corruption and red tape, said an official of the department.        
	Traffic sergeants too should have checked the buss papers since it was carrying so many children despite being in such a shape, added the official.

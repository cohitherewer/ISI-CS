The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Toll 30 as hammer looms
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Toll 30 as hammer looms

	Six more bodies were found under the debris on the fifth floor of fire-ravaged Stephen Court on Friday even as residents were allowed to enter the building by turns for the first time since the blaze.        
	Police said the decomposed bodies, which took the toll in the citys worst-ever fire tragedy to 30, could be those of some of the persons reported missing. The stench was unbearable as we cleared the debris. The search for bodies will continue on Saturday, said a fire department official.        
	Earlier in the day, the high court dealt a blow to residents of the upper floors of Stephen Court by allowing the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to pull down the highly damaged portions. The court modified Thursdays interim stay on demolition, saying the CMC could pull down the perilous portions after the occupants drew up a list each of their belongings.         
	The revised order came while occupants of Stephen House were queuing up to enter the seven-storeyed building for half-an-hour each by turns. Poignant scenes were witnessed outside the landmark structure as residents waited to enter two at a time and came out with suitcases full of belongings and tears in their eyes.        
	Around the same time, CMC counsel Alok Ghosh was submitting photographs in the high court to support the petition against the interim stay on demolition obtained by 16 flat owners.                                 
	 The CMCs first duty is to clear the debris. But how can it accomplish this task if the court bars it from demolishing the highly damaged portions visible in these photographs? Also, if the debris is not removed, how will the occupants enter their flats and draw up lists of their belongings? counsel Alok Ghosh argued.        
	Justice G.C. Gupta issued a revised order stating that the petitioners be allowed to enter their flats and business establishments first under supervision.         
	Two persons from each of the 16 flats on the fifth and sixth floors of blocks II and III of Stephen Court will submit their photo-identities to the CMC. The CMC will take them to their respective flats to draw up a list each of their belongings. A copy each of the lists should be given to the CMC, which can then start demolishing the highly damaged portions of the building, states the order.         
	Ashok Banerjee, the lawyer appearing for the residents, had opposed the demolition order on the ground that the CMC wouldnt take responsibility of the petitioners belongings.         
	 My clients do not want demolition. They are very anxious about their belongings. Will the CMC take responsibility of these articles? Demolition should not be allowed until the occupants are allowed to salvage their belongings.        
	After the revised order was issued, Banerjee requested that the CMC be asked to carry out demolition between 10am and 5pm to minimise the possibility of theft. Justice Gupta turned down the plea, saying that only experts can say how and when the demolition job should be done.         
	City police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti later announced a series of regulations meant to ensure that the Stephen Court tragedy is not repeated.        
	Submitting plans and drawings of all buildings of 14.5 metres and above with the local police stations will be mandatory from now on. There was no copy of the Stephen House layout with any of the caretakers when rescue and firefighting operations were being carried out, which was a big handicap, said Chakrabarti.        
	Layouts of highrises will also have to be displayed in a conspicuous place in the buildings as part of the preventive disaster management plan.        
	The police commissioner said that a central team comprising officers of the CMC, fire brigade and the CESC would be formed under special commissioner of police Banibrata Basu to co-ordinate the implementation of the regulations.         
	 The team will initially focus on 32 marketplaces and 12 multi-storied buildings in Calcutta that are known to be fire-prone. The team will instruct the caretakers of all these buildings how to implement the safety measures and take suitable action if anyone does not fall in line.        
	Chakrabarti also announced a proposal to form a special unit of the Disaster Management Group with 130 trained police personnel. This unit will be exclusively for handling highrise disasters.        
	Governor M.K.Narayanan summoned home secretary Ardhendu Sen, police commissioner Chakrabarti and fire services chief Jogesh Chattopadhayay to brief him on the measures taken so far in connection with the Stephen Court tragedy.         
	Narayanan, who had visited Park Street on Wednesday, asked the officials to ensure that those displaced by the fire were rehabilitated.        
	A source at Raj Bhavan said the governor might call fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee next.

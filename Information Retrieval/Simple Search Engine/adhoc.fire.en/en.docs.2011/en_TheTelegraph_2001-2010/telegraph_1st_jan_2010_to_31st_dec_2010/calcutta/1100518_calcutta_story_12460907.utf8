                      Colours and ideas        At its annual summer show, Tejas Gallery presents mixed artworks   by artists like Dhiren Sasmal, Saikat Maity, Ujjwal Debnath (a paint  ing by him appears here), Dhananjoy Saha, Tanay Kumar Paul, Viraag   Desai, Subhash Pal, Sambhu Saha, Subrata Sen, Sujit Kumar Gho-sh,   Nitya Kundu and others. The artists have adapted their medium to their   theme, in order to produce works that speak both through their images   and their execution. Saikat Maitys watercolours of a rain-drenched city   are a perfect example of this amalgam of theme and medium. Viraag   Desais Passion of Blue Tara is inspired by the vocabulary and patterns   of Tibetan mandalas, but is executed in a textured style unique to the   young artist. Dhiren Sasmal seduces his viewers with his dexterous for  mal structure which portrays the ethereal world of fantasy. When he   works with folk tales of Bengal, his paintings reflect the sobriety of Ben  gal art within his multi-layered structural compositions. Apparently   childlike in form and content, the paintings of Subhash Pal echo por  tents of danger lurking behind innocence. The works of Nitya Kundu are   inspired by folk and religious legends, while Ujjwal Debnath paints pic  tures of piety, prayer and devotion.

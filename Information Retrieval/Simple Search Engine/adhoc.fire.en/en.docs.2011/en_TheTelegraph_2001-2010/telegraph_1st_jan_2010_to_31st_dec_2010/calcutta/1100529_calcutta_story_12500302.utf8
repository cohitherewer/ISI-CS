          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                      water man      Name Sovan Chatterjee
  Age 47 
  Qualification				 BSc, LlB 
  Profession				 Business 
  Contesting from				 Ward 131 (covering Behala Parnasree, Netaji Subhas Road, Upen Banerjee Road and Jinjira Khal) on a Trinamul Congress ticket
  Political career Started out as a Chhatra Parishad activist. Later joined the Trinamul Congress. Won all five civic elections since 1985; lost the 2006 Assembly polls from Behala West by 26,000 votes. Chairman of the borough XIV committee since 2000 
  Agenda To develop rundown parts of his ward and prevent waterlogging in the area
  Unwinds by				 Listening to Rabindrasangeet and watching movies. Aamir Khan is his favourite actor 
  One thing people don rsquo;t know about him				 Walked out of a screening of Taare Zameen Par as he couldn rsquo;t bear little Ishaan rsquo;s plight in the hostel. He later watched the remaining part of the film on DVD                                
	He came to be known as Jol Sovan after becoming the mayoral council member in charge of water 10 years back and seems to be enjoying his moniker. Sovan Chatterjee even has a framed cartoon of himself holding a water pipe in his plush office in Behala Parnasree.        
	Chatterjee is a five-time councillor from ward 132 in Behala. This time he is contesting from the neighbouring ward 131, his home ward. And many in the Trinamul camp are betting on him as mayor.         
	He won the last polls by a handsome margin of 2,187 votes and a walk along the two wards shows why. Sovan Chatterjee is everywhere. Eight out of 10 people know the directions to his palatial home in Parnasree.         
	The house itself is the subject of much debate among his detractors. He travels in four cars and owns a huge house with marble floors. From where did he acquire so much money? wonders CPM supporter Rupam Chowdhury, who lives in ward 132.        
	But theres no denying Chatterjees popularity in the area. Chatterjee is accessible any time of the day. Even if he is unable to attend to a problem himself, he deputes someone to take care of it, says Goutam Adhikari, a resident of Upen Banerjee Road.        
	Chatterjees old ward shows signs of care with well maintained roads, functioning street lights, cleared garbage dumps and well-constructed parks and gardens, especially the one around Parnasree lake         
	Chatterjee is confident of winning the May 30 polls, buoyed by the fact that ward 131 has shunned the Left since the very first election.        
	I revolutionised the supply of treated drinking water in Calcutta, Chatterjee says of himself. He recalls how he took a loan to set up booster pumping stations across the city. I increased the generation capacity of the Garden Reach water treatment plant from 40 million gallon to 120 million gallon a day, he announces proudly.        
	In his ward, the problem of waterlogging needs immediate attention, he feels. I plan to install a booster pumping station in Behala once we form the board. I also want to develop the border areas of my ward like Guhapara, he added.        
	Known as a close aide of Mamata Banerjee, Chatterjee does not rule out his chances of becoming mayor.        
	Mamata Banerjee is like my guardian... if she asks me to handle the responsibility (of the mayors chair), I am ready for it. I will lift the city to international standards in just five years, he promises.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mercury nudges decade low in December
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mercury nudges decade low in December
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    
	Wednesday was the second coldest December day this decade.        
	The minimum temperature touched 11.3 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal, at Alipore and 10.3 degrees Celsius, a couple of notches below normal, at Dum Dum, after an overnight dip.        
	December 28 last year, when Alipore recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius, was the coldest day of the month this decade.        
	On Tuesday, the minimum at Alipore was 13.2 degrees Celsius. At Dum Dum, it was 11.8 degrees Celsius.        
	Meteorologists attributed the Celsius drop to a cold wave in north and central India. Similar conditions are prevailing in four south Bengal districts  Bankura, Burdwan, Purulia and West Midnapore.         
	According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the northerlies and the northwesterlies that contribute to the winter cold in Calcutta have been colder than usual this week because of their journey over the cold wave-hit north and central India.        
	The North Wind usually loses much of its sting by the time it reaches Calcutta. That has not been happening over the past couple of days because of the ongoing cold wave in four districts to the west of the city, an IMD official told Metro.        
	The conditions, however, are not likely to persist beyond Thursday afternoon.        
	The cold wave will ease out in the districts over the next 24 hours. The minimum in Calcutta too will rise slightly to return to normal or stay just below it, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The Celsius dip will also be arrested in north and central India over the next 48 hours. The IMD attributed the change in conditions to a feeble western disturbance that is about to affect the western Himalayan region.        
	During the next 48 hours, the western disturbance will cause overcast conditions and rain in the western Himalayan region, checking the free flow of North Wind, said an IMD official.        
	The weather over the Christmas weekend will be cold and pleasant, assured the weatherman.        
	The minimum might rise by a couple of degrees but that will have little impact on the wintry feel that Calcuttans have been enjoying, said Debnath.        
	According to him, the weather around Christmas is likely to be cold, dry and windy, with the mercury dipping to a minimum of around 13 degrees Celsius.        
	The minimum could dip below Wednesdays in the first half of January, said a scientist from the Noida-based National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting.

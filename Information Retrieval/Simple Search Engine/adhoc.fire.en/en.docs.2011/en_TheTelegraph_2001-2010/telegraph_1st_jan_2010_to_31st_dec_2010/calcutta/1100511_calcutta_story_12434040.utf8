	A 21-year-old employee of Wipro drowned in the Bay of Bengal during a trip with colleagues to a resort near Digha on Sunday.         
	Rajan Sangrulla, who hailed from Shillong, had reached Tajpur along with 17 others from Wipro BPO in Calcutta on Saturday. Police said Sangrulla had gone for a swim with some colleagues on Sunday afternoon. His body was found on the Mandarmani beach, 8km away, on Monday afternoon.         
	Four people were caught in the current during changing tides. Fishermen dragged three of them to safety but Sangrulla could not be found, said Champak Chowdhury, the officer-in-charge of Ramnagar police station.        
	The group was supposed to leave for Calcutta on Sunday night. Some of them stayed back to look for Sangrulla. Fishermen took out trawlers and scouted the Tajpur coastline but to no avail. Some of Sangrullas family members arrived in Tajpur and joined the search. His body washed up around 4pm on Monday.        
	According to sources in Wipro, Sangrulla worked as an agent in the Hewlett Packard team of the BPO for the last two years and lived in a rented house in Dum Dum.

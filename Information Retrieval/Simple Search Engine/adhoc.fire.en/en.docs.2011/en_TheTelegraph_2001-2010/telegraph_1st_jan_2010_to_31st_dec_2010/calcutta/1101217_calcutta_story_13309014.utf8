The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU teachers to monitor student conduct
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      JU teachers to monitor student conduct
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University teachers will keep a close watch on engineering students for a few weeks before deciding whether the semester exam they recently boycotted will be organised again.         
	The chairman of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu), which spearheaded the boycott, on Wednesday sent a letter to the 350 engineering teachers, apologising for the conduct of students during the agitation.         
	Unless the semester exams are held again, 3,000 first, second and third-year students will lose a year.        
	A meeting of the engineering and technology faculty council will be called to discuss the impasse arising out of the exam boycott only if the students attend classes, behave themselves and restore academic atmosphere on campus, said a source in the university.        
	We want to see that the students are serious about their studies. They have spoiled the academic atmosphere by boycotting the semester exams and by staying away from classes when the new semester began on December 7. We are not going to accept such disruptions any more, said Niladri Chakraborty, the dean of the engineering and technology faculty.        
	After observing the students, Chakraborty added, the heads of departments would submit a report to him on their attendance and performance in class.        
	The decision on holding a meeting of the faculty council to bail out the students will be taken on the basis of the reports filed by the department heads, said Chakraborty, who is also the vice-chairman of the engineering technology faculty council.        
	Palash Ghosh, the Fetsu general secretary, said the academic boycott had been withdrawn and the students were regularly attending classes.        
	We want to make it clear to the teachers that our movement was not aimed at harassing them. Our boycott was against police atrocities and lathicharge on the campus (on November 9), added Ghosh.        
	The teachers said though they were happy that the students had understood their fault, the apology letter did not guarantee that they will not be irregular in class once the authorities find a suitable way to solve the crisis that has arisen from the exam boycott.         
	Chakraborty said: The monitoring is not intended to harass the students for their misconduct and exam boycott. We want to make them careful about their own careers so that they do well later. We are not against student participation in politics. But they should be aware about their responsibilities as students.        
	Agitation: Supporters of Trinamul Congress gheraoed Barasat police station for three hours on Thursday, demanding immediate removal of the officer-in-charge of Barasat police station and the in-charge of Aminpur outpost for favouritism towards the CPM.

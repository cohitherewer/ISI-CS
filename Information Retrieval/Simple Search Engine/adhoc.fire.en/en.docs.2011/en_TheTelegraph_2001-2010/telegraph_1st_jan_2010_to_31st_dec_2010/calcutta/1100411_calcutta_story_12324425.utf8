	A quarter of a century after the death of her mother in a concentration camp in Terezin, Czechoslovakia, Anny Stern, a resident of the US, received a packet from a stranger. As she opened it, out came some dog-eared brittle papers covered with a shaky handwriting. Among them was a collection of recipes. She recognised the hand to be her mothers. Faced with death, she was writing down recipes hoping they would one day reach her daughter.        
	This extraordinary account of heroism reached Calcutta with the recent visit of French graphic artist Elsie Herberstein, who was here for Bon Jour India, a French festival. She has co-authored and illustrated Les Carnets de Minna (Minnas Recipe Book), published in 2008.         
	The book mixes history of the camp with a personal account, says Elsie, who has retraced the path of the recipe book from the Terezin camp to Prague, Israel, Palestine and then to the US along with documentary film-maker Anne Georget.        
	The tale takes off with the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939. While the youngsters of the family fled to Palestine, 70-year-old Minna Pchter refused to move. She was deported to Terezin, from where people were sent daily to Auschwitz. She was herded along with 15 elderly women.         
	There was little food to go round as the Nazis fed only men as they could work in the camp. These starving old women spent their time discussing food, which was important in their families as a way of giving love. It was also a way of their resisting the Nazis, telling them that you can treat us like animals but you cant take away our dignity.        
	Elsies book carries illustrations of every mouth-watering recipe that she has chosen to print alongside the heart-rending story  cakes for wedding, rich chocolate cake The exchange of recipes gave them a fantasy of actually tasting the food.

	Before she died in 1944 at the camp hospital, Minna handed the papers to someone with a request to reach it to her family. Because of travel restrictions in the Communist Bloc, 27 years passed by before that person could finally trace Minnas daughter Anny in the US and hand the parcel over. When she opened it, it was as if the hand of her mother came out of the grave and caressed her.        
	A facsimile came out in New York, on seeing which Anne Georget, a documentary film-maker, contacted the family. Georget collaborated with the illustrator of the book. The book came out in France, while the movie was made in the US.         
	If Elsie succeeded in convincing the family to recount their painful memories, it is because she can win peoples trust.         
	I learn by experience, not prejudices. Our family had a caravan that broke down during a childhood trip to Macedonia. The only people around us were gypsies, who we had been told were thieves. But they took us to their village, their forger worked on the van all night as the others fed and sang for us. They fixed the van and didnt even take any money.         
	She has travelled around the world, making sketchbooks, but ask her what she likes best and she replies that shed rather meet people than visit monuments.

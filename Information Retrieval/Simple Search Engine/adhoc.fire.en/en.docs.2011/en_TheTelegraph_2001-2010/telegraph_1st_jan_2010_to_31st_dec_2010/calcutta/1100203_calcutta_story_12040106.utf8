The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Turban goes trendy in click class   For turban to be trendy
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Turban goes trendy in click class     - Young Sikhs being taught to pick suitable headgear and wear it right          ZEESHAN JAWED                                           Saif Ali Khan plays Veer Singh in   Love Aaj Kal                Akshay Kumar plays Happy Singh in Singh is Kinng                Ranbir Kapoor in Rocket Singh:   Salesman of the Year      
	Singh isnt king without his turban  thats the message going out to young Sikhs who are shunning the traditional headgear to flaunt a trendy head of hair.        
	Akal Purakh Di Fauj, an organisation fostering community traditions, has launched The Turban Clinic in Calcutta to turn the symbol of Sikh pride into a fashion accessory that every young man of the community would willingly wear.        
	The workshop at Khalsa High School, in Bhowanipore, every Sunday, promises to teach Sikh youth different ways of tying a turban with the help of computer software to choose the style that best suits a particular face.        
	The campaign has been successful in Punjab and Delhi, and we hope it will click in Calcutta as well. We are doing everything we can to make the turban trendy, said Satnam Singh, the co-ordinator for Akal Purakh Di Fauj in the city.        
	The reluctance of young Sikhs to wear the turban coincides with the advent of the turbaned Sikh as a conventional Bollywood hero after decades of stereotyping. Be it Akshay Kumar in Singh is Kinng or Ranbir Kapoor in Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year, the celluloid Sikh with a pagdi is no longer a bumbling buffoon.        
	Over the years, many Sikh youth gave up wearing the turban primarily to avoid being stereotyped like in Hindi films. We hope the change (in perception) that has come about is here to stay, said a veteran member of the community.        
	Some blame the nuclear family set-up for young members of the community not even learning how to tie a turban.                    
	Usually, its the grandparents or elders in the family who teach a child the art of tying a turban. But young boys in nuclear families are often denied that. Our workshop will help them learn it from professionals, said Udham Singh, the president of the Central Gurdwara Committee.        
	Participants superimpose pre-programmed styles on their pictures using the Smart Turban software and select the ones they think will suit their faces and personality. Experts from Punjab will help them select the best turban and teach them how to tie the perfect turban. There are as many as 40 ways of tying the turban according to facial structure, height and complexion, added Udham Singh.        
	So what do young Sikhs in Calcutta  the community numbers around ?????? in the city  think of the campaign? Sikhs are very stylish people. A trendy turban does help enhance ones looks, said Yash Singh, an undergraduate student of Bhawanipur College.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sir, change it if you can
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sir, change it if you can
                              Mayor Sovan Chatterjee is greeted by former mayor Subrata Mukherjee after the swearing-in on Wednesday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                            
	The winds of change may have brought about a civic change of guard but bringing about a change in the way the city is run is another matter altogether. Calcutta Municipal Corporations cholchhe cholbe culture of corruption and non-action will greet the new mayor, who is also a six-time councillor.        
	On the day he took oath, Metro prepared a list of things Sovan Chatterjee of the Trinamul Congress will find difficult  if not impossible  to change.              
	BUILDING BAD        
	Land scouts and local promoters are hand-in-glove with the councillors to carry on illegal activities, block by building block  from clearing a plot to building an extra floor.        
	Change it if you can.                
	ILLEGAL FLOORS        
	Nandram Market stands as the symbol of all that is illegal about the citys vertical growth. A high court directive to pull down the illegal floors of the 11-storeyed Burrabazar market following the 100-hour blaze two years ago has been ignored by the CMC, which has declared the building unsafe but allowed business to boom on the fire-ravaged floors. Scores of other such unauthorised buildings dot town.        
	Change it if you can.                
	PAVEMENT PERIL        
	The citys pavements, constructed with taxpayers money, have long been handed over to hawkers to do business from. With the government now deciding to issue identity cards to them, hawkers are set to own your pavement. Pavements will be their kitchen in the morning, shops during the day and bedroom at night.         
	Change it if you can.        
	KILLING FIELDS        
	Corruption has struck pay dirt at the Dhapa dumping ground, where a Citu top gun and his cohorts charge the CMC 300 litres of diesel daily in return for allowing it to dump the citys garbage there. In terms of money, the bribe amounts to Rs 37.44 lakh a year. Another 3,000 litres of diesel are siphoned out of 150 CMC-owned conservancy trucks near the Ambedkar bridge on the EM Bypass every day. The stolen diesel is sold at Rs 25 per litre, which works out to an annual misappropriation of Rs 3.74 crore of taxpayers money.        
	Minister Kanti Ganguly had tried to end the practice when he was in charge of conservancy between 1995 and 2000 but was forced to step back at the behest of his party bosses.        
	Change it if you can.                
	WATER WOES        
	Over 15 million gallons of filtered water go waste daily through the broken spouts of 17,000-odd street taps in the city even as taxpayers are forced to buy water to drink. Mayor Chatterjee, who earned the moniker Jol Sovan as the mayoral council member of water supply from 2000 to 2005, could soon see his promise of filtered water to every household go down the drain.         
	Change it if you can.                
	FOUR-HOUR DAY        
	Nobody has heard of nine-to-five in the corporation, where as many as 70 per cent of the non-technical staff work  or pretend to do so  for a mere four hours every day from noon till 4 pm. The first half of the day is unofficial me-time at the taxpayers expense.        
	Change it if you can.              
	NO-TAX ZONES        
	The CMC has left over two lakh buildings in the added areas either unassessed or under-assessed, and so out of the tax net. With the Left Front being drubbed in what used to be its strongholds, the Trinamul regime might feel obliged to adopt the no-tax theory. That mayor Chatterjee, of ward 131, is the first first citizen from the added areas strengthens their case.        
	Change it if you can.              
	MATERNITY MESS        
	Four maternity homes under the CMC  two in Garden Reach, one in Kidderpore and another at Champamoni, off the Bypass  have not been functioning for over 25 years although the matrons, doctors and other staff have been getting their salaries regularly.         
	Change it if you can.

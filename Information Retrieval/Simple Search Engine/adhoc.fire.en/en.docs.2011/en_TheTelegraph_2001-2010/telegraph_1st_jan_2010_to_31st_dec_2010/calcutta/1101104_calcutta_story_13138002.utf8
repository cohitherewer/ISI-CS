                      Fresh and free ideas in art                    Calcutta Painters celebrates its 46th anniversary with a group show showcasing the works of 23 painters and three sculptors presently associated with it. These artists represent a faction which has contributed enormously to the making of our contemporary visual text. They provoke a dialogue that not only questions our own notion of culture and society but also affects how we see ourselves. The works on show have to be seen in the context of current concerns, practices and expectations. They are self-referential and steeped in a personal vision that is intimate and preoccupied with explorations of form, space and myth. Viewing them results not in familiarity but fresh discoveries. Most importantly, the works affirm the unimportance of any historically-derived meaning and are distinguished by an absence of any theory surrounding much contemporary and conceptual art. Participants: Anita Roychowdhury, Bijan Chowdhury, Dwijen Gupta (a painting by him appears here), Isha Mahammad, Jogen Chowdhury, Prokash Karmakar, Rabin Mondal, Subrata Ghosh, Wasim Kapoor and others.

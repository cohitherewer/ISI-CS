	The academicians on the panel are Goutam Poddar of IIT Kharagpur, Biswanath Roy of Jadavpur University and Gautam Bandopadhyay of the Bengal Engineering and Science University.         
	The two other members are CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey and consultant engineer Sadhan Mukherjee, former chief engineer of the public works department.        
	I would like to clarify that there will be no conflict with any other committee formed (to probe the fiasco), CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Tuesday.        
	We had first approached Philips, GE, Siemens and L amp;T. All four companies gave various suggestions but we were not satisfied. So we decided to contact the three premier technical institutes in the state. The names of the experts on the panel have been suggested by the institutes themselves, added Dalmiya.

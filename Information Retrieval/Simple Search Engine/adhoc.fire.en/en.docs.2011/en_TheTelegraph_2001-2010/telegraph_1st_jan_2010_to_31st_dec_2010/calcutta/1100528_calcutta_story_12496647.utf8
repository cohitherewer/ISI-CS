										      POULOMI BANERJEE      Civic Poll 2010                  Anita Basu campaigns in her ward. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)    
	Two unfortunate incidents propelled her into politics  her husbands death and the involvement of Trinamul councillor of ward 69 Manila Chowdhury in a land grab case. But now that Anita Basu is in the fray, the gritty lawyer-poet is determined to make her mark. In March 2010, Metro had exposed Manilas dubious ways, after which she was denied a ticket by the Trinamul Congress. Manila joined the Congress in a huff and Mamata introduced Anita.               
	Name: Anita Basu        
	Ward: 69 (Lansdowne-Puddapukur area)        
	Party connection: Anita is the widow of Gautam Basu, who was additional private secretary to Mamata Banerjee         
	Profession: Lawyer. Practised at Alipore Judges Court for 10 years.        
	Passion: Writing poetry. Has published three books of her poems. The latest volume (published in 2010) deals with Anitas emotions about her late husband and is dedicated to him. She says she enjoys the works of Joy Goswami, Pabitra Mukhopadhyay and Sunil Gangopadhyay.         
	Favourite filmstar: Hrithik Roshan.         
	Entry into politics: I was finding it very difficult to cope with my husbands death in 2008. When Mamatadi offered me this opening, I thought it might help me overcome my grief. It also gives me an opportunity to attach myself to a cause that was my husbands life.        
	Gautam Basus legacy: Im hardly a new entrant  all the Trinamul leaders know me and help me out. Mamatadi is like family. The people of the ward also loved my husband they refer to me as Gautam Basus wife. That feels good  its as if my husband is alive through me.         
	Poll preparations: Im concentrating on door-to-door campaigning, on getting to know the people and their problems.        
	Agenda: Clearing the garbage piled up in the ward is her top priority. If I become councillor, I will also try to rid the area of stagnant water as these breed mosquitoes. I will also look into water supply woes in households and try to give a facelift to the corporation schools in the ward.

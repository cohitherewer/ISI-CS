	A 35-year-old trader was shot to death in his Howrah flat on Monday morning, the assailants allegedly keeping his father locked in the bathroom.        
	Mahesh Chorrarias parents  his mother was in the kitchen when the killers struck  found the trader lying on the floor of the drawing room, bleeding from the head.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that Mahesh, who dealt in shares, was shot from the point-blank range. An empty cartridge shell was found near the body.        
	An investigating officer said the killers must have used a sophisticated pistol fitted with a silencer as Maheshs parents did not hear any gunshot.        
	Howrah police superintendent Hari Kishore Kusumakar said: We are probing all angles. The murder could be the fallout of an extramarital relationship or business rivalry.        
	Mahesh, who married four years ago, moved to the third-floor flat in Charu Chandra Singha Lane with his parents around the time he got separated from wife Sweta a year ago. A divorce suit filed by the couple is pending in court.        
	Maheshs father Lov Charan, 65, said he had heard some men talk to his son in his room when he went to the bathroom around 9.40am. I could not see their faces as the rooms door was shut.... My wife Kamri Devi was in the kitchen, said Lov Charan.        
	He found the bathroom door bolted from outside when he tried to come out. I started banging the door fiercely, after which the bolt somehow slid back. I stepped out and saw Mahesh lying in a pool of blood in the living room, recalled Lov Charan.        
	The fathers screams alerted one of his other sons, Manoj, who lives next door. Manoj and other family members took Mahesh to Howrah District Hospital and two nursing homes but the authorities everywhere refused to admit him.        
	The family members returned home a couple of hours later with the body and kept it on the same spot where Mahesh was found lying with gunshot wounds.        
	The police were alerted in the afternoon.        
	A year ago, a gang of four had strangled Kalicharan Gupta, a trader, in his Dobson Road flat under Howrahs Golabari police station. The case is yet to be cracked.

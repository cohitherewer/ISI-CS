The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Why am I so glad to be alive?
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Why am I so glad to be alive?
          SOMINI SEN DUA                          Stephen Court occupants perched on parapets till help arrived; some jumped to their deaths                                   
	I remember having escaped the fire. I remember getting home panting, panicking, and angry, guilt-ridden and a bundle of nerves. I remember hugging my four-year-old daughter thanking God that I could make it in time. Last Tuesday.              
	My husband Sanjiv and I had saved incessantly through the initial years of our marriage just to buy (lease 70 years) a place on Park Street to start our own ventures and call ourselves entrepreneurs. Our plans of setting up a bigger home and starting a family were put on the back burner. We used to be so careful, and not spend a paisa if we could avoid it.... Last Tuesday, I did not recall a thing. I had to run, I needed to be alive.        
	I went into office around 1pm ready to wind up, as I was travelling to Delhi the next morning. I was checking my mails, pecking at a boring salad lunch and cursing the heat. We heard a ruckus below and dismissed it as the usual lunchtime parking brawl. A few minutes later the lights started flickering. Apprehending a power failure (a recurrent feature in summers), we were about to put our respective laptops on Save mode, when the peon burst into the room crying Didi, bahut zor ki aag lagi hai, bhagna parega.        
	I still thought he was overreacting. I opened the window as the lights had gone off by then. And there it was  clouds of dark smoke just above us and down below people screaming and looking up at us. I realised Sanjiv was travelling and I had to take whoever was in office and run out. We had to switch off the mains and lock office. All this took about a minute and soon I realised I was gliding down the stairs with many others.        
	It was pitch dark and we had to take the help of our cellphones. Someone in the crowd had the presence of mind to warn everyone not to rush; we will hurt each other in panic. The Stephen Court staircases are like huge caves, with a death trap of an elevator.        
	What happened during the next few seconds is something I would not want to remember. We saw about a hundred people looking in our direction from the parking area and saying na na! There was a strange thud and I immediately covered my head with the bag I was carrying. I thought the building would collapse, chunks had already started falling.        
	But there he was. A man. A man fell. We ran a little further and looked up.        
	There were about six to seven people trying to wriggle out of a window and a balcony and there was one lady hanging from another window. For a few seconds I thought if I could help them or maybe call the right person to get more fire engines. I told my colleagues to get out of that place and ran to my car.        
	We all ran out like rats from a sinking ship and we are still thanking God that we are alive. I know how I ran away. I knew that the only difference between me and the woman who was hanging was that she was located on the fifth floor and me on the first. I also knew that I had a baby to look after, but, maybe, so did she! What will happen to those parents who lost their children, or women who lost their husbands?        
	Why am I not asking for the fire minister to resign? Why will the builders not be taught a lesson so that nobody ever has the audacity to commit such irresponsible blunders? Why am I so glad to be alive? Why are we so passive? Did anyone of us really bother about the fire-safety measures in what was our property? Did we care? Why does it take so many people to be burnt alive to jolt our senses? I am still looking for an answer.         
	Can you answer the questions raised by this survivor of the Stephen Court blaze? ttmetroabpmail.com

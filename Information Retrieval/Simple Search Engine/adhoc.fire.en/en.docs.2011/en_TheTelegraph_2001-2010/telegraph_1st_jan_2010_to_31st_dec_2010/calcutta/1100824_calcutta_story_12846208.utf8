The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | House tax jump put on hold 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      House tax jump put on hold 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation on Monday decided to do away with the six-yearly revision of property tax to pave the way for its plan to tax property on the basis of location.        
	The decision by the Trinamul Congress mayoral council means house owners will no longer receive the hearing notice for a tax revision or the supplementary bill of arrears.         
	After the meeting that lasted three-and-a-half-hours, may- or Sovan Chatterjee said: The pending cases of upward revision will be kept in abeyance.        
	Sources in the CMC said the board acted under express instructions from Mamata Banerjee and made the decision with next years Assembly elections in mind.        
	So long, the tax on property in CMC areas was calculated on the basis of their notional rent value  roughly, around 40 per cent of the possible rent was levied as tax.        
	The minimum increase in tax was 10 per cent of the existing amount. It was more than 10 per cent if there was a change in use ( residential to commercial), an increase in the buildings covered area or if the whole building or a part of it was let out. The ultimate decision on what the tax would be lay with the inspectors and there was no upward limit.        
	In the new unit area method that the Trinamul board wants to introduce, all properties in a particular area will be taxed equally.        
	However, CMC sources said the new method of taxation was unlikely to be implemented before the Assembly polls, which translates into an across-the-board benefit for all those whose property taxes are due for revision.        
	Sources in the assessment department said those who had already received the hearing notice or the supplementary bill would have to do the needful.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Where families run a fan-fare factory                                                                                                                            3                                                                                      Where families run a fan-fare factory     - Colony off Jessore Road churns out flags and headbands to cash in on IPL craze          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          ALL IN THE FAMILY: One of the many homes in South Jogendranagar where IPL ware is the way of life now.

	The game plan of Manojit Roy, 17, for Wednesdays big match is simple. A walk to Biswarpara-Kodalia station to catch the Down Bongaon line train to Sealdah and then a bus to Babughat or Esplanade, he rattles off. After that, take guard as close to Eden Gardens as possible, armed with flags and headbands, to notch up a decent score before the fours and sixes start raining.        
	The teenager will have at least four dozen neighbours for company. For, out of every 10 houses in his para, three are busy playing to the T20 galleries.        
	Welcome to South Jogendranagar, a colony about 3km off Jessore Road, the KKR fan-fare factory far removed from the roar of Eden. Almost all the flags and headbands you will see at the stadium during the Kolkata Knight Riders vs Delhi Daredevils match can be traced back to the sewing machines of South Jogendranagar working overtime to cash in on the IPL craze.        
	Madhumala Biswas has no idea who opens the batting for KKR but she can say precisely where on the purple flag the mesh with the golden crest should be set for the logo to be hand-printed. She deposits her infant daughter with her sister-in-law after work and sits down with her sewing machine, says a neighbour as the shy housewife smiles.        
	The Eden experience is much more fun than hawking. We wear a jersey and a headband ourselves, says Sumanta Gayen, who has just finished his Madhyamik exams and is helping his brother-in-law keep the flag business flying high. The stitching is done by his sister. The family scorecard reads: 250 flags and 400-500 headbands. A profit of Rs 7-8 per flag makes it feasible.        
	In South Jogendranagar  just like in Mannat in faraway Bandra  the mood of the moment depends on the fate of a KKR match. Our sales were best for the match against Chennai Super Kings after the first two victories, says Gayen. A win on Wednesday will revive flagging fortunes.        
	It is not as if the IPL flagged off the business at South Jogendranagar. The behind-the-scenes cricket army has been at it during Tests and ODIs too, but T20 has made it a different ball game.                    
	 Rohit Biswas is pushed forward as amader gurudeb (our mentor). The 48-year-old frail man sells bedsheets, when he is not selling cricket flags. When we started there was hardly a handful of us. Now 100-150 boys are in the trade.        
	The boys have never seen an IPL match from the stands but they have been inside Eden. During Tests, big groups trade extra tickets for flags, smiles Manikanta Bar, an unemployed youth who springs into action for cricket.        
	Most houses here deal in only KKR colours but the Roys living down a brick-lined alley are batting for IPL. Robin Roy, who runs an imitation jewellery shop in non-IPL months, is just back from Bangalore and Chennai. Heaped on his bed are flags of every IPL hue. Counting the unsold Deccan Chargers headbands, he looks downcast. Business in away matches has been bad this year, from Gilly to Dhoni.        
	So, South Jogendranagar is pinning its hopes on Sourav Ganguly, one last time.

                      Social messages through art                    In 2006, Zubaan, a Delhi-based feminist publishing house, began work on a project to collect posters from the womens movement in India. They wanted to map a visual history of the womens movement in an attempt to find out the shape of political activism of Indian women, how it mobilised support or reached out to a wider audience. In the process, they came across an unexpected treasure trove of artistic expression. These were the works of traditional and folk women artists from all over the country that carried, in one way or another, content that related to issues such as violence against women, dowry or HIV/AIDS. Crafts have always been a strong medium of expression and communication, specially for women. For generations, they have used this medium to tell their stories  through paintings, weaving and other forms. Poster Women II is an attempt to document and showcase these traditional forms of expression that rural women have used to engage with social issues. Some of these artworks, created and designed by marginalised and socially excluded (tribal and Dalit) women, deal with issues ranging from livelihood rights, health awareness, communalism and violence, to marriage and domestic work. The exhibits on show include Madhubani from Bihar, Patachitra from West Bengal, contemporary Phad painting from Rajasthan, applique embroidery from Orissa, Jogi art from Gujarat, Sujuni embroidery from Bihar, Khovar paintings from Jharkhand, Gond art from Madhya Pradesh and Khatwa from Bihar. Inauguration today at 11 am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools to send more examiners   Too few to examine scripts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Schools to send more examiners

	The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations will make it mandatory for each school to depute an adequate number of examiners to correct ICSE and ISC answer scripts.        
	The move has been prompted by several schools this year sending fewer teachers than promised to the council, which threatened to slow down the evaluation process.        
	Every school will have to send a certain number of teachers to the evaluation camps depending on the number of students they send to appear for the ICSE and ISC exams, said Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive of the council.        
	The student-examiner arithmetic will be worked out soon. Schools will be penalised if they do not abide by the order, said a source in the council.         
	The centralised evaluation system was introduced this year with the council requesting schools to send enough examiners to the camps where they sit and correct the answer scripts together. The objective is two-fold  to maintain parity and also fast-track the publication of results.        
	We were extremely inconvenienced when we realised that schools had not sent the required number of teachers to most of the camps. We did not have enough examiners to correct the answer scripts within the given deadline, said an official of the council.                          
	In order to declare the results on time, we were forced to ask the examiners who attended the camps to correct more number of scripts, added the official.        
	After the announcement of the results last Wednesday, heads of many schools in Calcutta held the new centralised marking system responsible for the low marks scored by their students in English.        
	They pointed out that the standard of evaluation had deteriorated this year, particularly in English, because each of the examiners had to correct too many scripts on a single day.         
	The decision to make it compulsory for the schools to send teachers proportionate to the number of ICSE and ISC examinees they send, will apply not just to the 300-odd ICSE/ISC schools in Bengal but to all 1,500 such institutions spread across the country.        
	We have found that schools from all over the country are reluctant to send enough teachers to correct the answer scripts. We are determined to end this practice, said the council official.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Project to stop airport flood
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Airports Authority of India will undertake a Rs 30-crore project to solve the waterlogging problem at the city airport.        
	The project is based on the recommendations of Jadavpur Universitys construction engineering department. The plan includes an overhaul of the airports drainage system as well as the drainage channels, said airport director R. Srinivasan.         
	Drainage channels around the airport often get clogged, submerging hangars and large parts of airfields. Aircraft have been damaged because of the flooding and complaints lodged with the airport authorities.        
	The plan includes desilting of all major drains around the airport and concreting of brick channels. The JU engineers have also recommended construction of a drainage outlet. Currently, 11 drainage outlets around the airport are in poor condition.         
	According to an official, two outlets on the eastern side and one on the western side would be realigned and overhauled. A new one would be built on the southern side at a cost of Rs 7 crore.         
	Airport officials will hold a meeting with the local municipal authorities within 15 days regarding the project, said Saugata Roy, the Trinamul Congress MP from Dum Dum and the chairman of the Airport Advisory Committee.        
	The advisory committee met municipal and North 24-Parganas authorities on Monday to discuss the matter.        
	The airport authorities have also decided to convert the recently built ceremonial lounge into a business air terminal for non-schedule airlines. The ceremonial lounge was built spending Rs 4 crore for the use of VIPs and the old one was to be demolished.         
	The old lounge has to be kept for VIPs because of security reasons, said an official.

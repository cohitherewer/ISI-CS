The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blank zone risk in airport link failure
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blank zone risk in airport link failure

	A thousand aircraft entering the Calcutta air space daily face a safety hazard as they fly through blank zones where the pilot fails to communicate with the air traffic control at the city airport.        
	Sources said inadequate network of the airports Very High Frequency Omni Range communication system has turned 1,000 nautical miles  1,852km  on various routes covering Calcutta into blank zones.        
	The Airports Authority of India is aware of the problem and has asked the Calcutta ATC to identify the zones. The study is almost complete and we are expecting a report soon, said an AAI official.        
	Once we fly into a blank zone, the voice communication with the ATC is snapped abruptly. Attempts to communicate through other higher frequencies, too, dont work, said a senior Air India pilot. During emergencies like sudden bad weather, we try to communicate through other aircraft which are in the coverage area, he said.        
	Pilots in a blank zone also face severe problems in changing altitude or direction. With the ATC out of bounds, there is no one to guide us if we need to go down or fly up. In such situations we take a call based on our interactions with adjacent aircraft, a pilot pointed out.        
	The problem is most acute on the Calcutta-Port Blair route as almost the entire 500 nautical miles (926km) of the stretch fall in a blank zone. On the Calcutta-Bagdogra route, flights have no communication link with the airport on a 100-nautical mile stretch (185.2km) between Katihar and Bagdogra.        
	Similarly, around 250 nautical miles (463km) on the Kathmandu route and 100 nautical miles on the Mumbai route are beyond the Calcutta ATCs communication link.        
	Overflying flights between Europe and south-east Asia face the problem on eight routes over the Bay of Bengal.        
	The problem has been persisting for several years and is a major safety concern for us, said an airport official.        
	A senior AAI official in Delhi said the power of the two very high frequency transmitters at the airport was being increased in an attempt to solve the problem. There are similar transmitters in the Andamans, Visakhapatnam and Berhampore. But sources said the Andamans transmitter had not been functioning properly while the other two could not be accessed by aircraft flying over land.        
	Three new Remote Control Air Ground transmitters have been installed at Katihar (Bihar), Jharsuguda (Orissa) and Shillong (Meghalaya) but they are yet to be functional.

             New Market. (Pabitra Das)                           
	Apropos Market Rebirth, January 10, New Market has not lost its identity in the jungle of malls. However, I feel the market authorities should replace the conical sheet of corrugated iron right above the main entrance as it mars the beauty of the magnificent building. Also, filtered drinking water should be available free at various spots inside the market. I strongly feel the civic body should not add another floor to the market.

	 It is a nostalgic experience to visit or shop at New Market. What scares me is the CMCs plan to build an additional floor to raise funds to revamp the market. New Market is a heritage building; funds can easily be arranged from various conservation committees if the civic body makes an effort. The beautiful building should not be turned into a pigeonhole.

	 I certainly prefer New Market to malls. New Market has its own unique charm. The shopkeepers are friendly and the prices are mostly affordable. Parking has become easier because of the underground parking lot and better traffic management. However, poor ventilation inside the market remains an area of concern.

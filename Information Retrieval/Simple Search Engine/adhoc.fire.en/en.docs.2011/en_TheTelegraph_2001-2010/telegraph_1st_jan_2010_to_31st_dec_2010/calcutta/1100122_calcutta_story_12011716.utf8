The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fashion weeks split is showing

	Calcutta, which got its first fashion week in 2009, nine years after Delhi had one, will soon host two fashion weeks thanks to a rift in the ramp managers ranks.        
	The double dose of February fashion will see Kolkata Fashion Week (KFW) Season 3 and Kolkata Fashion amp; Lifestyle Week (KFLW) Season 1 slug it out.        
	This is the result of a split in the organisers of the first two seasons of Kolkata Fashion Week in 2009, the Mindscapes Maestros Events amp; Sports Management. Soon after the second season last September, one of the co-directors of the company, Yudhajit Dutta, parted ways because of a difference in opinion.        
	Dutta will now be hosting KFLW at PC Chandra Greens  the scene of KFW 1  under the Purple People Entertainment banner, from February 23 to 28. The dates of KFW are not confirmed, but a clash on the calendar seems imminent.        
	Prateek Sen, co-founder and co-director of Mindscapes Maestros, confirmed that they would host KFW 3 at a five-star property. Unlike the last two seasons, this time KFW will be a trade event. Mornings will be reserved for business and shows will be staged only in the afternoons. We are in the process of a tie-up with a Latin American fashion property, said Sen, eyeing a collateral agreement to give a chance to Indian designers to show overseas.        
	The challenger has already got 36 designers  Narendra Kumar and more  in the bag, but KFW is not giving any numbers yet, waiting for brand ambassador M.S. Dhoni to finish the Bangladesh tour. KFLW has lured away backstage teams and choreographers, but KFW promises to go really big on the ramp stars.        
	City designers are divided on the fashion week front. Monapali say that both have approached them, but they are yet to decide. Kiran Uttam Ghosh is wary of fashion week fatigue. Too many of them abundance makes for redundancy, she says.        
	Case in redundancy point: Delhi Fashion Week, the breakaway group of Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week, lasted only two seasons.

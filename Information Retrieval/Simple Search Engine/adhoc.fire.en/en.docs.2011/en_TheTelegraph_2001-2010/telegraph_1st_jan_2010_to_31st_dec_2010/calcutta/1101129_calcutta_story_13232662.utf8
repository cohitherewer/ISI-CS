The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Con victim list grows
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Con victim list grows
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                 
	Complaints are piling up against Priyanka Pugalia, the attractive 30-something who had allegedly duped several traders, job seekers and parents across the city, without using an alias once.         
	The mother of two was arrested on Thursday for buying saris worth Rs 80,000 from a boutique against a cheque that bounced.         
	The owner of an electronics showroom lodged a complaint with Ekbalpore police station the next day accusing Priyanka of taking away television sets and DVD players worth Rs 12 lakh without paying for them. Two other complaints have been lodged against her with Tollygunge police station since her arrest.         
	At the electronic store, Micro Innovation at 70 Diamond Harbour Road, Priyanka introduced herself as a retailer of electronics gadgets and sweet-talked the manager into letting her leave with television sets and DVD players.        
	One of the complainants is Pankaj P. Sharma, a private firm executive who had recently shifted to Kasba from Mumbai. He had paid Rs 1.51 lakh in cash to a south Calcutta school to enrol his two daughters in the institution.        
	The school authorities insisted on a cheque but Sharma did not have a cheque book with him then. Priyanka wrote a cheque to the school on his behalf and asked him to later transfer the amount to her account, said an officer of Tollygunge police station.         
	She also invited the Sharmas for dinner to her Monoharpukur Road home. When Pankaj and his wife told Priyanka they had bought furniture, worth Rs 2.45 lakh, whose payment was pending, she again offered help.        
	Priyanka claimed she was an agent of the furniture showroom and could manage a discount of 10 per cent for the couple. The two gave her Rs 90,000 to deposit at the shop as payment for the furniture, added the officer.        
	A few days later, the school authorities told Pankaj that the cheque Priyanka had deposited on their behalf had bounced. By then, he had transferred the amount to her account.        
	On being confronted, Priyanka apparently confessed to having wrongfully taken money from the Sharmas, but made no effort to return the amount.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen families get 2 lakh
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The parents of 21-year-old Ankush Ghosh at Lalbazar on Monday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                   
	Police gave cheques for Rs 2 lakh each to the families of Stephen Court victims on Monday at Lalbazar.         
	City police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti handed over the compensation amount to the kin of 30 victims out of the 34 identified so far. The March 23 blaze had claimed 43 lives.         
	We will give the cheques to those who were unable to come on Monday whenever they approach us, said Chakrabarti.        
	The family members said the cops had called them up late on Sunday to ask them to reach Lalbazar around noon on Monday.         
	I received a call around 11.45pm on Sunday night. The police were very cooperative. They escorted us to a room at the headquarters where they registered our names and served us tea. We were then taken to the office of the police commissioner in groups of six and given the cheques. They also provided us with vehicles to return home, said Pankaj Ghosh, the father of 19-year-old Prithwish.        
	The cops noted down our complaints and promised us that a senior officer would visit each of our homes, said Rajani Devi Khandelwal, mother of twins Joy and Bijoy.         
	Some were unhappy with the compensation amount while others wanted to know why action wasnt being taken against those responsible for the fire.         
	The worth of my sons life is only Rs 2 lakh? Can they give me back my son, cried 68-year-old Anil Ghosh, the father of Ankush.         
	Chakrabarti said a joint inspection team would visit Stephen Court on Wednesday to assess the refurbished wiring and structural stability of the building.        
	We will decide whether to allow the residents of the less-affected portions to return to their homes after the inspection. The elevators will be out of service for now, he said.

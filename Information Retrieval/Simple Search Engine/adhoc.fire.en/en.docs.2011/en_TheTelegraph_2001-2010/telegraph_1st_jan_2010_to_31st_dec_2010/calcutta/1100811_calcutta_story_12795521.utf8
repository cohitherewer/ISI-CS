The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protest blurs political lines
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Protest blurs political lines
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Political differences among college and university teachers in the state have been blurred as faculty members  cutting across political lines and academic institutes  are exerting pressure on the government demanding five more years in service and immediate payment of arrears.        
	In an unprecedented move, members of the Jadavpur University Teachers Association (Juta), a CPM stronghold, held a demonstration in front of Bikash Bhavan on Tuesday to press for their twin demands.        
	The All Bengal University Teachers Association (Abuta)  a body of anti-CPM teachers  has been organising such protests for the past few days and the Calcutta University Teachers Association (Cuta), another CPM fief, has written to the higher education department listing similar demands.        
	All the associations are working separately, but there is a unanimity that the government has to change its stand, said a CU teacher.         
	College and university teachers in Bengal are awaiting release of arrears, due to them following the adoption of the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. The state government has given only a partial hike to the teachers.        
	The cash-strapped government is banking on the Centres largesse to give the full hike and the arrears but the University Grants Commission has linked the release of funds  80 per cent of the outstanding  with the raising of the retirement age of teachers from 60 to 65.        
	With the government not blinking, the funds are stuck and teachers from across the political spectrum have found a reason to unite. Now that Juta and Cuta have joined the Abuta cry, the government is clearly on the back-foot.        
	Despite repeated attempts, Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri, the state higher education minister, could not be contacted on Tuesday.        
	The government should let us know what it intends to do about the retirement age, said Keshab Bhattacharya, the Juta general secretary.        
	After submitting a memorandum to the government stating their demands, the Juta leaders said they would decide on their course of action next week.        
	Some Cuta members told Metro they were planning to launch a movement. We are trying to convince the government to find a solution, said Biplab Chakraborty, the Cuta general secretary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic trauma on Puja eve
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Traffic trauma on Puja eve
          A STAFF REPORTER                           A snarl on Central Avenue near Girish Park on Tuesday evening. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Raima Sen spent Tuesday evening on tenterhooks. She had a flight to catch but her car was stuck in a massive snarl.        
	Need traffic control during Puja..people need to catch flights too..hope I dnt miss mine and left a good hour and half back.. she tweeted anxiously.        
	The actress eventually reached the airport in the nick of time and wrote on Twitter: Made it..phew..and was told that due to traffic 60% of passengers didnt make it on their previous flights.        
	At least 80 people, if not 60 per cent of the fliers, were not as lucky as Raima and had to return from the airport on Tuesday having missed their flights because of traffic congestion.        
	They were among the lakhs who were caught in a traffic gridlock across the length and breadth of Calcutta with Puja barricades eating into road space and top cops caught napping.         
	Rashbehari Avenue, Gariahat Road (South), Arabinda Sarani, APC Roy Road and JL Nehru Road were among the worst affected stretches in the city proper. Roads on the fringes were hit just as bad.         
	Only 200 additional cops had been deployed to manage the Panchami traffic but with vehicles stuck in snarls for hours on major arteries, Lalbazar was forced to ask the officers in charge of six police stations  covering the central business district and south Calcutta  to lend a hand in the evening.        
	As harassed citizens kept calling the control rooms to complain about the traffic mess, the top cops decided to rush in 700-plus sergeants and 900 constables who were undergoing training in a Barrackpore school by night for deployment on Sashthi.        
	Only deploying extra men will not help. From Sashthi, restrictions on movement of goods vehicles, autos and hawkers will come into force and things will improve. Imposing the restrictions is not possible on Panchami since most of the schools and offices are open, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	The cops on the road asserted that more of them managing traffic would have made a huge difference.         
	On the four Puja days, about 300 police personnel are deployed around Gariahat. Today, only about 100 of us are trying to maintain the traffic flow here, said an officer working at the south Calcutta intersection.        
	The strength of green police has dwindled at key intersections like Exide, KC Das, Dorina and Park Street. At many places, men employed by companies are helping us control pedestrians, said an officer.         
	Why are there fewer green cops on the road? Debasish Roy, the additional commissioner of police, was not available for comment.         
	Senior officers blamed Puja barricades on major roads like Central Avenue, Rashbehari Avenue and Park Circus for the traffic trauma.        
	At least 14ft on either flank of Central Avenue has been blocked by the barricades. Given the erratic pedestrian movement, it is impossible to manage traffic on the road, said a cop.         
	As the vehicles heading north moved slowly down JL Nehru Road  courtesy barricades  many headed to Mayo Road from Park Street in the afternoon, leaving Red Road, the citys all-season speed corridor, clogged.         
	It was frustrating to be caught in a snarl on Red Road around 2.30pm. It seemed there is no traffic policeman in the city, said Reshmi Mukherjee, a homemaker from Ekdalia.        
	Appointment: Varun Bharthuar has taken over as the general manager of Eastern Railway on Tuesday evening. He has worked as the additional general manager of South Eastern and East Central railways.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parents return with ashes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Parents return with ashes
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          Nand Kumar Agarwala. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Madhu Agarwala looked calm as she walked into a temple in Baranasi Ghosh Lane to offer a prayer on Monday evening. But the sight of her relatives waiting for her at her home next door tore apart the faade: she broke down and sobbed on the road till she was helped into the house.        
	The homemaker and her husband Nand Kumar were returning from Pune, where their 22-year-old son Rajeev succumbed on Sunday morning to injuries sustained in the German Bakery blast. The final-year student at Symbiosis Law School was cremated in the afternoon.        
	Madhu and Nand Kumar, who had been camping in Pune since February 14, boarded the flight for home 24 hours later. From the airport, we went to Nimtala ghat, where his ashes were immersed in the Hooghly, said Nand Kumar.         
	The day before the blast, Rajeev told me that he wanted to take a break. My elder son was in Calcutta then. So I asked Rajeev to come home. It would have been a wonderful family reunion, recounted the father. The brothers, their sister Radhika and their parents had last been together over a year ago.         
	Over the past week, lying in a hospital bed, Rajeev had tried to speak to his parents several times. Since a tube was inserted into his throat, he could not, said Nand Kumar.         
	The youth had even tried to scribble something on a piece of paper. But he did not have the strength to write. We could not decipher what he wrote, said elder brother Ravi.

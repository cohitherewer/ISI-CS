	Five men returning home from work died when a stationary Tata Sumo Victa was sandwiched between a loaded trailer and a lorry after being rammed from behind at the Vidyasagar Setu toll plaza on Tuesday evening.        
	The cherry red Sumo (WB06 0861) carrying employees of Mohun Bagan official Debashis Dutta had barely stopped at the toll plaza around 6.50pm when the trailer ploughed into it, smashing the vehicle against the lorry in front.        
	Five of the nine passengers, including the driver, were brought out dead from the mangled mass of metal. The other four are in a critical condition.        
	All five casualties  driver Debabrata Sarkar, Nirmal Ghosh from Dankuni, Nityananda Poddar and Bimal Bhattacharya from Barasat and Dinesh Santra from Singur  were employees of DG Samaddar and Sons Pvt Ltd, a shipping firm owned by Dutta.         
	They worked in my Hastings office and were returning home in my car. I have identified their bodies. I will now be going to Howrah to try and shift the injured to Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Dutta, the finance secretary of Mohun Bagan Athletic Club, said at the accident site.        
	The victims, aged between 35 and 40, were also members of Mohun Bagan, club secretary Anjan Mitra confirmed.        
	Three of the injured  Ajoy Bhattacharya, Tridib Chatterjee and Suman Chakraborty  were admitted to Howrah District Hospital. The fourth, Subrata Chakraborty, was taken to SSKM. The Hooghly resident, the only one among the passengers who was able to speak, recalled chatting with his colleagues when he heard a deafening sound and passed out. I was seated in the middle row. I dont remember anything. I regained consciousness in hospital, Chakraborty told Metro.        
	Police said the driver and the handyman of the trailer (NL01 G0465) fled after the accident. There was no official confirmation of the vehicles ownership till late on Tuesday but the name GE SeaCo in red and blue on the trailers body suggested it was carrying a consignment for the global freight container company.        
	An officer said the accident might have been caused by brake failure. A mob threw stones at the cops and damaged some furniture at the toll plaza. A contingent with officers from Hastings, Shakespeare Sarani and Park Street police stations later cordoned off the area, triggering snarls that continued well past 9pm.         
	Sourav Sarkar, who was returning to Howrah on his motorcycle, alleged that the first ambulance arrived almost 45 minutes after the accident. I joined some residents in rescuing those who survived the accident. A police vehicle was parked on the flyover but no cop came to help, he said.        
	Zeeshan Ahmed, a witness, said some of the lights near the toll plaza were switched on only after the accident.

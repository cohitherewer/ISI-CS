	An outsider learning to drive a battery-operated bus inside the Indian Botanic Garden in Shibpur rammed into students of a Howrah school on Monday afternoon, injuring five of them.         
	According to the students of Howrah Ramkrishna Adarsha Balika Vidyalaya, who were on an educational tour with three teachers, a battery-operated bus meant for ferrying visitors inside the 223-year-old garden charged at them around 4.10pm.         
	After the accident, the driver of the bus fled, leaving the vehicle behind. A probe revealed the official bus driver had let an outsider take the wheel to practise driving on the 273-acre premises.         
	Police said 54 Class XI students of the school had visited the garden for nature study. When the bus charged towards them, most of the girls managed to leap out of harms way but five of them sustained injuries.        
	Chandrani Das, a humanities student who was hit on the hip, said: We were studying plants and trees when the bus suddenly hit me on the hip. I was flung in the air and landed on a grassy patch, 10 feet from the road. I was writhing in pain, my uniform soaked in blood.         
	Chandrani received four stitches on her left hip. Another student, Sanchari Sen, was injured in the head and doctors have advised her to undergo a CT scan. Their batchmate Sahanara Sheikh was injured in the knee and elbow.         
	Teacher Alakananda Mukherjee said that there was no vehicle to take the injured teens to hospital.         
	The students were in no position to walk. Finally, after much pleading, another bus driver agreed to take them to Shibpur State General Hospital,she said.         
	The teachers informed the students guardians about the accident and they rushed to the hospital. Kartick Prasad Shaw, whose daughter Neha was injured in her hand and leg, said the parents were told that an outsider had been allowed to learn driving on the garden premises.         
	I hope the police take proper action against the offender, he said.         
	The police said they were looking for the errant driver and were trying to find out the cause of the accident.        
	Till late on Monday, the cops could not find out the name of the official driver of the bus.         
	Repeated calls by Metro to the garden authorities went unanswered.

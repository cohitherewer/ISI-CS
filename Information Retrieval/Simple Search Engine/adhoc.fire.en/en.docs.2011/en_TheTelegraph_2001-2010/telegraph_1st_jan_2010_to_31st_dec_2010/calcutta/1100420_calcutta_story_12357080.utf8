          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta is set to get a daily flight to Nepal soon.        
	Kathmandu-based Buddha Air has plans to start flights between Calcutta and the Nepalese capital.        
	Buddha Air has been designated by the Nepalese government to operate flights to India following a revised air service agreement between the two countries.         
	We are exploring the possibility of starting operations from Calcutta, Patna and Lucknow in the next three to four months, said Bijendra K. Mehrotra, the country manager of Buddha Air.        
	Mehrotra met officials of Calcutta airport on Monday. We told them about the parking bay and other facilities that can be provided. It will be convenient if the airline takes a slot in the afternoon or early evening, airport director R. Srinivasan said.        
	Airline officials said they were in the process of getting regulatory approval from the directorate general of civil aviation and airport space from the Airports Authority of India. The only airline that now operates between Calcutta and Kathmandu is Air India, which flies four days a week. The average passenger load factor is 70 per cent. On holidays, it goes up to 90 per cent, said an Air India spokesperson.        
	Cosmic Air, a private airline in Nepal, used to operate flights from Calcutta but withdrew a couple of years back.        
	Buddha Air is a leading private domestic airline of Nepal, flying to 11 destinations from Kathmandu.

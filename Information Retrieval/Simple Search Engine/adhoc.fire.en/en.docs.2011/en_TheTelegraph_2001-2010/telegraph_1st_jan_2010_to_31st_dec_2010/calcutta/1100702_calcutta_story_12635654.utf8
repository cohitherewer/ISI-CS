	Two children  aged 12 and 10 years  have been arrested in connection with the murder of five-year-old Jhumjhum Das, whose body was found on the terrace of an apartment block in Turf View on Thursday.        
	The duo are residents of the Alipore housing estate where the girls parents, too, live.        
	The post-mortem report mentions that the girl was strangled with hands. The two children who have been arrested have admitted to their crime and will be produced in a juvenile court on Friday, said Supratim Sarkar, the deputy commissioner of police (south).        
	A probe revealed that the boys  the elder one has studied up to Class V while the other has never been to school  had asked the girl to accompany them on the 11th-floor terrace of Block 17 of the estate.

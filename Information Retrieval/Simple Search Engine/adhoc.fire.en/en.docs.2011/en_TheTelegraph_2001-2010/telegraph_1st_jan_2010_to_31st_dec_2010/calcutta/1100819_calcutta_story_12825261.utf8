The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Failure spurt in JU tech
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Failure spurt in JU tech
  - Probe team to mend trend of engineering faculty result          MITA MUKHERJEE                                     
	A jump in the number of failures in the engineering facultys internal annual exams of Jadavpur University has sent the authorities into a tizzy as it threatens to affect campus placement and downgrade the institutes rating.        
	The universitys engineering faculty council has set up a probe team to mend the trend. A failure rate of five to six per cent can be accepted as normal, but this time the percentage in each of the three years is between 12 and 13 per cent, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the JU engineering faculty council and the chairman of the committee.        
	We immediately need to identify the causes for the dip in the pass percentage, find out solutions and implement them as early as possible, he added.        
	The number of failures can lead to a dip in the overall final-year results. This will finally lead to a situation when big recruiters may not want to hire engineering graduates from the institute and poor placement will result in poor rating of the institute, said a JU faculty member.         
	Data available from the department revealed that a total of 305 students  114 in the first year, 132 in the second and 59 in the third year  have failed the engineering annual exams, the results of which were declared a few days ago.        
	The trend, according to a senior JU official, can be traced back to two prime culprits  low attendance in class and failure to maintain consistency in day-to-day academic activities. Students are neglecting day-to-day studies and just focusing on how to get a good job in the campus interview, warned Biswas.        
	The probe committee has been asked to analyse the root causes and suggest remedial measures. An interim report would be submitted within seven days, suggesting some short-term remedies for those who have failed.        
	A number of unsuccessful students had gheraoed the faculty council members on Tuesday evening protesting the results and blaming the failures on their teachers not having completed the syllabus in class.        
	Some teachers do not attend class regularly and they had not completed the syllabus. But questions were set from the entire syllabus, alleged a student.        
	Rubbishing the allegation, a teacher blamed the results on the low attendance of students. Students should have lodged a complaint with the heads of departments if classes were indeed not being held regularly, he argued.

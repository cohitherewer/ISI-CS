The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Constable benched for escorting armed men
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Constable benched for escorting armed men
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A sub-inspector was suspended on Sunday for allowing four armed men, who were stopped at Sealdah station, to keep their pistols with them while they waited at the GRP office to be examined by senior cops.        
	I was shocked to see four men sitting in the GRP office with pistols tucked in their waist. The arms should have been taken away till their licences and other documents were verified. Had they wanted, they could have shot all the cops in the office, said the additional director general of railway police, Dilip Mitra, who signed Biswajit Saus suspension order.        
	The men were allowed to go after the police cross-checked their arms licences and other papers with their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, from where the four came to the city.        
	Investigations revealed that they had come to Calcutta to buy pistols and had the transit licence to carry the arms back to Uttar Pradesh.        
	Sau was in charge of the security checks, which have been intensified before Republic Day. As soon as the four were stopped, they claimed they had arms licences. Sau asked them to accompany him to the office. He then asked them to wait there for senior officers to arrive without taking away the guns, said an officer of Sealdah GRP.        
	According to cops, when Mitra asked Sau to show him the pistols, the men took out the arms instead and placed them on the table. Mitra then asked Sau why he did not take the pistols in his custody. The constable failed to come up with a satisfactory reply, said an officer.        
	Two held: Imtiazuddin and Raju Sardar, alleged members of a two-wheeler theft racket, were arrested in Prasadpur, under Sonarpur police station, on Sunday. Residents caught the duo and handed them over to police but another man who was accompanying them managed to escape.

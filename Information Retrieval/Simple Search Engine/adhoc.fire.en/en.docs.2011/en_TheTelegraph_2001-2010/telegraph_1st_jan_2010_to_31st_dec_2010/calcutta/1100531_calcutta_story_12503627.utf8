                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Just another Sunday? No way, till dusk
          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR AND RADHIKA SEN                          South City Mall on Sunday afternoon. (Rashbehari Das)                                        
	Alakananda and son Varun caught up on a show of Prince Of Persia on Sunday morning as 1,048 candidates sweated it out for the thrones of the princes of the corporation. Or princesses, given the record number of women in the fray.        
	We watch a movie every Sunday and today was no different, said the 47-year-old mom, coming out of INOX Forum, her 19-year-old son in tow. But this Sunday is different, she conceded, many shops are closed and there are hardly any people its more fun!         
	Sundays at city malls are about busy shoppers, crowded escalators, buzzing food courts and packed car parks. But poll day robbed the must-visit weekend haunts of much of the madness, save for a handful of dedicated shoppers and movie buffs.         
	Its a peaceful day. Public transport is barely visible and people are few and far between, said 18-year-old Devika, grabbing a bite in between tuitions at the Forum food court with friends Rishika and Shrishti. But what about voting? We just finished with our ISC boards and didnt have the time to get our voter I-cards made so was the excuse.         
	Ditto for Arin Palit, who was shopping with wife Ramon at South City Mall. We are yet to receive our voter I-cards. We knew the mall would be deserted because of the polls and decided to spend the day shopping, said Arin.         
	Teeing off a few hours earlier at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club was a handful of hopefuls who strayed into the Shamiana around 7.30am. The wide green course was dotted with only a few golfers but the drop in numbers was because of the heat and not the hustings, said regulars.         
	The course is 25 per cent less crowded than other Sundays. Its too hot, complained S. Mitra. Others hit the course early not only to avoid the sun but also election trouble.         
	Even if crowd was thin, the buzz on the greens was definitely about politics. The uncertainty is worrying. I am not sure if any party will gain a clear majority. Trinamul seems ahead, but there is no surety, said Pavan Poddar, golfer and the president of The Bharat Chamber of Commerce.        
	At present it doesnt look like any party is in a position to provide for the growth and development of the city, said fellow golfer S. Rungta, the president of Credai.        
	A visitor from Mumbai asked the question many in the city have often wondered: Why does Calcutta treat poll day like a bandh day?         
	I wanted to buy litchis and sweets, but the vendors are missing and the shops are shut. Also, many people warned me against stepping out because of poll trouble, said G.P. Shah, in town on work.

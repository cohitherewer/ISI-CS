The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Merc ride to Puja getaway
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Merc ride to Puja getaway
          ANASUYA BASU                          A Mercedes bus                                  
	This Puja, you could ride a Merc to your holiday destination. A city-based transport operator is in the process of buying six luxury buses with the three-pointed star that would ply to popular tourist destinations in the state and beyond.        
	Medi-Drips Carriers Pvt Ltd has paid an advance for the buses, priced at Rs 92 lakh each. We have been told that the buses would be delivered in September, when we would pay the remaining money, said Sandeep Dayma of Medi-Drips Carriers.        
	Mercedes, which builds the chassis of the buses in its Pimpri plant and fits them with the body in Jalandhar in collaboration with Sutlej Motors, would deliver the buses in September, confirmed a company spokesperson.        
	Like in planes, the seats in the buses will be divided into business and economy classes. The first four seats in the bus would make up the business class, added Dayma.        
	Food packets would be available on board. Business-class passengers will get bottled water on demand and the rest, a bottle each.        
	According to Dayma, each seat would have a pneumatically adjustable footrest and calf support and lumbar support. The air-conditioner would have individual controls. Overhead LCD screens and one near the entrance would take care of entertainment. There would be laptop and mobile charging points for every two seats.        
	Both Medi-Drips and Royal Cruiser of Kaushik Logistics, two of the largest private bus operators in the eastern region, have a fleet of Volvos, which ply to Siliguri, Digha, Puri, Varanasi, Patna and other destinations. The new buses will be introduced on some of the routes.        
	I run 14 Volvo buses from Calcutta to different destinations. Volvo offers the same efficiency and comfort as Mercedes. However, the eight-wheel, 53-seater Daimler buses are slightly more powerful, said Dayma.        
	Subrata Dasgupta of Royal Cruiser, which runs 50 Volvo buses on different routes in eastern India and Uttarkhand, is also thinking of buying Merc buses. I am working out the economics of the move, he said.        
	Mercedes would open a dealership for its buses, said the company spokesperson in Calcutta.        
	We are aiming to sell 125 buses this year, and we have already sold 65, he said.

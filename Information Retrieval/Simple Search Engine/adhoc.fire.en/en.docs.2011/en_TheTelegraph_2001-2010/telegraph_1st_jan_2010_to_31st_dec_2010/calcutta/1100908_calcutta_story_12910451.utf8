                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bullied by yet another bandh? just beat it
										                                
	If Russi Mody can, why cant Calcutta?        
	The 92-year-old being wheeled into South City Mall on Tuesday eveningwas a slap on the face of the bandh brigade out to cripple Calcutta for 24 hours. I dont support bandhs. I think it is unnatural, Mody told Metro, from his wheelchair.                  
	In South City Mall, the chosen hangout for shoppers, diners and movie-goers, the say-no-to-bandh numbers swelled by the hour. The food court was packed and there was a queue for We Are Family. Not one show was cancelled, said an official of Fame, where screenings commenced from noon and the occupancy count crossed 1,200, a bandh-day record.        
	The mood at South City was summed up by fashion designer Sayon Mitra. I came here almost as a personal protest. It is not fair for others to hamper and disrupt my life and the life of so many others.              
	A bandh serves no purpose. Why cant there be change without disrupting everyday lives?        
	Anahita Golchha, student    
	Anyone and everyone can call a bandh and everyone unquestioningly follows. It is very annoying.  
	Megha Bhutoria, designer    
	Any kind of bandh is bad, but when it is 24 hours, it is claustrophobic. I just had to step out of the house.  
	Chandani Basu, entrepreneur                          
	Naseeruddin Shah made a simple statement by treating it as just another day at work. I didnt face any problem while travelling from my hotel (HHI) to the shooting spot (Tollygunge), except that there was a demonstration and so we had to take a different route, said the star busy shooting for Michael.  
	Raima Sen, who attended a Shabana Azmi play at Taj Bengal in the evening, was very vocal about the bandh earlier in the day.                  
	Tweeted (raimasen): These bandhs are so annoying. Taken most seriously in Bengal. Whenever I come here there has to be at least one bandh. So wats d solution to this bandh. Wat do we achieve being in a state of inertia.        
	Told Metro: These bandhs are so pointless and such a waste of time. Calcutta is famous for these bandhs. Look at Bombay, people are not affected at all, its a normal working day there. And here life has come to a standstill, its so pointless.                        
	Prosenjit        
	Tweeted (prosenjitbumba): I really hate strike...Told Metro: I am completely against bandhs. They just stop the entire flow of life. Common people suffer the most.

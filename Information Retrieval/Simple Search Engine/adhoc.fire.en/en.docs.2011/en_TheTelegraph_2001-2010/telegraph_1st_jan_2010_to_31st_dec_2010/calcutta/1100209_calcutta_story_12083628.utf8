                      Vanishing trades                              Indias economic growth has changed the entire country, particularly its cities, in very significant ways. Technology, mechanisation and large firms producing cheaper goods have marginalised specialist craftsmen. British photographer Clare Arni has been documenting these disappearing professions in Bangalore, Delhi, Calcutta and Chennai, during this story of rapid development. In Disappearing Professions in Urban India, Arni showcases important trades traditionally associated with each city, but now fast becoming extinct: those who served the Moghul court like the attar producer and the miniature artist in Delhi; Bangalores silk trade, Chennais shrinking film studios and in Calcutta, the piano tuner, auctioneer and the Chinese cobbler, who are examples of its multi-ethnic history. In photographing these professions, she has also explored how trades have tried to find ways to adapt to survive, like the calligrapher scribing letterheads. The show also examines broader trades dying out in urban India like the brass tinner, the signboard painter and the water-seller. Ultimately, it paints a picture of a new landscape forming in the country  that offers better consumer choices at the cost of losing a variety of skills and narrowing job opportunities. Hosted by Gallery Sumukha and Seagull Foundation for the Arts.  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Clare Arni When: Till February 14; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

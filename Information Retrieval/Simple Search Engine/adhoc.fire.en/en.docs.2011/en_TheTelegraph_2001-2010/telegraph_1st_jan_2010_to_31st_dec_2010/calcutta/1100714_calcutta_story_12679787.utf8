The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxi fume bar four months late 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Taxi fume bar four months late 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The state government would stop registering BS III cars as taxis from August 1, four months after it was supposed to do so.         
	The BS IV emission norms came into force in Calcutta and a dozen other cities on April 1. The state government, however, has been allowing BS III cars to be registered as taxis in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area so that the replacement of taxis older than 15 years (in compliance with a high court order) does not slow down. By April, 4,000 of the 6,000-odd cabs banned by the high court had been replaced with BS III models. Till the remaining taxis are replaced, we want the segment to be exempted, because operators are reluctant to pay more for BS IV vehicles, transport minister Ranjit Kundu had said in May.        
	Registering BS III taxis after they were banned by the centre can be interpreted as a violation of norm. It would finally stop at the end of the month, said a transport department official.        
	The minister on Tuesday announced that the norm would be enforced but did not explain what prompted the change in stand.        
	Even if one is willing to, how is one supposed to get a BS IV Ambassador? Hindustan Motors is not ready to manufacture BS IV Ambassadors on a large scale, claimed Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association.

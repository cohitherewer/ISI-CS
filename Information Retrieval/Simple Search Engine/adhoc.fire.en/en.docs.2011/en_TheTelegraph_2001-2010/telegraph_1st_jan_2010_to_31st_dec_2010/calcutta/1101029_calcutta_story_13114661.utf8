	Welcome to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	That, for the frequent flier, means welcome to hell.        
	Or, in other words, welcome to the state-run mess posing as a modern airport even as the other metros cruise towards privatised gateways they deserve.        
	Why must we  the people and the place  pay the price for the red brigade being allowed to bypass the private option for airport revamp?        
	Metro spent two successive mornings at the airport to capture the horrors of merely entering the domestic terminal, which sadly reflects so much of the city we live in  chaotic, messy and reeking of incompetence.        
	CAR-LANE CHAOS        
	What: When Sandip Rakshit, 27, arrived at the domestic terminal on Monday morning to see off his parents, he was appalled. The chaos at the airport seems to get worse with every visit. It starts from the time you get off your car or cab and continues till the entrance and beyond, said the advertising executive.        
	The long queue of vehicles looks like rush-hour Burrabazar. Passengers frantically waving their hands and lugging their luggage across the four lanes reflects the utter lack of crowd and traffic management.         
	The honking is deafening. Taxis often enter the lanes earmarked for private vehicles and block the way.        
	Why: The chaos starts with lack of accountability and co-ordination as the airport authorities and the police play pass-the-buck.        
	Officers at the airport police station admit that constructing three lanes for vehicles in front of the terminal building was a mistake. That creates a bottleneck, said an officer.        
	Airport officials blame the police for the congestion. We have asked for additional manpower from the state government to manage traffic but are yet to receive any response, said airport director R. Srinivasan.        
	TROLLEY TRAUMA        
	What: Bhaswar Banerjee, 31, started his Goa holiday ranting about something that would have been farthest from his mind when he left home for the airport: a trolley.        
	A trolley may seem trivial but small things like these determine how outsiders perceive a city and its people, he said, struggling to find one that wasnt broken to wheel his luggage into the terminal.        
	I am here with my friends to take a flight to Mumbai en route to Goa and the last thing I should have to worry about now is a trolley. Its so irritating, added Bhaswar.        
	During peak hours, fliers scrambling for trolleys is a common sight outside the domestic terminal. You have to be very lucky to find one. If you are running late for a flight and have heavy luggage, just pray, said a frequent flier.        
	Some passengers learn the hard way not to accept a trolley that a seemingly helpful man masquerading as an airport employee might offer them. They demand a tip the moment the passenger is ready to go in.         
	Try arguing with them and you could even miss the check-in deadline.        
	Why: For an airport where the average flier footfall is 8,000 to 9,000 during peak hours, barely 2,500 trolleys fall woefully short of the requirement. Worse still, these trolleys are not maintained.        
	Airport authorities blame incoming passengers for part of the problem, saying they step out of the terminal with trolleys and leave them in the parking lot or even in the middle of the road.        
	But isnt a system in place to collect these trolleys and bring them back to the terminal at regular intervals? We are hamstrung by a shortage of manpower, argued a senior airport official.        
	QUEUE QUANDARY        
	What: Sonal Singhania, 37, reached the airport at 7.15am on Monday, only to spend the next 10 minutes looking at her watch repeatedly as the queue of around 30 people ahead of her moved ever so slowly past the terminal gate that leads directly to the check-in arena.         
	The common gate for passengers and visitors was open but most people chose to queue up in front of the other one. Not a single official was at hand for quick queue management.        
	I have never seen such a long queue at the gate of any other airport in the country. Things are much better managed at Mumbai and Delhi despite those airports being far busier, said fashion designer Singhania, a resident of Camac Street.         
	On an average, it now takes around 12 minutes for a passenger to just enter the terminal during rush hour.         
	Why: Poor queue management is the sole reason for the go-slow at the entrance.        
	As of now, there are two entry gates  one directly leading to the check-in area and the other to the visitors lounge. A third gate exclusively for passengers is opened occasionally, depending on the footfall.                    
	On any given day, most passengers make a beeline for the entrance to the visitors lounge because there is nobody to guide them to the direct-entry gates.        
	Even the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel who man the gates dont bother pointing out to passengers in the queue that they can use two other gates.        
	I saw everyone queuing up in front of the gate in the middle, so I also stood here. Nobody told us that we could enter through the other two gates, said Duke Pramanik, a telecom company executive booked on a flight to Bhubaneswar on Monday.         
	After he had stood in the queue for 10 minutes, Metro guided Duke to one of the empty gates.        
	WHEELCHAIR WOES        
	What: Clutching a crutch with his right hand and the trolley handle with his left, Abhirup Chowdhury, 24, hobbled into the airport on Tuesday morning after waiting more than a few minutes in the car for a wheelchair. Nei, shunlam keu niye gechhe (Its not here, heard someones taken it), he told Metro.        
	Hyderabad-based IT executive Abhirup, who fractured his leg in an accident, had heard the same thing last month while returning from a trip to his hometown. My parents, who had come to see me off, looked around for a wheelchair but didnt find one. I was forced to put my arms around their shoulders to get to the terminal, he recalled.        
	Ailing Narmada Das, 75, and Mintu Das, 70, suffered the same fate after reaching the airport to catch a flight to Agartala on Tuesday morning. A wheelchair for the elderly is a must. Arent the authorities bothered about the physically challenged and the infirm? demanded a relative.        
	Metro learnt later that a lone wheelchair was kept near one of the gates, but there was no sign anywhere to guide those who might need one.        
	Why: As in most public institutions, the needs of the physically challenged matter little.        
	The airport has a solitary wheelchair, the explanation being that airlines are supposed to arrange for facilities meant for passengers with special needs. We have wheelchairs but there is no allotted space outside the terminal building to keep them where passengers can find them, said an official.        
	At times, a wheelchair is available but there is nobody to steer it.

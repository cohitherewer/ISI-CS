          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have sought the call details of the teacher of a south Calcutta school accused of demanding a laptop as bribe from the father of a Class IV boy. The boys father filed a complaint on Monday alleging that his son had been detained in Class IV after he refused to bribe the teacher.         
	The boys father said the teacher had called him up to demand a laptop with Internet connection and also sent text messages asking for the same, said an officer. The cops said they would speak to the school authorities and the teacher after getting the call details.        
	The boys father told Metro that the teachers wife had called him at 7am on Tuesday, asking to meet him. She asked me to reconsider the matter. I told her I could not talk to her about the case as the matter was being probed, the father said.        
	He added that some teachers from his sons school visited his Tollygunge home on Tuesday evening and expressed solidarity with him. They asked me to continue my fight for justice,he said.

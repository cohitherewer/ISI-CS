The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Security scan for all for safer city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Security scan for all for safer city
  - Celebrities and students wonder why the VIP fuss about being frisked                                  
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra was at Hyatt Regency for a meeting on Saturday when he threw a fit on being stopped for frisking. The government has taken it upon itself to punish those responsible for what it terms a deplorable incident. Home secretary Samar Ghosh reiterated on Wednesday that an explanation was being sought from the hotel management about the harassment of minister Mishra.        
	Metro, which believes that uniform security-scan rules should apply to everyone to make the city safer, asked some celebrities and students what the fuss was about        
	SOURAV GANGULY
  Cricketer        
	We go through the security scan all the time. At airports, hotels and at all other important places. I dont have a problem with that at all.              
	SAHITA GHOSH
  Class XII student of Our Lady Queen of The Missions School        
	I dont see why a minister or a celebrity cant be put through the same drill, given the security threat everyone is under. I think everyone should be checked and no one should be given preferential treatment.         
	RITUPARNA SENGUPTA
  Actress        
	Security checks should be made mandatory irrespective of who you are or what your social status is. After all, a rule is a rule and it should be applicable to everyone. And why make a hue and cry about it? Dont we all have to go through security checks at airports? Then why object to it at other places?                
	INDRANI BANERJEE
  Third year student of comparative literature, Jadavpur University        
	The security check is necessary and I hate it when some people dont have to go through it. If Im being subjected to security checks then everyone should be made to go through them.              
	ANAMIKA KHANNA
  fashion designer        
	Security check is absolutely essential for everyone. How does anyone decide who is a celebrity or VIP and who is not? Tomorrow if anything happens, then what?

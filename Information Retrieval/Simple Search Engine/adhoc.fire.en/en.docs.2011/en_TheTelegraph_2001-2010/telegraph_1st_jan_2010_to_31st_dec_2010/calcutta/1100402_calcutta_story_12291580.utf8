                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scan reveals school fire hazard
          SUBHAJOY ROY AND JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Experts measure the width of a staircase used by Harrow Hall students in Karnani Mansion. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Two schools with over 500 students have been operating out of Karnani Mansion, opposite Stephen Court, violating fire safety rules, a team of police, CESC, civic body and fire services representatives found on Thursday.         
	The team has been visiting buildings in the city to identify the ones vulnerable to fire and suggest remedial measures. The experts also visited 20 Park Street during the day and found gaps in fire-prevention measures.        
	In one of the schools in Karnani Mansion, Harrow Hall, the width of the two staircases that the students use are 1.2m and 90cm. The maximum distance between a staircase and the point in the school farthest away from it is 47m.        
	According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, staircases in educational institutions should be at least 1.8m wide. A staircase should not be more than 6m away from any point within an educational institution, said Dipak Sarkar, the deputy director (fire prevention) of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.         
	The distance of the staircase from the point farthest away in St Judes High School, the other school, is nearly 20m, according to Sarkar. About 400 students study in the school.        
	In both schools we did not find any way leading to the roof. The students cannot even escape to the roof in case of a fire, he added.         
	The experts will prescribe corrective measures to both schools. If the changes are not made, legal action would be taken against them, said Banibrata Basu, the special commissioner of police (II) and a member of the team.         
	Stanley Correa, the director of St Judes High School, assured the inspection team of prompt action. Charles Mantosh, the chairman of Harrow Hall, said the school authorities planned to upgrade the fire safety infrastructure.        
	Authorities of several prominent schools are also thinking along similar lines.         
	Calcutta Girls High School and Calcutta Boys School have decided to install sprinklers, fire hydrants and an alarm system. Calcutta Boys will also set up an underground water reservoir in their new block.        
	We hope to obtain civic sanction for the project soon, said Raja McGee, the principal of Calcutta Boys.         
	We have fire extinguishers but since our building is more than 100 years old, we need to upgrade our system, said Basanti Biswas, the principal of Calcutta Girls.         
	At Welland Gouldsmith School, the authorities are planning to change the wires and conceal them. We will increase the frequency of fire drills from once a month, said principal Gillian Rosemary Hart.         
	Loreto Day School, Dharmatala, is planning to change its wooden staircase while South Point School will review its fire safety measures.         
	Firemen said all schools should have at least two staircases in addition to emergency fire exit. There should be ready access to sand bags and enough water. The students should undergo regular fire drills so that they can get out of the building within two minutes of a fire, said Sarkar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Enter North Wind, exit rain
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Enter North Wind, exit rain

	The cool, dry North Wind has started blowing across south Bengal, signalling the departure of the monsoon three weeks later than usual.        
	The withdrawal of monsoon from this region is expected to take place by the end of this week. The conditions have started looking favourable for the seasons departure, Gokul Chandra Debnath, director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore, told Metro.        
	The monsoon, which arrived on June 13 after a five-day delay, was supposed to depart around October 7. But the withdrawal of the monsoon, which began on September 27 from north-west India, halted on October 11.        
	The withdrawal line has been static since October 11, passing through Forbesganj, Dhanbad, Champa, Seoni, Khandwa, Bhavnagar and Porbandar, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).        
	The cause? Several atmospheric formations over the Bay of Bengal in October. From low-pressure areas to depressions, cyclonic circulations to a cyclonic storm, the Bay has seen it all this month. The formations brought rain, kept the season alive and delayed its withdrawal, said the IMD official.        
	Even on Monday, a cyclonic circulation off the Andhra Pradesh coast and a low-pressure trough from coastal Bengal to Tamil Nadu  which could bring some rain to south Bengal in the next few days  slowed down the departure. Once these systems weaken by the end of this week, the withdrawal process should be complete, said a Met official.        
	The cool, dry northerlies and northwesterlies have already started blowing across the Indo-Gangetic plain, as the region enters the transitional phase before winter.        
	The city and its surrounding areas have been receiving some of the flow, said O. P. Sharma, chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.        
	The windflow is responsible for the slight nip in the air towards late evenings and early mornings. But the flow is still weak over south Bengal, he added.        
	Debnath said the flow of northerlies and northwesterlies would strengthen with the lifting of the cloud cover.        
	So, is winter around the corner? No. Winter is not expected to arrive earlier than usual (around the first week of December), said Debnath.  
	WHY IS MONSOON STILL HERE? Estimated date of departure was October 7. Atmospheric formations over the Bay in October have brought rain and kept the season alive. The withdrawal line is static since October 11.  
	WHEN IS IT SLATED TO DEPART? End of this week.  
	WHY THE NIP IN THE NIGHT/MORNING AIR? The northerlies, northwesterlies have started blowing.

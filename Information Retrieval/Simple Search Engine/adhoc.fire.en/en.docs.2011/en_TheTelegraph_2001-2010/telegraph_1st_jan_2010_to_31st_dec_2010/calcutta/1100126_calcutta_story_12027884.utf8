          A STAFF REPORTER                           Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with Mexican writer Volpi Escalante at the Book Fair launch on Monday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	The 34th Calcutta Book Fair was inaugurated on Monday afternoon with Milon Mela far from ready, which prompted the chief minister to ask those responsible for fairground maintenance to put things in order.        
	Members of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, the organisers, poured out the problems they were facing at Milon Mela during an informal interaction with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee after Mexican writer Volpi Escalante launched the annual event.        
	The chief minister asked us about the problems we were facing and patiently heard what we had to say. He asked all the agencies concerned to immediately co-ordinate among themselves and address the lack of amenities at the fairground, said Tridib Chatterjee, the secretary of the guild.        
	Organisers of several fairs, including the Industrial India Trade Fair, had earlier complained about the lack of facilities at Milon Mela.        
	On Monday, Bhattacharjee reportedly told officials to prepare the ground properly for the fair. The chief minister meant that if the fairground is ready for the Book Fair, it can host all other fairs without any problem, said a guild member.        
	Subrata Gupta, the managing director of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, the agency that does the bulk of the maintenance, and Khalil Ahmed, the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas, were among the government officials who faced a volley of complaints from guild representatives after the chief minister left.        
	Ground convener Sudhangshu Dey asked the officials about the lack of drinking water and toilets and the ground and the road around it not being ready in the meeting in the presence of the principal secretary of information and cultural affairs, Subesh Das, said sources.        
	Entry to the Book Fair will be free on Republic Day. From Wednesday, visitors will have to buy tickets for Rs 5 to get in. The fair will be open from noon to 8pm on working days and till 9pm on holidays till February 7.

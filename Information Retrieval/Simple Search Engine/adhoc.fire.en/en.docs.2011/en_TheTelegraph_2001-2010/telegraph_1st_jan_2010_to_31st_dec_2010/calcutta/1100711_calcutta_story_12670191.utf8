The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fouled by the fundamentalist 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fouled by the fundamentalist 
										      -Beware of the football zealot till the Cup is won                                          
	He waits to rise this time every four years. Not that he can be ignored at other times. He is the guy who thinks football is the only way to be and wants the world to believe the same. If peaceful means dont work, he has a tendency to turn violent.         
	Sometimes he can be a she too. Thirteen ways to know a football fundamentalist.         
	 He looks down on you if you dont know the difference between off-sides, penalties, long passes, short passes, dribbles, dodges, tie-breaker rules, sudden deaths and whatever. He thinks you are a worm if you dont know additional time from extra time or how to pronounce Schweinsteiger (pronunciation s-bainsh-tigah).         
	 If in a good mood, he tries to educate the ignorant on off-sides, penalties, long passes, short passes, dribble, dodge, tie-breakers, sudden deaths and whatever. A long pass is one that takes you closer to goal in a shorter period of time than the short passes. Remember Bergkamps goal against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup. He only had to dribble past one defender after de Boer curled the ball over seven players to him.         
	 He can hold forth for an hour on why the FIFA should allow the use of technology.        
	 He can hold forth for another hour on his favourite shot. It was in August 1996, the first day of the Premier League. Manchester United was leading 2-0 against Wimbledon. David Beckham received the ball in his own half a couple of yards from the half line, looked up and saw that the goalie had taken a few steps out of the goal post and floated the ball over his head into the net.         
	 He roars at the referee. (The idiot, he thundered after Lampards goal against Germany was disallowed in the pre-quarterfinal.)         
	 He claps. At 2 in the morning. Loudly. Then shouts.         
	 He quizzes his children often. On Dunga. Have they done the right thing by sacking Dunga? On Maradona. Against which team did Maradona receive the red card in the 1982 World Cup? On the history of football.         
	 He thinks they are not growing up the right way when they cant answer. He questions their moral character.         
	 He cuts you short if you have something to say about Brazil. When they lose, he cries. He has a softer side too.         
	 If you crack a football joke, as Rabi Ghosh did in Dhanni Meye  Why is there only one ball for all these men? Each should have one  he is not amused.         
	 He doesnt like other people reading the newspaper.         
	 He looks down on cricket. Its a womans game, he says loftily. (Yes, women fundamentalists say it too.)         
	 He hates Mahendra Singh Dhoni for daring to get married in the crucial final week and displacing football from the headlines with his marriage details.       SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY

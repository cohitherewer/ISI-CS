          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University has introduced a compulsory subject in its newly-launched B.Ed course in an attempt to discourage corporal punishment in schools.        
	The 50-marks paper on mental health and life skill is aimed at equipping teachers with skills to maintain child-friendly atmosphere in classrooms.        
	The subject deals extensively with the mental health of children and the measures to address problems arising out of mental health disorders, said Muktipada Sinha, the head of the education department at JU.        
	Designed under the guidance of psychologists and psychiatrists, the subject will train teachers in understanding students mental state. Teachers will also be urged not to misuse the authority bestowed on them.        
	Most BEd institutions in the city and elsewhere now teach mental hygiene as an optional paper. The subject does not cover the burning issue  managing students with abnormal behaviour without inflicting corporal punishment or mental torture on them.        
	Sinha blamed the rising number of complaints about corporal punishment on the outdated topics being taught as part of the optional paper and lack of training among teachers to tackle mental health disorders of students.        
	Satyajit Ash, a city-based psychiatrist whose suggestions JU had sought to prepare the syllabus of mental health and life skill, has urged other universities to incorporate the subject in their BEd courses.        
	There is no point in organising seminars and workshops to sensitise school teachers to the effects of corporal punishment, said Ash.        
	Upgrading the BEd course by introducing subjects like mental health and life skill, which deals with issues related to modern children, will be more effective in rooting out corporal punishment from campuses.        
	Another psychiatrist said: Corporal punishment has not stopped because it is impossible for the secondary education board to sensitise the 1.55 lakh-plus teachers across the state through workshops and seminars.        
	Blood donation: More than 1,450 people, including V.N. Tripathi, the general manager of Eastern Railway, donated blood at Sealdah and Howrah stations, and Kanchrapara and Liluah workshops. Over 3,000 people attended health check-up camps organised at these places.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Norms eased for IPL
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Norms eased for IPL
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday relaxed norms governing the use of loudspeakers and bursting of crackers during IPL matches at Eden Gardens, following a plea by KKR.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice P.C. Ghosh issued the order following a submission by KKR lawyer Pratap Chatterjee that the crowds at the stadium could not be controlled without using loudspeakers and crackers to be burst would not produce more than 90 decibels of sound.        
	The prayer by the petitioner, KKR Sports Private Limited, has some merit. So, the court is staying the notification (on sound norms) of the pollution control board for three months in the present case only, the bench said.        
	The bench also said the notification could be stayed as there were no residential buildings around the ground and the matches would be held after office hours.        
	The boards notification, sent to police last month, had cited a high court order banning the use of loudspeakers in open places and bursting of crackers producing more than 60 decibels of sound during exams. Loudspeakers can be used in closed places if the sound is kept at 55 decibels or less.        
	The police sent the notification to the Cricket Association of Bengal, which in turn forwarded it to KKR.        
	Appealing against the order, Chatterjee said: The notification should be stayed. Is it possible to control such huge crowds without using a public address system?... As for crackers, they will not produce sound more than 90 decibels.        
	CAB lawyer Gitanath Ganguli said the court did not treat the stadium as an open place. The order gave the organisers permission to use loudspeakers according to their need.        
	Appearing for the state, advocate-general Balai Ray said: The government had only carried out the court order.        
	KKRs Jeet Banerjee said: We welcome the high courts decision.

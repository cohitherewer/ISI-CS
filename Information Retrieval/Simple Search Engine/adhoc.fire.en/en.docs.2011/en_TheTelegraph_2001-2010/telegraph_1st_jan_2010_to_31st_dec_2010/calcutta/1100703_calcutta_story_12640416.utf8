          RITH BASU                                                
	They werent crying. They werent cursing. They just stared at one another with a blank look in their eyes.        
	What can we do? We tried everything we could, mumbled Edmar Barros, a football coach and agent.        
	The fight had gone out of the 21 Brazil nationals cramped into a Narendrapur living room on Friday evening to watch their team samba into the semis.        
	The drumbeat had turned into a dirge after 93 minutes of bruising battle as The Netherlands sent Brazil crashing out of the World Cup.        
	The evening had not shown the night, starting as it did on a dream note  a Robinho strike in the 10th minute. The party was on for the Brazilian brigade of men, women and children armed with a vuvuzela and dressed in team colours.        
	As the Port Elizabeth stadium came alive, the vuvuzela in the Narendrapur room was playing out loud  often playfully into the ear of a neighbour.        
	Less than half an hour later, the vuvuzela had fallen silent, the shoulders had dropped and the shouts of joy had turned into shrieks of disbelief.        
	The second half had turned to nightmare with back-to-back strikes from Sneijder and company and the Oranjes on the rampage.        
	The first signs of frustration were heard when Felipe Melo was sent off in the 74th minute. He has always been a bad-tempered player, shouted Fernando Santos, who works with an NGO.        
	Bruno Silva, 32, a soccer agent in town, tried to play the perfect host by keeping up the cheer for Kaka and Robinho. As if on cue, Kaka broke free on the left and the mini-stadium in a Narendrapur room rose to its feet. Only to collapse in dismay.        
	As time wore on, the 21 die-hard supporters of 10-man Brazil began to wither. Even nine-year-old Jonathan, who was shouting Kaka, Kaka into the Vuvuzela in the first half every time the number 10 touched the ball, was reduced to a plea: Will he not score even once?        
	The boy from Bridge International School had been let down by his hero.        
	As the clock counted down and the final whistle was blown, there was stunned silence. Then, despair turned to disgust  mostly with Dunga and his tactics.        
	How can you possibly go into the World Cup without Ronaldinho and Adriano, grumbled Edvan Carvalho, the coach of a local team here who is even learning Bengali at Jadavpur University.        
	End of 2010, wait for 2014. For the next World Cup, I will be back in Brazil, resolved Bruno.        
	Not many Brazil fanatics in Calcutta could console themselves with that on Friday night. I am devastated. I dont know what to say, said clinical researcher Abhijeet Mukherjee. I fail to understand what happened to Brazil in the second half. What was Kaka doing? thundered Mukherjee, anguish quickly turning to anger.        
	Why did Brazil lose? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

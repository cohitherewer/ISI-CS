The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fake IT raid at home for Rs 2cr
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fake IT raid at home for Rs 2cr
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Three thieves masquerading as income-tax sleuths entered a transformer-oil traders Beleghata house on Thursday when only his wife was at home and walked away with Rs 2 crore in cash after handing her a fake seizure list.        
	Tarachand Daftari, 52, had ostensibly earned the cash from selling a prime plot of land on CIT Road earlier this month, though police are yet to find out why he had kept his crores at home.        
	Police said the calling bell at the Daftaris second-floor flat at 74 Hemchandra Naskar Street rang around 2.05pm, when Tarachand was at work in his central Calcutta shop-cum-office and the couples three daughters were in school.         
	Wife Manju, 43, told the cops that she answered the bell immediately and found three formally dressed middle-aged men flashing income-tax department identity cards standing at the door. They introduced themselves in Hindi and walked in before I could realise what was happening, an investigator quoted Manju as saying.        
	When the homemaker asked them what they were looking for, one of them said they would give her a list of the seized items later. They also warned her against making any noise, saying that policemen were waiting downstairs and another IT team was raiding a relatives residence in Phoolbagan.         
	According to Manju, the trio didnt say anything more but kept an eye on her even as they moved from one room to another looking for what they wanted.        
	She did admit to feeling nervous but didnt feel compelled to scream for help even once during the 25-odd minutes the trio took to raid her home. There was no frenzied hunt for cash under mattresses or the sofa. They didnt even touch some cupboards, an investigator said.        
	Manju, who quietly followed them to each room, told the cops that the trio would randomly open a drawer and close it on not finding anything they were interested in. One of them even climbed the kitchen-counter top to open a loft that suddenly caught his eye, she said.        
	The raid ended with the trio finding a bag stashed with the cash inside a steel safe in one of the bedrooms. There was also some gold jewellery in the safe but they didnt show any interest in it, Manju said.        
	So didnt the homemaker press the panic button and try to call anyone once they found the cash? They seized my cellphone along with the cash and handed me a document where they mentioned finding Rs 90 lakh. I was too stunned to react, and they were gone by the time it dawned on me that we might have been robbed, recounted Manju.        
	She used the landline phone to first call her husbands tax consultant Abhijit Ghosh and ask him whether he knew anything about the raid. As Ghosh contacted his acquaintances in the income-tax department, Tarachand lodged a complaint with Beleghata police station after hearing from his wife what had happened.        
	The Daftaris were unavailable for comment till late on Thursday with the investigating team questioning them for hours about the Rs 2 crore they had kept in the house for more than a fortnight and the robbery in the afternoon.        
	Praveen Jain, a nephew of Tarachand who stays in Phoolbagan, said his uncle had called him around 2.30pm to ask whether there was any IT raid at his home. I was puzzled by his question. Moments later, he called again to say that he had been robbed. The robbers had planned the operation well, timing their visit to the house when nobody except my aunt was there, he added.        
	Praveen declined comment on the amount of cash his relatives had kept at home.         
	Tax consultant Ghosh insisted that he didnt know about his client keeping Rs 2 crore in cash at home.        
	Whatever be the case, someone close to the family may have known about the cash and either planned the robbery or tipped off the gang that executed it, he said.        
	Detective department chief Damayanti Sen said the preliminary investigation suggested the involvement of insiders. It appears that the trio who turned up knew about the cash. The tip-off was very specific, which raises the possibility of insiders being involved, she added.        
	According to the police, the robbery could be the biggest in a city home in recent years. Thieves have entered homes in various guises but this is the first known instance of criminals knocking on the door posing as income-tax sleuths. It comes at a time when the spotlight is on IT raids in the IPL scandal.

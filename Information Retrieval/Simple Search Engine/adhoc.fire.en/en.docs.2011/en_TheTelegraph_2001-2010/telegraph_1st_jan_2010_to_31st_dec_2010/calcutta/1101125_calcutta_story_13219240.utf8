The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ransom tossed out of train window
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ransom tossed out of train window
  - Cash bag lands on track, kidnapped realtor lands up at railway station          OUR BUREAU                          Morgan Freeman as detective Alex Cross in the Metro train scene from Along Came a Spider that found a real-life parallel in the Anup Ray ransom drama                                        
	Kidnapped realtor Anup Ray returned home unharmed early on Wednesday after his family ostensibly fulfilled his captors demand to toss a bagful of cash out of a moving local train in a scene reminiscent of a 2001 Hollywood ransom drama.         
	Wife Sangita and three other women assigned to carry the bag containing Rs 7 lakh  the kidnappers had insisted that no male family member be involved in the task  found 53-year-old Anup with his face and body draped in a red shawl at Jadavpur railway station around 5.30am.        
	A relative said Anup was spotted getting off the same train that the quartet had boarded at Subhashgram station, on the southern fringes, after completing the ransom-payment operation.        
	As instructed by the gang, the women threw the bag out of a Diamond Harbour-bound train at the designated level crossing between Sonarpur and Subhashgram stations. They got off at Subhashgram and took the next available train back to Jadavpur, the relative told Metro.        
	The alleged Ray ransom plot bears a striking resemblance to a scene from Along Came a Spider, where a US senators daughter is kidnapped and detective Morgan Freeman delivers a ransom of $10 million dollars in diamonds stashed into a thermos by tossing it out of a Metro train towards a figure standing by the tracks.        
	Police officers who interrogated Anup on his return have, however, picked holes in his version of how he was kidnapped from in front of his Bikramgarh home on Tuesday and shifted from one location to another.              
	An officer at Jadavpur police station said Anup told the interrogation team that his kidnappers were unarmed. He also said he was taken to Talpukur, Mullickpur and Julpia on a motorbike after the car used in the kidnapping dropped him and his captors at Garia.        
	 The police escorted him to these places on Wednesday, but he failed to identify the exact locations to which the kidnappers had allegedly taken him, the officer said.         
	The car number provided by the Ray family also did not match any in the registration records.        
	Anups brother Prabir said his sibling provided the required information to the cops despite suffering from stress and fatigue. We suspect he was abducted because of business rivalry. As of now, he is not in a condition to answer more questions, he added.         
	The kidnappers had apparently allowed Anup to call wife Sangita on Tuesday. He told her that he was being held captive at Mograhat but hung up  family members insist he was forced to do so  the moment a police officer took the phone.        
	The police are also surprised that the kidnappers settled for Rs 7 lakh in ransom after first demanding Rs 50 lakh.         
	 We have drawn up identikits of the kidnappers, based on the descriptions given by the victim. We will be checking Anup Rays bank accounts and verifying other assets to find out how the family arranged for the ransom in such a short span of time, said the police chief of South 24-Parganas, L.N. Meena.        
	According to a family member, the ransom was finalised when the gang leader called Sangita on her cellphone around 2am. After the amount was settled, the caller asked her to send four women on a Diamond Harbour-bound train from Jadavpur at 3.15am. However, the 3.15am train did not stop there and the four women had to board the 4.15am Dn local, he said.        
	The quartet tossed out the cash bag from a window of the trains last compartment, the family member said.

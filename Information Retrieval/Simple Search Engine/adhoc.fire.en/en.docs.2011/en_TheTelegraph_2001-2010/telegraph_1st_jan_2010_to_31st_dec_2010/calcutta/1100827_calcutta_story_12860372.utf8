The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Death after soccer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Death after soccer
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Sukanta Nandi, a 30-year-old former footballer, died during a practice session near his Howrah home, minutes after a ball hit his chest on Thursday morning.        
	Rajib Manna, a fellow player, said Sukanta told his mates that he was feeling unwell and sat down on a bench. He fainted after a while. We rushed him to a local nursing home, where he was declared dead, Manna said.        
	The body has been sent for post-mortem. A police probe suggested that Sukanta had died of heart failure.         
	The resident of Liluah F Road had played for the junior side of a first-division club in Calcutta. Sukanta had been working as a salesman for a private firm. He used to practise at a local ground.        
	He loved football, said sister Sarmistha. He had aspired to represent a renowned club in Calcutta.         
	Sarmistha said Sukanta had fallen ill three years ago after receiving a ball on his chest and had undergone treatment. Chest specialist Satish Gupta described Sukantas death as very unusual. Maybe he had a heart problem. An injury can cause bleeding in the heart and make it stop, he said.

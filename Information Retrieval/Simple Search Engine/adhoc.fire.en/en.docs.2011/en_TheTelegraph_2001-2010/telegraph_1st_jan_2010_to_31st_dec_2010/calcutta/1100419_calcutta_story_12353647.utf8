The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Murder plot after brawl
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Murder plot after brawl
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Hardeep Singh alias Vicky had decided to kill his rivals immediately after a brawl outside a south Calcutta lounge bar on March 21, sleuths interrogating the 25-year-old said.        
	Vicky, a Tiljala resident who was picked up from Park Street on Saturday morning, had asked friend Debojyoti Ray to arrange for a gun before his rivals could reach home. Debojyoti was arrested a week after the incident.        
	The duo had allegedly shot at leather dealer Shaqueel Khan, 28, and DJ Vishal Agarwal, 27, moments after they stepped out of New Sharma Hotel on Ballygunge Circular Road where they were eating breakfast on their way home from the lounge bar.        
	Officers questioning Vicky said he and his friends had fought with Babar Khan in front of Ginger, a lounge bar on Hazra Road. Babar had gone there with his group, which included his girlfriend.        
	Vicky and Babar, both nightclub regulars, knew each other.         
	Vicky fancied Babars girlfriend and misbehaved with her in front of Babar and his friends outside the lounge bar. That led to a brawl between the two groups, said an officer probing the case.        
	After the brawl, the Ginger authorities allowed Babar and his friends to enter but stopped Vicky and his group. It annoyed Vicky. He immediately left the place with Debojyoti on a motorcycle. It was then that Vicky decided to kill his rivals, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.        
	The two went to a place on the eastern fringes that often served as a liquor den for the gang and collected an improvised revolver.        
	They returned and started waiting for Babar and his friends in front of the lounge bar. But Babar had left by then. When the others emerged and headed for the Ballygunge eatery, the duo trailed them on the motorcycle, said an officer.        
	When Shaqueel and Vishal stepped out of the eatery in search of a cigarette shop, Vicky and Debojyoti did not miss their chance.

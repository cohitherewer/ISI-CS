                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      True spirit for building puja
          A STAFF REPORTER      
	The pre-Puja buzz at apartment complexes across town is not just about what mishti to order for the bhog or who will open the dhunuchi naach. A hundred housing societies have pledged to celebrate Puja with a conscience and signed up for the first edition of The Telegraph Festival Of Joy, presented by Nerolac.        
	Organised in association with CESC Ltd with radio partner Friends FM and health partner Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, Festival of Joy stresses on civic consciousness, community participation and social commitment.        
	The guidelines for the event are simple: make your apartment puja inclusive, safe and sensitive. Puja organisers will have to keep in mind civic measures like first-aid facilities, fire-prevention tools and adherence to immersion norms. Regarding community participation, arrangements for the aged and the disabled near the pandal are a must while on the social commitment front, measures like displaying emergency numbers at the reception and puja venue and drinking water facility should be looked into.        
	After an initial round of screening, celebrity judges will visit a shortlist of 10 apartments on Ashtami. The complex that gets crowned Model Apartment Puja stands to win Rs 50,000, which must be utilised for projects mirroring the spirit of the exercise. Apartment pujas with 5-star status will receive Rs 15,000, 4-star pujas will get Rs 10,000, 3-star pujas Rs 7,500 and 2-star ones Rs 5,000 each. The results will be announced on Dashami.        
	Our complex has residents from across the country, many of whom might not know much about Durga puja or might miss home during the festive times. Weve always tried to ensure that ours is a festival for everyone, says Dilip Banerjee from CGEA Salt Lake.        
	The puja at Ujwala, City Centre, is just a year old but the residents are set to compete for the Model Puja crown. Weve tried to ensure cleanliness, undertaken anti-pollution drives like planting more trees and called in pest control services so that the pujas are enjoyable for all, said committee member Chaitali Dutta Chowdhury.        
	We will be on the lookout for honest efforts made by the organisers, not their budget or scale of celebrations, said the principal of a city school who is part of the team that will prepare the shortlist.

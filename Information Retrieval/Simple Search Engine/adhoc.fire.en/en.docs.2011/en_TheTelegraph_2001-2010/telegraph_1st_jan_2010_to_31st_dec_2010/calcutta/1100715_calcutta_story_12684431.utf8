The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rs 2.5 crore heroin haul
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rs 2.5 crore heroin haul
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth was arrested with 2.5kg heroin, worth about Rs 2.5 crore, in a Tiljala hideout on Wednesday. Police claimed Sheikh Raju had brought the consignment to the city to distribute it among those who sell to addicts.        
	On Tuesday, officers of Government Railway Police had arrested two drug peddlers, Pintu Debnath and Mohammad Khan, in Sonarpur and seized 1.4kg heroin from them.        
	Though the duo did not tip us off about Raju, it appears the three work for a drug-peddling racket active in the city and its adjoining areas. They are middle-level operatives. We are tying to track down the leaders of the racket, who hardly visit the city and run their business with the help of their aides, said an officer of Tiljala police station.        
	During interrogation, Raju allegedly identified the drug dealer from whom he had collected the consignment. The investigators did not reveal the details.        
	The operatives of the racket did not have to pay to collect the heroin. Once it was sold, they would get a certain percentage of the profit, said an officer.

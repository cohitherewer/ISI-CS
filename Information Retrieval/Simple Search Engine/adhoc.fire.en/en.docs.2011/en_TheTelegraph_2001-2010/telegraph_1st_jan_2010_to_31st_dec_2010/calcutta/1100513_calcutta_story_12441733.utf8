The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Change drives in: licence test goes from farce to foolproof in two weeks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Change drives in: licence test goes from farce to foolproof in two weeks
          RITH BASU                                            (From top): The Metro report on April 29 exposing the driving-test sham on Penn Road; the motor vehicles inspector who was missing in action two weeks ago was in the thick of things on Wednesday, keeping an eye on all candidates; the drivers seat belonged to candidates and not a driver from a training school.

	The law is back in the drivers seat, at least for now.         
	The farcical driving-licence test conducted by the Alipore RTO (route transport office) on Penn Road every Wednesday has gone from sham to strict within two weeks of a Metro expos on how back-seat driving could get you a licence to kill.        
	Metro parked itself on Penn Road this Wednesday for a repeat test that revealed a reformed licence regime. Spot the difference        
	What we saw        
	April 28: A trainer from a motor training school is at the wheel, a group of applicants are bunched in the back seat and the motor vehicles inspector is missing in action. The driver takes the car 100 metres down a low-traffic stretch and the applicants at the back are asked to watch him. Test over. Success rate: 100 per cent.        
	May 12: Candidates listed for the licence test start converging on Penn Road around noon in cars belonging to various motor training schools. The names emblazoned on the cars look familiar. The inspector, who arrives at 1.15pm, looks familiar as well. Only his shades are missing, replaced by a pair of glasses.        
	As soon as the inspector signals he is ready, the 100-strong contingent is divided into groups of four. The groups are asked to get into four cars parked in a straight line. Three applicants each get into the back of every car and one takes the drivers seat.         
	At 1.25pm, the convoy starts moving with the inspector in the front passengers seat of the first vehicle. All four candidates in the car take turns to drive, the inspector watching their every move. The inspector then gets into the next car as the convoy enters Belvedere Road. By the time the convoy returns to Penn Road, all 16 applicants have been at the wheel.        
	What we heard            
	April 28: Shouldnt I drive? asks a bewildered candidate on being told to sit at the back. You all carefully watch how I drive. Otatei kaaj hoye jabe, retorts the driver from the motor training school.        
	May 12: Dilip, a trainer with Mahamaya Motor Training School in Garia, wipes the sweat off his brow before complaining about the change. It was much simpler before The Telegraph clicked our pictures. Otherwise candidates wouldnt have to drive to get a licence. This is a very time-consuming process, though it is for everyones good, he sighs.        
	Maybe not for some taking the driving test, though. One candidate is asked to get off after the car refuses to move and the engine goes dead every time he releases the clutch. It happens five times. Turns out he had forgotten to put the car in first gear.        
	Five of Dilips candidates fail the test, and at least one in every car on an average.        
	What it means        
	Had they come to Penn Road a fortnight ago, each of those who failed the test on Wednesday would have got a licence to kill. Sources say at least 25 per cent of those issued licences by the Alipore RTO  till Metro blew the lid off the back-seat test  lacked even basic driving skills.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strength boost for stand
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Strength boost for stand
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The contentious IPL Club Lounge at the Eden Gardens would be bolstered following the recommendations of the public works department (PWD) before the next home match of the Kolkata Knight Riders on April 1.         
	The framework of the air-conditioned lounge and the 400-seat gallery over it would not be touched but the steel plates bolted to the walls would be welded together, said an engineer. The gap between the plywood walls of the structure and its steel frame would be reduced.        
	A team of PWD engineers, accompanied by IPL officials, inspected the Club Lounge on Wednesday afternoon and suggested changes to strengthen it.        
	Those who built the stand deviated from the original plan. Safety was compromised. It is sheer luck that there was no accident, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami. The structure was built like a film set. Thankfully, there was no dancing in the gallery and not too many people were allowed in, he added.        
	The changes would have to include the recommendations of the fire services department, stressed the PWD brass. The departments engineers would inspect the modified Club Lounge.        
	We have passed on the suggestions to engineers. We hope to make the changes in the next two weeks, said Jeet Banerjee, a KKR executive.        
	The state government has called a coordination meeting of agencies on the issue at Writers Buildings on Thursday. We want to ensure that the structure is built according to the rules, said chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti.

                      Labour of love                    Photography takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still  Dorothea Lange.        The world belongs to children and they hold the future of this global village in their small palms. And we adults can only ensure and pray for them: let there be sunshine always. June 1 is marked the International Childrens Day. This day is celebrated and observed globally to protect the fundamental rights of children of this universe. PhotoPeer, an association of city-based photographers, is celebrating International Childrens Day in a novel way: the association is currently holding its first photographic exposition where photographs on different aspects of children are depicted. The multi-coloured realm of dreams and aspirations that Nature bestows on young souls confront the brutal, sordid, gloomy everyday world and the fragile souls tear apart, bleed silently to extinction. Cant we do something to make them smile and ensure a better future for them? Surely we all can endeavour to make children happy and bask in the glory of natural wealth and better health. PhotoPeer, in association with Russian Centre of Science and Culture, is doing just that: spreading sunshine and laughter through its labour of love.                   Event: Let there be sunshine always  a photographic exposition; When: Till June 5; 4 pm - 7 pm; Where: Gorky Sadan

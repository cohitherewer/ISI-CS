The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blow hot over wind and power
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blow hot over wind and power
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Celsius shed a degree on Wednesday but Calcutta found little relief in the reading with hot winds blowing in through south Bengal and peak-hour power cuts keeping the discomfort factor high.         
	A trough of low pressure over Gangetic Bengal held out hope for a further fall in the maximum temperature from Friday, though the weatherman warned that high humidity would negate that gain.        
	The prevailing situation is likely to continue for another 24 hours. From Friday, we expect marginal relief in terms of a temperature drop but you will still feel the discomfort, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Although the maximum temperature recorded in Alipore was lower than Tuesdays at 37.9 degrees Celsius, it was still two degrees above normal. In Dum Dum, the maximum temperature was close to the April second-week highs at 39.1 degrees Celsius.        
	Rain has eluded the city this summer with conditions conducive to a Norwester flattering to deceive at least twice in the past week.        
	According to the Met office, there is little chance of rain over at least the next 24 hours.         
	 Hot winds from the western and central part of the country are blowing in, raising temperatures in south Bengal to heat-wave levels. We have not issued any heat-wave warning for Calcutta but the city wont escape the swelter either, said Debnath.        
	As the sun blazed, long hours of loadshedding in areas under the West Bengal Electricity Distribution Company Ltd as well as CESC-served areas compounded the Calcuttans woes.        
	 The shortfall in the city and its neighbourhood on Wednesday shot up to 250MW during the evening peak hours. In the districts, the deficit soared to 400MW.         
	Power department officials said loadshedding in the city ranged between 90 minutes and two hours.        
	Thursday could be worse in parts of central and north Calcutta with CESC carrying out urgent maintenance of its Strand (south) distribution station between 10am and 1pm.         
	Power supply to parts of Kalakar Street, Hariram Goenka Street, Burtolla Street, Ratan Sarkar Garden Lane, Jadulal Mullick Road, Tara Sundari Park and Debendra Dutta Lane could be affected, officials said.

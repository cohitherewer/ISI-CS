	Surabhi Banerjee, the vice-chancellor of Central University of Orissa, delivered the Sukhnandan Bhagat Memorial Lecture on womens education in the new millennium at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture on January 9.         
	She traced the evolution of womens education from medieval times, the period of foreign conquests, the impact of the purdah system to the social reforms initiated by Raja Ram Mohun Roy.        
	Our leaders realised the importance of womens education after Independence. Educated women can influence the development of the country. Today, the rate of growth of female literacy is 14.87 per cent, compared with the male literacy rate of 11.72 per cent, said Banerjee.         
	Gender discrimination is one of the biggest drawbacks to womens education, said Banerjee, talking about the current scenario. We may no longer have the purdah system, but our minds are still closed, she felt.        
	For womens education to be effective, it will have to blend the rural and urban, the national and the global, Banerjee added.                    JM

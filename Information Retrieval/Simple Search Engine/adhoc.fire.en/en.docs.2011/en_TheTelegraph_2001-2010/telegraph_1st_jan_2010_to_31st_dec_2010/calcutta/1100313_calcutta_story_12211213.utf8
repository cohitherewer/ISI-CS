The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suchitra phone line snapped
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Suchitra phone line snapped
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Suchitra Sen                                  
	The telephone line at Suchitra Sens Ballygunge home was disconnected on Thursday for non-payment of dues.         
	On Friday, Sibendu Basu, the reclusive former actresss advocate and power-of-attorney holder, was told by the telephone office that Sens bank had declined the ECS payment of her bills.         
	We then came to know from the bank that the income tax department had seized my clients account, including her savings of over Rs 40,000, on February 2, Basu said.         
	According to Basu, the I-T department had slapped Sen with wealth tax dues of Rs 8,69,359 in December 2009 for 1996-97 for her three flats. Basu moved the appellate tribunal for a stay on the order, which was granted in January 2010.        
	On February 11, the tribunal passed an order quashing the earlier demand for Rs 8,69,359, Basu pointed out.         
	Based on a writ petition filed by Basu, the high court ordered that Sen should pay only Rs 75,000 and submit a bond approved by an I-T official stating that she would not sell or alienate the property.        
	I-T officials said the order was issued after they had taken action against Sens bank account, but Sens counsel claimed that the department had acted just to harass and humiliate her.         
	Sen has already paid the amount that she was asked to and the bond has been sent for the approval of the assistant commissioner. It has not been returned to us yet, he said.

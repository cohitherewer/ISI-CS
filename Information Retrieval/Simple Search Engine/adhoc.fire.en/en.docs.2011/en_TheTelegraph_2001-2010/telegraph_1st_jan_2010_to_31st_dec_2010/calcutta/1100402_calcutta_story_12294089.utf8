          A STAFF REPORTER                          The mangled car after the mishap. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Four members of a family and two others were killed on Thursday evening after a trailer crushed their car at Howrahs Bagnan on Thursday evening.         
	Bijoygarh resident Jaydeep Mukherjee, a trader, was taking his family for an impromptu holiday to Digha after failing to get tickets for the Kolkata Knight Riders-Deccan Chargers match at the Eden Gardens, said a relative.        
	Jaydeep, 32, his wife Monima, 28, her sister Jayita Mukherjee, 25, the couples two-year-old daughter Shonama, the familys help Kalpana, 34, and their driver Tarak Sarkar, 40, were killed.        
	Witnesses said Sarkar lost control of the Maruti 800 near the Khadinan crossing on National Highway 6 and came in the path of the trailer.        
	The two vehicles were moving parallel to each other at high speed. When the trailer tried to turn left at the crossing, the car skidded and rolled under its rear wheels, said Jagannath Raychowdhury, a witness.        
	The trailer overturned but its driver managed to flee within seconds. The six died instantly. Residents of the area pulled the bodies out of the car, which was reduced to a mangled mass of metal, said Tapan Mondal, another witness.        
	Jaydeep was very upset because he didnt get tickets for the IPL match at Eden. He decided to take his family to Digha on the spur of the moment. They were to return and watch Sundays match against Kings XI Punjab at the stadium, said Jaydeeps uncle Manabendra.        
	They would not have died if Jaydeep got tickets to the match. The family would have been at Eden then, he added.        
	Neighbours and relatives described the family as fun-loving. They often went for short trips. They were happy as Joyeetas marriage had recently been fixed, said Manabendra.

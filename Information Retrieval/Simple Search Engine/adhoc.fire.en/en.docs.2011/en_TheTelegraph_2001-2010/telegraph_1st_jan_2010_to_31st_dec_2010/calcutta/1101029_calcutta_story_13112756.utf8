          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have arrested five suspected members of a gang that stole two-wheelers from roads and recovered six vehicles lifted over the past month.        
	The accused, said to be new faces, have apparently confessed that they had been stealing two-wheelers parked on roads over the past six months.        
	Damayanti Sen, the joint commissioner of police, crime, said one of the accused was an expert in preparing fake documents and changing the number plates of stolen vehicles.        
	We have traced the owners of two of the six motorcycles that have been recovered. We need a few more days to track down the owners of the rest as the number plates have been changed, said Sen.        
	Police came to know about the gang following the arrest of Mohammad Shahbaz in Entally during Durga Puja.        
	He was allegedly caught red-handed while stealing a two-wheeler.        
	Shahbaz allegedly named the other members of the racket. Alamgir and Sabir were picked up from Bhangar in South 24-Parganas on Wednesday night. Shahjahan and Arup Das were picked up from Titagarh and Raju Mandal from Barrackpore.

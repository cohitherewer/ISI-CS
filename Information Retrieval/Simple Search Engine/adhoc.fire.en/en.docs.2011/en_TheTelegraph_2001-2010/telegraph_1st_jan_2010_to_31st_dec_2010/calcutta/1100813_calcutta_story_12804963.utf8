                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Local train coach derails
          OUR BUREAU                              
	A crowded compartment of a Majerhat-Namkhana local got derailed near Lake Gardens station on Friday morning.        
	No one was injured but railway officials said the derailment could have resulted in a disaster as the train was packed to capacity.        
	S. Chakraborty, a permanent way inspector who was in charge of the upkeep of the tracks, has been suspended.        
	The third coach from the rear jumped tracks around 9.52am, when the train was about to enter Lake Gardens station, on the Ballygunge-Budge Budge section of Eastern Railways Sealdah (South) division.        
	No one was injured in the incident. We are trying to find out why the train got derailed, Purusottam Guha, divisional railway manager, Sealdah, said after visiting the spot.        
	Residents said they had seen maintenance work being carried out on the tracks in the past few days.        
	We had seen some people working on the tracks, said Subir Mahato, who lives around 200 metres from the spot where the coach got derailed. Hundreds of passengers were jumping off the train in panic.        
	Services were disrupted after the incident. Shuttle trains were run between Tollygunge and Budge Budge, said an Eastern Railway official. Five pairs of Sealdah-Budge Budge locals had to be cancelled and two others were short-terminated.         
	Normal services resumed at 2.35pm.

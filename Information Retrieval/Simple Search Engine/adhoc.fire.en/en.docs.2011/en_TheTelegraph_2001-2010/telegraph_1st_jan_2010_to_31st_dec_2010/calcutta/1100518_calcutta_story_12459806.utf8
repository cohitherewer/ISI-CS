The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heat protest at Writers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Heat protest at Writers
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The deserted PWD office at Writers Buildings on Monday afternoon. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Hundreds of employees posted on the top floor of Writers Buildings demonstrated for over five hours on Monday demanding steps to lower the temperature in their offices.        
	Employees of the public works department who do not have air-conditioners in their offices started the demonstration in front of the chamber of the deputy secretary. Other employees on the top floor  the third floor  of the main building of Writers soon joined the protest.         
	The protesters dispersed after PWD minister Kshiti Goswami inspected their workplaces and promised to install air-conditioners for their benefit.         
	About 5,000 of the over 40,000 Writers employees have their offices on the top floor. Beside PWD, the other departments on the floor are information and culture, transport and prison.        
	The floor gets unusually hot since the heat radiates down from the roof. The balcony, too, receives direct sunlight and gets hot. Till today, no steps have been taken, said Shyamal Mitra, an employee of the PWD.        
	After the tour, the minister said a number of steps had been taken to lower the temperature on the top floor but to no avail. The exhaust fans that had initially been installed were replaced with coolers and then blowers.         
	Employees of the rank deputy secretary and above are entitled to air-conditioners. But sometimes we have to consider the situation. I would request finance minister Asim Dasgupta to sanction split air-conditioners. Fifteen such machines would do for now, said Goswami.

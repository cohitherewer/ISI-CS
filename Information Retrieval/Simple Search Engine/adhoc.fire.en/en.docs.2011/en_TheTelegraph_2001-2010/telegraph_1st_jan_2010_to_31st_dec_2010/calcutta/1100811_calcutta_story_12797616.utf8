	It was back to school for former Miss India and national swimming champion Nafisa Ali. As the chief guest at the inter-school aquatic meet of La Martiniere for Girls, held on July 31, the 53-year-old took a walk on the campus, looked back on her days as a former student and advised participants on improving their swimming skills.         
	Principal of the school, Hilda Peacock welcomed her home as Ali, who passed out in 1973, turned down the offer of a car and instead walked from the swimming pool in the boys campus to the girls campus.        
	The participating schools included Calcutta Girls High School, Modern High School for Girls, Calcutta International School, The Heritage School and Ashok Hall Girls Higher Secondary School.

	A non-competitive section saw special students from Mentaid and Manovikas Kendra swim backstroke and breaststroke with the help of students.        
	As she saw the girls dive into the pool, Ali recalled: As a student I would sit here and wonder when the chief guest would stop speaking and I could go home.         
	Ali, who gained recognition for her performance as the British girl Ruth in Shyam Benegals 1978 film Junoon, admitted that she was far from the ideal student.         
	I loved bunking classes and was sent to the principal almost every day. One of the teachers, Miss Chatterjee, would often ask us if we were up to something. We would reply, nothing. To which she would say, nothing comes from nothing. But the principal, Miss Subaya, was very nice to me, she recalled.         
	The competition was not without its high points. Students vied for the gold and silver medals in the freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly categories. There were a total of 14 categories.         
	The freestyle relay was the most popular, with the hosts outsmarting their peers . Some of the other winners in this category were Modern High, Calcutta Girls and Ashok Hall.        
	The breaststroke swimmers should correct their hand stroke, advised Ali while giving away the prizes to winners, adding that she would be happy to sponsor a Nafisa champion trophy.        
	I have been swimming from Class I and we were always reminded of swimmers like Nafisa Ali to draw inspiration from, said a senior member of the school team, Nikita Belani.

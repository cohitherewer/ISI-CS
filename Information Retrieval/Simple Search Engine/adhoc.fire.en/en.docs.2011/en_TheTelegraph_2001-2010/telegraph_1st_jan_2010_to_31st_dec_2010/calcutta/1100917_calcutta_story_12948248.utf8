The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | I was shaking and sobbing
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      I was shaking and sobbing
                                  A tiffin box at the accident spot (top); a boys shoe in the school bus. (Bishwarup Dutta)				                           
	The one thing that teenager Ayush Jain would like to forget in a hurry about Thursday afternoons school bus accident on the Rajarhat Expressway is what might have been. The Class IX student of Delhi Public School Megacity tells Metro how boarding the school bus wont be the same again for him and the 30 other students who were in the vehicle.              
	I was seated on the right towards the rear of the bus and looking out of the window when I felt our vehicle swerving, as if trying to avoid something that had suddenly come in the way. The next thing I knew, the bus had collided with a truck and veered sharply to the left and then right, throwing us off balance. I screamed and clung to my seat as the bus rammed into the divider and turned turtle. I went blank. I dont know whether I passed out but my next recollection is of lying on the roof of the bus and staring at the shattered rear windshield.        
	Someone pulled me out and by then I was crying, more out of shock than pain. I realised that I had suffered a cut above my upper lip and it was bleeding when someone asked me whether it was hurting. The one face that I remember  and will never forget  is this elderly gentleman who introduced himself as Pavan and offered me his cellphone so that I could call my parents.         
	When I heard my mothers voice, I couldnt utter a word for a few seconds. I was shaking and sobbing. I somehow managed to explain to her that I didnt suffer any serious injury. The gentleman then took the phone and told her that he would escort me home.... It was so kind of him, not only to comfort me but also take me home to my parents.        
	As we left the spot, I vaguely remember seeing some injured schoolmates being put on vehicles. They too must have found a helping hand.        
	On reaching home, my parents hugged me and kept asking if I had any injuries other than the gash above my lip. They took me to a doctor, who stitched the cut. The pain is bearable now but I cant help thinking: What if?                          As told to Jhinuk   Mazumdar

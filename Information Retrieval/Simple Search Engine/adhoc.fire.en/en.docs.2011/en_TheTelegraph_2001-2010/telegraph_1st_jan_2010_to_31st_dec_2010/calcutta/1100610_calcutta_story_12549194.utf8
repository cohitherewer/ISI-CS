	THE DIARY  
	State of Bengal  
	It rsquo;s red in its heart But green in its head, 
  Some on the right 
  And others misled. 
  We need to change, 
  It rsquo;s the hour to re-arrange. 
  The mother, the soil or the man, 
  Wherever the journey began, 
  Spoke in unanimity, 
  Against the vehemence, the toxicity. 
  Against those who plan the game, 
  The players who pass the blame. 
  What if it came back? 
  If they sanction the air attack? 
  I rsquo;m afraid, 
  But I rsquo;ll wait instead, 
  Since it rsquo;s red in my heart, 
  But green in my head.   
	Orchon Bhattacharya,
  CU  
	Circle of life  There are times
  When I feel 
  No one rsquo;s around, 
  There are times 
  When I feel 
  I am just a lost soul. 
  Apprehensions seem 
  To strike me with a bludgeon. 
  There are times 
  When everyone 
  Fails to understand me, 
  There are times 
  When loved ones 
  Hurt me. 
  Do they forget the 
  moments 
  They spent with me? 
  There are times 
  When life seems 
  apathetic, 
  When I am petrified, 
  But the circle of life Spirals endlessly.

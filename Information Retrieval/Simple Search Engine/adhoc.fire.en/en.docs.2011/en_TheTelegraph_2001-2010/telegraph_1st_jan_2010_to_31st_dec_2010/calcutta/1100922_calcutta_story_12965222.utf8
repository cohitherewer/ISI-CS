          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A man who allegedly promised a kidney to a woman suffering from renal failure and took Rs 25,000 from her was arrested at a Loudon Street nursing home on Tuesday on fraud charge.        
	Suman Chhetri, a 26-year-old woman from Dimapur in Nagaland, told police that Kaushik Pal had promised to arrange a kidney for her while she was being treated at a Bypass hospital a few months ago.        
	The Rs 25,000 she paid the Belghoria resident, Chhetri alleged, was an advance. Cops refused to specify the total amount Pal had asked for.        
	Kaushik never showed up after collecting the money. On Tuesday afternoon, the woman spotted him at the nursing home and called Shakespeare Sarani police station, said joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.        
	Pal, who runs a tea stall, had got in touch with Chhetri after she published a newspaper advertisement seeking a kidney.        
	Pal himself had sold one of his kidneys for Rs 60,000. He claims he has been in debt since his marriage in 2007, said an investigating officer. Its not clear why he had turned up at the Loudon Street nursing home.        
	Sleuths suspect Pal is part of the nation-wide kidney racket unearthed in February last year following the arrest of three men in the city.        
	The alleged kingpin of the racket, Manik Chowdhury, is still at large.

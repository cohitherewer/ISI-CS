                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Salt Lake civic panel debut
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The advisory committee of Bidhannagar Municipality met for the first time on Wednesday in the presence of the Trinamul Congress board.         
	Eighteen of the panels 25 members, including Trinamul leaders Partha Chatterjee and Sujit Bose, artist Shuvaprasanna, educationist Sunanda Sanyal, former bureaucrat Debabrata Bandopadhyay and retired IPS officers Sultan Singh and Rachpal Singh, attended the 90-minute meeting in the conference room of the municipality. Several Trinamul councillors were also present.        
	There were proposals to turn Indira Bhavan into a political museum, solve the water problem, simplify the tax structure, form a municipal force along with police, name township roads and provide round-the-clock ambulance and medical services to the aged, said Bandopadhyay, the chairman of the advisory committee.        
	The recommendations are not binding on the board. It is up to the chairperson to decide which of the recommendations to implement, said Chatterjee.         
	The Opposition leader in the municipality, Ila Nandi, said: The meeting was an all-Trinamul affair. Since they held the meeting in the municipality office, they should have invited councillors of other parties as well. Even the advisory committee is politically biased.         
	Chairperson Anita Mondal said it was an informal interaction.

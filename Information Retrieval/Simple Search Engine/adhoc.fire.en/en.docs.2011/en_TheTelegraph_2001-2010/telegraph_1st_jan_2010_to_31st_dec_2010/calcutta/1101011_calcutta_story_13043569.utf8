	Rishikesh Bose, a retired sub-inspector of police in his 80s, was shot at twice in his Sonarpur house on Sunday morning. Bose was admitted to Peerless Hospital with injuries in his left leg and forearm.        
	Preliminary probe suggests property related disputes led to the attack, said a police officer. Four men who had allegedly come to discuss rent had shot at him, said the cops.        
	Bose stays with his wife Kalyani, who was in the garden when he was attacked. My father told me that not a single neighbour had come to help. My mother informed our house physician who alerted the cops, said Boses son.        
	Arrested: Roshan Mallick, a 40-year-old Bagnan resident, was arrested on Sunday in connection with an explosion in a building at Howrahs Bankra that killed three men and injured six on October 7. Mallick, a mason, was the caretaker of the apartment where the blast occurred.  
	Woman dead: Subhadra Mondal, a 52-year-old homemaker, was found lying in a pool of blood in her JR Dhar Road house in Dum Dum on Saturday night. Local councillor Barun Natta said an LPG delivery man had spotted Mondal lying injured and raised an alarm. The homemaker was taken to Dum Dum Municipal Hospital, where she was declared brought dead. Police said Mondals husband Anukul, a retired government employee, was in Krishnagar at the time of the incident.  
	Injured: Four persons travelling in an autorickshaw were injured when it fell into a canal after hitting another auto on the Shyampukur-Bagnan Road in Howrah on Sunday. The injured have been admitted to Bagnan Hospital. Both drivers managed to flee.

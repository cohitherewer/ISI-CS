The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll pause on ready Madhyamik results
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Poll pause on ready Madhyamik results

	The municipal elections may have pushed back the Madhyamik results by some weeks with the Left Front wary of a pass percentage plunge or any such negative trend reducing its chances of passing the May 30 poll test.        
	Sources said the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education had suggested two dates  May 19 and 21  in a letter to the government on May 10 but was yet to receive a response.         
	Board secretary Partha Roy confirmed on Thursday that the results were ready but wouldnt say whether the government had informally communicated its decision to delay announcing them. We will be declaring the date of announcing the results very soon, he said.        
	According to board officials, it would be impossible to declare the results before May 30 if the government did not give the green signal latest by Friday the 21st.        
	An official who didnt wish to be named said the governments preferred date would certainly be a post-poll day.        
	Its been 10 days since we wrote to the government but there has been no word from Writers Buildings. The government is usually prompt in giving permission to declare the results of examinations like Madhyamik, he said.        
	But what could be the link between Madhyamik results and municipal polls?         
	Madhyamik is a big exam and even a small mistake or downward trend in the results could be used by the Opposition to create a controversy designed to affect the ruling partys poll prospects. With elections barely 10 days away, the government would rather wait than take a chance, said a senior official at Writers.        
	In Bengal, it is mandatory for the board to take the governments permission before announcing the date when Madhyamik results would be declared.        
	The usual practice is to declare the results at least three days after getting the governments permission. A minimum of three days is required to send the marksheets to the 9,000-odd Madhyamik schools across the state. This time, scores of schools will be taken over by the election department from May 26. So that almost rules out declaring the results before the elections, a source said.        
	For the nearly 9.5 lakh students who wrote Madhyamik this year  a record  that means waiting at least two extra weeks to know how they fared in the first big exam of their lives.        
	The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education has already decided to announce the HS results in the first week of June. In 2009, HS results were declared on May 29 and those for Madhyamik the previous day.

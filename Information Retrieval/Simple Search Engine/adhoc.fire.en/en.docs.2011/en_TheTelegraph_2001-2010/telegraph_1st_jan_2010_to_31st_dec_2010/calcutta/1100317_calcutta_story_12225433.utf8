	Whistle-stop tolerance tour for youth        
	Phurbu Tso left Tibet nine years ago at age 11. The Class XII student now lives in the Tibetan SOS Village in Dharamsala. We could not talk about our culture in Tibet, she recalls. I am free here, says the 16-year-old, who wants to specialise in a foreign language.

	For Kiran Subba of Sikkim, the cherished moment was his Metro Railway ride. How can a train travel underground? he asked his teacher repeatedly.         
	Phurbu and Kiran were among 350 underprivileged children from 15 states hosted by The Heritage School on January 24, as part of a four-day National Youth Festival. Rock-climbing, rifle-shooting, archery and clay-modelling were some of the treats the hosts had in store for them.         
	The festival coincided with a three-day international conclave, starting on January 23, on the position of the poor in society. We discussed the allocation of aid and its accessibility to the poor, said Shourabh Mukerji, president, Young Mens Welfare Society, which hosted both the conclave and the festival.        
	A photo exhibition on life in disturbed parts of the world was inaugurated on January 24 at the Indian Council for Cultural Relations art gallery as a part of the festival. Called Spirit of Peace, it had 45 photographs by 11 photographers from countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Palestine, Israel and India. Pictures like a child playing the tabla, children playing in Afghanistan and a group of youngsters in Italy displaying hands painted white were examples of the spirit of survival in troubled lands.        
	It was a whistle-stop tour to the city for the visitors, with stops at the MP Birla Planetarium and Nicco Park on January 23 and on Red Road for the Republic Day parade on January 26. Said Phurbu: I loved the architecture of Victoria Memorial. Its grandeur is unlike anything I have seen.        
	The festival promotes tolerance, showing the way to the young to break away from cultural and religious inhibitions, said Mukerji.

	As part of South Point High Schools ongoing effort towards rehabilitation of Aila victims in the Sunderbans, a group of 35, including students and teachers, handed over 50 semi-permanent dwellings to families on Satjelia island in Gosaba, in December.        
	More than 100 residents of Lahiripur and Satjelia panchayat were present at the handing-over ceremony. The houses are in the distinctive blue and gold colours of South Point.

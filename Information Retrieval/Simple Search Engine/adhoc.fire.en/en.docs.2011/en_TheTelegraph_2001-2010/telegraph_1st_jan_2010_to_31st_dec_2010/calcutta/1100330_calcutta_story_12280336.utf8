The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CBSE students in a school-switch spot
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CBSE students in a school-switch spot
          MITA MUKHERJEE                                                  
	Students writing the CBSE Class X test and planning to switch schools for plus-II are clueless about the admission criteria in the grades-only system that came into effect this year, their confusion made worse by the absence of a directive from the Delhi-based board.        
	The schools, too, are in a fix, each deciding its own rules to admit students to Class XI. The CBSE Class X exams will continue till March 31 and the results are expected to be announced in end-May.        
	Till 2009, the CBSE schools would go by marks to prepare a shortlist of candidates from other institutions applying for admission to Class XI. But this year the board decided to scrap marks and award only grades to Class X examinees.        
	A CBSE source said from Delhi that schools from this year were expected to admit students on the basis of their grades, though private institutions had been given some freedom to fix their criteria according to their needs.        
	But students, parents and teachers of CBSE schools dubbed the boards advice impractical, pointing out that grades could not be the basis of admission as they indicated a wide range of marks. The problem would be acute in reputable institutions where applicants often failed to make the cut for barely one or two marks, said a teacher.        
	The board has made a good move by scrapping marks but should have followed it up by issuing a clear directive on the Class XI admission criteria. That would have helped students who want to switch schools after Class X, said a student of a prominent CBSE school in south Calcutta.        
	Thanks to a lack of directive from the board, some schools want to conduct tests for students applying for admission to Class XI, some want to screen candidates on the basis of their performance in their pre-board exams, while a few have decided to hold interviews.        
	Twenty per cent of our seats have been earmarked for students from other schools. We will select the students for arts and commerce on the basis of their performance in pre-board exams but those applying for the science stream will have to sit for a test, said Mukta Nain, the principal of Birla High School for Boys.        
	Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, said: Initial screening will be done on the basis of the students scores in pre-board exams. The shortlisted students will have to then appear in an interview. Apeejay School will conduct tests for students applying for admission in all three streams.        
	The absence of a uniform admission procedure has hit hard Kasba resident Banani Ghosh, whose son is writing the CBSE Class X test from an Andhra Pradesh school but wants to switch to a Calcutta institution for Plus-II.        
	I started collecting information about the new admission rules in November but still dont have any clear idea on how to guide my son, said Ghosh.

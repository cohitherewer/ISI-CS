                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blaze blocks SSKM surgery 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The partially damaged operating theatre at SSKM on Wednesday. (Rith Basu)                                  
	A fire in an SSKM operating theatre minutes before a patient was to be wheeled in for surgery on Wednesday morning brought the poor maintenance of infrastructure at Bengals lone state-run referral hospital into sharp focus.        
	Eight nurses were preparing for the mornings first surgery in the operating theatre of the gynaecology and obstetrics department when the wooden false ceiling caught fire  apparently because of a short circuit  around 9.10am.        
	As the nurses rushed out of the room screaming for help, the 50-odd patients in the gynaecology ward across the corridor panicked. Fortunately, hospital staff on duty in the ward calmed them down, preventing a possible stampede.        
	Two fire-tenders doused the flames before it could spread to the half-a-dozen oxygen cylinders in the operating theatre. Power supply to the building was also immediately disconnected.         
	Emergency surgeries slated for Wednesday were conducted in other operating theatres at SSKM but 12 other planned surgical procedures in the department were postponed. Some patients were referred to other government hospitals in the city.        
	We had a close shave today, said a professor of orthopaedics. It is a miracle that there isnt a fire at SSKM every day given the zero maintenance of our facilities. I wonder how the old elevators are still functioning, he added.        
	Pallav Khan, the PWD assistant engineer in charge of power supply to SSKM, owned moral responsibility for the unfortunate incident but blamed lack of manpower for poor maintenance.        
	T.K. Ghosh, the head of the department of gynaecology and obstetrics, lauded his staff for showing courage under fire. I am proud of the way my staff acted. They did not run away but tried their best to douse the flames before the firemen arrived, he said.         
	The operating theatre will be double-fogged to sterilise the equipment and surroundings after the civil wing of the PWD completes the repairs. We will hopefully reopen in two days, said Ghosh.

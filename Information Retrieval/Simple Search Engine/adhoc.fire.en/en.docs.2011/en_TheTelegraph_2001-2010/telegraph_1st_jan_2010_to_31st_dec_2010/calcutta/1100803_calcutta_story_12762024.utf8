          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two bombs hidden under heaps of sand exploded in two crowded parts of Barasat on Monday morning, injuring five people.         
	Police said the first bomb went off in Purvachal at 9am when homemaker Shyamali Saha, 28, was travelling with her daughter and nephew in a rickshaw van. The trio and the van driver suffered shrapnel wounds and were taken to Barasat District Hospital, where they were treated and discharged.         
	An officer said the blast occurred when the vans wheel ran over a crude bomb stuffed with stone chips.         
	The second blast took place at 11.30am at Champadali. Construction worker Saiful Sahazi, 18, was loading sand in a basket when his spade hit a crude bomb and it exploded, the officer said. Saiful received a deep gash in his palm.

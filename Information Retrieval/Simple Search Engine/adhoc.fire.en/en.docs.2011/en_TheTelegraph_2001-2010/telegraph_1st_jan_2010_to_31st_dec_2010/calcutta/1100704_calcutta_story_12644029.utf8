The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Spouse grouse
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Spouse grouse
          Top twelve reasons why a partner causes more stress than the boss                      THE LOCKHORNS: A still from Kramer vs Kramer, which portrays the breakdown of a marriage                    
	There may be no other place like home, but office may just be better. A recent survey claims that spouses at home cause more stress than the boss. The study, conducted on 3,000 people in the UK, claims that 58 per cent said that their partner caused them the most stress, while 43 per cent said the same of their bosses. The survey adds that men are worse for the blood pressure for their spouses than women, at the ratio of 18:12.         
	All this may be strategy for making people spend more time at the workplace, but on the face of it, what is true of Britain seems to be true of Calcutta. Spouses and long-time partners cause great stress to each other. Metro finds out a dozen reasons         
	 Stress erupts on Sundays. Couples living apart from their parents may have created their own space, but who lives in that space? Not they; on weekdays they are working and Sundays are dedicated to visiting parents.        
	Whose parents are dearer? A city couple says the issue divides them. The husband has threatened to end the marriage if he has to eat the polao-mangsho lunch cooked by his mother-in-law another Sunday.         
	Rubina and Vivek Sinha (names changed) are a working couple. Every Sunday, the only day we are off from work, Vivek insists we spend time with his parents. Ideally I would want some us-time. Now that he wants to visit his parents, I too go and visit mine. In the end, we spend most of our Sundays separately and return home totally frustrated with each other, says Rubina.         
	Monday stares ahead. When does one visit City Centre?               
	 But City Centre can lead to trouble. A woman says that she always goes out shopping alone, even though that is something she wanted to do with her husband.        
	I go into the shop and linger. He starts to frown. He goes out. When he finds it unbearable, he comes in again and asks if I am not buying, why am I going through so much stuff? Its embarrassing. I explode. The rest of the evening he spends watching football and she feels like smashing the TV screen in.               
	 These are lifestyle issues. Stress can boil over the making of dal. It can stir up fundamentals.        
	A young woman says thin dal always leads to the following conversation. It is a long conversation.         
	Is this dal? he asks.        
	What else do you think it is? she asks.        
	Well, I thought it to be some unnameable liquid passed through the rear part of an equine creature, he says.        
	In our family, the dal was always thick, he adds.        
	In our family, we always had the dal thin, she says.        
	What makes you think your familys way is the right way? he asks.        
	What makes you think your familys way is the right way? she repeats.         
	She thinks they would not have fought over dal if they spent more time with each other. Then she would have made him go to the bazaar.        
	I have made it quite clear to my husband that if the maid is not around he has to shop for vegetables. All boring housework should not come to me, says Shibani Sengupta, a gynaecologist.               
	 Long-distance marriages, often conducted through Skype, email and phone calls, are a problem.        
	Email is not the same as talking. If I am very enthusiastic about something, and he just replies ok, I feel let down. Then there is a flurry of emails in which I complain about his tone and he tries to explain that he was not being curt. But an email is really toneless, says Sanjukta Mukherjee, a media employee, whose husband lives abroad.         
	Unsolved disputes and long-distance misunderstandings take a toll on marriages, quot; says psychiatrist Sanjay Sen.                
	 Who drops the child to school? Which high school will he go to?        
	Since my daughter started going to a nursery my husband and I have been having fights over which school to send her to, says Madhushree Chatterjee, a mother of two.         
	Who calls the AC repairman? The electrician? The plumber? The computer mechanic? The cooking gas service? And who follows them around when the men are in? Faultlines.               
	 Psychiatrists point out more faultlines. Why does he have to go on blowing up the balloons for their daughters birthday long after she has finished wrapping up the return gifts?               
	 Why cant she drive back after party?               
	 Why did he not put up the commode rim, again? Why does he need so many pillows?                 
	 Why did she get a better raise? A successful wife often leads to bitter clashes in a marriage, says advocate and NGO counsel Amalesh Kanti Ghosal.        
	 Why does he snore?               
	 Why does she always have to have the last word?               
	 Anything, actually, can cause stress in a marriage. A Calcuttan confesses to his marriage breaking over the way he used to keep his umbrella. His wife had fixed a place for the umbrella to hang if it was wet, as she had a fixed place for everything, but the husband would always forget the rules and drop things wherever he could. He would just throw the dripping umbrella on the floor.         
	One day, the wife confronted him. Dont you have any faith in order? she asked.        
	The old order changeth yielding place to new, he said.        
	She thought he was calling her order, and old too, and new meant another woman. If you want change, you will get change, and freedom from order, she said and walked out, leaving him and his umbrella, which hid larger issues, he feels.         
	As the survey suggests, the trick is to remain married to your job. You dont even have to clean the toilets.

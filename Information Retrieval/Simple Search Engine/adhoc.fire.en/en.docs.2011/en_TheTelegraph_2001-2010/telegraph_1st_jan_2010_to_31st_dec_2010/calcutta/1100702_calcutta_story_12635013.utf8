The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mortuary move
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mortuary move
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government has vowed to provide funds to set up mortuaries if land is made available.        
	Minority affairs minister Abdur Sattar made the promise in the Assembly on Thursday after Barry O Brien, a nominated MLA, highlighted the lack of mortuaries in the city and the rest of the state.        
	The city has only two mortuaries, both of which are in a sorry state because of lack of funds and upkeep, said O Brien, also a member of the state minorities commission.        
	The MLA suggested that Christian cemeteries in the state donate small plots where mortuaries could be set up with financial help from the government.        
	Responding to O Briens suggestion, minister Sattar said the funds would be provided to build mortuaries if land was made available. Sattar asked the MLA to submit a proposal in this regard.        
	O Brien later told Metro that he had raised the issue in the House following requests from several people who want a decent mortuary in the city.         
	Found dead: A 50-year-old man was found dead on the rear seat of a Tata Indica in Mahesh Chowdhury Lane, near Jagubabus Bazar, around 9.20am on Thursday. Police said Suresh Jana, from Darbhanga in Bihar, was the driver of the car.

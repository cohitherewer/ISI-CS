The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bangla author hits visa wall
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bangla author hits visa wall
          POULOMI BANERJEE                              
	Bangladeshi author Rizia Rahman was born in Calcutta in 1939. Seventy years later, she will not be able to attend the launch of a book that includes her writings, in the city of her birth, because the Indian high commission in Dhaka has failed to issue her a visa in time.        
	My son has, for the past two weeks, been trying to impress upon the authorities that unless my visa interview is brought forward from February 2, I will miss the book launch on January 31. But to no avail, Rahman told Metro on Friday, over phone from Dhaka.        
	Speaking for Myself  An Anthology of Asian Womens Writing is being launched in the city on Sunday by the Prabha Khaitan Foundation and India International Centre, New Delhi.        
	Bengal and Bangladesh share a special relation in the cultural field. That no author from Bangladesh will be able to make it for such an event is really sad, said Sundeep Bhutoria of the foundation.        
	Rahman is heartbroken. I have been to so many cities, but Calcutta holds a special place in my heart. I am old and I was so looking forward to this trip...        
	The septuagenarians predicament is even more ironical as Irinas Picture, the story by Rahman included in the book, was translated by Radha Chakravarty, the wife of the former Indian high commissioner in Dhaka, Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty.        
	Her son, Abdur Rahman, is furious at the turn of events. I thought the relationship between our two countries were improving, but I saw no reflection of that in the attitude at the high commission, he told Metro.

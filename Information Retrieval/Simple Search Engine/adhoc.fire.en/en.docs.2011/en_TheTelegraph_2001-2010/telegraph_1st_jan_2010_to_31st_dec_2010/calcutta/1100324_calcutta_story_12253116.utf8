                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Heroes who defied blaze and gravity
          OUR BUREAU                        Pervez Akhtar during his rescue effort. (Amit Datta)                                 
	Pervez Akhtar, a driver working for a hotel on Mirza Galib Street, had rushed to Park Street on hearing about the fire.        
	A lot of people were trying to jump as the building was engulfed in flames. I immediately started climbing up the stairs and managed to reach the second floor, Pervez recalled.        
	The Ekbalpore Road residents helped at least 10 people escape through windows but himself suffered back injury and asphyxiation. His lungs might have been damaged. Well know for sure after two-three days, said a doctor at the Mission of Mercy Hospital, where Pervez is being treated at the ICU.        
	Raj Mullick was eating lunch at his home on a Royd Street pavement around 2.25pm when he heard the siren of fire tenders close by. Minutes later he learnt about the Stephen Court blaze.        
	The 24-year-old contract labourer rushed to the site in a red vest and shorts, little knowing that a couple of hours later he would be hailed a hero for having saved three lives from the inferno.        
	When I reached in front of the building, I saw people screaming their lungs out for help from the upper floors, recalled Raj. There was no time to think. I immediately started climbing up a sewerage pipe of the building.        
	Witnesses said Raj  helped by Shams Tavrez and Mohammed Dilshad  had saved at least three lives before the firemen could start their rescue operation.        
	Some in the crowd on the road were reminded of a monkey and a few of Spiderman as Raj scaled the structure and hopped from one window to another, looking out for trapped victims.        
	I could not believe what I saw. Like a seasoned athlete he was climbing up the building, holding on to a pipe. We were cheering and clapping him every time he could reach near a victim, said Richa Banki, who was watching the rescue operation. The diminutive youth later said dense smoke was preventing him from staying put at a place for more than a few minutes.        
	Wasnt he scared of what he was doing?        
	Fear struck me only once when I spotted the television cameras. My mother would surely see me on TV and scold me for risking my life. But I think she will relent after learning of the number of lives her son had saved during the day, smiled Raj.        
	Jinia Dasgupta and husband Kunal had stepped out of their sixth-floor flat in Stephen Court before the fire. My ailing mother-in-law was alone inside. My husband rushed upstairs but he called me saying he could not bring out my mother-in-law as the flat was filled with smoke, recalled Jinia.        
	With no one around to help her, the homemaker and three local youths made their way through the choking fume and brought down Kunal and his mother.        
	Jagannath Prasad ran out of his shop on the Park Street pavement hearing peoples cries for help. With a few others I arranged for a ladder from our servants quarter and climbed up to the Peter Cat terrace. We rescued a few people who had already got down to the terrace with the help of a rope, recalled the 59-year-old.        
	A canteen worker in the adjacent YWCA building was also in the thick of the rescue operation.         
	I alerted the hostel authorities and then ran to the fire site, said Haripada Bhuniya. He climbed up a pipe and held a ladder on the first-floor cornice for cops and firemen to bring down a trapped woman.        
	I also guided the firemen through an easier passage in the building from where they could fight the blaze better, said Bhuniya.

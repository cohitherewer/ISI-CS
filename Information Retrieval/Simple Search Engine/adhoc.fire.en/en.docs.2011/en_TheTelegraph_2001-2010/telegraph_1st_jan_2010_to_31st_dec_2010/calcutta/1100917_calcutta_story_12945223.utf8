                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Quick quiz in city comeback
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Barry O rsquo;Brien                          
	Get set for a battle of brains this weekend as one of the quizzes that had put Calcutta on the Q amp;A map makes a comeback after six years.        
	NSHM Corporate Quiz 2010 amp; Fastest Finger First are being organised by Advertising Club, Calcutta, in association with The Telegraph.        
	The prelims and finals of the corporate quiz will be held at The Chrome Hotel on Saturday.        
	The quiz used to be one of most sought-after in Calcutta. We want to bring back its glory days. The quiz is a great engagement with marketing media and we want to build on that, said Kanchan Datta, the secretary of Advertising Club, Calcutta.        
	Quizmaster Barry OBrien promises an eclectic mix of questions. It will be a combination of traditional quizzing with out-of-the-box thinking and never-seen-before masala.        
	Two-member teams from corporate houses are eligible to participate in the first quiz. Six teams will make it to the finals, which will comprise 10 rounds of questions with a dose of novelty.        
	At the end of each round, teams will face two googlies called bumper buzzer questions.        
	Each round will have a winner. A team might win a couple of rounds but not the entire quiz, said Datta.        
	The rounds will be theme-based  travel, food and drink, current affairs, Calcutta and others.        
	The highlight will be The Telegraph Unputdownable round, which would be a tribute to excellence.         
	Fastest Finger First, an open quiz for individuals from all walks of life, will be the other battle of wits on show. Anybody above Class XI is eligible to vie for the quiz crown.        
	The prelims for Fastest Finger First would be held at Rotary Sadan from 6pm on Friday. It would comprise 50 questions, from movies to mythology, cricket to computers. The six highest scorers will qualify for Saturdays finals.        
	More than 10 companies and over 70 individuals have already registered.        
	Quizzers feel that Fastest Fingers First would go a long way in reviving open quizzing in Calcutta.         
	Its a good initiative and the Advertising Club is doing its best to revive the glory days of Calcutta quizzing, said OBrien. For me the ideal finalists would be from different walks of life. For example, a doctor, a teacher, a school student, a police officer, a bureaucrat and a corporate executive might fight it out for the crown of the best quizzer.        
	The finals would be rounded off by a classical jazz and flamenco performance by Ronnie and Mitul.

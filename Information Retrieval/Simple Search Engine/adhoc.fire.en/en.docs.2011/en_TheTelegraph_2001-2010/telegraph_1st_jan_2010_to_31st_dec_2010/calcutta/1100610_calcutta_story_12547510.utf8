          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 25-year-old driver in a Howrah car rental agency who went missing after leaving for a trip on April 21 was murdered and dumped beside a road in Jharkhand the day after.        
	According to family members, Abhijit Das left for Asansol on the afternoon of April 21. He was to pick up those who had hired the car he was driving near Santragachhi station. Around 2.15am, he had called his mother and said something was going wrong. The call got disconnected and his phone was switched off after that.        
	After making the rounds of Shibpur police station for a week from April 24, Abhijits parents, residents of Rammohan Mukherjee Lane in Howrah, had managed to lodge a missing diary. The owner of the car-rental agency had by then filed a complaint accusing Abhijit of stealing the car he was driving.         
	On Tuesday, Abhijits parents learnt that Jharkhand police had cremated their son three days after his body was found in a roadside bush in Tiliaya with his limbs tied.         
	On Tuesday, a sub-inspector of the police station took Abhijits father Khagendranath to Jharkhand. Officers of Tiliaya police station told me that my sons body was found and cremated as unclaimed. I identified him from photographs of the body, he said.

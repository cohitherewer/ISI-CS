The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police prod for revelry curfew
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Police prod for revelry curfew
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The police headquarters prodded the excise department into curtailing the weekend night-out by two hours after a survey revealed a surge in drunken brawls and drink driving late in the night, sources told Metro.        
	Nightclubs at star hotels that would earlier stay open till 4am are now shut by 2am with the excise department setting a new deadline for the last drink.        
	Standalone nightclubs have also stopped serving liquor and playing music beyond 1.45am lest the party police come calling.        
	A senior officer at Lalbazar confirmed to Metro that the nightclub curfew was a police initiative implemented by the excise department rather than the other way around. Based on our survey of untoward incidents at night, we had advised the government to propose a two-hour cut in weekend party timings. It was taken up with the excise department, which agreed to the proposal, the officer added.        
	Two youths were shot at in front of a dhaba on Ballygunge Circular Road early on March 21 following a brawl in a Hazra lounge bar.         
	Policemen said instances of young partygoers landing in trouble after one drink too many were common. An officer at Park Street police station said he recently found an intoxicated young woman in party attire sitting on the pavement alone. Her friends had left for home but she didnt find a taxi. She barely managed to give us her parents phone number, he added.        
	According to the police brass, even the curtailed weekend party timings are more liberal than those in other cities.         
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), hoped that the new rules would help curb crime. If people drink till morning without creating a law and order problem, we would have nothing to say. But a section of partygoers creates problems after stepping out of nightclubs, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ground reality from the gallery
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                        We Ask You Answer      Ground reality from the gallery
					      Todays question: What facilities do you want to see at the renovated Eden Gardens?                                          
	Abhirup Bhunia, 
  Bansdroni									      
	 The Eden Gardens, the biggest cricket stadium in India, is surely not the best when it comes to facilities. The revamped Eden Gardens should have proper lights to prevent a repeat of the blackout episode. A better press box, a swimming pool, an improved commentary box, well-equipped practice grounds and digital displays and comfortable seats are much desired.              
	Kaushik Guha, 
  Address not mentioned									      
	 The renovated Eden Gardens should have distinctly numbered seats and the ground should be properly visible from all sides. The stadium should have adequate drinking water arrangement and hygienic food court in all the blocks. The electronic scoreboard should function properly.              
	Utpal Banerjee,
  Kalyani									      
	 All seats should have a clear view of the ground. The seats that we were allotted in B block meant for life members for the Test match versus Pakistan in December 2007 had huge pillars in front of us which partially guarded our view of the leg side. In a packed ground, it is impossible to shift seats.

										 The Eden Gardens attracts international attention. So the authorities should be careful about its upkeep. I want the seats to be more comfortable. The lower-priced ones are not so at all. Also Id like the stadium to have a proper food court. Someone who has gone there to watch a days cricket can hardly survive on potato chips. But the spectators should be made to finish eating before entering the gallery as unruly spectators may throw food at the grounds or litter the gallery.									          
	Prithwijit Dutta,

	 The height of the stands should be lowered. There is no need to turn the stadium into a sauna. Spectators need to have a hawks vision to follow whats going on from that great height. The space between the seats should be increased. The number of seats should be lowered too. The fewer experts, the better. The fence-like structure around the enclosure on the boundary should be done away with. It obstructs the view at the ground level. Proper drinking water should be supplied.              
	Hrishikesh Nath,
  Garia									      
	 I feel that there should be better policing in the stands as much of the IPL crowd is not aware of spectator ethics at cricket matches. They stand up in the middle of the over blocking the view of those behind them. Many of them turn a deaf ear to requests. Better policing will also ensure that the plastic seats coming up will not be damaged by the over-enthusiastic.

	 I would like to see another giant screen at the Eden Gardens as the spectators just under the lone giant scoreboard that we now have cannot watch the replays. I dont know how many grounds in the world have two screens but still we should go for it because few grounds host as many people as Eden does.              
										Shiladitya Banerjee, 
  VIP Road  
	 What I do not want is a controversy, like the recent one regarding the IPL club lounge, after the renovation work.           
	Krishna Banerjee,
  Jodhpur Park									      
	 The last five times I have been to the Eden clubhouse over a span of a year and half, I have been struck by the condition of the womens toilet for spectators entering through Gate 1. The only chamber with a commode has a broken latch. No one bothers to repair something so basic in an area where VIPs sit. I wonder how things are in the galleries.              
	Smita Basu,
  Tollygunge									      
	 At the last Test versus South Africa here, there was a packed Eden waiting for the presentation ceremony. But the crowd could not hear a word of what was being said. Either the presenters mike was not properly connected to the public address system, or worse, no one cares for cricket lovers sentiments any more as long as the mullah is smoothly raked in. I would expect CAB to show its patrons a little more respect.

				 According to International Cricket Council rules, there has to be about 12 inches of leg space in between chairs in the galleries. Concrete slabs are not permissible as seats. So chairs have to be placed. The dressing room has to be bigger with more facilities for players, like sauna bath. The electronic scoreboard will be bigger. A swimming pool will be built inside the stadium complex. Of course, this will bring down the capacity of Eden Gardens by about 15,000 from what I hear. But we would have a better stadium to host the World Cup.

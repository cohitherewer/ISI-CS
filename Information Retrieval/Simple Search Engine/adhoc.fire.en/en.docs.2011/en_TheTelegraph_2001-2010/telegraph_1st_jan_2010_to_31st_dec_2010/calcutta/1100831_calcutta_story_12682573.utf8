The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Helpline for elders rings louder
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Helpline for elders rings louder
          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                          Milan Prabha Chakraborty, 79, took the stage with an impromptu recital at a cultural programme organised by Pronam members at the Bodyguard Lines auditorium of Calcutta police on August 8                                        
	Pronam, the 24-hour helpline for senior citizens who stay alone, is now reaching out to all senior citizens in town.        
	Set up by The Bengal and Calcutta police in June 2009, the Pronam helpline has already drawn 1,681 members.         
	We receive many calls from senior citizens who dont stay alone but ask if they can enrol. So we have extended membership of Pronam to all senior citizens who are 60 years of age and above, said Sundeep Bhutoria, secretary general of The Bengal.        
	As a result, the numbers have jumped by a few hundreds, said Banibrata Basu, the special commissioner of police. We thought why not extend the facility since we have already invested both funds and effort. Theoretically, these senior citizens dont live alone but because their children dont have time for them, we decided to include them, too, added Basu.        
	The calls are currently handled by the Pronam office at Ballygunge police station. A special cell at each police station has also been set up recently. All 48 police stations have a dedicated officer of the rank of assistant sub-inspector whose duty is just to attend to these calls. It could be a health distress call or a simple thing like submitting the electricity bill because some of the callers are so old that they cannot move out of their homes alone, explained Basu.        
	Pronam records reveal that regular complaints by the elderly range from being harassed by helpers (maid servants) of the house to being disturbed by a building being constructed next door.        
	Im glad that the helpline has been extended to those who dont stay alone because the needs of all senior citizens are the same. Loneliness is the biggest problem faced by them. You can feel lonely even if youre part of a family, pointed out Nabaneeta Dev Sen, the working president of Pronam.        
	In March, Manoranjan and Sikha Sarkar, aged 64 and 56, lost the will to live. Drowned in loneliness after their only son took up a job in Bangalore, the couple in Patuli attempted suicide.        
	The older you get, the more isolated you get. Solitude, helplessness (physical and mental), health and security are the other areas of concern. It is reassuring to know that here is one number you can dial which will not go unanswered, added Dev Sen.        
	Amongst the measures taken to address these issues are counselling, organising adda sessions and outings like picnics. Members can avail of discounts on medicines and medical tests.        
	The most common problem they face is loneliness. The smaller problems are telephones that have been out of order for a few days, no gas supply, payment of tax and electricity bills. Even things like booking a taxi to take them to Howrah station. We help them as much as we can, said Shukla Taraphder, the administrator of Pronam.        
	For membership, senior citizens can contact the local police station or the Pronam control room (24190740).        
	But this does not extend to senior citizens in Salt Lake, Howrah and other districts of Bengal beyond the jurisdiction of Calcutta police.

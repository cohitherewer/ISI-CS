The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire brigade in a big fix
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fire brigade in a big fix
  - 250 complaints since Stephen Court, inspectors too few          SUBHAJOY ROY                          Stephen Court on the day of the fire                                         
	A deluge of Stephen Court-sparked complaints about highrise tinderboxes across town has left the fire services headquarters on Free School Street staring at an HR crisis.        
	A senior official said the department was pleasantly surprised to receive over 250 complaints in the first two weeks since the March 23 fire tragedy  not more than 30-odd complaints are normally filed in a month  but couldnt address these immediately because of a shortage of inspectors.        
	Most of the complaints are about the lack of basic fire-safety measures in residential and commercial buildings in the city. The volume of complaints is a welcome change but we cant address them all with just seven inspectors, deputy director (fire prevention) Dipak Sarkar told Metro, which has been running a campaign for greater fire-safety awareness.        
	Officials at the Free School Street headquarters said they would take several months, if not a year and more, to clear the growing backlog of complaints with the existing staff strength.        
	The fire-prevention wing has written to the authorities, asking for five additional inspectors to cope with the spurt of complaints.         
	Then we can form two to three more small teams with each assessing four buildings a day, said Sarkar.         
	The principal secretary of fire services, P.S. Kathiresan, said the manpower shortage would be addressed soon. We will fill up the vacancies if there are any.         
	A fire inspector assesses the safety level of a building and makes recommendations, based on which the department is supposed to slap a notice on the owner.        
	A follow-up inspection is to be conducted after some time to confirm whether the owner has carried out the recommended corrective measures.        
	If the owner does not comply with the suggestions, we are required to initiate legal action, an official said.         
	The common violations in a city where no one seemed to be bothered about living and working in tinderboxes are lack of emergency exits in highrises, narrow staircases and the absence of fire-fighting equipment.        
	According to Sarkar, fire-safety equipment does not mean only sandbags and extinguishers. Highrises must also have sprinklers and certain other measures in place.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tendulkar turns the tide
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tendulkar turns the tide
  - Sachins super knock gets Calcutta talking about cricket... again          RITH BASU                          MAKE IT DOUBLE: Sachin Tendulkars epic knock has revived interest in Team India                                        
	Trust Sachin Tendulkar to do it. Again.        
	Just when you thought that Calcutta would stay a football city, with flags of Argentina and Brazil decorating the para skyline three weeks after Spain won the World Cup, cricket is back with a double bang  all thanks to Sachin Tendulkar.        
	Clinical researcher Abhijit Mukherjee and his club mates at the Kalighat Halderpara Subhash Sangha had been missing the soccer matches so much that they would relive the Cup and the camaraderie by watching repeat telecasts in their club room. Till Sachin stroked a double.        
	The drubbing India got in the first Test did nothing to bring us back to cricket but then came this splendid innings (Tendulkars 203 in Colombo). It reminded me of so many proud moments the man has gifted us, said Mukherjee, 40.        
	We shout ourselves hoarse cheering Brazil and Argentina during the World Cup but its a different feeling when you are supporting your country and a sportsman as special as Sachin, added the man whose ringtone remains Waka Waka.                  
	If Mukherjee speaks of the intangible thrill of a Sachin special, for Sheikh Azad the gains from Tendulkars ton are tangible. The jersey and flag-seller at Maidan Market who suffered a slump with the early exit of Messi and Kaka, is pinning his hopes on the 37-year-old cricket hero to revive interest in the sport and with it the sale of Team India jerseys.        
	Our sales took a beating after Brazil and Argentina were knocked out with a few para clubs picking up Spain, Germany and Holland jerseys, said Azad.        
	But I saw the crowds in front of shop windows with television screens during Sachins innings on Thursday and realised this was the turning point, he smiled.        
	The Maidan Market racks expect Sachin Tendulkar T-shirts to be the pop pick again and drive the demand for other cricket stars too.        
	With the World Cup being played here next year, we are hoping for huge sales. We have already placed orders for Team India jerseys with Sachin, (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni, Yuvraj (Singh) and (Gautam) Gambhir. Its vital for us that Calcuttans retain interest in cricket and the stars, summed up Azad.        
	Over 516 match-saving minutes of gruelling Test match cricket, during which he faced 347 deliveries, Sachin ensured just that  remind Calcutta how much it loves cricket and its little big man.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hurt girls advised rest 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The five Class XI girls who were hit by a battery-operated bus during an educational trip to the Shibpur botanical garden on Monday have been advised at least two weeks rest by doctors.        
	Chandrani Das, who needed four stitches on her hip, said on Tuesday that she was still in pain. Sitting in her home near the garden, the teenager said: We were so engrossed as our teachers helped us identify trees that we did not notice the bus speeding towards us. Swati Karmakar, who was injured in her head and back, said she had spent a sleepless night haunted by images of the bus rushing towards them.        
	The driver of the bus, used to ferry visitors, had let an outsider take the wheel to learn driving. Both are missing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Captain plays politics   Boundary in cricket, not politics
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Captain plays politics   Boundary in cricket, not politics
  - Minority affairs for Azharuddin, youth affairs for Sourav on day of different strokes          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          Azhar at Mondays rally. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                        
	He may not have been contemplating century No. 6 but Mohammad Azharuddins mind did wander to Eden Gardens  and cricket  as he padded up for a different cause barely 200 metres from his favourite pitch on Monday afternoon.        
	For a moment, it seemed I was headed for Eden to play a match like in the old days. Then the car that was bringing me here took a turn, and I realised that I am not in town to play cricket anymore, Azhar, in a red T-shirt with the trademark raised collar, told a large gathering at Rani Rashmoni Avenue.        
	The cause that had brought Azhar so close to the ground where he had scored a Test century on debut  and four more later  was a rally by the Furfura Darbar Sharif to highlight minority-specific issues.        
	MP Azhar, designated the Congresss star representative at the rally by non-playing captain Pranab Mukherjee, started his innings like batsman Azhar would often do in his prime: with a quick flick.        
	I never let go of an opportunity to come to Calcutta, said the 46-year-old, recalling how he first came here in 1977 as a school cricketer and played at Eden. I also made my Test debut there. Eden is my favourite ground and Calcutta is my favourite city.         
	But the cricketer-turned-MP said he was pained to hear about land being forcibly acquired in Bengal in the name of development. Statistics show that Muslims account for 27 per cent of the Bengal population, 25 per cent of them farmers. If they lose their land, where will they go?        
	So how can Bengal tackle this bouncer? I am new to politics... but from what I have heard, change is necessary after 33 years of inadequate development.                          
	That lofted drive was hit so hard it could have crashed through a window of Writers Buildings.        
	The first-time MP from Moradabad, went on to say that the difference between cricket and politics lay in the size of the ground.        
	Cricket is played within a boundary. But there is no boundary in politics. I would like to make use of this opportunity to go out of my constituency and work for public welfare across the country.        
	Azhar, however, admitted that Bengali makes him duck. I understood parts of what my fellow speakers said but most of it went over my head like bouncers, he chuckled.        
	Later, uncomfortable questions from reporters were met with a straight bat. What was his take on the IPL controversy? All good players should get a chance, irrespective of their nationality.        
	Would he like to own an IPL team? I am not that rich.

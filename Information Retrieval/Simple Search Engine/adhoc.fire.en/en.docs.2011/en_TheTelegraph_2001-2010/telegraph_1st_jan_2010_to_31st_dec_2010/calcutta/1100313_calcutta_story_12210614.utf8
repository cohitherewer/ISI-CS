	Nibha Roy, a 73-year-old widow, killed herself by jumping into the well of her house in Bally on Friday morning.        
	Her husband died eight years ago and her daughter teaches at a US university, said a police officer. Relatives said Nibha had been lonely since daughter Rita, her only child, moved to the US two years ago.

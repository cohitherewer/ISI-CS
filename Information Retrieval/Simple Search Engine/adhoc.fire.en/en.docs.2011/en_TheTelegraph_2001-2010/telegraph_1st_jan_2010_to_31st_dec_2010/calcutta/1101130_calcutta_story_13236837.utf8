The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Box-office beating for Bolly
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Box-office beating for Bolly
  - Harry Potter leads Holly to victory in battle at the plexes          PRIYANKA ROY                                                  
	Saturday at a plex: Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows running to a near-packed house        
	Saturday at the same plex: A Guzaarish show with less than five viewers               
	Holly has stolen a march over Bolly at the fag end of 2010.         
	With the first part of the last instalment of the Harry Potter franchise going strong in its second week and Facebook saga The Social Network bringing in the crowds even in Week 3, it has been a period of rare Hollywood dominance at the plexes.         
	Both the Hollywood films are doing well and have brought in the numbers for us. Harry Potter, in particular, has been doing extremely well, Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX, told Metro.         
	The Holly content over the last two months has been of a high standard. The fact that India has seen the release of most recent Hollywood films simultaneously as the US has also helped, added Rishi Negi, chief operating officer, Fame.         
	Business has been stupendous, said Denzil Dias, deputy managing director of Warner Bros, of Pottermania.        
	Bolly has also been challenged by Tolly with the eight-week-old Prosenjit starrer Autograph still pulling in the crowds. This success means the world to me and is also a good sign for Tolly, said Srijit Mukherji, the director of Autograph.        
	Guzaarish, powered by a big budget and star power (Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), has been fast losing steam. Last Fridays release Break Ke Baad has also got off to a poor start. Break Ke Baad grossed a paltry Rs 10.5 crore in its opening weekend, which is below average. The film will run up losses, said trade analyst Taran Adarsh.         
	Naseeruddin Shahs Allah Ke Banday has been a non-starter from Day 1. Laugh riot Golmaal 3 is the only film that is keeping the Bolly boat afloat.

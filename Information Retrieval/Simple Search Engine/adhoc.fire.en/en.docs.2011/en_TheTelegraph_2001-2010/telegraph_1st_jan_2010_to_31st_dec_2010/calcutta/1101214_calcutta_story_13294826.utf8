                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hoax call at school, students herded out
          OUR BUREAU                                                Students of GD Birla Centre for Education after they were herded out following the bomb scare. Pictures by Anindya Shankar Ray      
	Thousands of students of GD Birla Centre for Education at Netaji Nagar were herded out on Monday morning following a bomb scare resulting from a hoax call.        
	A man identifying himself as Akash Chatterjee of Ranikuthi called the school reception around 10.25am and said a bomb had been planted in the building and we should leave the premises, said principal Sharmila Nath.        
	The 2,800-odd students on the campus were immediately asked to leave their bags in the classes and gather on the playground.        
	The students, many in tears, stood on the ground for close to two hours before being taken to an adjacent building under construction.        
	After hours of search, police and bomb detection squad personnel declared the campus safe around 3.30pm.        
	The authorities announced that the school would remain closed on Tuesday and the students would get their bags back the day after. The bags of all the students and the employees were searched.        
	We were having our English class when the vice-principal madam asked us to leave our bags and gather on the playground. Someone said there could be a bomb. I was terrified and started crying, said a student.        
	The principal, however, said the students had not been told about the bomb scare. The management, she added, kept supplying food and water to the students.        
	Asked about the parents allegation that they had not been alerted in time, Nath said: We have more than 3,000 students and its impossible to get in touch with each and every parent at once. But we did try to alert them. All the students were sent home early by school buses.        
	Till late on Monday night, the school had not lodged any police complaint.         
	We are yet to receive any formal complaint from the school authorities, said Murli Dhar, additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.        
	We are yet to trace the call. Investigations are on and we cant divulge the details, said L.N. Meena, South 24-Parganas police superintendent.        
	Not that it would have mattered had the school been prompt in lodging a complaint, for several senior officers pleaded helplessness in preventing hoax calls and nabbing the culprits.         
	There were more than 100 prank calls in the city over the past six months but the police could start cases only for two.        
	GD Birla Centre for Education does not have a caller line identification facility, which means the police would have to spend a lot of time getting in touch with the service provider in order to trace the call.         
	The trail may go cold if it turns out to be a call from a PCO, said an officer.        
	Senior officers in Calcutta and adjacent districts said the biggest hurdle in nailing hoax caller was the reluctance of the victims to lodge a complaint and pursue the case.        
	Unless there is a complaint, the police dont start a probe. So, the pranksters get away easily and seeds for more such calls are sown.        
	Even if an accused is arrested, a bailable charge under the Information Technology Act (sending offensive messages through communciation devices) are pressed against him/her.        
	On August 25, a 28-year-old man had been arrested for making a hoax call to Technopolis in Rajarhat, which houses several IT companies, saying a bomb would soon explode in the building.        
	Somnath Dhally apparently wanted to take revenge for being turned away by a guard when he had appeared in the office for a job interview.         
	Dhally, who was picked up from Dankuni, was charged under the IT Act and released on bail.         
	There has not been any progress in the case since. To nail someone under the Information Technology Act, you need to produce certain digital evidence that is not always available, said an officer.        
	Its not easy to collect all electronic evidences. At times, the mother server is in a country with which India does not have any arrangement to share information or evidence, the officer pointed out.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fake firm owner held for fraud
          OUR CORRESPONDENT IN GANGTOK                              
	An alleged Calcutta conman has been arrested in Sikkim for masquerading as a tea planter and exporter to bag a contract to run a state-owned amusement park inaugurated by President Pratibha Patil in April.        
	The vigilance wing caught up with Rajesh Jhunjhunwala at Rangpo, on the Sikkim-Bengal border, while he was trying to flee the state disguised as a labourer. He was handed over to the crime branch on Monday.        
	Police said the rural management and development department called Jhunjhunwalas bluff after a cheque for Rs 1.7 crore issued by him bounced. We later learnt that the man was a fraud and his company was fake. We immediately lodged a complaint with the crime branch, A.K. Ganeriwala, the secretary of the department, told Metro.        
	Jhunjhunwala had allegedly floated an unregistered company called Jhunjhunwala amp; Sons to bid for the contract to run the Rs 55.6 crore Kanchenjungha tourist villa-cum-amusement park in Gangtok.        
	Jhunjhunwala allegedly also duped the owner of the hotel he was staying in. He owed the hotel Rs 30,000 but avoided paying by saying the money was stuck in a wire transfer, the police said.        
	He has been charged under sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery) and 471 (using a forged document as a genuine one) and remanded in police custody for seven days.

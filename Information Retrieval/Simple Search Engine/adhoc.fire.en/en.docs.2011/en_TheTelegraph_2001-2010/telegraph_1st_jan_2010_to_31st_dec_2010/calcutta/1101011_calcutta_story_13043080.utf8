          OUR BUREAU                                          
	The Archbishop of Canterbury came, he spoke and he conquered with a smile on the second evening of his mission of goodwill trip to India.        
	The principal leader of the Church of England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion was the guest of honour during the evening church service at St Pauls Cathedral on Sunday and the civic reception that followed.        
	In the United Kingdom we often have debates on what it means to live in a multicultural society and a secular society. Many believe that to live in a multicultural society is to live in chaos and to live in a secular society is to live in an atmosphere of graveness. Which is close to saying more people from the United Kingdom ought to visit India! smiled Rowan Williams.        
	He also struck an easy personal note. Thank you for the privilege of having me here with you. I remember in my student days I was deeply inspired by what was done here (St Pauls Cathedral) for the refugees and the poor, said Williams at the civic reception arranged at the Parish Hall in St Pauls Cathedral.        
	Showing no signs of fatigue after a long day that began with his sermon for the morning mass at St Peters Church, Behala, he walked up to the guests gathered around circular tables and greeted them all with hands folded in a namaste.        
	One of the first guests he met was Mamata Banerjee, who the bishop of Calcutta, Ashok Biswas, introduced as a most vibrant and powerful lady.        
	Is this your first time in Calcutta? asked the railway minister with a smile.        
	Yes, my first time in Calcutta and full-time too, answered the Archbishop, with a smile.        
	Mamata urged the bishop to make the first visit memorable. I would request you to give Archbishop Williams some rosogolla and some mishti doi.         
	Earlier in her address, Mamata had welcomed the visitor on behalf of the people that she seems poised to rule politically within a few months.        
	We are all proud to say we are meeting such an important messenger from the Anglican Church just before our Puja, said she.        
	Then she drew upon the Bible to deliver a three-in-one message of peace, fellowship and development  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God; Love one another as I have loved you; We work together as partners who belong to God.        
	The political powers that be were missing in action  only Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim was in the front row  and so no questions were asked about how much Mamata practices what she was preaching.        
	It was left to the Archbishop to add a tinge of plurality that could be interpreted in more ways than one in the time of political change.        
	This city has simply been a chaos of warring identities and nobody could say it was grave or colourless, he observed.        
	The impression the city has already made on the Archbishop was evident. Calcutta is a welcoming city and that has been made very clear to us in the last two days.... This city is a crossroads of languages, people and cultures welcoming diversity over centuries.        
	The Calcutta visit marks the beginning of his two-week mission of goodwill trip to India for the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Church of North India (CNI). The CNI is part of the Anglican Communion that Rowan Williams heads.        
	Sunday evenings reception saw on the dais governor M.K. Narayanan, bishop Ashok Biswas, Mamata Banerjee, Justice (retd) Shyamal Sen, deputy moderator of CNI Philip Marandih, British deputy high commissioner in Calcutta Sanjay Wadvani and others.        
	But the focus was entirely on the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest ranking non-royal in the United Kingdom and a member of the House of Lords.        
	A face in the crowd, Nikhil Biswas, hoped for more to come: Today its the Archbishop in Calcutta, tomorrow it could be the Pope (who was here in 1986) again.        
	What does the visit of the Archbishop of Canterbury mean to you?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | In LA, a joyous return to roots
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      In LA, a joyous return to roots
          PRATIM D. GUPTA IN LOS ANGELES                             Sharmila Tagore with Amjad Ali Khan (top) and her daughter Soha at the KKN Ananda Utsav venue in Los Angeles. Pictures by Ashok Majumder                                 
	Ever since 9/11, America has lost ananda I hope events like these can bring back happiness, peace, tranquillity and everything that ananda stands for, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan told Metro moments before the launch of KKN Ananda Utsav, Los Angeles, presented by Anandabazar Patrika, here in California.        
	Taking place at the Pasadena Convention Center, nine miles north-east of downtown Los Angeles, the three-day celebration of Bangaliana on American turf got underway on a sunny Saturday morning when the ever-graceful Sharmila Tagore cut the red ribbon and lit the lamp  electrically (fire is a strict no-no, of course)  alongside the sarod maestro.        
	We dont come here often but we are the same, Sharmila Tagore told the hordes of Bengalis who came in early from all parts of California  San Jose to San Diego, Fremont to Fresno.        
	And by the time Hariharan sang Roja jaaneman at the end of the first day, the Exhibit Hall was chock-a-block with people determined to return to their roots and plug into that Bong connection.        
	The aim of an event like Ananda Utsav is to share with all of you this feeling of togetherness, said the actress who had started out with Ray and then become a Bollywood rage. Tagore, who had also inaugurated the London Ananda Utsav in March, was accompanied by daughter Soha Ali Khan, to present Robi O Radha (an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagores Bhanushingher Padabali).        
	After the mother-daughter act, the spotlight was on Ustad Amjad Ali Khan with his sons Amaan and Ayaan. This is the first time that a newspaper has organised a festival like this here in America where all kinds of musical genres are being celebrated, said the sarod guru.        
	He was referring to the wide variety on offer over three days, from classical music to Bollywood (Sunidhi Chauhan and Hariharan), Bangla rock (James and Ayub Bachchu) to Rabindrasangeet (Rezwana Choudhury Bannya).        
	The fun is, of course, not limited to the stage. The stalls in the adjoining hall give an opportunity to the non-resident Bengali to buy not only jewellery and sari but maybe a plot back in Calcutta.        
	While we have artistes coming down every now and then, we really look forward to an all-round event like this, said Monalisa Dasgupta, a member of the Bengali Association of Southern California, which has helped Anandabazar Patrika organise this cultural extravaganza in LA. For us, its a three-day party where we get together with family and friends.        
	So this extended Labour Day Weekend (September 4-6), the destination is not the beaches of Venice or the casinos of Vegas but the Bong festival here in Pasadena.        
	The ilish has somehow managed to swim back from the river to the sea, from the Thames to the Pacific Ocean.

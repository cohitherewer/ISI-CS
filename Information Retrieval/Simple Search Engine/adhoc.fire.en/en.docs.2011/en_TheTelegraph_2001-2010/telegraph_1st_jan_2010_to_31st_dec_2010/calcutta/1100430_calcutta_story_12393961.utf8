The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pay it, get it and forget it
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pay it, get it and forget it
  - Schools cash in on quick-licence craze        ZEESHAN JAWED                          A motor vehicles inspector surrounded by representatives of training schools on Penn Road on Wednesday. (Amit Datta)                                        
	Their task is to train people to drive and help make our streets safer. Instead, they have turned into vending machines for licences geared to spill blood on the streets.        
	On Wednesday, Metro had witnessed a farce called driving test under the Alipore RTO on Penn Road being run by representatives of various motor training schools. The training school drivers took the wheel while the candidates watched carefully from the back seat. That was enough for the candidates to pass the test with no motor vehicles inspector in sight.        
	With the line for a licence growing by the hour, there are close to 55 motor training schools now registered with the public vehicles department (PVD) in Beltala while more than 120 are registered with the Alipore RTO.        
	According to the Central Motor Vehicles rules, all motor training schools must be registered with the local transport authority. The route transport officer uses his discretion on the number of schools required in any area.        
	There are more than 120 motor training schools registered under Alipore RTO, which is probably the highest among all RTOs in the state, said a PVD official in Beltala.        
	A hefty bribe can get a motor training school the necessary licence, without fulfilling other mandatory requirements laid down by the Central Motor Vehicles rule book. The owner of a driving school revealed that the going rate is Rs 1.5 lakh for the licence.        
	The rule book says that a training school must have a classroom, a mechanical room and a library. The qualification of the chief instructor and his deputies are also spelt out. But all that is flouted for a bribe, said a transport department official.        
	All for a cause  a quick and easy licence. Even smaller driving schools have at least 75 trainees on their rolls at any given point. The likes of Shib Lokenath Motor Training School in Behala  there at the Penn Road driving test  churn out at least 40 licence cases every week. At the bigger ones, the weekly count crosses 100.        
	In the late-Nineties when entry-segment hatchbacks hit the market, there was a rush for licences and a boom in motor training centres, said a veteran instructor.        
	This boom also gave birth to a nexus between the motor training schools and officials of the transport department to expedite and smoothen the process of acquiring a licence.        
	For a few hundred rupees you did not have to take the wheel in front of the motor vehicles inspector. For a few thousand, you need not even show up.        
	There can be no supply without the demand. Why does nobody blame the applicants? People want driving licences like fast food. Most of them do not even want to appear for the driving test, thundered the owner of a school under the Alipore RTO.        
	Clearly, in this game of the quick and the dead there is blood on many a hand.

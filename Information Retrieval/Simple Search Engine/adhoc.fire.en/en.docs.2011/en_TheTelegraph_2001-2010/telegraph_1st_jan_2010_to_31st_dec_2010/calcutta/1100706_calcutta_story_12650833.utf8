The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fair guide to Puja getaway
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fair guide to Puja getaway

	By the time the last stall at Tourist Spot had closed on Sunday, hundreds of families had sorted out their plans for Puja vacation.        
	The tourism fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium, in association with Anandabazar Patrika, began on Friday and ended on Sunday with the footfall count touching 20,000.         
	We are here to plan our vacation to Kashmir after Puja. We picked Kashmir because of its pristine beauty now that the security situation has improved. This fair has given us a fair idea of places to visit in Kashmir and the best packages for the purpose, said S. Chanda, a government employee, on Sunday evening.        
	While traditional favourites Kerala, Kashmir and Rajasthan remained the top domestic picks, emerging destinations included Arunachal Pradesh.        
	Egypt, Greece and Turkey emerged as the favourite international destinations for Calcuttans.        
	I have always wanted to see the pyramids and cruise down the Nile. Athens and Istanbul are also great destinations. Hopefully I will visit them during Puja, said homemaker Sunanda Nandi, who dropped in at Tourist Spot on Sunday afternoon.        
	Southeast Asia continued to generate the most frequent enquiries. Those travelling to Thailand are looking to club the trip with a visit to Vietnam, an emerging destination, said Sumit Batabyal, a member of the Travel Agents Association of Bengal.        
	The price tag is important for the Bengal market. A six days-five nights tour of Egypt would cost Rs 50,000 per person. A Thailand-Vietnam combo for the same number of days costs around Rs 42,000, he added.        
	South Africa, in the limelight for the World Cup, has grabbed the attention of adventure and wildlife enthusiasts.        
	We have received quite a few enquiries about south and east Africa, especially about the jungle safaris, said Pranabesh Sarkar, the secretary of the Travel amp; Hotels Association.        
	And Argentina may not have made it to the World Cup semi-finals but has scored with would-be travellers.        
	A few families asked us about Argentina. Those who did not want to go to New Zealand or Australia were interested in South Africa, said Sumit De, manager (sales-east), ezeego1.com.        
	Low-cost airlines, increased spending power and education abroad have widened the Bengalis travel map, felt U.K. Banerjee, the director of Jetchoice Tours amp; Travels, a travel agency.        
	Closer home, eco-tourism was a hit. We expect around 20 per cent enquiries to translate into package purchases. People usually do their homework at such fairs before zooming in on one destination, said Nayan Kar, the CEO of Eco Tourism.        
	The company offers trips to the Sunderbans, Goa, Mirik, Chilika, Dooars, Simlipal and Santiniketan.                          
	Emerging destinations  
	International: Egypt, Vietnam and Sri Lanka  
	Domestic: Arunachal Pradesh  
	Pop picks  
	International: Southeast Asia, Europe and China  
	Domestic: Kerala, Kashmir and Rajasthan

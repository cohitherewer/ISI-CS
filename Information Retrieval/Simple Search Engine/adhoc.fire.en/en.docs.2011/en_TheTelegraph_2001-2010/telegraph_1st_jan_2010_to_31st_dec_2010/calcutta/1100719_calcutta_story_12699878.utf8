                      Philosophy on canvas                    A group of Hindu philosophical traditions by which one may understand the ultimate nature of reality, Vedanta forms the basis of much of later spiritual thought. The goal of Vedanta is a state of self-realisation or cosmic consciousness. Since his formative years, city-based artist Dipankar Mani has been deeply influenced by Vedantic literature and its teachings. Om-Ma-Maya-Mukti, the ongoing solo show of his paintings, features works inspired by his understanding of this ancient philosophy and its tenets and treatises. Expressing a concern for eternal principles of life, the paintings deal with the dynamism of still life, the thought-processes of the human mind, the eternal cycle of life and death and the essential cosmic unity of the universe. Manis paintings have the power to arouse our deep-seated emotions and ultimately have a cathartic effect on the viewer. Some of his works also bear the influence of modern Indian philosophical thought as found in the teachings of Swami Vivekananda or the poetry of Kazi Nazrul Islam and Sukanta Bhattacharya. Nature, too, is a source of inspiration to the artist which finds reflection in his work as a living force that energises and invigorates.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Dipankar Mani When: Till July 21; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts, South A Gallery

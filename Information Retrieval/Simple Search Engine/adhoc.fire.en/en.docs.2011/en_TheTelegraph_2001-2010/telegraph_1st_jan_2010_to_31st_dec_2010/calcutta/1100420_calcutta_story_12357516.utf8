          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A man in his 20s was arrested in a south Calcutta mall on Sunday evening with fake notes amounting to Rs 1 lakh.         
	Prabhash Jhapri, a resident of Bagnan in Howrah, allegedly tried to buy clothes using the counterfeit notes.         
	Police claimed Jhapri was part of a racket dealing in fake currency and the Special Task Force (STF) had received a tip-off that he would visit the mall in a bid to spread fake notes.        
	Jhapri turned up at the mall around 8pm. He went upstairs and entered a garment shop. Our men followed him. They caught him after he took out counterfeit notes to pay for the clothes he had selected, said an officer.        
	A bunch of fake Rs 500 notes was found in the youths pocket. During interrogation, Jhapri claimed he had received the notes from a person in Bangladesh.

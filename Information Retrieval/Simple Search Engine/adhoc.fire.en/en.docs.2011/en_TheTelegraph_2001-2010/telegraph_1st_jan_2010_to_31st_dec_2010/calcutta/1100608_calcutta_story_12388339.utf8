										      SHOUT OUT LOUD                                    
	A few days ago, chaos reigned in our house in the morning. No water since last evening, were the words on everyones lips.         
	On the way to college, though, I saw water gushing out of the roadside taps with no takers in sight. I stopped for a while and searched for something to plug the tap with, but in vain.         
	This is hardly a solitary instance. Everyday, I see the water tanks of the houses next to ours overflowing, without the residents bothering to notice until a lot of water has been wasted.        
	We dont realise that water is getting scarce by the day. There are fears that our groundwater resources will be severely depleted by the next decade.         
	Water has no substitute. People will realise the magnitude of the disaster brought upon by the wastage of water only when its consequences are upon us.

	Height of it all              
	An advertisement often aired on television shows a proud mother boasting of her success in helping her son grow taller by regularly giving him a prescribed health drink.         
	It seems that the fascination with height is no less than that with fairness as a marker for beauty. Why do we give importance to certain external attributes, elevating them to virtues? Is one any less of a person if shorter?        
	One wonders if height was a concern for the parents of Sachin Tendulkar (picture right), A. R. Rahman, Lata Mangeshkar or Woody Allen, each of whom tower in their respective fields.

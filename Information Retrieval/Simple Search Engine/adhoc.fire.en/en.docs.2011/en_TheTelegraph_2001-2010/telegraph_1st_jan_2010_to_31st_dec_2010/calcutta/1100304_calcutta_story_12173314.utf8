          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The state government on Wednesday opposed the Centres decision to set up the National Commission for Higher Education and Research, describing it as an attempt to curb the autonomy of universities.        
	A state government representative told visiting officials of the human resource development ministry  touring the country to collect feedback on the plan  that formation of the higher education regulator would lead to over centralisation of powers.         
	According to the central plan, the commission would replace the University Grants Commission (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE).        
	Members of the national taskforce that is advising the Centre on the move tried to allay the state governments fears.         
	The proposed bill is aimed at giving more freedom. It aims to provide more autonomy by removing the centralised powers vested on agencies like the UGC, AICTE and the NCTE, said M. Miri, a member of the taskforce.         
	The taskforce members held met senior state government officials, vice-chancellors, university teachers and academicians on Wednesday to discuss the issue.        
	We have visited many states, including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and those in the Northeast. But we faced maximum resistance in Bengal, said Begum Sahida Hameed, a Planning Commission member who is part of the taskforce.         
	Provisions in the bill make it mandatory for universities to get the authorisation of the commission on various academic issues like granting of a degree. The ambiguities need to be removed, said Subimal Sen, the chairman of the West Bengal State Higher Education Council.

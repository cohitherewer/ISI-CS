                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      High court orders shift of convicts
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                               
	A high court division bench on Monday ordered the Dum Dum Central jail authorities to immediately shift Satish Goutam and Sishu Pal, who were sentenced to death by a Barasat court, from the condemned cell to a general cell.        
	On January 8, the two, along with eight others, had been held guilty for the death of 42-year-old homemaker Chandana Das, who was pushed off a third-floor balcony of her Kanchrapara house while it was being looted in February 2008. Goutam and Pal were put in the condemned cell after the verdict.        
	The division bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice P.K. Deb passed Mondays order on the basis of a plea moved by the lawyers representing the two convicts.        
	Citing a Supreme Court ruling, the lawyers said those sentenced to death by trial courts could not be sent to condemned cells until the respective high courts confirmed the punishment. The lawyers also told the court that the 10 had moved Calcutta High Court against the sentence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dismal report card on Lakes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dismal report card on Lakes

	The issue of maintenance of Rabindra Sarobar has come up in Calcutta High Court 24 times between 1997 and 2009 but the largest man-made lake in the city continues to languish in a sorry state.        
	The water body, better known as the Lakes in south Calcutta, was listed as a Lake of National Importance in 2003. The high court and apex court issued a number of directives and orders over the past 13 years to protect it but the state government and the polices approach to the task has remained laidback.        
	Two non-government organisations (NGOs)  Rabindra Sarovar Bachao Committee and Paribesh Dushan Rodh Committee  filed a petition before the green bench of the high court in 1997, demanding development of the Lakes.        
	By 2003, following orders of the court, the squatters were evicted, the broken wall around the water body rebuilt, the pollution control board and Jadavpur University involved in its maintenance and funds allotted for its rejuvenation and beautification.        
	Seven years after the judicial intervention, the health report of Rabindra Sarobar is still dismal. There has been environmental degradation, the lake has shrunk and its water is heavily polluted as a large number of people use it for washing and bathing.

	The green bench of the high court had asked the PCB and the Institute of Wetland Management and Ecological Design for a report on the health of the Lakes and they had stated that the quality of the water was below all acceptable parameters.        
	Jadavpur University had submitted a comprehensive plan to rejuvenate the Lakes but because of paucity of funds it could not be implemented, pointed out the chief engineer of the Calcutta Improvement Trust.         
	The wall, which was last repaired in 2006, has since been breached by shanty dwellers who use the lake for bathing and washing clothes and utensils.        
	The carpet of green grass is disappearing gradually, hyacinths have covered the water at many places, the toy train no longer plies and heaps of garbage can be seen beside the paths on the premises.        
	The police patrol the lake but never prevent anyone from bathing or washing or dumping garbage.         
	A pollution control board official said on condition of anonymity: Nothing can be done as long as councillors, MLAs and MPs of the area allow people to destroy the lake so that they continue to get votes. In Mumbai, Chennai and other cities, representatives of the people do not allow such destruction of public property under any condition.         
	Environment activist Subhas Dutta said: We will file another petition before the high court green bench.

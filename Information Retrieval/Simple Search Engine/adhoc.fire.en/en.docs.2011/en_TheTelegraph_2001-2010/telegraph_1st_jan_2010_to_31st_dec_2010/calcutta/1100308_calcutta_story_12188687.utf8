                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Xaviers old boys adopt sister school

	Akash patal tofat (Theres been a sea change), smiled Fr Andre Bruylants while looking around Bagi Pourbala Bar Prabhabati Mandal Balika Vidyalaya in Joka on Sunday.         
	What was a three-room hutment with a thatched roof till July 2009 is now a concrete two-storeyed structure with 12 rooms and a proper toilet.         
	Fr Bruylants, a former headmaster of St Xaviers, inaugurated the new building on Sunday morning in the presence of members of Alsoc  the old boys association of St Xaviers Collegiate School, Calcutta.         
	The new building was built at a cost of Rs 30 lakh provided by Alsoc. Earlier, we had from classes V to X; after the extension, we have added five more classes  Nursery to Class IV, said Oli Koley, the headmistress of the school, the only secondary school in the vicinity.        
	The Joka school, still smelling of fresh paint, greeted the old boys with a cultural programme presented by students of the school  including a dramatic adaptation of Rabindranath Tagores short story Chhuti.         
	The principal and vice-principal of St Xaviers Collegiate School, Fr Jerome and Fr Sebastian, also attended the programme.        
	In 2003, I came to know of the poor infrastructure in the school from Surjyasen Patra, then a local panchayat member and a teacher in the Bagi school. I tried to raise funds from various sources and when nothing seemed to work out, I approached Alsoc. The members of the association readily agreed to take up the project, said Fr Bruylants.        
	Alsoc, which has adopted the Joka school as its sister concern, has also gifted it ceiling fans, benches and other material.         
	We are most thankful to Alsoc for all that they have done for our school. They are also trying to get us affiliated to the state secondary education board. We had written to Bikash Bhavan in 2006 and 2009 but without much success, said Koley.        
	Alsoc members are also planning to create an open space for the students of the school by filling up low-lying lands around it.         
	We are happy to have got the opportunity to do something meaningful under the guidance of the fathers, said Noomi Mehta, the honourary secretary of Alsoc.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Team spots lapses in highrises
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A newly-formed joint team inspected four highrises on Sunday and spotted several lapses that could trigger a Stephen Court-like disaster.        
	Special police commissioner Banibrata Basu, the co-ordinator of the team, said faults were detected in the firefighting arrangements, precautionary measures and electrical wiring in all four buildings. We will serve notices to the authorities of the buildings asking them to fix the flaws within a deadline, he added.        
	The four structures are Mercantile Building on Lalbazar Street and 7A, 7B and 7C Kiran Shankar Roy Road, near the high court.        
	Apart from the police, the team comprised representatives of CESC, fire services department and the civic body.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti announced on Friday that the team would carry out checks on premises in an attempt to prevent a re-run of the Park Street tragedy. A list of 10 fire-prone residential and commercial structures and three slums has been drawn up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girl points finger at killer father
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girl points finger at killer father
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Madhumita Mitra                                  
	A seven-year-old girl has told police that she saw her father electrocute her mother, pour kerosene on her and set her on fire in their kitchen.        
	Shampa Mitras statements prompted officers of Sonarpur police station to arrest her grandmother, uncle and aunt last Wednesday and launch a hunt for her father.        
	Shampas mother Madhumita, 28, was taken to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital and later shifted to SSKM Hospital with 92 per cent burns. She died early on Thursday.        
	My son-in-law had tried to fool me by saying a burning stove had fallen on her. But I was not convinced and lodged a complaint with Sonarpur police station against her in-laws, who often tortured her for dowry, said Madhumitas father Kumarendra Ghosh.        
	When Ghosh accompanied a police team to the Mitras house in Sonarpurs Lashkarpur on Wednesday evening, he could not find his granddaughter Shampa.        
	The little girl, a student of Class II, was later found trapped in her uncles house next door, from where she had cried to alert her grandfather and the police team. They were refusing to let her out because she knew the secret, Ghosh, a caretaker of a building, recalled on Monday.        
	After the police rescued a weeping Shampa, she narrated what her father had done to her mother.        
	Based on her statements as well as Ghoshs complaint, the police later rounded up Madhumitas mother-in-law Sheela, and brother-in-law Soumen and his wife Seema.        
	Madhumitas husband Samar, a driver, could not be found. Key accused Samar Mitra is absconding. We had earlier slapped charges of cruelty, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy on the husband and the in-laws. After the woman died on Thursday, they were booked under the murder charge, said a senior officer.         
	On Monday, Shampa said: My parents were fighting since the morning. Suddenly my father slapped my mother. As she fell, my father pressed some electric wires against her. I was crying. My mother shrieked and became still. He then poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. I cried out but my father slapped me and locked me in my grandmothers room.        
	Shampa said her father often assaulted her mother.        
	Ghosh alleged Madhumita had to be hospitalised four months ago with head and hand injuries after being thrashed by her husband and in-laws. They would regularly beat her up for dowry, he said.        
	The in-laws have been remanded in judicial custody till October 12. Ghoshs lawyer Anirban Guha Thakurta criticised the police for not seeking police custody for the accused.        
	The probe is on. If required, we will again question all the witnesses, including Madhumitas daughter, said Ranendra Nath Banerjee, additional superintendent of police (rural), South 24-Parganas.

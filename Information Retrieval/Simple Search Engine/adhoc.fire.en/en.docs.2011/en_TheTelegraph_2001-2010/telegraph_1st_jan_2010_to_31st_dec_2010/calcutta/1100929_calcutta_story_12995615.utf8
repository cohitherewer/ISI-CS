                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trek trail leads to missing six, but no trace of trio
  - Climber duo find Chinsurah team making their way down from destination after three-day delay          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Six of the nine trekkers from Bengal reported missing in rain-ravaged Uttarakhand were traced on Tuesday trudging down a hill after taking three extra days to complete their expedition to Dhumdharkhandi Pass.        
	The last time anybody had seen Shikha Das, Animesh Saha, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, Jayanta Ghosh, Pradip Ghosh and Amit Das of Chinsurah, in Hooghly, was nearly 10 days ago when they were in Sima village.        
	Kasba resident Samudra Bose, whose account of a trek to the brink and back was published by Metro on Tuesday, had recalled meeting the group at Sima on the route to Har-Ki-Doon and Dhumdharkhandi Pass on September 18.         
	Sports minister Kanti Ganguly, who was in Uttarakhand until Sunday to co-ordinate rescue efforts, said mountaineers Sourav Mondol and Bibhuti Biswas tracked the teams route and found them at Jhala (8,448 feet) on Tuesday morning. They had taken a different route to their destination because of landslides and lost a few days in the process. With no cellphone connectivity, they were unable to contact anyone to say they were safe, he added.        
	Tanmoys brother Asim Bhattacharya was one of the many relieved faces back home after having spoken to his sibling, who assured him that all is well. They are headed for Uttarkashi and will return home via Dehradun, said Asim, who had been frantically calling the authorities and other trekkers from Bengal over the past few days for any information they might have.        
	The sigh of relief was, however, tinged with concern as another day passed with no news of the three trekkers who went missing while heading towards Badrinath via Kalindi Pass over a week ago. Anal Das, N.P. Rao and Arun Adak were part of an eight-member team from Howrah Golabari.        
	Its been four days since when our trek was scheduled to be completed. They might not have got back to the Kalindi base camp as the area around it is covered with snow. Choppers and army rescue teams are searching the route constantly, but there is no trace of them yet, rued Sudipto Mitra, one of the other five team members who returned safely.        
	A six-member team of mountaineers, including Everest climbers Basanta Singha Roy and Debasish Biswas, is searching for the missing trekkers.        
	The ground search team has already covered the route to Kalindi Pass, but in vain. The state government has written to the Uttarakhand authorities to arrange for another search in the area, still five feet under snow.        
	A team will also cover the area on the other side of Kalindi Pass from Joshimath. We have to give it another try, said minister Ganguly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seven-day siege of city centre
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Seven-day siege of city centre
  - Front eyes protest base camp        OUR BUREAU                                                  
	What do political parties do when they desperately seek popular support? They set up a base camp in the city centre and rob the people of their right to free movement.        
	In 2006, Mamata Banerjee  reduced to an insignificant minority in the Assembly  parked herself in Metro Channel in a last-ditch attempt to slam the brakes on Tata Motors small-car factory in Singur. She managed just that after crippling traffic movement in the heart of the city for 26 days in a row.        
	Desperate to retain the seat of power and lift the morale of cadres before next years Assembly polls, leaders of the ruling Left Front have zeroed in on the same place to hold seven consecutive rallies, between November 24 and 30.        
	Left Front chairman Biman Bose rolled out the rally roster after the front partners put their seal of approval. Protest against the terror and anarchy unleashed by the Trinamul Congress and the Maoists was cited as the official reason.        
	Front sources said the plan to camp in Metro Channel was aimed at drumming up support for the beleaguered coalition.         
	The impact of the row of rallies  with a grand finale on Day VII  on poll fortunes remains a matter of speculation, but their effect on the citys traffic is a no-brainer.        
	The rulebook says police cannot give permission for rallies in Metro Channel or RR Avenue but data available with the traffic department reveals that these two venues are used to hold rallies at least 300 days a year.        
	This stretch is spared only during the Madhyamik and HS examinations, a few festive days, peak monsoon and the height of summer, said a constable of Bowbazar police station, who often has to manage traffic movement along Metro Channel.        
	He fears the worst when the Left Front takes over Metro Channel weeks before Christmas. If Metro Channel is choked, traffic movement along Chowringhee, CR Avenue, Lenin Sarani, SN Banerjee Road and RR Avenue takes a severe beating and the ripple effects can be felt on key stretches along Moulali, BB Ganguly Street, Park Street, Theatre Road and AJC Bose Road, said the constable.         
	Bose, of course, spared a thought for the commuter. We are a responsible political party.... Our mass organisations will hold meetings and demonstrations from November 24 to 29, and, on 30th, there will be a central rally in Metro Channel for which sizeable mobilisation will take place. But its not that everything (read, traffic) will collapse because of that, stressed the front chairman.        
	Try telling that to victims of traffic snarls in and around Metro Channel. The political parties know that by holding a meeting in Metro Channel they can cause maximum disruption with minimum effort, said Sandeep Sonthalia, whose office is on Bentinck Street. If these parties had paid me Re 1 for every minute Ive spent stuck in traffic jams near Metro Channel in the past five years, Id be a millionaire by now.        
	Also counting their losses are traffic department bosses who fear that traffic at Esplanade will come to a standstill in the last week of November. And not just because of the Left Front.        
	Between November 24 and 29, several other organisations  like the West Bengal Directorate Employees Association and the West Bengal Madrasah Students Association  have booked the southern flank of RR Avenue.        
	Although November 30 is open till now, there is word about the BJP planning to hold rallies at different places across the city. They also have plans to march towards Writers Buildings, said a traffic department official.         
	Rahul Sinha, the BJP state president, said the party would go ahead with its November 30 protest even if it clashed with the CPM rally. We had decided on the date long ago. The police commissioner has requested us to shift the date, but there is no question of that, he said.        
	The traffic bosses have started working out elaborate diversion plans to keep vehicles moving, albeit at a snails pace.         
	Unlike Bose, a senior CPM state secretariat member admitted that the rallies would slow down traffic, but he also found a justification. People will face some problems. But if Mamata Banerjee can block that place for 26 days for her hunger strike, whats wrong if we demonstrate there for seven days?        
	Like most politicians in town, he refused to see the real wrong  how the people have to pay a price for the politics of disruption that defines Bengal.

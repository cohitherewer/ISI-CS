The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayorspeak: mean politics, not cash crunch, impedes citys development
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayorspeak: mean politics, not cash crunch, impedes citys development
										      DEEPANKAR GANGULY      CIVIC POLL 2010                                    
	Next week this time, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, 59, will be back where he belongs  poring over case material and fighting it out in court. The mayor  clean for some, a misfit for others  gives his exit interview to Metro...              
	Five years ago, you had entered the chor-poration with some apprehension...        
	After five years, a respect has grown in me towards this institution. Chor-poration is a misnomer. It is a vast organisation, it is a prestigious organisation with a dedicated workforce. I had no idea that the people here are engaged in so many activities. The corporation has immense potentiality and if properly harnessed the institution can really make the city and the lives of its citizens better.              
	What is the key to the corporation functioning to potential?        
	The primary precondition is not to turn it into a cauldron of cheap and mean politics.              
	Talking of cheap and mean politics, after running it for five years can you say who really runs this place?                  Outgoing mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya campaigns for a party colleague in the New Market area on Friday. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray      
	I have understood the inner meaning of your question. For me, it is the mayor who runs the corporation. When you are talking about outside influence, I wont say that it is not there but how to tackle that depends on ones personality. If a mayor is judicious and has the grit to deal with it, he can. If I didnt take a strong stand, some of the projects would have got delayed. But I wouldnt like to elaborate on this point.              
	What is the basic hurdle to the citys development? Funds or politics?        
	Funds is no problem. Too much stress on head-count politics is. Lack of political consensus on some basic issues  encroachment of pavements, illegal constructions, slum development, auto menace, air pollution, visual pollution, heritage conservation and cleanliness  is the main impediment to the citys all-round development.        
	Is the CMC really an autonomous body?        
	It is an autonomous body and there is no doubt that the Left Front government has empowered it financially to a great extent. Without financial empowerment, autonomy becomes meaningless. Still, I strongly believe that the CMC is a city government and it must be given all powers that a city government should have.        
	For example, in the case of trade licence for food items, the CMCs licences have no value until a section of police issues another licence. It is a practice from the pre-Independence era. The relevant clause in the Calcutta Police Act requires an immediate review. It is restricting the scope of business for unemployed youths.              
	What gave you the greatest satisfaction as mayor?        
	There are three things for which I feel good. First, taking up a scheme to lay an additional 26km water main from Palta to Tallah under BT Road.        
	Second, being successful in cleaning up the century-old silt from the underground brick sewer with international standard workmanship.        
	Third, setting up chains of citizen service centres in different pockets. Future generations will continue to enjoy the benefits of this infrastructure development.        
	What can you claim as a first, during your tenure?        
	It is for the first time in the history of the CMC that waterlogging in the city has been taken up as a challenge. This board has taken up schemes of over Rs 1,000 crore to mitigate this problem. Completion of such a big scheme will spill over into the next tenure but citizens will enjoy the benefits in the decades to come.         
	Your biggest failure?        
	Being unable to pull down the illegal parts of the fire-ravaged Nandram market. I should have done that. It is a blot on justice. But the situation did not permit me. I wont elaborate on that.        
	What has left a bitter taste in your mouth?        
	The role of a section of media. I feel sad when I recall acrid criticism over some natural calamities and other events.... A mayor is for five years while the city is over 300 years old.        
	Finally, what must the next mayor have to make the city a better place?        
	He should have a vision for development. It is no more a seat for a myopic person with a traditional outlook. He must understand the aspirations of the youth, otherwise he and the political party to which he belongs will be rejected by the next generation. Children in slums may soon demand an answer from the mayor about how long they will be kept confined to such an environment. They have aspirations for better living. The youth will ask why our city is not beautiful like other cities.... A mayor should shut out politics when it comes to the question of development.        
	How would you rate Bhattacharyya as mayor on a scale of 10 and why? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

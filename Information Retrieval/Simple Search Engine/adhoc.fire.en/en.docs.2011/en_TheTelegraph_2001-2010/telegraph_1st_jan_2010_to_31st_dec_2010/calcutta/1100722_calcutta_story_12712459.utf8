The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crowd cry music to her ears   Mamata rally math
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Crowd cry music to her ears   Mamata rally math
  - Eye spy a count that counts        KINSUK BASU                          SHE SAYS IT WITH A SMILE: Mamata Banerjee is a picture of poise as Nachiketa (not in picture) sings a song of change on the martyrs day stage. Picture by Amit Datta                                         
	Crowd count became more complicated than calculus on the day of Mamata Banerjees giant roadshow, with figures fluctuating wildly between three and 20 lakh depending on who was calculating.        
	I see a 20 lakh-strong sea of humanity in front of me. This is the biggest ever street rally in the world, declared Mamata to cheers from the congregation that stretched longitudinally for over a km from Victoria House to Indian Museum on Wednesday.        
	Lalbazars official head count of three lakh was less than one-sixth of the turnout touted by Trinamul, though officers of the Special Branch admitted in private that the actual figure would be between 5 and 5.5 lakh. Lets put it this way: the turnout would have made Mamata very glad and the Left Front even more glum, quipped a senior officer on counting duty.         
	Although still far short of Mamatas estimate, the unofficial police calculation makes this the largest street rally in town, if not the world.        
	So how were all the calculations made? For the Trinamul leadership, 20 lakh was a figure based on what the eye wanted to see from Mamatas dais.        
	The polices calculation was far from foolproof  there is still no consensus on the turnout at Barack Obamas historic swearing-in last year, or at Lyndon B. Johnsons for that matter  but there was a method to it.        
	Be it a CPM gathering or a Trinamul one, our calculations are an amalgam of two methods  number of parked vehicles multiplied by estimated average passenger count per vehicle and the people-per-block method, said a member of the Special Branch team that carried out Wednesdays crowd count.        
	In the first method, the police counted the number of rally vehicles parked across nine designated lots in the north, central and Maidan areas, picked an average number of passengers per vehicle and multiplied the two. The final figure was arrived at by adding an estimated number of people in processions from various parts of the city.         
	We classify vehicles into three categories  normal buses, deluxe buses and Matadors/vans. The counting pattern is 15-20 people per matador/van and an average of 40 per bus, both normal and deluxe. Then we take into account the number of processions, based on data available with the traffic control room, said an officer.                           
	The total vehicle count on Wednesday was 3,960, but the break-up was not available.        
	The polices second method of putting a figure to the crowd was to take the rally area to be approximately one km in length  Bentinck Street to Indian Museum  and around 120 ft (37 metres) in width. The 37,000sq m area was then divided into four blocks  Dais to KC Das, KC Das to Dorina Crossing, Dorina to Lindsay Street and Lindsay to Indian Museum.        
	Each of these blocks was divided into smaller squares, based on eye estimates of how many people were there in each square. An average was arrived at and multiplied by the number of such squares. The margin for error was taken to be 3-5 per cent.        
	But there was no official announcement to contradict or challenge the Trinamul estimate.We generally never quote the turnout at any rally or meeting, Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), told Metro.   
	fun with numbers   
	Mamata has Obama for company. The turnout at his swearing-in on Jan. 20, 2009, was estimated to be between 8 lakh and 3 million  
	The 8 lakh figure was based on satellite images and simple math. Experts figured out how many people there might have been per sq ft and then factored in the surface area. The equation was: total area divided by sq ft per person, depending on crowd density. The standard calculation for the space in front of the stage at an open-air gig is 2.5sq ft per person

                      Ideas, idols and images                    Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture pays homage to two eminent artists of Bengal, Ajit Chakraborty and Sailen Mittra, through an exhibition of their works. It includes 24 figurative and abstract sculptures of Chakraborty done in stone, bronze, terracotta and wood. Most of them are small and portable, but each expresses human emotions and sentiments with effortless ease. Inspired by expressionism, the 50-odd compositions of Mittra are essentially contemporary reflections of the futilities and frustrations of life. In his use of latent geometry and blended colours, there is a quest for peace and beauty that offers viewers the intellectual pleasure of delving through layers and layers of meaning.                    Event: Sculptures by Ajit Chakraborty and paintings by Sailen Mittra When: Till November 26 (except Sunday and Monday); 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 108 Southern Avenue, 1st floor

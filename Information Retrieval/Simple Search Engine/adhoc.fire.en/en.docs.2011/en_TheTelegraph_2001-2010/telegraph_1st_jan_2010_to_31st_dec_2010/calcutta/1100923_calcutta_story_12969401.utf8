  - First familys day out: Pratibha lectures India Inc, Devisingh laps up salute from roots        A STAFF REPORTER                          President Pratibha Patil and governor M.K. Narayanan at the inaugural session of the 37th National Management Convention of AIMA on Wednesday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	Outside, wheels were enjoying a rare smooth Wednesday ride and pedestrians were enjoying a rare smooth pre-Puja passage.        
	Inside, the spotlight was on the cause of a snarl-free Chowringhee and a hawker-free Oberoi Grand arcade  Pratibha Devisingh Patil.        
	The 37th National Management Convention of the All India Management Association (AIMA)  returning to the city after a three-year break, and partnered by The Telegraph  had brought the President to town and therefore prompted police to keep her Raj Bhavan-Oberoi Grand-Raj Bhavan route clean and quick.        
	The two-day meet had begun from 10am on Wednesday, with corporate leaders, politicians and bureaucrats dwelling on Managing India: Opportunities amp; Challenges, but the inauguration was kept for 5.30pm.        
	President Patil entered with governor M.K. Narayanan, she lit the inaugural lamp, felicitated Team India opener Gautam Gambhir with the Managing India Award, and then launched into her inaugural address.        
	The stress was on rural economy, which must be integrated into the mainstream with other sectors of the economy. Indias objectives are clear. It is to work for development that is sustainable, build the capacity and skills of our people, create a fair opportunity for every Indian to accomplish ones full potential and push forward the frontiers of knowledge for innovations and creativity.        
	Earlier in the day, the conventions chairman, B. Muthuraman, had said it slightly differently. A global economic rebalancing is underway and will be the key factor for India to become a product, service and people provider to the world, said the vice-chairman of Tata Steel.        
	Agriculture in India, stated Patil, needed a fresh approach to enhance its productivity and profitability. Most importantly, we need a system that respects the values of honesty and hard work as also our rich cultural heritage.        
	Day 2 of the AIMA convention will, in fact, begin with a session titled Going Rural: A Fortune in the Dust.        
	Surrounded by dark suits, Patil dwelt on inclusive growth and the role of the private sector in the Public Private Partnership model.        
	She called for a trust-based relationship between government, organisations and society at large for corporate India to become a credible partner in Indias progress.        
	Business is for profit but it cannot be divorced from ethics, she concluded.        
	Governor Narayanan struck a note of optimism. India today is one of the most respected countries in the world... Along with doctors, engineers and IT professionals, Indias managers are now respected worldwide, he said.        
	About 800 delegates have turned up for the convention and for them all and many beyond, AIMA president Sanjiv Goenka said: This could be Indias century. It is early days yet, but we are at the cusp of an inflexion point.

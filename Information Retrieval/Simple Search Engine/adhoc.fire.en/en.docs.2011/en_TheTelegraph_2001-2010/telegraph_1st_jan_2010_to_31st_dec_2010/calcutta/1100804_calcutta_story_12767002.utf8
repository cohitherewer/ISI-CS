                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scam-tainted in hospital
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Ketan Desai                                  
	Ketan Desai, the former Medical Council of India president, arrested by the CBI on the charge of taking a bribe and brought to Calcutta last week for interrogation, was admitted to SSKM Hospital on Tuesday after he complained of chest pain.        
	Desai is in the ICCU and is undergoing tests. His condition is stable, said Debashish Bhattacharya, the medical superintendent of SSKM.        
	Desai and two others were arrested in Delhi in April for allegedly accepting Rs 2 crore to grant recognition to a private medical college.         
	After the arrest, the Union health ministry dissolved the MCI governing body and set up a six-member panel to run the countrys apex regulator of medical education.        
	CBI sources said Desai had been brought to Calcutta as sleuths suspect he had spread his network of making money illegally to the city, too. We have got some leads revealing Desais Calcutta link, said a CBI official.        
	Desai was removed from the post of president of the medical council in 2001 following charges of corruption but was later re-elected.        
	Desai was taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital last Friday after he complained of chest pain and discomfort. Doctors, however, found nothing wrong with Desai.        
	He complained of chest pain on Tuesday afternoon, too, and was taken to SSKM Hospital.

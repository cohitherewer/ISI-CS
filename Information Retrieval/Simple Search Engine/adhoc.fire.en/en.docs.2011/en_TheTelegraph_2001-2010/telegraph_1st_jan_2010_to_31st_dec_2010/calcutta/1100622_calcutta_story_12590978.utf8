The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Driver punches ex-MLA 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Driver punches ex-MLA 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An autorickshaw driver punched former Trinamul Congress MLA Paresh Pal in the face at Kankurgachhi crossing on Monday morning after the politicians car hit the three-wheeler.        
	The auto which was plying on the Kankurgachhi Ganesh Talkies route made a sharp turn to pick a passenger when the car hit it from behind around 8.15am. The auto driver started abusing the other driver. When Pal came out of his jeep and tried to separate the two, the auto driver punched him in the face, said local shop owner Tarun Dutta.        
	Pal, who fell on the ground, was taken to a nursing home, where he was treated for a swollen chin.        
	The auto driver probably did not recognise me. He was too hot tempered to even listen to me and attacked me suddenly. I have no personal grudge against the driver but such unruly behaviour is not expected of him, especially since he ferries ordinary people, said Pal later.        
	After the incident, Trinamul supporters rushed to the spot, beat up the 29-year-old auto driver, Avijit Dutta, and smashed his vehicle before taking him to Phoolbagan police station.        
	Pal lodged a written complaint with police against Dutta, who was arrested and charged with physical assault.        
	Auto drivers on this route are extremely unruly. They abuse us for not having change. Also, they drive rashly and make sudden u-turns to pick up passengers without the least regard for traffic rules. They hardly pay heed if we object, said Sangita Basu, a Kankurgachhi resident who commutes by auto.

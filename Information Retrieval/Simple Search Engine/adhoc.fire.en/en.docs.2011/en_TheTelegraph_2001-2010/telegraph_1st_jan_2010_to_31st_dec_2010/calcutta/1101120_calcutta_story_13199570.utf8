The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hard truth of soft touch
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hard truth of soft touch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Jadavpur University on Friday scrapped the meeting of its executive council, citing lack of academic environment on the campus, amid talk of how a history of soft-pedalling on disciplinary issues was to blame for things coming to such a pass.        
	A senior faculty member told Metro that the cancellation of the meeting of the highest policy-making body of the university, because of an examination boycott call, was unprecedented in the 55-year history of Jadavpur University.        
	The council meeting will be of no use if normal academic atmosphere does not prevail on the campus, said Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher and EC member.        
	Almost all the 30-odd members of the council requested registrar P.K. Ghosh and vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh to postpone the meeting where a series of important issues were to be discussed.        
	The authorities have not acted firmly when students have repeatedly disrupted normal academic activity, said a retired JU official.        
	The university had set a precedent by bowing to student pressure and arranging for re-exams in 2005 after a boycott to protest the suspension of five students. The suspension order had been issued for assaulting some senior officials and two lady teachers. They had also attempted to set a taxi  carrying one of the two lady teachers  on fire.        
	Ever since, the Jadavpur campus has erupted whenever the authorities have tried to take action against students found guilty of violation of university norms. (See box.) Had the authorities taken a tough stand then, the students would not have dared disrupt classes at the drop of a hat, said a senior teacher.        
	Registrar Ghosh had taken a stand on Friday that the exam schedule would remain unchanged and students boycotting the exams would be marked absent.        
	Though the students claim that the exam boycott is to protest police atrocity on the campus, it is clear that the main purpose is to get the exams postponed, said Goutam Gupta, an EC member.        
	This alarming trend of student disruption with or without a cause has stumped faculty members. We need to explore why this is happening even though some of the best young talent comes to study here, said a veteran teacher.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Insects driven out
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Insects driven out
                              A work by Jayashree Chakravarty                            
	The exhibition at Gallery Sanskriti titled Nature Revisited gains contemporary relevance as the works are informed by an awareness of how under extreme stress nature is striking back at us. The works that make oblique references to nature are the most intriguing.         
	Manisha Parekhs tightly-wound forms made of jute with armatures constructed of the same material have a Gandhian orientation. But even without their message against exploitation of nature for commercial gains, they will attract viewers, alluding as they do to animal and vegetal forms, without actually making a statement.        
	Viewers will be mystified by the serpentine forms created with steel wool by Adip Dutta. As with the giant loofah-like (or is it a mridanga?) form hanging from the ceiling that Dutta created with copper wires, viewers will be intensely aware of the unconventional materials with which both the pieces were cleverly crafted. No less captivating are the large graphite drawings of Debnath Basu that play on the form of trees and Tapas Biswass sculpture in brass and bronze. Art and nature become virtually indistinguishable in Anjum Singhs slick aluminium sculpture of a spring-time tree and Jagannath Pandas painting of the beleaguered wildlife on the outskirts of Delhi being driven out of their natural habitat by that demon called development. Rajan Krishnans foliage could be straight from the assembly line, fuelling the art versus nature debate.         
	K.S. Radhakrishna is known for his over-exuberant nudes. The piece he has created for this show is something else. Tiny conjoined human beings rise to a crest as if the river of life were in spate. From afar, the piece could easily be mistaken for a bramble bush. Its ambiguity should arouse viewer interest. On the hand, Mithu Sens paintings though pretty are too close to illustrations to ensnare our eyes. Nantu Behari Dass giant seed/genital is disappointing. He can do better.        
	Changes in our environment brought about by rapid urbanisation have been Jayashree Chakravartys concern for some time now. Here it finds expression in all its intricacy and richness. A plague of insects with gem-like wings and carapaces invades the gallery as their nest explodes.         
	Chakravarty uses multilayered paper and jute, fluorescent pigments and glass beads to create these beetles, bugs and scarabs driven out of their nests by man. This exhibition jointly curated by Chakravarty and Anirudh Chari is one of the most satisfying shows to be held in this city in a long time. The catalogue is well produced. If only the text did not try so hard to sound learned!                    SOUMITRA DAS

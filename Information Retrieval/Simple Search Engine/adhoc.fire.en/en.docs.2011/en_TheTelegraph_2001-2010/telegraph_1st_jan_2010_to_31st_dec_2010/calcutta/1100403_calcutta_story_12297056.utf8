The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flight returns twice
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Flight returns twice
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Calcutta-Agartala flight returned to the city twice on Friday following snags mid-air.        
	The Air India flight, with 90 on board, was finally cancelled. Passengers complained of shoddy treatment by the airline.        
	The plane, an Airbus 320, had taken off around 10am. After half an hour, the pilot announced that there was a technical problem and so the flight would have to return to Calcutta, said Timothy Roger Peck, a passenger who works for a tea garden in Tripura.         
	After the flight returned to the city around 11.15am, there was no airline staff to guide us to the arrival lounge. Nobody offered us even a drop of water, alleged Peck.        
	Air India officials said the flight had to return because of a snag in the air-conditioning system.         
	After repairs, the plane took off again around 1.15pm. However, after flying for 20 minutes, the pilot announced that there was a problem with the left engine and we have to return again, said Peck.        
	The flight landed around 2pm and the passengers were asked to disembark. We refused to do so since there was no one in the lounge to assist us. Most of us had not eaten anything till then, said Peck.        
	Later, the airline provided snacks to the passengers in the lounge.         
	Air India officials said they had arranged for an Airbus 319 to take the passengers to Agartala but the plan failed. A member of the A319 crew could not fly because of the flight duty time limitation (FDTL), said an Air India spokesperson.        
	The flight was cancelled and 26 passengers were accommodated in the 5.10pm flight to Agartala. Some other passengers were accommodated in flights operated by private airlines. The rest would have to travel tomorrow, said the spokesperson.

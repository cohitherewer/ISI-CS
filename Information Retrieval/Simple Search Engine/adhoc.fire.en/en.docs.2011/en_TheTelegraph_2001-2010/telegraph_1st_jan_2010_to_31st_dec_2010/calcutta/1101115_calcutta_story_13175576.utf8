                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Diabetes concern for kids
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Sourav Ganguly and Rituparna Sengupta (below) joined two walks on Sunday to spread awareness about diabetes. (Aranya Sen)                                 
	Five-year-old Raja Mondal was diagnosed with diabetes in August after he started feeling fatigued after minimal physical activity.        
	Arnab Ghosh, 13, was diagnosed with the disease when he was three and has been on insulin support since.         
	On World Diabetes Day on Sunday, doctors expressed concern over the rise in the incidence of diabetes among children and adolescents in the city.        
	The type of the disease afflicting the young seems to be undergoing a change. Earlier, most of the diabetic children suffered from the Type I variety, caused by the bodys failure to produce insulin.        
	But now, an increasing number of children are being diagnosed with Type II diabetes, which results from the failure of the cells to use insulin properly.        
	Even 10 years back, the average lower age group for diabetes was 40. Now, it has come down to 15. Change in lifestyle, lack of physical exercise and stress are responsible for this, said Sudip Chatterjee, city-based endocrinologist and secretary, Park Clinic.        
	Diabetes-related complications affect the heart, kidneys and other vital organs. The complications are determined by the level of blood sugar and the duration of the disease. Less the age, the more vulnerable is the patient to the risk of complications, said Subhankar Chowdhury, the head of SSKMs endocrinology department and vice-president of the state chapter of the Diabetic Association of India.

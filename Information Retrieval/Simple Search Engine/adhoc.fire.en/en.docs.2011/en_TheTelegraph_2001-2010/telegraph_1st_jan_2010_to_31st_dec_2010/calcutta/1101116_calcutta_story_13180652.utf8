          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A death row convicts lawyer on Monday visited the Camac Street flat where Kevalram Rai had allegedly killed his former employers.        
	In a rare order, the high court had on Friday allowed defence counsel to visit the flat before making his submission for Rai.        
	Rai was sentenced to death by a sessions judge two years ago for killing Tara Chand Banka, 68, and his wife Sarda, 65.        
	While moving an appeal against the order, Rais lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee had pleaded with the division bench headed by Chief Justice J.N. Patel that he wanted to visit the murder spot before making his submission.        
	I have several queries. I pray before the court to allow me to visit the spot where the murders took place. It will help me fight the case better, Chatterjee had said.        
	The bench allowed the prayer.        
	On April 18, 2005, residents of the multi-storeyed Manas Sarovar had found the main door of the Bankas seventh-floor flat broken. Stepping in, they found Tara Chands body on a divan in the drawing room and Sardas body in a bedroom.        
	Rai, who was the Bankas domestic help till he quit his job a few weeks before the murder, was picked up two months later from his home in Bihar.        
	In November 2008, the additional sessions judge of the city sessions court found Rai guilty of the twin murders and sentenced him to death.

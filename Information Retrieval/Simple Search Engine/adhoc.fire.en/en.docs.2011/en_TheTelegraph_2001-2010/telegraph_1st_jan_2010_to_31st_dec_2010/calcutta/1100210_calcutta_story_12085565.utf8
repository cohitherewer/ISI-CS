          A STAFF REPORTER                           The post office in Sonarpur outside which the robbery took place on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The South 24-Parganas police chief has ordered a probe into the role of cops during Mondays robbery of Rs 39 lakh outside Sonarpur post office, barely 30m from a police station and police barracks.        
	It is a matter of concern and shame for the entire force that criminals had the guts to fire eight rounds injuring two men and flee with Rs 39 lakh from a spot so close to a police station, said L.N. Meena, the superintendent of the district police.        
	Residents complained that cops had remained inside the police station even after hearing the gunshots, which allowed the four robbers to flee with the loot on two motorcycles.        
	Officers of Sonarpur police station, which has close to 100 on its rolls, claimed that they had not heard any gunshot and had learnt about the firing from residents.         
	Postmaster Brindachal Ram and home guard Sujit Halder, who sustained bullet injuries, are stable, said doctors.        
	Investigators questioned the two and prepared sketches of the robbers on the basis of their descriptions. Bullets had flown past a Group D employee who was helping the two carry money from the police station to the post office.         
	We have distributed the sketches to nearby police stations. We have also found out the registration number of one of the motorcycles, said a senior district police officer.        
	Meena said the cops were investigating whether the same gang was behind the robbery at a Patuli petrol pump last month in which an 18-year-old employee suffered a bullet injury.        
	The post office was open on Tuesday but some of the stores around it were closed. Three armed policemen stood guard outside the post office.        
	Employees were afraid to go to Sonarpur post office on Tuesday. Employees in other post offices have also complained about the lack of security. We have asked the police for more guards, said Ashoke Kole, the divisional superintendent (South Presidency) of the postal department.

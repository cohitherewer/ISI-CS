          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A weeklong torture on 14-year-old Hyder Ali came to an end on Thursday with the arrest of his uncle Abbas Khan, who had allegedly kept him locked in a room, beaten him up and assaulted him with a hot iron rod following a theft in his house.        
	The boy was rescued on Thursday morning by the Khans neighbours at Ballys Bhootbagan after his father raised an alarm.        
	Ali had burn marks all over his body when he was wheeled into TL Jaiswal Hospital in Howrah. Police said Abbas had also sprinkled chilli powder and salt on the boys wounds and kept him gagged all the time.        
	Ali lived with his parents in a Bihar village till he shifted to his uncles house three months ago.        
	Six days ago, Rs 1 lakh allegedly went missing from the Bhootbagan house.        
	Abbas called Alis father Amirullah Khan, a farmer, on Wednesday and asked him to bring Rs 1 lakh the next day if he wished to see his son alive. When he reached Abbass house on Thursday, he was led into a room where his son, burn marks all over him, was tied to a beam. The father lost consciousness at the sight but when he came around he raised an alarm and alerted neighbours, police said.        
	Abbas Khan has been arrested on the basis of a complaint by the boys father, said an officer of Bally police station. Ali had come to live in his uncles house because his father could not feed his three children.

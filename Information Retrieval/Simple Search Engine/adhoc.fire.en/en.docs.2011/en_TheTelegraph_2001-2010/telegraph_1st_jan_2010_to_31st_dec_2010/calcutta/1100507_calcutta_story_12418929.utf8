The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Double scoop of sporty delight   Sporty double bill
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Double scoop of sporty delight     - Inter-club sports carnival reaches climax, countdown to soccer cup for corporates is on          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR AND SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY                          The countdown to The Telegraph Cup Football 2010 for Corporates at CC amp;FC has begun. (Rashbehari Das)                                                 
	The IPL is done with, the T20 World Cup is yet to pick up pace and World Cup soccer is still five weeks away. Then how come so many sports-crazy Calcuttans are wearing a smile?        
	The happy cause can be traced to twin club addresses: Saturday Clubs 35th Inter Club Sports Carnival, in association with The Telegraph, reaches its climax this weekend and The Telegraph Cup Football 2010 for Corporates is gearing up for kick-off at the CC amp;FC.        
	There is a mini-Olympic feel to Saturday Club, the entrance aflutter with flags of 10 clubs  RCGC, CC amp;FC, Tollygunge Club, Calcutta Club, Bengal Rowing Club, Calcutta Swimming Club, Dalhousie Institute, Ordnance Club, Calcutta Punjab Club and The Saturday Club. Around 2,500 people attended the opening night on May 1. The response has been tremendous and this year weve tried to bring in a new dimension with the renovated squash courts, said Utpal Singh Roy, president of the host club.        
	Six other games were lined up during the 10-day inter-club carnival  tennis, swimming, badminton, snooker, bridge and table tennis.        
	Swimming has the maximum number of participants. But for Rishi Tandon, 15, squash is the chosen sport.         
	The crowd is good, the whole club is bustling with activity, its my favourite time of the year, said the squash champ.        
	Things were very different when the carnival started 35 years ago. It was then about people who had not left the city during their summer vacations and had nothing else to do. But soon the tournament became so competitive that we had to host it before they left for their summer holidays, said Ranjani Sikri, the clubs convener of entertainment.                    
	Now, things get competitive from months before the carnivals opening day. Since a lot of members are common, each club wants to grab the best players, says Singh Roy.        
	Competition apart there is a lot of camaraderie as the games are all interspersed with fun events like beer-drinking (only for the men), basket the ball, hoopla hoop, arm wrestling, tug of war and Simon Says. Glamour comes into the game for the finale on May 9, with the Carnival Queen and Princess in the spotlight.        
	If the spotlight at Saturday Club is on a medley of racquets and strokes, the focus is entirely on the ball at CC amp;FC where the McDowells No.1 Celebration presents The Telegraph Cup Football 2010 for Corporates kicks off on May 15.                    Saturday Club rsquo;s Sports Carnival, in association with The Telegraph, makes a splash. (Rashbehari Das)    
	This is for middle-aged executive who do not really have the scope to play the game he loves and with people of similar age group and background, said P.S. Rawat, the sports co-ordinator at CC amp;FC on the sidelines of the Captains Meet.        
	The 36-year-old league-cum-knockout tourney has in the past five-six years seen a rapid dip in the age graph of players. But this year only 25-plus executives can turn up for the tourney.        
	Last year, there were 56 teams competing and this year the number of entries is 56 and counting. Off the field, expect fashion shows and music performances. We intend to give value-for-money entertainment, said Rawat, promising a return to fun.        
	And the ultimate takeaway from the tournament? It will serve as the perfect curtain raiser for the World Cup beginning in South Africa on June 11. This will really get the football lovers into the mood, said Abhishek Deb, who has won multiple Player of the Tournament awards down the years.

          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation plans to deploy civic cops to keep drains clear and prevent waterlogging this monsoon.         
	Mayoral council member (drainage and sewerage) Rajib Deb directed the departments chief engineer Amit Kumar Roy to deploy civic police personnel to man gully pits and key manholes. Currently, waterlogging is inevitable after a spell of heavy rain but civic employees can help matters by keeping gully pits clean and opening 56 strategic manholes in time, said Deb.        
	The 56 manholes are located in 20 city pockets, including Thanthania, Camac Street, Free School Street and Deshapriya Park.         
	Police deploy civic cops for traffic control, pointed out Deb, but the CMC pays the forces annual salary bill of over Rs 2 crore.         
	Power woes: Metropolitan Building on Chowringhee has been without power since 8.30am on Sunday, reportedly following a transformer fault that could not be fixed till Tuesday night. All the offices inside and on the ground floor were shuttered on Tuesday. Big Bazaar, which occupies the ground and first floors, installed an extra generator to keep things going.         
	According to a tenant who lives on the third floor, water has been unavailable for the past three days and the lift is not working. Another tenant said the contractor trying to repair the fault failed to do so because a part is unavailable.         
	Arrow-hit MP: Bhutan MP Ugyen Tenzin, 42, who was operated on in a city hospital on Monday evening after an arrow pierced his head while he was taking part in an archery competition in Thimpu, regained consciousness and was able to speak on Tuesday. The arrow did not damage any of the important arteries in his brain. But it bruised the left optic nerve, causing loss of vision in the left eye, said L.N. Tripathy, the head of the neurosurgery department of the hospital.         
	Acid attack: Jasmeena Begum, 40, and her 17-year-old daughter Tania were admitted to hospital on Tuesday after Jasmeenas husband Taiyab Ali allegedly poured acid on them while they were sleeping in their Uluberia home. Police said Ali, who had an extramarital affair, was absconding.        
	Metro suicide: A 28-year-old unidentified youth committed suicide by jumping in front of a Kavi Nazrul-bound Metro Railway train at Mahanayak Uttam Kumar station on Tuesday evening. Services were disrupted from 7.40pm to 8.10pm between Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Kavi Nazrul stations.        
	Suicide bid: Three members of a family tried to commit suicide by consuming sleeping pills in a guesthouse near Santoshpur late on Monday. The three  father, mother and daughter  have been admitted to Peerless Hospital. The girl is to be married soon.

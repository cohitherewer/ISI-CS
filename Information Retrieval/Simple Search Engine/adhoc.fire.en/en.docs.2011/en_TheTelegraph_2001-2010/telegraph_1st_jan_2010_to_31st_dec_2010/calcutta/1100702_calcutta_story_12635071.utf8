The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea to HS council
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Plea to HS council
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday requested the Higher Secondary council president to review as soon as possible the physics and mathematics papers of a student who passed the exam this year.        
	Justice Dipankar Dutta also ruled that if the scripts could not be reviewed by July 3, the day the petitioner is to appear for the state joint entrance counselling, the council head will have to produce them in court on July 5.        
	The order followed a petition by Moinak Kar, who appeared in the HS from a Barasat school and scored 149 out of 300 in the science group comprising physics, chemistry and mathematics.         
	His rank in the JEE (engineering) merit list is 2683.        
	According to JEE rules, a student cannot attend counselling if he scores less than 150 in the science group in the school-leaving exam. Since Moinak has scored one mark less than the cut-off, he had applied for a review of physics and maths papers and requested the council secretary to do the needful by July 3. But the council is yet to review the papers, said the students lawyer, Debabrata Mukherjee.

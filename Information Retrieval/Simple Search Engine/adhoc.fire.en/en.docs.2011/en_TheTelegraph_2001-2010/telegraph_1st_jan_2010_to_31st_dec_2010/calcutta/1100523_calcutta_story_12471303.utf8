The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Spell-check in poll time
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Spell-check in poll time
                              The website of the Trinamul Congress                           
	If the Left Front and the Trinamul Congress are crossing swords over whether the city should become London or stay Calcutta, there is one place which they treat alike. The websites of both sides need a spell-check, especially one which can sift through proper nouns.         
	The Trinamul site www.allindiatrinamulcongress.org lists out its MPs. Mamata Banerjee, Saugata Roy, C.M. Jatua, Dinesh Trivedi, Sisir Adhikari, Sultan Ahmed  they are all Honarable ministers.        
	They have escaped with their names intact. Some of their colleagues are not so lucky. On the page for office-bearers, Sudip Bandhopadhya is named vice-president. Is he the same as Sudip Bandopadhyay who is listed as the MP for Calcutta North? Will Derek OBrien ever know if Shri. DereK Oberayan, another party vice-president, is a shadow of his own self?         
	The site has taken care to project the party chairperson as one with interests beyond politics. Her creativity has a separate corner. On a page with her poetic compositions in both English and Bengali, one is drawn to an intriguing title: Torn paper and solid paper. But on opening the hyperlink, the title on the actual page turns out to be Sack of torn and soiled paper.         
	Unlike Mamatazone, www.leftfrontwb.in has a lot of interactivity, allowing visitors to write in, run a commentary on events and even run into squabbles.         
	There are some funny exchanges. Someones note on Marxism is dismissed by another viewer as irrelevant before the civic polls. This provokes an outburst from the first writer: Your comment proves typical shortsighted CPM leadership can not look beyond 5 yeards.         
	To this, a third viewer chuckles: Yeards, absolutely!         
	Plan man                   The website of the Trinamul Congress and (right) a still from Satyajit Ray rsquo;s Ghare Baire       
	A year back, on May 25, 2009, cyclone Aila had blown past Calcutta, smashing to smithereens the city minders claims of disaster preparedness. Today, cyclone Laila is hovering in the vicinity. After witnessing the devastation that Aila wreaked, journalist Utpal Chatterjee says he kept thinking of steps for better emergency preparedness. When he became sheriff in January this year, he was determined to do something for the city.         
	Cleaning and greening Calcutta are Chatterjees top priorities. A handful of Calcutta lovers or green activists cannot change the citythe change has to come from the citizens, stresses Calcuttas 251st sheriff.         
	His pet themes  proper garbage disposal at the household level, putting up no honking posters, introduction of hi-tech gadgets for traffic signals, planting smaller trees in barren areas, and, of course, emergency preparedness. All the best.        
	Ray remake                  A still from Satyajit Ray rsquo;s Ghare Baire       
	For a self-taught director/ scriptwriter/producer to try and better Ray with her very first film is well, cheeky. In the age of remakes this is just my interpretation of Rabindranath Tagores Ghare-Baire, says Reema Mukherjee, 34, in Calcutta, awaiting verdict on her debut film Ardhangini ek ardhsatya.         
	The film in Hindi timed for the 150th birth anniversary of Tagore will be screened at festivals in New York and Beijing before hitting cinemas at home later this year.         
	What about the Ray version? Ray belonged to a generation that felt itself bound to the original text, I feel I have the right to give my reading, says Reema.        
	The cast includes Reema Lagoo, Sreelekha Mitra, Subodh Bhave, Subrat Dutt and Manoj Mitra. The film was shot in Mumbai and Gujarat.                   Calcutta girl Bharati Ghosh has made the city proud. Part of the UN peace-keeping missions, the spunky cop has worked in Kosovo, Chad, Somalia and is currently posted in Haiti and Nairobi                     
	Sudeshna Banerjee and Sebanti Sarkar

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Health insurance for poor families
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Mamata Banerjee on Monday flagged off a scheme to distribute medical insurance policies to 1.84 lakh Calcutta families living below poverty line (BPL).         
	The scheme is a joint venture of the civic authorities and the Centre. Up to seven members of each family will be covered by the National Insurance Corporation policy.        
	The families will get maternity, accident and disability benefits. The total annual disbursement of benefits per family will be not more than Rs 30,000.         
	The total annual premium for the scheme will be Rs 9 crore a year. The CMC will pay Rs 3 crore and the Centre Rs 6 crore. There are 26 parameters to ascertain whether a family is below poverty line.        
	Like subsidised monthly train tickets of Rs 25 for BPL families, the health insurance scheme is also a way of restoring the prestige of the poor, said Mamata Banerjee. National Insurance director Kuldip Singh attended the launch.

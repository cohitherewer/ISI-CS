The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | MAPPING THE MULTIPLEX MINDSCAPE
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      MAPPING THE MULTIPLEX MINDSCAPE
          
	Today, a metro is known by its multiplexes. And a multiplex is known by the audience it attracts. Calcutta got its first plex, INOX Forum, in 2003. Over the past seven years, the Calcutta movie-going audience has got eight more plexes, dotting the length and breadth of the city, each with its own audience base. Over a period of time, every multiplex develops its core audience. The kind of films being shown and the slots in which they are played are invariably determined by the viewer. The audience is king, says a Mumbai-based industry expert.        
	So if the upwardly mobile non-Bengali businessman and the upper-class Bangali bhadralok at INOX Forum ensure that a Jeet or Koel Mullick starrer rarely finds a place in its programming roster, then Tollywood potboilers are the pop picks at the plex chains Rajarhat property, determined by the crowd trooping in from Barasat, Madhyamgram and the adjoining suburbs. Catering to its Bengali hinterland, Fame Hiland Park, too, does well screening commercial Tolly fare. The Bengali crowd count at Salt Lake is the reason for the Aparna Sens and Rituparno Ghoshs claiming a sizeable number of shows at City Centre, much more than at Forum. Moving away from the standard Holly-Bolly-Tolly mix is Fame South City on Prince Anwar Shah, which has recently commenced regular screenings of Tamil and Telugu films for the Lake Market audience. Big Cinemas in Salt Lake hardly has a show scheduled post 10pm because its core audience of Sector V techies is at work then and no one else would bother making a trip there so late. And the newly opened Bioscope at Rajarhat has tickets for most films priced at Rs 75 to lure the middle-class Bengali crowd in the area. Metro provides a multiplex map of a growing city on the basis of inputs from those who run the show.

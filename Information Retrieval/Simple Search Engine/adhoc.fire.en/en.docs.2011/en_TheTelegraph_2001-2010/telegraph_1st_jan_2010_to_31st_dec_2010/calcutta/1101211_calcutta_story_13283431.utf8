The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bias cry in doc recruitment
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bias cry in doc recruitment
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A doctors association has alleged favouritism in recruitment of doctors by the state health department, which had issued an advertisement giving candidates only two working days to apply and thus allegedly ruining the chance of several aspirants in other cities.        
	The department, however, denied the charge.        
	On November 26, an advertisement had been published for 163 posts of demonstrators/clinical tutors and 46 posts of assistant professors. The deadline for the submission of applications was November 30.        
	November 27 and 28 were Saturday and Sunday.        
	The health department made the situation worse by stating that the applications had to be deposited at Swastha Bhavan, in Salt Lake, in person or sent by post. There was no option for submitting them online.        
	The advertisement was issued too late for candidates in various parts of the country to respond. Only those with inside knowledge were the most likely ones to apply. This was done with a motive, alleged Nemai Nath, the president of the Progressive Service Doctors Association.        
	U.K. Bhadra, the executive vice-president of PSDA, alleged that many deserving candidates had been denied a chance. A number of doctors in the districts and outside the state had wanted to apply, but could not because of lack of time.        
	The association has complained about the alleged favouritism in a letter to the director of medical education, S.N. Banerjee. When contacted by Metro, Banerjee said: There was no inconvenience for anybody. All procedures were followed.        
	Sourav Dutta, an ENT surgeon at Mumbais Tata Memorial Centre, said: I wanted to work in a state-run hospital in Bengal. But the formalities required for sending the application, like getting a clearance from the departmental head, could not be completed in working days.        
	Syed Monajatur Rahman, a gynaecologist at AIIMS, faced a similar problem. Had the authorities allowed online submission of forms, I would have tried.

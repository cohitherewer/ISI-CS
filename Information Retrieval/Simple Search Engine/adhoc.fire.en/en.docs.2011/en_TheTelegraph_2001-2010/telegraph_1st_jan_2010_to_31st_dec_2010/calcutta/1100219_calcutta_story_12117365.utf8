The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Principals vote for parallel polls 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Principals vote for parallel polls 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state higher education council is considering a proposal to hold students union elections in all colleges in a two-week window every year to prevent campus violence.        
	The elections are currently held between November and January in most colleges. Principals have proposed that the polls be held between September 30 and October 15.        
	Colleges should not be allowed to hold elections in a staggered manner because that allows a group of student leaders  mostly former students and belonging to both camps  to create trouble on several campuses. The mobility of the group could be checked if the elections are held within a short span of time, said Gyanankur Goswami, an executive committee member of the All Bengal Principals Council.        
	The proposal was recently placed at the meeting of the higher education council for discussion.        
	Heads of colleges have suggested certain steps for maintaining peace during students elections. The steps include holding the polls in a short span of time every year and enforcing a uniform set of rules. We will take a final call after discussing the suggestions with the vice-chancellors of the affiliating universities, said Subimal Sen, the chairman of the council.        
	The state higher education department had sent a circular to the principals in October, asking them to explore ways to conduct the polls peacefully. The government had urged the college heads to explore the option of holding the elections on the same day.        
	The All Bengal Principals Council suggested a string of measures to the higher education council in which it stressed the need to hold the elections before Puja.         
	The college heads feel students will gain if the elections are held in September-October. Since students remain busy with elections in November and December, they do not concentrate on studies. They will get more time to study if the polls are held in September-October, said the principal of a south Calcutta college.         
	Early polls will also make it easier for colleges to conduct the first round of class tests, usually scheduled at the beginning of December.        
	First-year admissions start in July and are over by September. If the polls are held before the Puja vacation, there will be fewer distractions for students once they return to college, he added.

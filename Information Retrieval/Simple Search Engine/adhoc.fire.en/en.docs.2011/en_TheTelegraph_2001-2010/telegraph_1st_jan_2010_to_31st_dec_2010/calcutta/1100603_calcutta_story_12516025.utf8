The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Day of tea, snacks and trend-spotting
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Day of tea, snacks and trend-spotting
  - The semi-final battle for Bengal as seen from the Alipore control room          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          Riddhi Banerjee (right), district election officer for Calcutta, in the Alipore control room on Wednesday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                        
	Returning officer Khalil Ahmed and his control room colleagues headed for the South 24-Parganas district magistrates office in Alipore early on Monday, ready for the concluding phase of Bengals semi-final battle.        
	The control room, on the ground floor of the 10-storeyed beige-and-brown New Administrative Building, was up and running an hour before the counting began at 8am.        
	We were all here by 7am. Despite all the hard work for nearly a month now, we couldnt let fatigue set in on such a crucial day, said a junior official from the district election office.        
	Frankly, all of us were keen on knowing the results as soon as possible. Some were too tense. This was, after all, the semi-final battle for Bengal, he told Metro.        
	The 60ftx15ft control room, cooled by six air-conditioners, was abuzz with around 30 officials armed with laptops coordinating with the 15 counting centres for the 141 wards of the city. Tea and snacks were served at regular intervals from an adjoining pantry.        
	From coordination to recording and analysing data to uploading it on the state election commissions website (www.wbsec.gov.in), weve been doing everything from here. This is the nodal centre for all 15 counting centres, said Riddhi Banerjee, a district election officer for Calcutta.        
	Ahmed kept dropping in to supervise the proceedings. Nothing went wrong. The entire team has done very well, said Ahmed.        
	The trends  it was apparent by 9.30 how the civic headquarters on SN Banerjee Road would look like for the next five years  triggered talk on the winds of change and how it may sway the outcome of next years Assembly polls.        
	The much-talked-about winds of change seem more real than many had thought. Even the exit polls couldnt predict such a thumping victory for Trinamul. Im sure even Didi didnt expect such a performance, an official told a colleague over tea.        
	It was only after the clock struck three that the control room officials could afford a sigh of relief, having received and processed the last of the results. A few more hours today and a little bit over the next few days. Then we can safely call it a day till the Assembly polls, smiled an official as he took his first smoke break of the day at 3.15pm.

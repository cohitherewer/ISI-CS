The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC slow in food check
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CMC slow in food check
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The number of food samples tested by the civic body has decreased sharply in the past few years, allowing unscrupulous traders to use harmful chemicals in dishes.         
	Till 2000, when only doctors could be food inspectors, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) used to inspect about 2,000 samples annually and file cases against the owners of about 40 eateries for not meeting the standard. For the past few years, civic inspectors have been testing 120 samples on an average each year and filing about a couple of cases.         
	The number of samples coming for analysis to the food laboratory has gone down drastically because several civic food inspectors are hand in glove with adulterators. The traders pay the corrupt inspectors every month, said a senior official of the health department.        
	The absence of checks has raised concerns about the quality of the food being sold in the city. According to chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay, samples of fish fries and rolls collected from four upmarket eateries recently failed the test because biscuits that were ground and used in the preparations contained carcinogenic colours. Harmful colours are rampantly used in cheap sauces and mango fish (Topsey), he added.        
	Biryani, tandoori dishes, biscuits, spices and sauces contain the most contaminants. Ghee (clarified butter) and vanaspati, too, contain harmful ingredients, said an employee of the food laboratory.        
	Civic sources blamed the lacunae in the testing process on the lowering of the qualification for inspectors to graduation in science by the earlier Trinamul Congress board and its subsequent implementation by the current Left board.        
	The non-doctor inspectors are neither adequately trained nor do they have any understanding of food poisoning, said Subrata Bose, a former superintendent of the civic food laboratory.

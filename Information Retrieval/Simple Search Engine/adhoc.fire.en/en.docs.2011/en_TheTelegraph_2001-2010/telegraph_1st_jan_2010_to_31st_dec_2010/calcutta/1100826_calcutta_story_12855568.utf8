                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bomb hoax to avenge insult
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth who was denied entry to an interview at Technopolis in Rajarhat allegedly took revenge by making a hoax call on Wednesday morning and saying that a bomb would soon explode in the building. The call was traced to Dankuni in Hooghly and Somnath Dhally, 28, the alleged caller, was arrested in the afternoon.        
	By the time the bomb squad declared the building safe, 4,000-odd employees had been evacuated and several offices in the building had declared a holiday.         
	Dhally was not allowed to enter when he came on Monday for a walk-in interview. To avenge this, he made the call, said an officer of Sector V police station.        
	The call came to a BPO unit, Firstsource, around 9.15am. The guard at the reception was told the building would be blown up in 10 minutes, said a company official.        
	Many employees thought the building was on fire. Only when we came down did we realise it was a bomb alert, said Shantanu Mitra, an employee of software firm Castle Rock.        
	Doctor absolved: The high court on Wednesday quashed proceedings against surgeon Shankar Sarkar accused of negligence in a sex-change operation, saying it was not his fault if the patient did not respond to treatment. Sarkar had operated on a 19-year-old boy from Beniapukur in 1991. Four years later, he lodged a complaint against Sarkar.        
	Driver sentence: A fast-track court sentenced truck driver Suresh Yadav to rigorous imprisonment for eight years and fined him Rs 15,000 on Wednesday. Yadav was convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder for mowing down five persons three years ago.        
	Illegal construction: Bidhannagar Municipality razed illegal portions of a Bhikharam Chandmal outlet near Salt Lake City Centre on Wednesday night.        
	Dupe arrest: Brajadulal Bandopadhyay, 59, an inspector with the bureau of applied economics and statistics of the state government, was arrested on Tuesday night for allegedly duping a man of Rs 8.27 lakh.

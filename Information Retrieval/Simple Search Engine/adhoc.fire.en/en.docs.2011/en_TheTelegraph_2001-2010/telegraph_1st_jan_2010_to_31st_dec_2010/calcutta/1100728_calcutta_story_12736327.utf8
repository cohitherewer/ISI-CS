The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Adult liver transplant a success
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Adult liver transplant a success
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Bhutanese who underwent the first adult liver transplant in eastern India three weeks ago was released from a private hospital in the city on Tuesday.        
	Norjay Tshering, 47, a manager at a cement company in Bhutan, had been suffering from a liver disease that caused fluid accumulation in the stomach. His condition worsened recently, prompting doctors at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals to advise him to undergo a liver transplant.        
	Norjays wife Evalin, 45, donated part of her liver, which was implanted in him on July 7. I am feeling better now. I can walk and eat, Norjay said before being released from the hospital. Doctors said he could return to normal life. Evalin was released 10 days ago.         
	The normal life expectancy of a liver transplant patient is five to 10 years, said Mahesh Goenka, a gastroenterologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. Goenka was part of the team led by transplant surgeon Subhas Gupta from Apollo Hospital, Delhi, that conducted the transplant.

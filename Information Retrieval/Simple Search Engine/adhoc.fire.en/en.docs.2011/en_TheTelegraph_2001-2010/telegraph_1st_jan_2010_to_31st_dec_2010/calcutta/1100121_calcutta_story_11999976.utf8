The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | His route to Writers unchanged
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      His route to Writers unchanged
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                                
	The man who piloted Bengal   unchanged for 23 years wouldnt let his convoy pilot change   his daily route for a day even if   his security was at stake.   
	Aapni amar convoy route   change korben na. Jei dik   theke aami roj aashi otai shob   shomoy thakbe (Never change   the route of my convoy. The   route that I take every day is   the one that must always be   followed), Basu had cautioned Kaustav Chakraborty,   the convoy pilot during his   last eight years as chief minister, when he had taken a different route to Writers one day.  
	 The former sergeant, who   is now the officer-in-charge of   the Bhowanipore traffic   guard, remembered the   episode while he was at SSKM   Hospital on Tuesday to guide   the gun carriage bearing the   body of Mike Charlie 1    Calcutta polices code name for   Basu  to the entrance of the   anatomy department.  There was a flood of memories even as I was doing my   duty. Most of these were about   the no-nonsense manner in   which Jyotibabu functioned,   Chakraborty told Metro.																								   
	Appointed the pilot of   Basus convoy in September   1992, Chakraborty had barely   settled into the job when he   was asked by Lalbazar to   change the route for a day on   security grounds.  
	 It was December 6, 1992.   The city was tense over the   demolition of Babri Masjid.   Given the situation, we   changed the route. He was driv  en from Indira Bhavan to Writers through Beleghata Main   Road instead of EM Bypass   and Park Circus.    Basu didnt force his driver   to turn back but made sure his   convoy pilot knew at the end of   the day who was the boss.  
	 In the evening, he summoned me to the Alimuddin   Street party office and told me   that his convoy route must remain the same. He said he didnt want to send the wrong signal to citizens. Jyotibabus   route remained unchanged   till his last day in office, recalled Chakraborty.				   
	So was Basu always stern?   I witnessed his humility, too.   Be it a constable or a home   guard, he would always acknowledge a salute, unlike   most VIPs, Chakraborty said.  
	 He remained with Basus   convoy even after 2000, but   was withdrawn some months   later with a promotion. He remembers it as a bitter-sweet   moment. I cried that day. I   was with Jyotibabu for more   than eight years and felt emotionally attached to him.

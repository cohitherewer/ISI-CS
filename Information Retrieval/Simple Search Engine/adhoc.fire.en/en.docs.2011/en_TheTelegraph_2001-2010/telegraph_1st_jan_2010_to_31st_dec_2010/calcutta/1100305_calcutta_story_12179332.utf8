          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Sleuths probing the pay up-or be-abducted case interrogated Aftab Ansari at Alipore Central jail on Thursday to know more about the Asif Reza Commando Force (ARCF).        
	The interrogation of the man behind the American Center attack and abduction of Khadims owner Partha Pratim Roy Burman was followed by a separate round of grilling of co-convict Jamaluddin Naseer.        
	The ARCF is headed by Dubai-based Aameer Reza Khan, brother of Asif Reza who was killed in an encounter in Gujarat a few years ago. Cops suspect the extortion calls to the owners of four business houses in the city came from Aameer Reza, who was an associate of Ansari.        
	The authorities have decided to post guards outside Ansaris cell 24x7 to keep a tab on his every move.        
	The grilling of Ansari and Naseer, by officers of the Special Task Force and detective department, follows the discovery of a SIM card on one of jail inmates, Mohammed Shamim.        
	Abduction accused: Taxi driver Sanjay Pal, the key accused in the abduction of IT professional Sandipan Das, and his two aides  Amit Das and Manoj Bag  were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days on Thursday.         
	Suicide: Yash Kagrana, a Madhyamik examinee, was found hanging from the ceiling of his Burrabazar home on Thursday. He left behind three suicide notes in which he said he had been depressed because he could not write the papers well.         
	Tourism plan: The tourism department plans to beautify College Square, illuminate heritage buildings and set up an international jetty, minister Manabendra Mukherjee said on Thursday at a programme to lay the foundation stone for the beautification of Subhas Sarovar.

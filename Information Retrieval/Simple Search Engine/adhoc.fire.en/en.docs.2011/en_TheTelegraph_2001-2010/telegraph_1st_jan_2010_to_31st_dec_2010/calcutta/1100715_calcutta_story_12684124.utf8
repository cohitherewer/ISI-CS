The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxis to go off road today
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Taxis to go off road today
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two Left-backed taxi unions have called a 24-hour strike on Thursday to protest the state governments delay in deciding on a fare hike, which the operators have been demanding since the recent rise in fuel prices.        
	The unions said they would wait till July 30 for the government to state its stand before going on an indefinite strike.        
	We will observe a token strike on Thursday to protest the delay. The government has asked for another fortnight to consider the fare hike. If it extends the deadline, we will go on an indefinite strike, said Bimal Guha, of the Bengal Taxi Association, which has around 18,000 members.        
	The token strike is in protest against the governments delaying tactic. We cant stay in the business after the fuel price rise without a fare hike, said Tarak Nath Bari of the Calcutta Taxi Association, which has 14,000-odd members.        
	The Trinamul-affiliated Progressive Taximens Association, which has more than 10,000 members, will not join the strike. The strike will inconvenience commuters who are equally hurt by the rise in the prices of petroleum products. We dont want to make them suffer more, said association president Madan Mitra, a Trinamul MLA.        
	I have requested the other unions not to join the strike. It does not serve any purpose. But, at the end of the day, its their call, said Mitra.        
	Taxi operators had proposed a Rs 2x+6 formula, where x is the reading on a digital meter. Currently, the taxi fare is double the meter reading plus Rs 2.        
	There are 42,0000-odd taxis in and around the city, of which around 33,000 hit the street daily.

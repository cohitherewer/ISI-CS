The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State fish reduced to small fry   Kerala lesson for Bengal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      State fish reduced to small fry     Kerala lesson for Bengal
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          KERALA PEARL:   A karimeen dish				                                             
	One Left-ruled state is showing another how to put a fish of choice on every plate without fishing in troubled waters.        
	As Bengals favourite monsoon hilsa becomes lighter inside the shopping bag  and heavier on your pocket  Kerala is going all out to protect its pearl of the backwaters as well as make the fish more available and affordable.         
	The pearl spot, locally called karimeen, has just been declared Keralas state fish as part of a Rs 2.5-crore plan to scale up commercial farming of the species that sells between Rs 120 and Rs 180 a kg. Bengals higher-priced hilsa, on the other hand, is swimming towards extinction despite enjoying the status of state fish for three years.        
	 We dont find enough hilsa in Bengal to fulfil even 40 per cent of the demand. To make matters worse, little is being done to protect our state fish, rued Syed Anwar Maqsood, the secretary of the Fish Importers Association.        
	That leaves Bengal not only dependent on Bangladesh for more than half its requirement but also at the mercy of a government-controlled export mechanism that regulates supply and raises prices frequently.         
	A delegation of importers from Bengal was in Dhaka earlier this week to plead with the Bangladesh government to reduce export rates to reasonable levels. Bangladeshs high-handed attitude when it comes to supplying ilish is something we neednt have faced had the state government regulated fishing in Bengal waters, said a wholesaler.         
	Calcutta consumes more than 100 tonnes of hilsa every day between July and September, out of which Bangladesh supplies almost 70 tonnes. Orissa and Maharashtra provide another 20 tonne.        
	So how did a state where more than 90 per cent of the population eats fish become so hilsa-deficient? The fisheries department is inactive. The research team of the department has not done anything to find out why the catch is diminishing with every passing year, said importer Maqsood.                     
	The official reason for the declining quality and quantity of Bengal ilish is indiscriminate fishing with the bulk of the catch comprising fish weighing below 500gm. Sale of khoka ilish (small hilsa) was banned in 2006 but enforcement has been almost non-existent.        
	The only ilish that the common man can afford is the khoka (priced at Rs 250-300 a kg), and that fuels illegal fishing. It was decided that teams would raid the ghats and markets at regular intervals but nothing came of it, said an official in the department.         
	But fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda claimed that his department, which declared hilsa as the state fish only after a prod from Delhi, was vigilant. Our officials check the nets of fishermen at regular intervals. We also raid various wholesale markets, he said.        
	In Kerala, 2010-11 will be observed as the Year of the Karimeen to boost production, but Bengals fisheries department doesnt intend doing anything to brand its state fish because of excess workload.        
	We dont hold promotional campaigns or hilsa festivals. A lot of hotels and other organisations do it but my department cannot do so because of its workload, said minister Nanda.

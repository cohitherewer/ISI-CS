The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Madhyamik in exam shift
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Madhyamik in exam shift
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Madhyamik could be your childs first exposure to an examination or every day in class could be an exam in itself, depending on how you look at the West Bengal Board of Secondary Educations most radical decision yet.        
	The board that governs the majority of schools in Bengal has decided to adopt a modern evaluation method that involves assessing a student on a day-to-day basis without heaping exam anxiety on him or her at regular intervals.        
	So while that means an end to routine terminal and annual exams, weekly or fortnightly classroom exercises and regular unit tests will continue to exist by another name  continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE).        
	 Once the CCE scheme is implemented, it will be farewell to the concept of testing students on the basis of what has been taught over the entire academic year, said the headmaster of a Madhyamik school in north Calcutta.        
	The board has convened a two-day meeting of CCE experts from across the country, starting Thursday, to develop a framework for the implementation of the concept.        
	We will exchange opinions with these experts and take a final decision on the basis of the outcome of the discussions, said board president Mamata Ray.        
	The CCE system will mark a major shift from the existing structure in more ways than one. The purpose is to de-stress children and yet ensure the holistic growth of every child. The CCE concept provides an opportunity to tap the individual potential of every child instead of labelling him or her as academically weak or intelligent. We intend making exams a part of our learning process instead of a procedure to test a childs ability to memorise what has been taught, explained Ray.        
	But board officials admitted that some parents might have misgivings about the system of continuous rather than periodic evaluation. It will take time getting used to the system, a senior functionary said.        
	The father of a Class VII girl said the flip side of the system could be that students might forget what it was like to sit for a real exam. Madhyamik will be Madhyamik, whether or not you have written a paper over the past five years, he added.        
	The continuous evaluation system made a partial entry into the Madhyamik system in 2007 when the board abolished the half-yearly exams and introduced unit tests like those in CBSE and ICSE schools.         
	As of now, five unit tests are held in a year. The number of unit tests and the nature of such tests might change once the new system is implemented, a board official said.         
	The CCE system has been fully implemented by the CBSE, whose chairman Vineet Joshi is one of those who will attend the two-day meeting at Rotary Sadan.        
	Delhi has already directed all states not to detain students till Class VIII and conduct the Class X exams based on a years syllabus rather than two.

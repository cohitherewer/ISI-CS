The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shower of body parts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shower of body parts
                              A photograph by Fawzan Husain                            
	Outstanding works are difficult to miss even amidst a welter of mediocrity. The exhibition titled Image and Symbol at Aakriti art gallery is a mixed bag of images and forms without any common link to hold it together. The paintings and sculptures could not but have been chosen arbitrarily, yet there were some that stood out. Sourav Janas gigantic Kali stretches across hillocks as body parts shower around her, in keeping with the myth of Sati. Instead of a fearsome goddess, however, she has turned into a farmer. It is a striking image that takes many liberties with form, yet manages to be rooted in tradition.        
	Jaya Gangulys work has taken a new direction  instead of caricature monstrosities she has created a monochromatic beggar boy lying on a red sheet, its jelly-like limbs like those of a marine creature. Nantu Behari Dass head looks like it is spinning fast while being shredded into ribbons by some unseen Hannibal Lecter  a haunting image difficult to erase from ones memory. Sunil Kumar Dass donkey is a classic case of how the grooved bark of a betel nut tree can be used effectively to create the texture of this piece.              
	As many artists know to their cost, religion is a touchy subject. Photo journalist Fawzan Husains theme is faith, and his focus is on devotion and ecstasy as manifested among Hindus. Fawzans assignment takes him to many familiar temples and he has come up with many striking images. The devotees wallowing in red during Holi, rushing the palkhi in a temple, dancing to kirtan and lying on the floor of a temple rise above cliches.         
	Even more remarkable are the wooden limbs offered to a deity, a baba displaying his rings with curative powers and the hands touching Christs feet.        
	Fawzan has studiously avoided any images that even obliquely involve Islam, save the one of the chief of a particular sect being held aloft.         
	The spinal cord is the concept behind sculptor Prasun Ghoshs exhibition at Gandhara art gallery. He has taken liberties with what in actuality is a vertical form. Ghoshs spinal cord is coiled like a snake, shoots up like a tree and is attached to a skull which turns out to be an aquarium with fish swimming inside.        
	Ghosh is known for being innovative but here he has gone too far. The forms he has created are not compact, to begin with, and at times they go awry. He shows more control over the smaller pieces.                    SOUMITRA DAS

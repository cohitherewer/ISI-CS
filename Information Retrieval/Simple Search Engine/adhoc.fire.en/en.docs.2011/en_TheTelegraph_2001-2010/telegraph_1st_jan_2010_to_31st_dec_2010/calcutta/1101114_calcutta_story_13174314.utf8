The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fest misses city films
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fest misses city films

	The recently concluded Kalpanirjhar International Short Fiction Film Festival, November 1 to November 5, proved that short films are fast emerging as a popular genre in Calcutta. The last day saw a packed auditorium at Max Mueller Bhavan on Diwali.        
	I was apprehensive about the turnout. But the full house clearly shows short films have a bright career ahead, said Reimar Volker, director of Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan, Calcutta.         
	Organised by the Kalpanirjhar Foundation and Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan, the eighth edition of the film fest screened 92 films from 19 countries. The Academy Award winner The Mozart of Pickpockets, a 2007 French short film, was a surprise.         
	Of the 25 Indian films selected for the competition, Narmeen (2009), directed by Dipti Gogna, earned the best entry honour. That there was only one film sent by Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI), Calcutta, was noticed.         
	The jury, comprising filmmakers Abhijit Dasgupta and Vasudha Joshi, was unanimous that this year the contest was closer than the Olympics and the students films were encouraging. Dasgupta expressed his disappointment with SRFTI. Perhaps Calcutta is a bit laid-back. It is time for the city to be a little more dynamic, he said. For the last three years the Kalpanirjhar best film award has been bagged by students from FTII, Pune.        
	Filmmaker Mrinal Sen said he was happy to see that the quality of films made by Indian students had improved considerably.        
	Drama at the Games                   A scene from the play Nagamandala       
	A sign in front of one of the food courts read: Dinning Encloser: Tea, Linch and Diner. The bad spelling aside, city theatre and folk music performers could not fault the arrangement at Delhi Celebrates or Jashn-e-Dilli, organised on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Games, 2010 (September 3-November 4).        
	The cultural programmes were held as part of Sangeet Natak Akademis Desh Parv.         
	Folk singers from Calcutta got a tremendous response at the Meghdoot Theatre Complex while theatre groups performed before a packed house at the Sri Ram Centre.         
	Most artistes are so used to travelling on shoe-string budgets and making do with poor accommodation and technical backup, that such a royal treatment was a pleasant surprise, said Suparno Chakraborty of Sundaram. The Calcutta group staged Manoj Mitras Ja Nei Bharatey at Sri Ram Centre with two screens projecting English sub-titles as well.        
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit had insisted on the subtitles, said Kiron Bhatnagar, the deputy secretary, Sangeet Natak Akademi.         
	The cultural events got such a huge response that someone quipped that the Games were only incidental, said Union secretary for culture Jawhar Sircar.         
	With winter in the offing, big cultural events will overflow. Several craft melas will be held. November 19, for example, will see the opening of a five-day crafts mela at Srijani Shilpagram, the 8.5acre complex in Surul Santiniketan. There will be a non-stop craft fair on the same premises from December-end to March.

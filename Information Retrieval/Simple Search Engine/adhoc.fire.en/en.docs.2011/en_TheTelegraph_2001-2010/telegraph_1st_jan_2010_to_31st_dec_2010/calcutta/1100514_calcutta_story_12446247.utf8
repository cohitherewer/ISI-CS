	The final hearing of the state health department panel probing the alleged refusal by Peerless and another hospital to admit some accident victims on April 13 and their subsequent ransacking by a mob was held on Thursday.         
	Doctors and officials of the two private hospitals deposed before the committee on Thursday. Two persons who had carried the injured to the hospitals were also among the 17 who appeared before the four-member panel. About 100 people had deposed on May 6 and May 8.        
	We have completed the hearings and will submit the report by the end of the month, said Swapan Chakraborty, a member of the committee. Chairperson R.K. Vats, Mrityunjay Mukhopadhyay and Bhaskar Bhattacharjee are the other members.

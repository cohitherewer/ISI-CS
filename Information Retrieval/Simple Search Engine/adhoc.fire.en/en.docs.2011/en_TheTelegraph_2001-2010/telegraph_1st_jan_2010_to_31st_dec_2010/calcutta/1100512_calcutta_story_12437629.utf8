          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday allowed Gameplan Sports Pvt Ltd, which allegedly owes Team India captain M.S. Dhoni over Rs 10 crore in endorsement fees, to operate its bank account after keeping aside Rs 5.2 crore.         
	Justice Nadira Patherya of the court modified an earlier order by her, directing the company, which used to handle the cricketers endorsements between December 2005 and January 2008, not to operate its bank account without keeping aside Rs 8.18 crore.        
	Dhoni had moved the court claiming that Gameplan owed him the amount.        
	Prima facie, the court is satisfied that the company has the right to keep 30 per cent of the amount earned by Dhoni from endorsements as commission, said the judge.         
	Justice Patherya also directed Dhoni to produce a statement of the payments he had received from Gameplan Sports for endorsements during the period he was associated with the company.         
	The judge asked Gameplan Sports to file an affidavit in response within the third week of June. The case is scheduled to come up for hearing again in July.        
	During Tuesdays hearing, Dhonis lawyers claimed that Gampelan Sports owed their client Rs 10.5 crore.

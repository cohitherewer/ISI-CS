The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | First-timers feel the judgement day jitters
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      First-timers feel the judgement day jitters
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                        NEWBIE NERVES: Zarina Aziz (ward 135), Sabina Yasmin (ward 138), Sanhita Das (ward 129) and Bablu Karim (ward 79). Pictures by Tamaghna Banerjee                                 
	The civic poll debutant(e)s are feeling the Madhyamik blues  not the writing, but the results of their first big exam.        
	From going on a fast to confining themselves to their four walls, first-time candidates battled judgement day-eve jitters as the heat and dust of poll day gave way to the chilling quiet of the countdown to counting.        
	For Zarina Aziz, the CPI candidate from ward 135, the parallel between exam results and ballot count is obvious  she is all of 21 years and five months old.        
	I have always fasted and prayed on the eve of my exam results in school and college. I am doing the same now, said Zarina. I am so tense that I slept at 2.30am last night and woke up at 5.30am today. I just cannot sleep, she added.        
	Three wards away, the junior-most Trinamul Congress candidate, Sabina Yasmin, was tongue-tied with tension. I am not answering calls and am not speaking to anyone. I am just sitting silently in my room, reading the papers and watching news channels on TV. I so wish the results would have been declared on Monday, instead of Wednesday. The wait is tough, said Yasmin, 21, from ward 138.        
	Trinamul candidate Sanhita Das of ward 129 is faring no better, behind closed doors. I have developed a terrible headache and a stomach ache. I plan to stay indoors these two days and spend time with my daughter. If my husband and party workers assure me of a favourable result on Wednesday only then will I step out, said Sanhita, wife of three-time councillor Anjan Das.        
	Sabina and Sanhita could take a tip or two from party colleagues Bablu Karim of ward 79 and Sushanta Ghosh of ward 107, who are trying to take their mind off the counting clock going tick-tock.        
	I slept till late, then went for a movie (the Hollywood fantasy Prince of Persia) before rounding it off with dinner with my family. The more calculations I do, the more tense I get. So, I have just decided to sit back and wait for Wednesday, said Karim, who faces a tough fight from five-time councillor Ram Pyare Ram of the Congress.        
	Bollywood is the chosen escape route for Ghosh, so he rented the DVDs of Devdas and My Name is Khan on Monday to stay home and watch his hero, Shah Rukh Khan.        
	Psychologist Tapasi Mitra said this was much like waiting for the results of their first big exam and prescribed thinking positive and keeping the mind off the results. How pray can the Zarinas and Sabinas do that? Listening to light music and watching comedy films is an option. Also, meeting friends, said Mitra.

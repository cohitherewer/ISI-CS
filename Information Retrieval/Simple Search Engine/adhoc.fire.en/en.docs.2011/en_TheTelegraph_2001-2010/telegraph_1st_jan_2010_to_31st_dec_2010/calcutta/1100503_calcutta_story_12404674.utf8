The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ceramic hope in hip surgery
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ceramic hope in hip surgery
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Ceramic implants developed by a city-based institute can bring down the cost of a total hip replacement surgery by more than half, some experts claim. Such implants were earlier imported from Europe.        
	The prosthesis developed by scientists at the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute has an added benefit. It lasts more than 20 years, compared with the currently used metal or polycarbonate implants whose longevity varies between seven and 15 years.        
	Bioceramic prosthesis offers much longer and trouble-free life span, compared with metal or polycarbonate prosthesis. Thats why the whole world is shifting to bioceramic implants, said Debabrata Basu, the head of the bioceramic and coating division of the Jadavpur institute.        
	Orthopaedic surgeon K.H. Sancheti has already used the institutes implant in an operation at AIIMS and has planned six more surgeries with the prosthesis at Jubilant Kalpataru Hospital in Barasat later this month.        
	Thanks to the institutes achievement, the cost of a total hip replacement surgery with a ceramic implant has come down from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 65,000, said Satadal Saha, the director of the Barasat hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Idol demand beats supply 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Idol demand beats supply 
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Lakshmi idols on Friday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	After a morning of scouring the markets, Pintu Sarkar finally found his Lakshmi at 4pm on Friday in an idol-makers studio near Tollygunge bridge, far from his Ranikuthi home. But without a single coat of paint.        
	Demand for idols outstripped supply this Lakshmi Puja leaving many like Pintu, going late to get a good bargain, empty-handed.        
	I went to markets in Bansdroni, Azadgarh and Tollygunge but found nothing. Then I rushed here to the idol-makers. Even here, only one house has a few idols left because they could not finish on time, he said, watching the idol getting a hurried coat of paint.        
	Decoration and quality of finish are determinants, but on an average a 3.5ft idol cost about Rs 200, keeping a margin of Rs 10-20 for the seller. The smallest idol, fitting into a palm, went for Rs 15, with a margin of barely Rs 2.        
	The rush for Lakshmi idols was evident at the Hudco crossing in Ultadanga, where Sajal Kundu had only two idols left of the 120 he had picked up. I could easily have sold 30 pieces more, but the artistes made less idols this year, maybe because the rains ruined last years business.        
	The modest-sized idols are made in obscure little artisan hubs far from Kumartuli. Ours are die-cast structures, not the kathamo-based ones they make, said Jagadish Haldar, seated in his empty shed in Chetla on Friday.        
	Haldar made 600 idols but could have done with 400 more. I had to trim numbers from every dealer to ensure no one returned empty-handed. We dont have the manpower to increase production, he rued.        
	About 15,000-20,000 idols are made in the Chetla area by 20-odd families. Haldars neighbour Rabin Das cites a space crunch for not making another 1,000 idols.        
	Close to the Keoratala crematorium, from the biggest Lakshmi idol hub in south Calcutta, Uttam Pal summed up the demand-supply dynamics : It is in our interest to see that the supply remains less than demand. It gives us bargaining muscle.

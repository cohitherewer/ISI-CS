The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Besu entrance googly stumps students   Problem of Besu entry
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Besu entrance googly stumps students             MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	The upgrade of the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) into an Institute of Engineering Science and Technology has cast a cloud over the admission procedure, forcing aspiring students to prepare for two different entrance examinations.        
	If the process of upgrade is completed in the next 15 to 20 days  which will require fast-tracking of formalities both in Delhi and Calcutta  the students will have to appear for the All India Engineering Entrance Examinations (AIEEE), conducted by the ministry of human resource development.        
	If not, they will have to sit for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), conducted by the state government, to book their berths in Besu.        
	The HRD ministry conducts the AIEEE for colleges like the National Institutes of Technology. Engineering colleges in Bengal also admit 10 per cent of their students on the basis of AIEEE scores.        
	The moment Besu is officially upgraded, performance in the AIEEE will become the only yardstick for admission. But we dont know the timeline for the implementation of the upgrade, said Ajoy Roy, the vice-chancellor of Besu.        
	All the procedures at the state and central levels need to be finished very fast. The students of our state will be the worst sufferers if there is a delay in the institute starting to function with its new status, added Roy.        
	With the authorities failing to come up with a definite answer, students aspiring for admission to the states oldest engineering institute  which has around 500 undergraduate seats in various streams  are in a fix.        
	The AIEEE questions are along the lines of the CBSE syllabus while the JEE questions are set on the basis of the HS course. It is difficult to prepare for two types of entrance tests and the exams are just five months away, said the student of a central Calcutta school.                    
	A Besu official said the Centre would have to amend the National Institutes of Technology (NIT) Act to include a provision for the special character of the Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, which will be covered under the NIT Act.        
	At the same time, the state government will have to withdraw the state act  applicable to Besu at present  for its upgrade. The state government is doing the needful to ensure that the students do not suffer, said Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri, the state higher education minister.         
	According to a JEE board official, the state entrance examination will be held on April 17. The AIEEE is also slated for April. JEE scores dictate admissions to the state government-run institutes and 60-odd private engineering colleges.        
	But most students aspire for Jadavpur University or Besu. If they cant make it to JU, students want admission in Besu So the confusion over Besu admission is bound to affect almost all the engineering degree aspirants in the state, said a JU teacher.        
	Last year, over 1.1 lakh students had appeared for the state JEE and the authorities are expecting the number to go up by around 10 per cent.        
	The Besu upgrade, however, will mean reserving only 50 per cent of the seats on the Shibpur campus for students from the state. Denial of opportunity may be a concern for some but that should be ignored as the state will get a centrally-funded quality institute. The bigger concern is the lack of clarity on the upgrade timeline, said a state board official.

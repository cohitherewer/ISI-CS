                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Two more in fake permit net
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An alleged key operator of the fake permit racket and his associate were arrested in Howrah on Friday on the charge of submitting forged documents to the public vehicles department (PVD).        
	Dilip Kodali, 40, was picked up from his house in Tantipara Lane. After interrogating him, officers of the detective department arrested his aide Tarak Nath Mukherjee in the same locality.        
	Dilips brother Bapi, Bablu Dey and Mahadeb Brahma were arrested earlier for their alleged links with the racket. Bapi provided information about Dilips role in the racket, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Damayanti Sen.        
	Dilip is a key person in the racket. He used to assure brokers that he would help them get route permits, said an officer of the cheating section.        
	He allegedly used to collect fake challans and submit them to the PVD, in a bid to show that money was deposited with the Reserve Bank of India.        
	The scam came to light after transport department officials found two route permits issued against a single challan.

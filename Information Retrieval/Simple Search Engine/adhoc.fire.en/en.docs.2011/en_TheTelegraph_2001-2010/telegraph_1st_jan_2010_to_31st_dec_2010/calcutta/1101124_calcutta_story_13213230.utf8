The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plan to widen parking space
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Plan to widen parking space
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Trinamul Congress-run civic body plans to levy parking fees on vehicles on 63 more roads and create legal parking space for around 500 more vehicles.        
	At present, there are roadside parking facilities on over 275 roads.        
	Mayoral council member Rajib Deb held a meeting on Tuesday with the assistant commissioner of police (traffic), Sunil Mukherjee, and OC traffic (planning) Nilanjan Banerjee at the civic headquarters and handed over the list of stretches the civic body wants to bring within the ambit of legalised parking. The new stretches include Vivekananda Road (northern flank), Lake View Road, Puddapukur Road, Ironside Road, Raja Basanta Roy Road and Belvedere Road.        
	The police will study the proposal and get back to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation within seven days. Sources said the police could object to parking on certain stretches if they felt it could affect traffic.        
	The city now has fee parking space for 7,510 cars. The number will go up to 8,020 cars if the CMCs proposal is implemented.        
	The meeting decided that the contractors running fee parking lots would have to mark the stretches clearly. They will draw criss-crossing lines with zinc so that car owners understand whether they are parking in a designated parking zone or not. The markings will have to painted every month, a civic official said.        
	At the meeting with the police, Deb pleaded helplessness about the fact that the contractors followed none of the norms laid down by the CMC. He urged the police to ensure that the men running the parking lots wore their uniforms and displayed their identity cards.        
	The operators of the parking zones are entitled to collect fees from 7am to 10pm but on several roads, such as Park Street, they charge fees till midnight.        
	The CMC earns Rs 6.34 crore annually by distributing parking lots among co-operatives, but insiders admitted that the authorities lacked the will to act against errant operators.        
	Besides fee parking, the CMC allows roadside night parking (10pm to 6am) and grants exclusive parking zone rights against a payment. For night parking of cars, the rate is Rs 300 a month. A sticker, which is to be displayed on the windscreen, is issued to the owner or the driver. For exclusive parking rights, the civic body charges Rs 15,000 per year for a car.        
	Deb also drew the polices attention to illegal parking in the Fancy Market, Kalighat Temple Road, Kankurgachhi, Hindusthan Park and Queens Park areas.        
	The civic authorities have not allotted fee parking lots in these areas but a group of people are collecting money from the cars parked on roads there.

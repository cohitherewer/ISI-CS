The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops trace mom, draw a blank on boy
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops trace mom, draw a blank on boy
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police on Tuesday managed to speak to the mother of 22-year-old Evan Vincent, who has been absconding since his wife Lesley Rebecca was found with her throat slit in their rented Thakurpukur flat on Sunday.         
	We spoke to Evans mother at her home in Ekbalpore but she said her son had been away for the last two years and she had no clue about his whereabouts, said an officer.         
	Evans mother, a schoolteacher, said that all her attempts to trace her son over the past two years had proved futile. She also said that she had no idea whether Evan had got married or was living in with a girl in Thakurpukur, the officer added.         
	Rebecca, 20, had been found dead naked with her hands and legs tied. On Tuesday, her body was sent for post-mortem at the Kantapukur morgue. The preliminary report revealed that the assassin had killed Rebecca by slitting her throat with a sharp weapon.         
	The victims hands and the legs were tied after the murder. If it was otherwise, there would have been rope marks on her wrists and ankles, but there was none, an officer quoted from the report.         
	The murder took place on Friday or Saturday morning, well after Rebecca had last eaten. There were no traces of undigested food in her abdomen. She had not consumed any alcohol before her death either, the preliminary findings suggested.        
	The report revealed the girl had not been sexually abused before being killed.         
	The police have sent a bottle of soft drink that they had found in the flat for a forensic test to find whether the drink was laced with alcohol or not. Officers said the bottle smelled of ethyl alcohol but refused to elaborate.         
	There are several grey areas. Given the financial status of the couple, we are not sure whether they used a cellphone, said an officer.        
	The cops feel a mobile jacket covered with love stickers found in the flat might have been just a showpiece. They also suspect that the killer might have consumed alcohol to muster the courage to commit the murder.

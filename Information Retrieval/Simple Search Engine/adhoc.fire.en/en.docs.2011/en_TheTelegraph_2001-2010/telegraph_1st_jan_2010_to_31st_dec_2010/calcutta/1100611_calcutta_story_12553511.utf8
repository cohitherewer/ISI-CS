  - Rs5cr plan for Salt Lake stadium upgrade approved        A STAFF REPORTER                              The Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg where the Fifa World Cup will be played; (above) the Salt Lake stadium which will soon be renovated				                                       
	The state government is set to take the excitement of the Fifa World Cup to rural Bengal by screening the knockout matches on giant screens.        
	The sports and youth welfare minister, Kanti Ganguly, announced on Thursday that 450 giant screens would be set up in villages across the state for people to enjoy the eight matches from the quarter-finals level.         
	We want sports lovers in rural Bengal who do not have access to television to enjoy the matches from the knockout stage, Ganguly said at Writers Buildings.        
	We would have liked to show all the matches of the tournament but cost constraints have forced us restrict ourselves to the knockout stage, he added.        
	According to the minister, the state government would spend around Rs 32 lakh for the purpose.        
	The cost would come to a little over Rs 7,000 per screen, which would take the total to around Rs 32 lakh. The finance department has been asked for clearance, said Ganguly.        
	Salt Lake stadium: The sports department has got the finance departments approval for renovating the Yuva Bharati Krirangan in Salt Lake at a cost of Rs 5 crore.        
	The renovation will begin soon, said Ganguly, adding that the much-needed revamp would make Yuva Bharati a prized stadium.        
	Ganguly also announced that a trauma care centre would come up at the Salt Lake stadium at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore. CPM Rajya Sabha member Chandrakala Pandey would give the money from his MPLAD funds, he added.        
	The trauma care centre will have the latest technology for prompt and quality treatment. There was a need for such a specialised government-run trauma care centre in the area, added Ganguly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Presi alumni meet Buddha 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Presi alumni meet Buddha 
  - Demand to appoint apolitical vice-chancellor, best brains          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A team from the Presidency College Alumni Association met the chief minister on Thursday to seek the appointment of an apolitical person as the first vice-chancellor of Presidency University.         
	The five-member team also urged Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to ensure that only the best teachers are recruited at the university so that it could become a centre of excellence.        
	Bhattacharjee, an alumnus of the institute, had taken the initiative to speed up its upgrade to a unitary university.        
	A senior higher education department official had told Metro that the government wanted the selection process to be over by September 3.         
	Though the government has set up a three-member search committee to find a suitable vice-chancellor for Presidency University, a section of the alumni fears that it will end up endorsing a candidate with strong Left links.         
	Senior lawyer Anindya Mitra, who headed the alumni team, said after the 45-minute meeting at Writers Buildings that Bhatttacharjee accepted all the proposals on how to turn Presidency into a centre of excellence.        
	The chief minister also became a member of the alumni association on Thursday.        
	The others in the team were Bibhas Chauduri, Prasanta Ray, Rupa Bandopadhyay and Animesh Sen.        
	The five requested that Presidency alumni be included in the management committee of the university.         
	They handed over a letter to the chief minister calling for the appointment of a vice-chancellor who is an outstanding academician with administrative capability. He should preferably be an alumnus who can rise above the narrow partisan line.         
	It may please be seen that only the best teachers selected on the basis of appropriate norms are recruited, states the letter.        
	Members of the association had approached former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray  also an alumnus of the college  to accompany them to the meeting with the chief minister.        
	Ray was unable to attend the meeting. He sent a message to Bhattacharjee stressing two points  full freedom for the university and recruitment of the best brains as faculty members.         
	The court or the syndicate, whatever is proposed should consist of only the best and brightest jewels from our intellectual world, even if they are from outside Bengal, not certainly anyone from or openly supporting any political party. Having a university under government control will be having no genuine university at all, Ray wrote.         
	Gas pipe leak: An underground pipe of Oriental Gas Company sprung a leak in front of 26 Camac Street on Thursday sparking panic in the area. Company officials fixed the pipe.

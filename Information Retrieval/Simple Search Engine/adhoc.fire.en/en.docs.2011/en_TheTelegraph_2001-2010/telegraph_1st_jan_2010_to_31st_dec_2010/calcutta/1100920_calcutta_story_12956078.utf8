The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ma has gone to work; she will bring new clothes for me this Puja
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ma has gone to work; she will bring new clothes for me this Puja
          SANJAY MANDAL                                          
	Six-year-old Shubho Das last saw his mother the day she boarded a train for Gwalior in May. He is hoping she returns by Puja with new clothes for him.        
	He is the only one who is clinging on to hope. How do I snatch that from him? cried grandfather Ganesh Gayen, a physically challenged man who has spent the past three months shuttling between his Kalighat home and Karaya police station for news about his missing daughter.        
	Shubhos mother Radha Das, 27, had apparently found work as a domestic help in a Gwalior house through a city-based agency that recruits women for such jobs outside the state. The agency claims her employers were dissatisfied and so put her on a train back home three days after she had reached Gwalior. Gayen argues that she couldnt have boarded a train to the city and not returned home.        
	With the agency shirking responsibility and the police shrugging off their failure to find her, Radha has become yet another piece of statistic in Bengals burgeoning list of missing women that has plunged families from Kakdwip to Kalighat into despair.        
	Like Johora Bibi of Kakdwip, who had petitioned the high court last year to trace her teenaged stepdaughter Tahira, Radhas father has now moved the Alipore chief judicial magistrates court. I at least need to know whether she is alive or dead, said Gayen, who is unemployed.         
	Shubho, oblivious to his grandfathers despair, seemed convinced he would be reunited with his mother this Puja. Ma has gone to work; she will bring new clothes for me, smiled the Class I student of a Rashbehari Avenue school.        
	Radha had returned to her parents two-room shanty on Satish Mukherjee Road in Kalighat after her husband deserted her a few years ago.        
	The youngest of Ganesh and Anima Gayens three children, she used to make Rs 2,000 a month working in various households in the city. She approached Binita Jhagarias Sakuntala agency at Karaya earlier this year and agreed to go outside the state after being promised Rs 6,500 a month.        
	Jhagaria said Radha was first sent to Mumbai but lasted only 11 days. Gwalior was her second outstation assignment through the agency.         
	So wasnt it the agencys responsibility to ensure that she was safe? The Gwalior family put her on a train to Calcutta with Rs 100 and some food. If she didnt return home, it is not our responsibility, Jhagaria insisted.        
	Gwalior resident Neha Goyel, who had hired Radha through Sakuntala, declined to comment on Radhas disappearance. I will speak to you after consulting my family members and lawyer, she told Metro over the phone.         
	The officer on duty at Karaya police station said: I am not aware of any complaint filed about a woman by that name.        
	Officer-in charge Alok Kumar Ghosh added: If there has been a complaint, an inquiry must be on.        
	Gayen accused the police of refusing to act on his complaint. An officer told me that the cops had more important things to do than hunt for a missing woman, he said.         
	Gayen, in his 50s, said the agency didnt bother informing him that his daughter had been sent back until he went there to collect her salary a month later. Wife Anima alleged that the agency owner abused her when she demanded an explanation. When I called our daughters employer in Gwalior, the lady insisted that Radha had boarded a train to Calcutta, she recalled.        
	Gayen had last spoken to his daughter the day after she had boarded the train to Gwalior. She told me that she had mistakenly got off at a station 25km from Gwalior but managed to take another train to reach her destination. I had no reason to suspect anything until I was told she had left after working for just three days, he said.        
	Do you know of any girl missing from the city?

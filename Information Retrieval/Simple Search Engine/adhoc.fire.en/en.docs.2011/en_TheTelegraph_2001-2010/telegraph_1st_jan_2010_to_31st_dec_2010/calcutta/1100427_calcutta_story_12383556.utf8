          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	An Ivory Coast national was netted on Monday on the charge of duping a Bowbazar youth he was staying with of Rs 5.7 lakh. Police said Broud Roland was a member of a racket that lured people through emails into parting with cash.        
	Ehetarmul Haque received an email in 2009 from a woman named Faber Jacobi who said she had been bequeathed with $6.5 million. Haque would get 10 per cent of the amount if he paid Rs 5.7 lakh, she said.        
	The youth paid the amount but did not get the promised return. When Haque asked for the money, Jacobi asked him to meet Broud in Delhi. But Haque asked Broud to come to his house in Calcutta. Broud came and put up with Haque but when he refused to pay up, the youth lodged a complaint.

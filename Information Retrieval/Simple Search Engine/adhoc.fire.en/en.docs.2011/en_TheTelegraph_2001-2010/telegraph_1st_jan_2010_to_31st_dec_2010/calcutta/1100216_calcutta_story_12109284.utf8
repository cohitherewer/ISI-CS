The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Snake trap to rob techie 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Snake trap to rob techie 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Indranil Biswas at his Salt Lake office on Monday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	A software engineer busy paying his taxi fare outside his Sector V office on Monday morning got the shock of his life when a man in a red robe reached through a window of the vehicle and dropped two snakes on his lap.        
	The snakes, one of which settled on Indranil Biswass lap while the other slithered down to his feet, were not removed till the petrified 24-year-old handed over Rs 600 to the snakeman and his identically dressed partner, who stood blocking the doors of the taxi.         
	It was a robbery. The men said they would not pick up the snakes if I did not pay them enough to appease Bholebaba, said the Konnagar resident who works as a programme analyst with Cognizant Technology Solutions at Technopolis building.        
	The snakes were at least five feet long. One of them was black and the other brown. As I tried to reason with the men, the brown one coiled around my legs. I have always been afraid of reptiles and could barely think straight in such a situation, he added.        
	The young man initially tried to get out of the taxi by paying the middle-aged duo Rs 2 but they would not budge. He then handed over Rs 100 but they refused to move. Trapped, the young man brought out a Rs 500 note from the wallet, which one of the men snatched away.        
	The men then handed Biswas a rudraksh before they picked up a snake each and left. The techie, embarrassed at being defrauded in this manner, was reluctant to lodge a police complaint but did so on learning that two of his colleagues had been robbed in the same manner.        
	One of them had paid Rs 1,500 to a duo who dropped snakes on his lap in Sector V in December. The other CTS employee was accosted at Bidhannagar Road station and got away after paying Rs 600.        
	Vijender Shaw, a taxi driver who is a regular at the stand outside Technopolis, said he had seen people being robbed in a similar manner in the area quite a few times.        
	An officer at the Sector V police outpost also said he had heard of robberies using snakes but Biswass was the first written complaint the cops received. Similar robberies have been reported in other parts of the city, including Prince Anwar Shah Road and Elgin Road.

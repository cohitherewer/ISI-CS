	Those who did            
	Agnimitra Paul, fashion designer  
	Are you a regular voter at the CMC polls?         
	Yes. I believe in exercising my right              
	Were you approached for autographs/photographs?        
	No, no, no!               
	One thing you want from the new mayor        
	To be concerned about the city; to work hard, honestly and hand in hand              
	It is being touted as the vote for change. Do you agree?        
	I think so; it will definitely be a strong fight                           
	Sohini Pal, actress  
	Are you a regular voter at the CMC polls?         
	I have been living in Calcutta for the past one-and-a-half years but I do vote regularly. Voting allows us the right to choose our leaders and make a difference               
	Were you approached for autographs/photographs?        
	Not really. I went to a booth on Golf Club Road around 10.30am. It was peaceful         
	One thing you want from the new mayor        
	Better roads, honestly. Thats one thing that can make a great difference in Calcutta. Also, we are tired of seeing how 10 minutes of rain brings the city to a standstill               
	It is being touted as the vote for change. Do you agree?        
	I think every vote is a vote for change. Lets hope that this election brings a lot of positive changes              
	Paoli Dam, actress              
	Are you a regular voter at the CMC polls?        
	If I am in town I make sure I vote. I vote because thats the only way I can have a say. Theres little I can do for my country apart from voting              
	Were you approached for autographs/photographs?        
	Yes, a few were clicking me on their mobile phones. But it was peaceful. I went to vote around 11.30am at Rajendra Prasad Colony in Lake Gardens              
	One thing you want from the new mayor        
	To take up the citys waterlogging problem a little more seriously              
	It is being touted as the vote for change. Do you agree?        
	Lets see. We are hopeful of something better, thats why we vote.              
	Churni Ganguly, actress        
	Are you a regular voter at the CMC polls?         
	Yes, I always vote because I believe in exercising my right. And I dont want anyone else to cast my vote              
	Were you approached for autographs/ photographs?        
	No, I went very early in the morning              
	One thing you want from the new mayor        
	Dedication to service               
	It is being touted as the vote for change. Do you agree?        
	Its difficult to say. How much change will happen or not is to be seen after the polls              
	Koel Mullick, actress        
	Are you a regular voter at the CMC polls?         
	Yes. I vote because I want a better Calcutta              
	Were you approached for autographs/photographs?        
	No. I was there for barely five minutes              
	One thing you want from the new mayor        
	The garbage to be cleared, the roads to be cleaned. Basically, a clean city              
	It is being touted as the vote for change. Do you agree?        
	Yes, but its too early to say what kind of change              
	Bickram Ghosh, musician        
	Are you a regular voter at the CMC polls?         
	If I am not out of my country, I make sure that I vote. Its my fundamental right to vote. I feel that by not voting people are making a negative statement               
	Were you approached for autographs/photographs?        
	Not really. Jaya (wife) and I went to vote around 12.30pm at Senhati Colony in Behala               
	One thing you want from the new mayor        
	Quite a bit, actually. I would like to see cleaner and better roads, and more public toilets              
	It is being touted as the vote for change. Do you agree?        
	I dont go by any such idiom. We definitely vote for hope. Whoever is in power should be able to improve the situation              
	June, actress              
	Are you a regular voter at the CMC polls?         
	Yes, of course. I vote to exercise my democratic right. I think everyone should vote              
	Were you approached for autographs/ photographs?        
	No. The people of my locality know me very well. I went to vote around 2pm at Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar in Ballygunge              
	One thing you want from the new mayor        
	To be more alert and agile. I would want him/her to make our city more liveable              
	It is being touted as the vote for change. Do you agree?        
	Yes, I feel there will be a few changes this time. I am not talking about which party should win or lose, but things should change for the better. I am tired of people in other states telling me that Calcutta is still backward. I hope we can prove them wrong              
	Sabyasachi Chakraborty, actor              
	Are you a regular voter at the CMC polls?        
	This is the first time I voted at the CMC polls. I voted to exercise my right as a citizen              
	Were you approached for autographs/photographs?        
	Yes, one person came up to me for an autograph. I went to vote in ward 94 at 10.30am and there werent too many people around               
	One thing you want from the new mayor        
	The welfare of the city and its people. I want people to live well              
	It is being touted as the vote for change. Do you agree?        
	I dont know and I cant predict before the results are out  
	THOSE WHO DIDN rsquo;T, for a reason            
	Bhaichung Bhutia, footballer  
	 Are you a regular voter at the CMC polls?  I don rsquo;t vote here actually. I vote in Sikkim  
	One thing you want from the new mayor  The city should be cleaner  
	It is being touted as the vote for change. Do you agree?  I am open to anyone coming to power as long as they have a positive impact. The welfare and development of the people should be the priority                Rituparna Sengupta, actress  I didn rsquo;t vote. With so much happening around (she meant the Jnaneswari Express tragedy), I am pretty disturbed. Also, I am a little under the weather and so I thought it would be best to stay at home and rest                 
	Swastika Mukherjee, actress  I was eager to vote but the Jnaneswari Express tragedy has left my family and me angry, puzzled and disillusioned with the system. A relative of ours, who is only 21 years old, has lost her right arm; her mother has suffered multiple fractures.  You feel so helpless when you are living in a country where no one is answerable for anything. Everyone is busy passing the buck. This was a time when all parties should have come forward and helped the victims together. But there rsquo;s a blame game going on and the whole drama about votes has become like a festival. What is this? Nobody is bothered, irrespective of which party it is.   It is a country where no party will come forward to help you during a crisis. You have to do everything on your own. So how does it matter if I vote or don rsquo;t vote? What difference will it make?  If it had not been someone in my family, I too would have just expressed my sympathies for the victims of the tragedy and gone ahead to cast my vote. But you don rsquo;t realise how bad the situation is unless something like this happens to you. You don rsquo;t know how to react.  Should you cry or shout? Shout at whom? Who will listen? Does anyone bother?

	look who the fashion finger is pointed at on the day of the finger  
	Sunday turned out as hot and humid as it can get, hardly a day for fashion. But Metro style watchers did spot some Calcuttans who stood out on poll day hellip;

	A three-day fair is giving parents a chance to evaluate various city schools and interact with their teachers. Titled Eduworld Kolkata and organised in association with The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS), the event started on Friday at the Milan Mela fair ground.         
	An initiative of a Bangalore-based event management company, the fair (from 11am to 8pm) aims to be a one-stop destination for schools and allied services like coaching classes, play schools and online education institutions.         
	This fair targets those parents who come to Calcutta from other cities and have a tough time getting their kids admitted in good schools. The established institutions are overflowing with applications, but there are other lesser-known ones too. Now parents can spot, compare and evaluate various educational institutions and take a decision, said B. P Mishra, the CEO of Vardaan Events Private Limited, a 10-year-old company that took its first steps into the education sector by co-organising the event.         
	The participating schools range from those affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations to those under the University of Cambridge International Examinations. Some were residential ones too. Akademia International School, South City International School, Indus Valley World School, Vidyanjali International School, St Josephs and Mary School have joined the fair. There are play schools like Prarambh and Tulip Hall. While students who will take their board exams learnt about online coaching from Techno Teaching Info Solutions, children had fun at the games corner set up by Aviva.         
	Parent Chaitali Banerjee had come in search of international schools. I am trying to find out more about them and the kind of teaching they follow.         
	Two seminars will be held on Saturday and Sunday. One will be a parent counselling seminar and the other will focus on corporal punishment. The participating schools are also organising fun activities like spot quizzes and dance programmes to jazz up the fair.         
	This kind of a fair facilitates an interface between teachers and parents, said Jayesh Koli, a teacher at South City International School. With the pilot project in Calcutta, the organisers plan to move to 10 other locales in the country. We plan to have the fair in Siliguri and Guwhati in January, said Mishra.

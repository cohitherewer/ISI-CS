          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 15-year-old schoolgirl allegedly being held captive by her parents to force her into child marriage was rescued after she texted her class teacher, threatening suicide if her SOS went unanswered.        
	Police found the Class IX student locked up in a room of her north Calcutta home on Saturday, hours after the teacher who received the SMS went to Lalbazar along with a senior to lodge a complaint.        
	The girl was absent from school for three days, though I had found no reason to suspect anything was wrong until I received the text message from her cellphone. The message said she was being held captive by her parents for refusing to marry a boy of their choice. She pleaded with me to rescue her or she would commit suicide, the teacher told Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.        
	A team from the womens grievance cell at Lalbazar then left for the girls home and rescued her. Her father, an employee with a private company, was arrested.        
	The girls stepmother, who wasnt home when the cops came calling, surrendered at the police station later.        
	The couple, booked under the Prevention of Child Marriage Act, 2006, and the Juvenile Justice Act, received interim bail till March 16 on Monday.        
	Their daughter, who spent two nights in a shelter run by CINI Asha, was shifted to the state-run home Sukanya in Salt Lake after being produced before the Child Welfare Board.         
	The board directed the school authorities to arrange for a female teacher to escort the girl to and from school on each day of her examinations, starting later this week.        
	The girls parents claimed to have decided to marry off their underage daughter to a boy of their choice from Arambagh, in Hooghly district, because she was allegedly not interested in studies and would spend much of her time with friends.        
	But sources in the womens grievance cell quoted the girl as saying that she wanted to continue her studies and become independent before even contemplating marriage.

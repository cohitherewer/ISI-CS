          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A trader who had declared himself insolvent allegedly to avoid repaying a bank loan was arrested at his Wood Street office on Friday.        
	Anil Mahensarias arrest, on the charge of fraudulently getting himself declared insolvent, was the first since the high court in February had ordered a probe into the alleged irregularities in bankruptcy announcements.        
	Our investigation has revealed that Mahensarias insolvency certificate was issued fraudulently, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of the detective department. We are trying to identify the others involved in the racket.        
	If a person is declared insolvent  the certificate is issued by the office of the registrar of insolvency in the high court  he/she is exempted from repaying bank loans or credit card dues.        
	Mahensaria, who runs an export-import business, took a loan from ICICI Bank in the middle of last year. He stopped repaying the loan once he got a bankruptcy certificate issued in his name after a couple of months.        
	Apart from ordering a probe into the bankruptcy declarations, Justice Sanjib Banerjee of the high court had stayed around 1,400 such declarations since April 1, 2008, following a plea by some private banks.        
	The banks had alleged that some lawyers and touts were running a racket to help people obtain insolvency certificates to avoid repaying loans or credit card dues, said government pleader Sovanlal Hazra.        
	The judge also asked the banks to send to the bar council a list of lawyers whose names figured in advertisements offering help in getting insolvency certificates. According to bar council norms, lawyers cannot publish advertisements offering services to the public.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A circus rolls through town
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A circus rolls through town
                              floral print: A Trinamul campaign vehicle. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                            
	Last Sunday, I woke up to the sound of rumbling drums, and saw two neat files of ebony-coloured men and women swaying to the beat. The men wore feather headgears, while the women were draped in saris with red borders. But then I noticed that the troupe was being followed by a tableau bearing the gigantic cut-out of a candidate. The beaming man, his hands folded in a namaste, promised to cure the city of its ills.        
	There is never a dull moment during elections in Calcutta, and this years civic polls were no exception. To quell our disgust and outrage against Calcuttas roads, frequent power-cuts and noxious fumes, we only had to look up and study the posters that had been put up by Didis party.         
	Most of the candidates from the Trinamul Congress had their nicknames printed on the posters demanding votes. So, in ward 125, Ghanashree Bag, who, I was told, had promised to build a garden (what else?) in the locality, proudly proclaimed that it was time the people voted Bachchu to the councillors chair.         
	In wards 123, 120, 74 and 55, Noni, Bua, Montuda and Gandhi, respectively, urged us to do the same. The botched attempts of a grand alliance notwithstanding, it was clear that the Congress was keen to emulate its big brothers example in the state. So Bishuda towered near a crossing in ward 55, right next to Gandhi. Never ashamed to ride piggyback on Trinamuls ingenious plans, I noticed Tata of the Bharatiya Janata Party making lofty pledges in a neighbouring ward. I was amused, but I wondered whether Didi will find it funny too. The Marxist candidates, by contrast, looked worried in their posters, and, given all this talk of change, had no time for frivolous pet-names.         
	There was also this procession taken out by the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). It had not more than five people in it. And in keeping with the communist ethic, the candidate himself was pushing a dimly-lit cart along with the four others.         
	Then there were the flags, banners and festoons, red, green and saffron. Suddenly, the city looked a little less grey.        
	In India, the functioning of democracy has a theatrical dimension. The drama that surrounds elections  dancing Adivasis, posters with funny names, tiny processions, fluttering flags, blaring microphones  also tells us something about our love of spectacles. Some are of the opinion that this theatricality is a ruse that it is engineered to distract the electorate from real issues.         
	Given the inadequacies in our democracy, such an explanation cannot be dismissed easily. But, equally, what is undeniable is that the people are willing to accept the reduction of a process as critical as elections to a series of comical vignettes. For such an exercise, however inimical to the idea of an ideal democracy, has its own therapeutic value. It is an act of imagined retribution on the part of the electorate. Tired of the dry taps, treacherous roads, and spells of darkness that invariably return, it is our way of re-imagining rulers as puppets who, for a few days, dance to the peoples tunes.                           UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

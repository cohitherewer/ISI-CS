	Calcutta police on Monday decided to trim its list of 160 super sensitive polling stations after the Centre announced that it could provide nine companies of paramilitary forces for the municipal elections instead of the requested 10.         
	We had planned to deploy paramilitary personnel in 160 polling stations. Since fewer paramilitary personnel would be available to us than we had planned for, we cannot deploy them in more than 140 polling stations, said an officer of the city police.        
	The 160 polling stations under 10 police stations  including Topsia, Beniapukur, Beleghata, Narkeldanga, Watgunge, Garden Reach, West Port, Muchipara and Tollygunge  were identified on the basis of the number of voters and the intensity of the political fight.         
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti convened an emergency meeting in the evening to revise the blueprint for deployment of paramilitary forces.         
	Areas around Marcus Square, BB Ganguly Street and Amherst Street would see heavy deployment of security personnel since most of the polling stations have over eight booths, said an officer who attended the meeting.        
	Senior officers would patrol eight to 10 polling stations in vans on May 30 to ensure maximum coverage, added the officer.        
	According to sources, the paramilitary personnel would put up near Cossipore Gun and Shell Factory and a school in Hastings. Their deployment and route march would start on May 27 evening.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Meena Devi Jain, 48, co-accused in a fraud of Rs 3.5 crore, was arrested from her Salt Lake flat on Friday.        
	Police said Meena and her husband Mahendra Kumar Jain, 52, the owner of a transport company, cheated at least five finance companies by mortgaging some vehicles several times.        
	The duo had been absconding since GE Capital, a finance company, had lodged a complaint against them in October 2009. Acting on a tip-off that Meena was seen in her Salt Lake flat in Sector I, cops nabbed her.        
	Meena told cops that she had been staying with her husband in Nagaland.        
	We suspect her husband is still in Nagaland. She will be produced in Bankshall court on Saturday, said an officer at Shakespeare Sarani police station.

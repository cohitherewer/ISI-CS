                      Contemporary visual rhetoric                    Perhaps two of the most gifted artists of contemporary Bangladesh, Mahbubur Rahman and Tayeba Begum Lipi both believe in an expression of creativity that is shaped by personal conviction, intelligence and a value system firmly rooted in their own culture. Over the last two decades, they have retained their refreshing disposition and vibrancy, principally because they have continued to explore, challenge, assimilate and, in the process, to reinvent their fortes. With an apparently disorderly, even bizarre sense of aesthetics, Rahman specialises in connecting and generating meaning from the unexpected and the unusual, creating breathtaking images and installations. Lipi, on the other hand, looks beyond the obvious, tracing hidden meanings and messages in delicate and subtle undertones. In Parables of Our Times, their works are packed with meaning; the angst, the sublimity and an interesting capacity to blend the autobiographical with the collective, provide a distinctive narrative of our times.                  Event: An exhibition of recent works by Mahbubur Rahman and Tayeba Begum Lipi When: Till September 30; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Akar Prakar, P238 Hindustan Park

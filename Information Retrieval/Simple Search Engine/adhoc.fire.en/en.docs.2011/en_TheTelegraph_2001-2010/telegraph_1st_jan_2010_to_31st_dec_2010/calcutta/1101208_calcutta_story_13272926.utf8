                      Analysing relationships                    Ballantines presents Donald Margulies Pulitzer-winning play Dinner with Friends. Directed by Feroz Khan it features an ensemble cast comprising Tisca Chopra, renowned theatre personalities Vinay Jain and Joy Sengupta, as also Perizaad Zorabian Irani, who comes back to her theatre roots after a long hiatus. The play is about four friends, two married couples and one divorce. Both couples are of different ages and at different stages of their lives. The play subtly examines the effects of the breakup of one couple on the other, who first feel compelled to take sides, and then begin to question the strength of their own seemingly tranquil marriage. It exposes the universal insecurities people face as a result of traumatic and devastating events in their lives. This play takes an in-depth look at contemporary relationships, which has the power to make the audience think even after leaving the auditorium. A Moving Platform production. Hosted by Showhouse.                Event: Play in English, Dinner with Friends When: Today and tomorrow; 7.30 pm Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

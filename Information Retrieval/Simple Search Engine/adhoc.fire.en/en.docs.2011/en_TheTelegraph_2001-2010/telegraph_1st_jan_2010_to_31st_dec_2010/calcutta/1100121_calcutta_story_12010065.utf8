The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plaudits for excellence
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Plaudits for excellence

	In India, higher education is either a money-spinning business or a moth-eaten system, said Union home minister P. Chidambaram, speaking on the plight of young people seeking higher education in India.         
	He was attending the third convocation and valedictory programme of St Xaviers College on Sunday. The programme was a part of the concluding ceremony of the 150-year celebration of the institution.        
	Also present on the occasion were Fr Provincial George Pattery, the principal of St Xaviers College, Fr Felix Raj and former principal of the college, Fr P. C. Mathew. Chidambaram also gave away the Nihil Ultra Award of Honour for excellence in service to Fr Mathew, the award for 25 years of service to Fr Felix Raj and professor Ashis Siddhanta (picture above).                                  (From top): The Park Street campus swayed to classical strains from Amaan and Ayaan Ali Khans sarod, fusing with Gino Bankss drums, on Wednesday evening as part of the cultural programme to mark the 150-year celebrations of St Xavier's Calcutta. The sarod brothers kept the crowds engaged in an hour of innovation on their Indian strings and alaaps punched with flute and drumming. Next up were The Vyas brothers, as Sandeep (above) and DJ Sanjeev (below) stormed the stage and got the crowd springing to their toes with club versions of popular tracks like Singh is King, mixed by Sanjeev and sung by Sandeep. Keeping them company on stage was Sufi dhol player Hanif Dhafrani, who drummed up an interesting medley of rhythms to help people warm up to the evening chill.

	Only 11 to 12 per cent of school-leaving children find a place in a college or university against a world average of 45 per cent, said Chidambaram. The promise of universalisation of school education will remain unfulfilled, Chidambaram said, if higher education is neglected. How are we to find teachers for our schools, or harness technology to provide quality school education to children in the farthest corners of our country without higher education? he asked.         
	Chidambaram divided higher education providers into two groups: one that produces graduates who at the end of three or five years, are no more educated than when they first enrolled and the other for which education is commerce.        
	But in this dreary world, we have shining examples like St Xaviers College, he added.         
	Speaking on private and public participation in education, Chidambaram said that private participation cannot be at the cost of compromising quality.         
	We are still debating the norms that should prevail in higher education institutions, especially the role of the private sector. The role of the private sector in higher education ought not to be private business.        
	Speaking of the state of higher education in the state, the vice-chancellor of Calcutta University, Suranjan Das, one of the guests, pointed out that despite the impressive growth in higher education, the need of the hour was to resolve dichotomies between central and state universities.        
	Prayer meet        
	On January 18, the school and college students of St Xaviers organised a multi-religious prayer meet, where representatives from Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Zoroastrian and Muslim communities read out from their scriptures, explaining the relation of the passages to education (picture below).         
	Holy Mass        
	On January 19, St Xaviers College organised a Holy Mass, presided over by Cardinal Telespore Toppo, the Archbishop of Ranchi, as part of the institutions sesquicentennial celebrations.                
	It included an English choir, comprising 60 students of St Xaviers Collegiate School and a vernacular choir, comprising students from the college, who sang Bengali, Hindi and Nepali hymns.        
	Up ahead on Thursday, a cultural programme by students of the school and college.

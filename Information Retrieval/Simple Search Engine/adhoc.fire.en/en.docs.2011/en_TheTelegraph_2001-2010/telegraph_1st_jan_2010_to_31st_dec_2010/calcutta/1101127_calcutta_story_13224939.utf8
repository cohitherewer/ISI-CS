                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      ICSE board shifts course
          MITA MUKHERJEE                                  WHAT LIES AHEAD      ISC math and science syllabi in tune with national entrance tests  Environment education to be abolished but chapters will be incorporated into other subjects  Alterations to ICSE syllabi   First batch under new system to write exams in 2013      
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations has lined up sweeping changes to its syllabi that will impact over five lakh students in nearly 300 ICSE/ISC schools in Calcutta and the districts, starting with the Class of 2013.         
	The decision, which includes doing away with environment education as a subject, is in keeping with the Union human resource development ministrys pitch for uniformity in curricula across school boards.         
	The ICSE and ISC syllabi have undergone sweeping changes and we are ready to implement the revised syllabi from the 2011-12 academic session, Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive of the council, told Metro from Mumbai.         
	The Association of Heads of ICSE Schools put its seal on the proposed changes during a three-day meeting in Mumbai to discuss how to keep the councils curricula relevant for 20 lakh-odd students studying in the 2,350-plus ICSE and ISC schools in the country and abroad.         
	Arathoon said the changes in the syllabi were in tune with the recommendations of the Council of Boards of Secondary Education. The draft of the revised syllabi will be sent to the heads of each of the schools next month, he added.        
	The physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and commerce syllabi at the ISC level have been overhauled to make it similar to the CBSE curriculum, according to an official.        
	This, he said, had fulfilled a long-standing demand of ISC students that their plus-two science syllabus should be on a par with the CBSE course, based on which national-level tests like IIT-JEE, Pre-Medical Test and the All India Engineering and Entrance Examinations are conducted.        
	 The move towards a common syllabus for science and math is a welcome step. The current syllabus puts ISC students at a disadvantage in competitive engineering and medical entrance tests. Now that the ISC science and math syllabus wont be different from the CBSE one, it should be less difficult for ISC students to prepare for these exams, said Ismail Nehal, a former math teacher of St James School.        
	The commerce syllabus is also being overhauled to create a level-playing field for students aspiring to pursue courses like chartered accountancy.        
	While environment education or EVE is being abolished as a compulsory subject, it will continue to be taught as individual chapters incorporated into other subjects.        
	Some of the major elective subjects taught in ICSE such as geography, commercial applications and home science will undergo changes, as will the overall evaluation system.         
	All the changes are student-friendly. Those aspiring to do well in the national-level competitive tests will benefit the most, said Sujoy Biswas, the principal of Rammohan Mission School and treasurer of the West Bengal chapter of the Association of Heads of ICSE Schools.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sourav soft touch at school fest
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sourav soft touch at school fest
          RITH BASU                          Sourav with Harshita Bajaj at The Heritage School on Thursday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                   
	The moment Sourav Ganguly got off his blue BMW at The Heritage School on Thursday, he was as sure about his next move as he was about half-volleys outside the off stump.        
	He strode past the children who had gathered to welcome him, towards a physically challenged girl sitting in the distance.         
	The gesture won more hearts at Heritage than all of Souravs runs in IPL 3.        
	I was sitting there just hoping to catch a glimpse of him. I couldnt believe it when I saw him coming towards me. When he shook my hand, all the cameras turned towards me it was a nice feeling it was the happiest moment of my life, Harshita Bajaj of Class IV, the girl Sourav had walked up to, later told Metro.        
	The cricket hero left Harshitas side only after he was assured that another kid was on standby to help the girl into the auditorium where Sourav was to inaugurate the schools first fest, Youthopia.        
	The welcome speech by principal Seema Sapru after the inauguration was drowned out by the voices of 900 children from 14 schools who were cheering to images of Sourav on a big screen, waving his T-shirt from the Lords balcony, hitting sixes and celebrating his centuries. The loudest applause was reserved for a diving catch in IPL3.        
	Formalities over, Sourav was asked if he would like to answer a few questions from the students, and he promptly agreed. Only students were supposed to ask the questions, but teachers too couldnt resist posing a few queries.        
	The first question  if it was difficult for players with puritan techniques to adjust to T20 cricket  made Sourav step out.        
	Look at it like this. Try to get your technique right and it will serve you in all forms of the game. If you see the IPL3 batting records, top Test batsmen were the top run-getters, he said.        
	Along with Sachin Tendulkar and Jacques Kallis, Sourav and Suresh Raina were the highest scorers in IPL 3.        
	The next question by Satyaki Ganguly of St Thomas was on the young left hander: does sir see a shadow of himself in Raina?        
	No, said Sourav, and then added: I would rather name Gautam Gambhir. He has scored runs in all forms of the game. Raina will have to score a lot of Test match runs before he can be compared with me or even Gambhir.        
	The southpaw stressed the need for physical fitness during the interaction. Just like you wont do well if you start studying three days before an examination, you wont do well in international sports unless you have prepared throughout the year.        
	What goes through your mind when you have scored six in 14 balls in a T20 match, asked another student. Sourav didnt bat an eyelid before responding: I try not to get to that situation but with bowlers bowling well it can happen. Then I simply think I have to make up for this and I can.        
	Arundhati Gupta, an alumnus of The Heritage School now studying biotechnology at Souravs alma mater St Xaviers College, made Sourav think with a simple question: What was your best moment in this IPL?        
	After puffing his cheeks and looking at the ceiling for about 30 seconds, the former Team India skipper said with some amount of embarrassment: Well, personally, it was the 500-odd (493) runs I scored. But it doesnt matter because KKR is still looking for its best moment.        
	Laughter blurted out. Sportingly, Sourav joined in.

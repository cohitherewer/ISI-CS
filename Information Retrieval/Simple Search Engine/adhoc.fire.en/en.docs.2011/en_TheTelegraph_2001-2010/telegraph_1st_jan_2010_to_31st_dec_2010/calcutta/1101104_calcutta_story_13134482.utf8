The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Script check time halved

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations is trying to slash the evaluation period by half.        
	To ensure that the answerscripts for the 2011 ICSE and ISC exams are evaluated in less than 10 days, instead of the 20-plus days now, the council plans to engage more examiners, advance the exams, reduce the gap between exam days and keep a strict eye on schools so that they send enough teachers for the evaluation.        
	The more the examiners in the evaluation camps, the faster we will be able to complete the process. An increased number of examiners is also needed to ensure quality in the evaluation process, said Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive and secretary of the council.        
	In a provisional exam time-table prepared by the council, February 28 has been fixed as the date of commencement of the 2011 exams, an advancement by a day or two.        
	The space between two exams is also being reduced to ensure early completion.        
	The centralised evaluation process lasted 18 to 20 days this year, triggering resentment among students and guardians.         
	In most schools, the academic sessions had started by April 7 but classes were irregular as many teachers were busy at the evaluation camps.        
	The evaluation camps for some subjects went on till April 25, though the council had promised to wrap things up by April 7.        
	The primary cause for the delay, the council later realised, was schools sending inadequate number of teachers for the camps.        
	Sujoy Biswas, the principal of Ram Mohan Mission School and the treasurer of the Association of Heads of ICSE/ISC Schools, admitted the problem and said they had urged schools to abide by the councils directive.        
	Some schools are suffering because the authorities of a number of institutions are not sending enough teachers. This trend needs to stop for the sake of the students, said the principal of a reputable ICSE school in central Calcutta.        
	The council will seek detailed information from the schools about the teachers they would be recommending for the evaluation camps.         
	This will be used to check if the schools are complying with the council order, failing which appropriate action will be taken, said an official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Winter date with Aussie attraction 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Winter date with Aussie attraction 
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          A kangaroo with her baby in her pouch                                  
	Calcutta can catch four kangaroos on the hop this winter  but only after Ricky Ponting and his men have left the Indian shores.        
	The Alipore zoo is in the process of procuring two pairs of kangaroos, the national symbol of Australia.         
	The kangaroos have to be acquired through an exporter. We have started talks and are checking the credentials of some exporters. We had a kangaroo 10-12 years back. No Indian zoo has a kangaroo now, said Raju Das, the zoo director.         
	According to the plan, the kangaroos would be in Alipore in winter, by when the Australian cricket team would leave the country after a short tour.         
	The zoo authorities want to keep two male and two female kangaroos since it is the norm to keep the opposite sexes of a species together.        
	Getting kangaroos is part of a slew of projects to upgrade and restructure the zoo. The plans include setting up of a 60,000sq ft glass-fronted open-air enclosure for tigers. The open-air enclosure that houses tigers now is spread over 4,000sq ft.         
	The tigers will roam freely in the new enclosure. Its glass front will increase the visibility for the visitors, said Das.         
	Work has also started on a 30,000sq ft aviary where several types of water birds will be accommodated. It will be a three-storey dome where the birds will be able to fly around, added Das.         
	We will keep birds that can stay together, like pelicans, spoonbills and storks, in the aviary, said Das. Birds like the eagle will be housed elsewhere.         
	We have set ourselves a target to finish most of the restructuring and renovation work before the arrival of winter, said Das.         
	The zoo authorities are also procuring a pair of pure breed Asiatic lions and two pairs of iguanas, a type of lizard found in south and central America. They are being brought from Hyderabad zoo, said Das.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wally meets brand Writers 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wally meets brand Writers 
          OUR BUREAU                                                Wally Olins in a city hotel      
	Wally Olins, the man tasked with positioning Bengal for the global market, met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Monday and made a draft presentation based on the findings of his personnel from villages and cities across the state.         
	Very good and successful. They seemed very interested and enthusiastic. So far so good, the brand guru with signature round-rimmed glasses said after a series of meetings at Writers Buildings.         
	We made an initial presentation. You could call it a draft. Wed be ready with our final recommendations in about a month, he added.        
	Saffron Brand Consultants, Olinss company which the Bengal government has hired to polish the states image, remained tightlipped about the talks.        
	CEO Avik Chattopadhyay only said that among the points discussed with the chief minister was the unique cultural pluralism of Bengal. We discussed how all cultures are encouraged to co-habit and co-exist in this state. Something very unique about the state that defines it and makes it a unique place to live in.        
	Saffron teams interacted with several groups of people to come up with the presentation that the chief minister was shown on Monday. We shared our initial thoughts on what we had seen, heard and analysed. We updated him on our progress. The chief minister noted our inputs and shared some of his own opinions, said Chattopadhyay.        
	On Tuesday, Olins and his team would meet the advisory committee comprising various departmental secretaries of the government, whose job it would be to translate ideas into action.        
	We will start talking about the implementation programme at this workshop because it is they who will be implementing it. Were glad they understand this will not be a short-term campaign but a long-term plan that will have to be sustained for a few years, Olins said.        
	Tuesdays detailed strategy discussion will be followed by a month of further studies before the team returns to Bhattacharjee with its final recommendations.        
	That will be the real discussion over the brand idea, the time it will take and the people who will be in charge, Olins said. The idea is to help Bengal express itself better. There needs to be a change in the way Bengal is perceived both outside Bengal and inside Bengal.        
	There would be something in the recommendations for every one, rich or poor, in a town or a village, he added.        
	Asked if the government was a little late in taking up the task, with the Assembly elections, and a possible change of guard at Writers, only months away, the 79-year-old Olins asserted he was working for Bengal, not for this government.        
	Olinss presentation to the chief minister was followed by a separate 90-minute meeting with finance minister Asim Dasgupta.        
	The government described the meeting as very constructive but it would elaborate on it only after getting the final recommendations. For now, we can only say their field researchers are doing a very good job and they are doing it quietly, Dasgupta said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deb olive branch to Mamata 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Deb olive branch to Mamata 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Gautam Deb at the news conference. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Repeated snubs from Mamata Banerjee have failed to dissuade housing minister Gautam Deb from trying to ensure her presence at Hidco events.        
	Deb on Thursday held out a land-cash carrot in an attempt to broker peace with Mamata amidst a turf war in New Town between the CPM and the Trinamul Congress.        
	Mamata had mentioned in her budget speech that she wanted to set up a Metro link between Rajarhat and the airport but was not getting land.... We will give her both land and cash, said Deb, who is also chairman of Hidco, the implementing agency of the Rajarhat township.        
	Elaborating on his offer, Deb said Hidco would offer Rs 250 crore for the project and arrange for land to lay tracks spanning over 12 km.        
	Deb had earlier made several overtures to placate Mamata for the sake of New Towns development but all his efforts came to nought.        
	In February, Deb had claimed that he had sought the railway ministers help to end the impasse over the installation of electric poles in Chhapna mouza. The next day, Mamata rubbished his claim.        
	On another occasion, Deb had said he had invited Mamata to the inauguration of a mass housing estate in Rajarhat. Mamata again refused to oblige him.        
	The housing minister has written to the Prime Minister requesting him to lay the foundation stone of a central business district in Rajarhat.        
	If the Prime Minister gives his consent, other Union ministers such as the finance minister and even the railway minister would agree to attend the programme, Deb said at a press conference, adding that he would invite Mamata to the foundation stone-laying of another housing project.        
	Reactions from the Trinamul camp, however, suggest Debs latest peace offer would meet with the same fate as the earlier ones. He is trying to ensure his political survival by associating with Mamata Banerjee. We have nothing to do with him, said state Trinamul chief Subrata Bakshi.        
	New name: Deb announced that New Town would be renamed Jyoti Basu Nagar on October 1.

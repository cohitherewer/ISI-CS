                      Salsa summer                    Having been showcased in many Hollywood and Bollywood movies as well as a few popular television shows in the recent past, Salsa as a form of contemporary dance has generated a lot of interest amongst audiences. Right now, Salsa, as a social dance phenomenon, is ready to take off. Vive la Salsa (VLS), which translates as Live Salsa, was formed by Aditya Upadhya and Raghvendra Upadhya to promote a life of Salsa in eastern India, particularly in Calcutta. The institution advocates both dance and music forms of Salsa and other Latin American dances through classes, workshops and demonstrations, as well as social events for both adults and children. This evening, Salsero Aditya Upadhya presents a live Salsa session with the members of his group, Vive la Salsa. Open to all, this session will be organised every alternative weekends (Fridays/Saturdays). So the citys young and the young-at-heart can start tapping their feet, learn the right moves and finally get into the groove by partying the night away.

	Visva-Bharatis Rabindra Bhavan and Nandan plan to upgrade their storage facilities and ensure proper handling of the invaluable collections.        
	Rabindra Bhavan houses a small collection of Rabindranaths clothes while Nandan, the arts and crafts museum of Kala Bhavan, is a repository of textiles.        
	Nilanjan Banerjee, the special officer of Visva-Bharati, said on Wednesday that the institution had received a Rs 20crore grant from the Centre for the upgrade and preservation of the heritage of Rabindra Bhavan, Kala Bhavan and Lipika, as well as the creation of new museums.        
	Godrej has been commissioned to produce showcases for its textile collection like the ones in British Museum. A strong room will be constructed for its conservation.        
	Susobhan Adhikary, the curator of Nandan, said it had 2,000 pieces of textiles that could not be displayed owing to lack of space, which is also the bane of Rabindra Bhavan museum. Unlike Nandan, the Visva-Bharati textile collection is not stored in a climate-controlled room.        
	Both institutions plan to hold workshops early next year on textile conservation in collaboration with the Victoria amp; Albert Museum in London. This was catalysed by the recent visit of Lynda Hillyer, the retired head of conservation at V amp;A but still attached to the museum, to Santiniketan. Hillyer led a small team of textile conservators from the UK to attend Raksha, a seminar-cum-workshop on textiles held at Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, from February 20 and 27.        
	Hillyer, who has been visiting India for 22 years, says she is glad that there is increasing awareness about the necessity for conserving textiles. Museums are beginning to modernise and not relying any longer on experts coming from the West. The will to do is there even if one seeks the advice of experienced conservationists from the West, she said.        
	She stressed the need for hands-on low-tech knowhow  even sewing.        
	Returning to India after about eight years, Hillyer was, however, horrified that Indian women, too, have started wearing boring business suits discarding Indian textiles that are a feast of colour.        
	Hillyer, dressed in salwar-kameez, specialises in Indian and archaeological textiles, and was with the British Museum before joining V amp;A. When she was 20, she was smitten by a Mughal floorspread with poppy patterns at V amp;A and decided to work with Indian textiles.        
	Hillyer has since worked as a consultant with the textile museum at Mehrangarh in Jodhpur in 1986, and in Ahmedabads Calico museum, which has 13,000 pieces of textile that mirrors V amp;As collection of 10,000 Indian textiles.        
	Hillyer, however, has had no formal training in textile conservation and learnt on the job. She admits that even in the West it was the last discipline to be recognised. In India, object, painting and paper conservation are established disciplines. But textile conservation has not emerged yet. The Raksha seminar-cum-workshop (whose predecessor was Sutra in 2003) was brilliantly timed.

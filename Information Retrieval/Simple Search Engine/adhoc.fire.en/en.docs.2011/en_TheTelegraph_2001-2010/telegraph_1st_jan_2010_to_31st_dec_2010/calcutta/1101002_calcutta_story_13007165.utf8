The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pipe leak blamed for road cave-in
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pipe leak blamed for road cave-in
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A portion of Southern Avenue caved in on Friday morning, trapping the rear wheels of a taxi.        
	Civic officials blamed the 4ftx4ft cave-in (in picture), at the crossing of Southern Avenue and Sarat Bose Road, on a leaking underground water pipe.        
	The pipe sprung a leak while CESC was boring a tunnel to lay cables. Water spilling out through cracks led to the cave-in, said N. Bhattacharya, the assistant executive engineer, water supply, CMC.        
	A CESC official said no complaint had been lodged. But I will look into the matter.        
	The rear wheels of a taxi suddenly got stuck in the road around 8.30am. We rushed to the drivers help and pushed the car out of a gaping hole, more than three feet deep. There was no passenger in the taxi, said Uday Dholey, a local resident.

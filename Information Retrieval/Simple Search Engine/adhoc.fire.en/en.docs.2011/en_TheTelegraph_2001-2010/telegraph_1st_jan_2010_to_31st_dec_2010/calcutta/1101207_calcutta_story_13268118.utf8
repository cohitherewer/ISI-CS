	A fire broke out in a popular Udipi eatery in central Calcutta on Monday night, suffocating two employees sleeping on an illegally constructed mezzanine floor.        
	Seetala Udipi Hotel, the face of P-103 Prinsep Street for over two-and-a-half decades, had just downed shutters for the day when smoke suddenly filled the dingy interiors around 9.30pm, trapping four employees on the ground floor and another two in the mezzanine portion.        
	While the quartet on the ground floor used a ladder to climb out of a rear window, cook Littu Singh and waiter Mahesh didnt get a chance to escape. Firemen brought out the two victims, aged around 50, and rushed them to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital but both died on the way, police said.        
	Three fire tenders took an hour to put out the blaze, which spread rapidly inside the restaurant but didnt envelop other parts of the G+6 building.        
	Fire brigade officials said faulty electrical wiring may have triggered the blaze.        
	Survivor Devinder Sahu, 20, said the smoke was so thick that he and his colleagues couldnt even locate the doors at the front and the back. We tried to save Littu Singh, who was unwell, and Mahesh but there was no way we could get to them, he told Metro.        
	One of Devinders colleagues, waiter Bullu, leapt out of a window and brought a ladder that helped the other three escape to safety. Till late on Monday, the police were unable to trace the owner of the Seetala Udipi Hotel, popular for its dosa, utthapam and puri.        
	Fire brigade officials said they would file an FIR against the eatery at Bowbazar police station for the lack of basic fire-safety measures and the illegally constructed mezzanine floor.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Four Trinamul Congress-backed professors have been elected to the court and the executive council of Kalyani University, the first anti-Left candidates in 17 years to make it to the decision-making bodies.        
	The university court has 71 members, representing lecturers and readers, professors, students, non-teaching staff, officers and supervisors, heads and teachers of affiliated colleges, research scholars and registered graduates (students who have passed out of the university).        
	Two of the four Trinamul-backed professors elected on Wednesday will be part of the executive council and the other two will represent the court.        
	Since there was no opposition member in the executive council for 17 years, the university had been making academic and administrative decisions unilaterally. The election of the four would ensure fair governance of the university, said Pratap Santra, a pro-Trinamul teacher of the university.        
	The executive council meets every month to make major policy decisions.        
	CPM-backed candidates have won elections to represent readers and lecturers, research scholars, non-teaching staff and heads and teachers of affiliated colleges. The elections for the students and the registered graduate constituencies are yet to be held.        
	A Trinamul-backed candidate was recently elected the dean of Calcutta Universitys law department, the first non-Left holder of the post in 22 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll wives vote for house hubbies   Role switch at home with a smile
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Poll wives vote for house hubbies     - Home affairs portfolio changes hands in run-up to civic election          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                                  
	Khurshid Anwar, 41, wakes up at 6am to make breakfast for wife Sufia Shireen, 32, and sons Elhan, 7, and Ahsan, 4. He then gets the kids ready for school while his wife, a civic poll candidate, rushes off to a meeting. By the time Sufia is back from the campaign trail, her husband has left their Taltala home to pick up the boys from school. Sufia steps out again after lunch, this time for her regular job as a lecturer. Khurshid stays back to supervise the kids homework. When Sufia returns from college in the evening, Khurshid is a tad exhausted but his day is far from over. He must now escort his wife on a door-to-door night campaign.        
	Stay-at-home husbands have won a crucial vote of confidence from their candidate wives in the run-up to the civic election.        
	While married women candidates fielded by various parties in the civic elections are busy campaigning for the May 30 vote, their husbands have taken charge of home, hearth and children in a happy departure from gender hegemony.        
	 I am doing the household work so that she is able to spend more time meeting voters in the area. I also accompany her on the campaign trail besides helping her meet other electoral obligations. Being her husband, I think it is my duty to help her in every possible way, says CPM member and trader Khurshid, happy to stay behind the scenes as his wife finds her feet in politics.        
	A smiling Sufia promptly credits her husband with making it possible for her to juggle her duties as an Urdu lecturer at Sreerampur Girls College and a councillor candidate from ward 53.                    
	But what made this Taltala resident take the poll plunge  a prod from her husband or a desire to prove herself in a different field? He (Khurshid) is my source of inspiration but I also want to help people, insists Sufia.        
	Khurshid is not the only house-husband in town to have switched roles with a smile. Lawyer Ajay Agnihotri, 38, from Bhowanipore has also been doing housework in between campaigning for his wife Sashi, a Forward Bloc candidate in ward 85. I am trying to ensure that she dedicates her time to campaigning, says Ajay, who was a poll candidate from the same ward in 2000 and 2005.                    
	For Tarannum, who teaches at Surendranath Law College, thats more than mere support. The way he has adapted has been a revelation, she smiles.

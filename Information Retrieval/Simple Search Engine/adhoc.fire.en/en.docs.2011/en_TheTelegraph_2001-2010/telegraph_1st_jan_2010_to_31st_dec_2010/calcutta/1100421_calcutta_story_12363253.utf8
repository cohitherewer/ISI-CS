	lI was drawn to the first part of your punning headline, Jersey team prays for KKR purple patch (April 1), because I come from Jersey in the Channel Islands. Was it an elaborate April Fools joke? No. The story was about the woes of vendors of the purple and gold jerseys (picture right), whose sales had slumped with the teams poor form.           
	Lovers of Byrons poetry may recall The Destruction of Sennacherib, with its resounding opening couplet:           
	The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,           
	And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold.           
	It all ended in tears, with the Assyrian army being slaughtered. The presence of royalty among the ownership and the team notwithstanding, was it hubris to choose imperial colours for the KKR livery?

	Apropos Fans amp; fantasy Knights, dated April 20, there is no way we can get M.S. Dhoni and Suresh Raina to play for the Kolkata Knight Riders. So, we must make use of the best available resources. My dream XI:             
	Sourav Ganguly (c)           
	Brendon McCullum (wk)           
	David Hussey           
	Manoj Tiwari           
	Cheteshwar Pujara           
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla           
	Shakib Al Hasan           
	Shane Bond           
	Ashok Dinda           
	Murali Karthik           
	Raymond Price           
	Coach: John Wright           
	There is no greater lethal combination than John (Wright) and Sourav. I think KKR should buy Shakib and Price as soon as possible as they are real match-winners.           
	We dont need big overseas names, we need players who can win matches for us even if they are from lesser teams. Price is now the No. 2 bowler in ODIs, so why not hire him? Shakib is a better all-rounder than (Angelo) Mathews as he is more consistent and his spin bowling is deadlier.           
	Reserve players: Brad Hodge, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Andrew Flintoff, Sourashish Lahiri, Kyle Mills and Hashim Amla.           
	Subhobrata Basu,           
	Ballygunge Station Road                     
	My KKR playing XI :           
	Sourav Ganguly (c)           
	Shane Watson           
	Chris Gayle           
	Robin Uthappa           
	Saurabh Tiwary           
	Andrew Symonds           
	Wriddhiman Saha (wk)           
	Pragyan Ojha           
	Murali Kartik           
	Dale Steyn           
	Ashok Dinda           
	Owner : Shah Rukh Khan           
	Coach : Dav Whatmore           
	Bowling coach : Wasim Akram           
	Sankhadip Bhadra,           
	New Raipur Road                     
	I am quite satisfied with the 2011 dream team mentioned in Metro. I would, however, prefer Bond in place of Pietersen and Pragyan Ojha in place of Zaheer Khan.           
	Arkadeep Halder,           
	Address not mentioned                     
	 I completely agree with the KKR 2011 dream team. Its a fantastic team.           
	Raunak Nath,           
	Address not mentioned                               
	I am writing this letter after reading the article Exam blues in the time of T20 fever, February 18, where some students have spoken about their dilemma as their board exams were clashing with some sports event.             
	I just want to ask one question: is that event more important than board exams? I would request Metro not to publish articles that belittle an important event like an examination.           
	Instead, please publish articles that encourage students to devote more time and energy into productive activities like studies or maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

	Apropos Eden loyalty goes for a 6 (March 18), it is a matter of great shame that a section of the Eden crowd preferred to cheer Chennai Super Kings instead of the Kolkata Knight Riders. Will those liberals who commented Its just one private club facing another or There were Indians on both sides to justifying their support for the Chennai team, care to answer why Mumbaikars did not support Deccan Chargers at the expense of their own city team at Brabourne stadium or Delhiites didnt root for KKR at Kotla?             
	I feel there exists a band of people in the city who always try to distance themselves from all things Calcutta, Bengal or Bengali, lest they get branded parochial. And the other set, despite settling in Calcutta to exploit its resources, is disloyal enough to harbour a dislike towards the ethos, culture and interests of the city which provide them their bread and butter. These are the very reasons why the Eden Gardens emerged as the only stadium in the country where the visitors got cheered instead of the local team. If the Calcuttans had an iota of self respect and loyalty to the soil, then Dhoni would have been the last man to get applauded at Eden because it was he who played the pivotal role in forcing Sourav Ganguly into retirement when the southpaw was in the best form of his career.           
	Kajal Chatterjee,           
	Sodepur                               
	While Calcutta reels under a severe power shortage, the state power minister feels that the fact that he assumed office only a few months ago is justification enough for the continuing distress of citizens.             
	The disturbing pictures of coal being looted from wagons by villagers have raised alarming questions (The dark truth at the heart of the darkness that descends every evening, April 16). The police standing witness to this awful felony furthers the concerns. Given the crisis, use of alternative sources of energy should be made. India has hydel power plants but their numbers are not enough. Again, the suns rays are strong here, but solar cells are not utilised to tap this source of energy.           
	Citizens can also do their bit to tackle the menace, by cutting down on unnecessary power consumption. Among other things, cellphone chargers should not be plugged in after charging is complete, ACs should not be overused, computers should be shut down instead of putting them on stand-by mode and lights and fans must be switched off when not required.           
	Abhirup Bhunia,           
	Bansdroni Place                     
	There is no doubt that local political leaders, cops, musclemen and the administration are hand in glove with the looters at Borjore coal mine and each is getting his cut.           
	According to law, buying stolen property is also a crime. If buying of looted coal can be stopped, the looting will stop automatically. The police can at least trail and nab the middlemen and the owners of illegal dump yards in the Ranigunj-Asansol belt who buy the stolen coal from looters.           
	However, it is unlikely that the police have not thought of this solution. Hence, it appears that the police are profiting from both the sellers and the buyers of the stolen coal. This is the reason that police officers are so audacious as to issue coupons to looters.           
	Govind Das Dujari,           
	Diamond Harbour Road                     
	I remember once I had witnessed a coal crushing plant at the Kolaghat thermal power station breaking down as the coal had large stones hidden inside. These stones were added to the wagon that brought the coal to balance the weight of the coal stolen on the way. Many such nefarious means are adopted to plunder the nations wealth.           
	CESC has been bringing coal rakes for power generation under private security for quite some time. And the cost of additional surveillance gets added to the cost of unit generation.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	With the World Cup being beamed on the small screen, even robbers are choosing TVs over other electronic goods.        
	A gang of four on Monday night beat the owner of a Bally shop unconscious and fled with 15 TV sets and cash.        
	One of the gang members visited the shop around 9.45pm and booked a 32-inch LCD television set and a double-door fridge paying Rs 2,000 and promising to return within half an hour with the rest of the money.        
	He returned to the shop with his three accomplices around 11.45pm, by when all the employees except the owner, 34-year-old Amitava Sanyal, had left and the neighbouring shops had closed.         
	The gang asked Sanyal to hand over the keys to the locker after threatening him with a razor and a pistol. When he refused, the four beat him up, locked him in the shop and left with the TV sets and money in a car that was waiting outside, said police.

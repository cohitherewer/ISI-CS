The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strike City in reverse gear
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Strike City in reverse gear
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA              dreaded deja vu: Six days of disruption in four weeks            June 26: Citu transport strike             July 5: Left bandh            July 15 amp; 20: Taxi strike             July 21: Mamata rsquo;s weekday rally            July 23: Fuel pump strike                                            
	Strike. Bandh. Strike. Strike. Rally. Strike. The city has been stumbling from one crippler to another this past month with political parties taking turns to derail life and heap torment  all for the people.        
	From two shutdowns on the same issue and a weekday rally paralysing life to taxi and petrol pump strikes, June 26 to July 26 has brought with it a sense of dreaded deja vu.        
	Politicians see in this the pre-natal pangs of change, while political scientists spy an indication of the people we are.        
	These frequent strikes and disruptions are a reflection of who we are as a people and our politicians are part of that society, said sociologist Prashanta Roy.        
	A leader of the CPMs labour arm tweaked the argument to his advantage. The disruptions are a natural consequence of the problems in our society. The Left parties call strikes on issues concerning the people and the people understand that, said Citu state secretary Debanjan Chakraborty.        
	Citu had started the cycle of disruptions on June 26, calling a transport strike with only a few hours notice. A bandh called by the Left parties followed on July 5. The issue the same as the one days before  fuel price rise.        
	Taxis owing allegiance to the Left went off the roads on July 15 to press for a fare hike. Calcutta braved it, hopping onto the Volvos or hailing AC cabs, but the wait was often long and taxing.        
	Five days later, taxi operators owing allegiance to Citu enforced a 12-hour strike  announced the night before  with bamboo sticks and stones following the death of a driver injured on July 15.        
	If the Left had stolen the strike show, the other side could not be left behind. Mamata Banerjee announced her roll towards Writers at a rally attended by lakhs in the heart of Calcutta.        
	There was development on her lips, but not a word on what purpose a paralysed city could serve for the people. Aamader shapath, aamader pon, dhongsho noy, unnayan (Our oath, our pledge, not destruction, but development), she roared at the traffic-stopper rally.        
	The Trinamul leader, the queen of street protests, had blocked a national highway for almost a month in 2008 to oppose the Tata Nano plant in Singur. Her partys electoral fortunes have been on an upswing since.        
	Like it or not, these disruptions have become a part of our lives. They dont surprise us anymore, said S.K. Ray, president of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.         
	At Writers Buildings, the attendance has not been over 25 per cent on any of the days of disruption. On the day of Mamatas rally, only about 4,500 of the 7,000-odd Writers employees had reported for work, though roads were clear in the morning. Most of those who came left around the time the rally started in the afternoon.        
	A 12-hour shutdown costs the state almost Rs 1,000 crore. Just spare a thought for the cumulative loss from the disruptions over the past month.        
	If the loss of a days work hurts poor the most, the loss of face bleeds the city in the long run. The message is loud and clear for potential investors  this state lacks a conducive environment for investment; people cant work here, said economist Abhirup Sarkar.        
	Senior police officers could not recall another recent spell of such unrest. But RBI officer Dipankar Ghosh, 58, knew when he last saw it. In the 70s, when we were young, these same tools of protest had added to the suffering of people already overburdened by problems. Forty years on, when other states are striving to make progress, we are stepping backwards, said Ghosh.        
	Economist Sarkar, too, saw in the spell the seeds of another doom. The situation in the 70s had spelt doom for the economy of the state. In the short term, the common people suffer. In the long term, the image of the state suffers. This cannot be good for Calcutta.        
	Sociologists do not expect the phase to be over till the ongoing political transformation is completed. Bengal is on the verge of a possible change of guard. The actions and reactions will be much stronger and frequent, warned Roy.        
	Congress leader Manas Bhuniya attributed the unrest to a growth in political competitiveness on the brink of a political change. The strikes and disruptions are not desirable but it is a democracy and people have their rights.        
	Leaders across the divide defended the unrest, paying Calcuttans a compliment that now sounds like a curse: political awareness.

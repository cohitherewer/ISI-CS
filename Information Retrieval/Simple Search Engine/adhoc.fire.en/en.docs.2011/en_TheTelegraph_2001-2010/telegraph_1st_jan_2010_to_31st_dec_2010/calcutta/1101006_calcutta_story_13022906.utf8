The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | High court upholds fair curbs
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      High court upholds fair curbs
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The Puja fair at Deshapriya Park will shrink to one-third its usual size after the high court on Tuesday upheld restrictions imposed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on the fair.         
	The civic body had directed Dakshin Kolkata Durgotsab Samity, which organises the Deshapriya Park puja, to limit the fair to 5,500sq ft.         
	The CMC had also asked the organisers to pay a special tax for permission to hold the puja at the park, which is owned by the civic body.         
	The puja committee had paid around Rs 3 lakh last year to hold the puja and the fair over 25,000sq ft. This year, the CMC has sought Rs 9.5 lakh for using 5,500sq ft.        
	The puja organisers had moved the high court challenging the CMC restrictions and the hike in rent.        
	Justice Indira Banerjee ruled on Tuesday that the committee would have to organise the fair within the allotted 5,500sq ft.        
	The decision on the fee hike will be taken later.

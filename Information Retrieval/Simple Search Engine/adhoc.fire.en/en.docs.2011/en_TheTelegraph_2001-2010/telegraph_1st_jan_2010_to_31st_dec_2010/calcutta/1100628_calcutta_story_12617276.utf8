The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fraud charge on probe trio
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fraud charge on probe trio
          OUR BUREAU                               
	A case of cheating and misuse of the national emblem has been filed against the trio who had visited La Martiniere for Boys last Wednesday to probe the death of Rouvanjit Rawla.        
	The detective department acted following a missive from the ministry of human resource development (MHRD). We got a letter from the ministry to start a case against the three as the ministry had not authorised them to carry out any probe on its behalf, said an officer of Calcutta police.        
	Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the board of governors, La Martiniere, said they were happy that the police had taken up the case. The school will co-operate in every manner possible, said Dhar.        
	Ramesh Bhattacharjee, Anthony Arun Biswas and Dilip Datta had entered the Loudon Street campus on Wednesday  playing the MHRD card with Shakespeare Sarani police station to ensure the gates would be opened  and demanded a report on the Rawla tragedy.        
	Bhattacharjee did a U-turn on Thursday and claimed that he had gone to the school in a personal capacity to discuss the inclusion of Sanskrit.

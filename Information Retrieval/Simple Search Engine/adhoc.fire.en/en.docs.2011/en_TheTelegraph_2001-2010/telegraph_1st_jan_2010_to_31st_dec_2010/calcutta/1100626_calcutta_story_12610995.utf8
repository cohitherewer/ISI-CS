          A STAFF REPORTER                          The probe team leaving La Martiniere on Wednesday                                  
	The three-member probe team that had entered the La Martiniere for Boys campus playing the ministry of human resource development card on Wednesday is set to face impersonation charges.        
	On Friday, the ministry sent a letter to the commissioner of police in Calcutta asking that a case of fraud be initiated against the trio who had landed up on the Loudon Street campus to probe the Rouvanjit Rawla case without any authorisation.        
	Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti confirmed to Metro in the evening that he had received a letter from the MHRD and a case would be initiated accordingly against the three accused of misrepresenting the ministry.        
	The school on Friday wrote to the officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station informing him that it had been told by the MHRD that the probe team had no authority to visit the campus. We wanted to keep the police posted, said Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the schools board of governors. The trio had got the local police station to call the school to get the gates opened for the probe team.        
	The team led by Ramesh Bhattacharjee, whose calling card said member, department of secondary and higher education, MHRD but who claimed to be a member of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Parishad under the MHRD, had turned up to probe the Rouvanjit Rawla case and demanded a report from the school.        
	He was accompanied by Anthony Arun Biswas, the president of the All India Minorities and Weaker Sections Council, and Dilip Datta, a retired deputy secretary of the West Bengal school education department.        
	Under fire from the ministry, Bhattacharjee did a U-turn on Thursday and told Metro that he had gone to the school in a personal capacity to discuss the inclusion of Sanskrit. He was unavailable for comment on Friday.

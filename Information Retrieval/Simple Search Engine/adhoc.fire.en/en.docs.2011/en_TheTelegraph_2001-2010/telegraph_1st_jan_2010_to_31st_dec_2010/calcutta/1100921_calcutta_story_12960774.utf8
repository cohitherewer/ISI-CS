The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop at missing mom house
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cop at missing mom house
          OUR BUREAU                          The Metro report on the plight of Radha Das and her parents and son                                  
	A police officer visited Ganesh Gayens house at Kalighat on Monday morning, two months after he had lodged a complaint stating that his daughter Radha Das went missing after leaving for Gwalior on work.        
	The cops during the day also interrogated Binita Jhagaria, whose agency Sakuntala had got the 27-year-old a maids job in a Gwalior household in May.        
	Metro had on Monday highlighted Gayens futile attempts to nudge the police into action in a bid to trace his daughter.        
	The agency, which recruits women for jobs of domestic help outside the state, had claimed that Radhas employers were dissatisfied with her and put her on a train back home three days after she had reached Gwalior.         
	But Radha, abandoned by her husband, never returned to her parents and six-year-old son Subho.        
	The officer from the detective departments immoral traffic section who visited Radhas home on Monday asked her father to meet officers of Karaya police station.        
	Gayen had first approached the police station in August but the officers allegedly refused to register a complaint. The father then lodged a complaint with a city court.        
	I am not aware of any complaint filed about a woman by that name, the officer on duty at Karaya police station had told Metro on Sunday.        
	The cops spoke a different language on Monday.        
	Gayen said he had received a call from Radha the day after she boarded the train for Gwalior. She told him that she had got off at a wrong station and would call him again once she reached Gwalior, said the officer who visited the Kalighat house.        
	The next day Jhagaria told Gayen that Radha had reached Gwalior safely. Thereafter, there was no news from her, he added.        
	Joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen said the detective department was yet to take up the case.        
	Radhas six-year-old son Subho is still hoping that his mother would return before the puja with new clothes. We told him today that the police will find his mother, said Gayen.

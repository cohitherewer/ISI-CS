                      Tales from Taiwan                    Cine Central, Calcutta, in association with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi, is hosting the ongoing three-day Taiwan Film Festival featuring a slew of critically-acclaimed films. To be screened today: Orz Boys (Dir: Yang Ya Che; 4.30 pm) and Three Times (Dir: Hsou Hsien Hou; 6.30 pm). In Orz Boys, a pair of young troublemakers have a hard time staying out of trouble. However, despite their fondness for pranks and tall tales, they soon realise that maturity is catching up on them. As they struggle to stay out of trouble, circumstances threaten to tear their friendship apart. Three Times tells three parallel stories of women and men. In the first two stories, letters are crucial to the outcome; in the third, cellphone calls, text messages and a computer file. During the course of the tales, as sexual intimacy becomes more likely and words more free, communication recedes. Tomorrow: Chocolate Rap (a still from it appears here; Dir: Chi Y. Lee; 4.30 pm) and Cape No. 7 (Dir: Wei Te-Sheng; 6.30 pm).                  Event: Festival of films from Taiwan When: Till April 25; 4.30 pm amp; 6.30 pm Where: Nandan II

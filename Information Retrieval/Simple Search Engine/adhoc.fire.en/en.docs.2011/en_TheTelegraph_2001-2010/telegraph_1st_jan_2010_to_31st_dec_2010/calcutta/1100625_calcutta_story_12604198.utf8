                      Glamour and grace                    A little bit of fashion, a little bit of Bollywood and a lot of fun is the motto for tonights most talked about party in town. The fashion show will showcase an amalgamation line by leading city designer, Abhishek Dutta. His distinctive style is the fusion of ancient embroidery with futuristic cuts. Class, elegance and the allure of mystery is what the designer label has to offer. He prefers working with handloom and natural fabrics and experiments with asymmetrical cuts. Duttas label personifies an unmistakable combination of bohemian freedom with subtle sensitivity. His garments portray originality and creativity, the hallmark of his line. Thus, he freely uses a sari that has a mingling of kasab crochet and leather. Duttas style is also avant-garde at times, putting him a step ahead of the others. Featuring Bollywoods newest heartthrob Jacqueine Fernandez (picture right), who will set the ramp on fire in clothes designed by Dutta, this show will certainly be remembered for a long time to come. Also featuring Shayan Munshi and Arpita, amongst others. Choreographer: Pinky Kenworthy. Hosted by Seagrams Blenders Pride and t2.

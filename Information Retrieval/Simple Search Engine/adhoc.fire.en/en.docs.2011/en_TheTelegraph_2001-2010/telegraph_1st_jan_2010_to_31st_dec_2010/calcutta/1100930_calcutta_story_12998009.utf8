                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wheels found, but not killers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Oxytown murderers used suspect Avik Ghoshs motorcycle to flee after killing his wife Mausumi and their domestic help Parul on Monday evening, police said on Wednesday.        
	The motorcycle was found abandoned at Haridevpur, around 4km from the Ghosh familys house at P-19A Oxytown.        
	The cops have also found Mausumis cellphone and are now trying to gather the relevant call records.        
	Sources at Thakurpukur police station said the investigation team was now almost sure that Mausumi and Parul knew all or at least one of the killers. It may have been an inside job. The help was killed to eliminate evidence, an officer said.        
	Nobody has been arrested for the twin murders yet. Engineer Avik, who walked into the police station on Tuesday afternoon, was questioned till Wednesday evening but allowed to return home for the night. Mother Sandhya was also freed after interrogation.        
	Aviks father-in-law Shankar Dutta, who had accused his son-in-law of plotting his daughters murder, said the 35-year-old called him early on Wednesday and threatened him with dire consequences.        
	He told me that we would have to pay a heavy price for lodging the complaint, said Dutta, a primary school headmaster from Plassey in Nadia.        
	Avik had allegedly called his father-in-law on Monday morning to say that there would be a horror movie on all news channels at 9pm.        
	Dutta said he realised what Avik had meant after seeing channels flashing news of the murders.        
	The additional superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas, S.K. Chowdhury, said Avik and his mother were still the prime suspects.         
	A CID team under deputy inspector-general Anuj Verma visited the murder spot on Wednesday, followed by a team of forensic experts.        
	Mausumi and Aviks two-year-old son Avirup, presumably the only witness to the murders, is at an undisclosed location in Thakurpukur and nobody except close relatives from the mothers side are being allowed to meet him.        
	Avirup and his eight-month-old sister need proper care. So we have sent them to a secure place, said an officer.         
	Headmaster Dutta said his two grandchildren were in the house of a member of a local club.        
	Avirups screams had alerted neighbours to the twin murders on Monday night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Life-term for Banka killer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Life-term for Banka killer
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday commuted the death sentence awarded to the killer of the Bankas of Camac Street to life imprisonment.        
	A sessions court had in November 2008 sentenced Kevalram Rai to death for killing his former employers Tara Chand Banka, 68, and Sardadevi Banka, 65.        
	The high court division bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice A.K. Roy said the death sentence was being commuted considering Kevalrams age.        
	Kevalram is now only 34. Given a chance, he may be rectified and made to realise the gravity of the crime he had committed. Moreover, he had no previous crime records. So the court is commuting his death sentence to life term in jail, the bench ruled following an appeal by the convict against the death sentence.        
	Kevalram was present in the court when the verdict was announced. His lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee said his client would move the Supreme Court seeking acquittal.        
	On April 18, 2005, residents of the multi-storeyed Manas Sarovar had found the main door of the Bankas seventh-floor flat broken.        
	Stepping in, they found Tara Chands body on a divan in the drawing room and Sardadevis in a bedroom.        
	Rai, who had quit his job as the Bankas domestic help a few weeks earlier, was picked up two months later from his home in Bihar. He had allegedly taken away Rs 2 lakh and jewellery worth Rs 12 lakh while fleeing.        
	 Emergency landing: The pilot of a Deccan flight from Jamshedpur, with 17 passengers, sought permission for emergency landing at Calcutta after an engine developed a snag on Friday. The snag, however, had been managed by the time the plane landed.

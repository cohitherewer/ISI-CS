                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      After dark, whiff of fear on meet amp; eat street
  - Regulars and residents complain of rowdy gangs and drunken scenes in upscale locality          OUR BUREAU                          Azad Hind is losing some of its family clientele because of its lack of crowd control                                        
	Suranjita Gupta was a regular at the Ballygunge Circular Road dhabas, till she started feeling uneasy and unsafe. It used to be our night hangout for good ol dhaba food. But we stopped going about a year back because the crowd was too rowdy and the cops couldnt be bothered, says the 28-year-old architect.        
	The sound of screeching tyres and the whiff of liquor-laced trouble fill the late-night air on the 100-metre stretch between two popular dhabas  Azad Hind and New Sharma Hotel  on upscale Ballygunge Circular Road.        
	Sujan Sengupta, a Class XI student, rues that his favourite meet-and-eat street has gone rotten. It was a convenient location for a cheap but wholesome meal. We would go there every other night, but stopped around six months ago as the crowd changed drastically, with drunken brawls a regular affair.        
	The likes of Suranjita and Sujan may have shifted allegiance and drifted elsewhere  though the hungry party crowd city is starved of non five-star options  but what about residents of Ballygunge Circular Road caught between the two all-night dhabas?        
	Hear it from Supriya Mukherjee of Mousumi, the highrise a shout away from Sharma dhaba. The boys and girls in cars and bikes eat and drink, shout and fight, while blaring music from stereos. They often race with their bikes, screech and honk in the middle of the night, not bothering that this is a residential area. Brawls often break out and we can hear glass bottles being smashed on the road.         
	But why dont the residents call in the cops? A patrol van is often parked near Sharma or Azad Hind; the cops do precious little  apart from feasting on the dhaba grub and turning a blind eye.                        Residents of the area have complained of the rowdyism outside Sharma dhaba      
	A disc jockey, who has been a regular at the two dhabas for the past 10 years, blames this becoming a danger zone on police inaction. The family crowd has stopped feeling safe here. How can the police allow such a prime locality to be overrun so blatantly by dubious elements?        
	Azad Hind and Sharma hit boom time about a decade ago, when the night club culture was revived in the city and partying every weekend became a norm for thousands. The famished party crowd started landing up at these dhabas for fare that was easy on the palate and pocket.        
	There is hardly a choice. Who wants to run up a huge bill after partying at a nightclub? And at the end of the day (or rather night) Dal Makhani, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Tandoori Roti means comfort food, explains an Azad Hind regular.        
	A meal for two is easily under Rs 200 and the hassle-free, eat-on-your-bonnet style service ensures a quick meal for youngsters running to meet curfew hour at home.        
	The precious few late-night food stops draw the good, the bad and the ugly, confesses one of the dhaba owners on condition of anonymity. This is the dark side of the story in any city. Any eating place that stays open late and is very affordable, will attract a certain kind of crowd, apart from the regular family-and-friends clientele, he says, claiming that the police are alerted at the slightest hint of trouble.

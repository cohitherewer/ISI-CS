	Calcutta airport goes from frustrating to fearful as evening sinks into night.        
	If touts hound passengers by day, passengers are forced to hunt for them by dark. Their Dada, taxi lagbe? becomes our helpless Dada, taxi achhe?        
	Metro spent four hours outside the domestic terminal from 8.30pm on Sunday to see how scary it is for someone touching down late.        
	PRE-PAID PAIN        
	Two of the three counters are shut by 10pm. The only one open, inside the terminal, had over a hundred in queue.        
	Manish Sharma, who flew in from Jaipur, thought he would skirt the crowd and buy a taxi ticket from a booth outside. There was a slight problem: the counters were shut.        
	Sharma started walking towards the taxi stand. There were some private vehicles, waiting to make a killing, but none of them would go to Howrah. They had more lucrative options in hand. A middle-aged man agreed to pay Rs 800 for a ride to Chetla  over three times the normal rate.        
	Sharma kept walking till he reached the western end of the parking area, where he found over a dozen others like him waiting for a taxi.        
	There, taxis yellow and white  that should have picked up passengers from the pre-paid stand  were exploiting the need gap to the hilt, demanding rates double or triple the normal amount. Not a single policeman was in sight.        
	The moment a taxi appeared, scores of people surrounded it and chorused Dada, jaben?         
	He is demanding Rs 550 for Howrah, Sharma told Metro. The last time I came, my brother had come to pick me up, he added, regretting telling his brother he could manage the home stretch on his own this time.        
	STAND-UP FARCE        
	Manish Sharma may have had more to regret had he braved the queue at the taxi booth. For, that is no guarantee of a smooth ride home.        
	Samir Kumar Bhowmick bought a taxi ticket from the BTA counter at 10.58pm. He wanted to reach his Salt Lake home fast. His eight-year-old daughter Tiyasha was hungry.         
	It took the Coal India official coming from Raipur an hour to find a taxi for the 20-minute drive.        
	First, he could not find the vehicle whose number the official at the counter had jotted down. The other waiting taxi drivers couldnt care less about his plight. Bhowmick walked up and down the lane several times. The cab must have headed straight for fleece point at the corner of the parking zone.        
	Nearly 15 minutes later, a cabbie told Bhowmick to get a new token. Woh taxi nikal gaya. Uska kuchh kaam tha (That taxi has left. The driver had some work), quipped another driver.         
	As his wife and daughter waited, Bhowmick went back to the counter. It was 11.15pm.        
	The second taxi he found easily. But before the family could get in, the driver rattled off a rider. I will take an extra passenger in the front seat.         
	Bhowmick protested. I have my wife and daughter with me. Why would I allow a stranger in the cab?        
	The driver shot back: No one will agree to travel such a short distance without extra passengers in front.        
	Not a cop could be found as Bhowmick stood his rightful ground, arguing with the taxi driver for 10 minutes in the parking lot.        
	A CISF jawan stepped in only after Metro alerted him about Bhowmicks harassment. He took the driver to the airport managers room.         
	Bhowmick walked back to the taxi counter. He got a new ticket with a new number. For the third time in 45 minutes.        
	The familys ordeal ended close to midnight. This happens only in Calcutta and earns our city a bad name, said Bhowmick, before boarding the taxi.              
	SHUTTERS DOWN        
	The Volvo bus service stops at 8pm. By 10pm, Wenz Cars, which runs a fleet of pre-paid taxis, downs shutters.              
	The only option available to the grounded passenger is the Bengal Taxi Association (BTA) booth, with the never-ending queue.        
	But ask airport officials and theyd tell you the pre-paid services are available and run normally through the night.        
	Regular fliers said that the booths had not shut shop early because it was a Sunday. It is the same through the week, said a salt-and-pepper man who luckily had his car waiting for him.        
	Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officers said they took action whenever a passenger lodged a complaint. Our primary responsibility is to maintain order inside the terminal. But we post personnel outside to check the harassment of commuters, claimed a senior officer.        
	But it is not possible to post personnel at the taxi stand, he added.              
	RICKSHAW RIDE        
	If you complain about lack of travel options from the airport, the authorities may well point at the row of rickshaws where taxis ought to be.        
	Caught between officials who couldnt care less and taxis who only care for more, passengers with luggage were seen paying Rs 40 to reach VIP Road, 500 metres away, hoping to get a bus or a taxi to take them home from there.        
	Predictably, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Rahul Srivastava blamed lack of manpower for the mess.        
	We have little traffic police strength. Hence it is not always possible for us to deploy traffic personnel at night, he said.

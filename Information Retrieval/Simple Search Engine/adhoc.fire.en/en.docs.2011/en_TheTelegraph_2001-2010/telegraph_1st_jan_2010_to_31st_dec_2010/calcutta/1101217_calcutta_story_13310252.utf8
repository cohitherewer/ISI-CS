          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          National Library                                  
	The National Library has been gifted a huge collection of manuscripts of mangalkavyas and vaishnav padavalis, some of them canonical texts of medieval Bengali literature, which once belonged to scholar and linguist Sukumar Sen.        
	The more than 900 manuscripts in the collection, microfilmed a decade ago as part of the South Asia Microfilm Project at the Center for Research Libraries, a global resources network based at the University of Chicago, are now available for readers at the National Library collection.        
	Forty-six reels of microfilm reached the library on December 13, said Swapan Chakravorty, director, National Library. He hopes that readers will benefit from such a rare collection.        
	Sens collection was acquired by the South Asia Microfilm Project when, the Center for Research Libraries website says, Rebecca Manring of Indiana University stumbled upon a neglected private manuscript collection in West Bengal. The collection was brought over from Burdwan, where Sen was born. The original manuscripts remain at the Sen house in Burdwan.        
	The collection, described on the website of the Indiana University, Bloomington, as constituting the medieval Bengali literary canon, includes Chaitanya Charitamrita, Krishnaleela Rasayan, Dharmamangal, Rai Ramanandas Shri Chaitanya Tattva Nirupan and Sahaji Padavali and Jaganananda Dass Geetagovindam. Of these, the manuscript of Krishnaleela Rasayan belongs to 1269 Bangabda and Dharmamangal to 1237 Bangabda.        
	The manuscripts, some made of palm leaves, were cleaned, repackaged, catalogued and microfilmed by Manring, who was the director of the Sen project, funded by the South Asia Microfilm Project.        
	Those associated with the project later felt that the texts should also be made available in the country of their origin and Manring sent microfilm copies of the texts to the National Library. A catalogue is on the way, said Chakravorty.         
	He is enthusiastic about several other rare collections that the library is to acquire soon.

	When you stand nine feet tall and weigh three tonnes, you make your own road. Thats the first thought that struck me sitting atop Laxmi, our stately pachyderm at Kaziranga National Park in Assam. The park is as much grassland as thick forest.         
	From where the elephant safari started, all I could see were tall grasses, growing in such dense clumps that there seemed to be no way ahead. Even as I wondered how we would make any headway, Laxmi stepped right into the thicket and the tough grasses bent under her, almost in obeisance. Curling her long trunk around one clump, Laxmi collected her breakfast.         
	Some 10 minutes later, we had our first sighting, the great Indian one-horned rhinoceros that the park is famous for. Our guide mimicked its call, part oink part grunt, and the massive creature looked up. It was much larger than I had imagined. All of us went click-click. Over the next hour, we spotted several rhinos, who didnt seem to mind us at all.         
	The elephant safari begins at 5.30am, before the sun is up, and gives tourists an amazing opportunity to witness sunrise in the jungles.         
	The soft sunlight slowly drove away the curling mist. As the sun climbed the sky, we were rewarded with a rare sight, a deer feeding her young. One hour was up all too soon and the elephants headed back to the starting point. While returning, we crossed a gurgling little stream, its banks covered with the prettiest pink wild flowers. I marvelled at the serenity of the forest as Laxmi took a long drink.         
	Back at our hotel, we wolfed down a sumptuous breakfast  the forest air works wonders for your appetite. Taking a much-needed nap, we were again ready for the forest, this time on a jeep.         
	We were to visit Bagori, the western range of the forest. In the morning we had visited the central range, Kohora. The jeep takes the unmetalled road inside the park, taking us to parts that we didnt cover on elephant back.                   
	The first thing we spotted was an open-billed stork sitting beside a beel (pond), waiting for a catch. Suddenly a herd of hog deer crossed our path. We stopped the jeep at a distance and enjoyed their dainty footsteps. Up ahead, as the path took a bend, we saw the magnificent wild Asiatic water buffalo, its curling horns as large as a cycle wheel, wallowing in a pond covered in hyacinth. Nearby sat a grey-headed fish eagle; viewed through a binocular, its hooked beak glinted in the sunlight.         
	A while later, we caught a glimpse of a herd of wild elephants foraging amid tall grasses. The forest has a distinct smell, a little wet, a little mysterious.         
	Kaziranga National Park has one of the highest densities of tigers in the country, 86 according to the 2000 census. But the king of the jungle eluded us.         
	The next day, we had the option of visiting the eastern range of the forest, which is known for its birds, or take the jeep route in central range. Our hotel staff said the last tiger sighting had taken place in central range, just 10 days back. Of course, we had to go back to the central range.                   
	The jeep took us past dark green trees and I wished I knew all their names. At one point, we saw a tigers scratch marks on a tree trunk. Our guide said they were quite fresh, may be a couple of days old. We spotted a huge sambar deer amid the foliage and a pelican sailing along a stream. Still no tiger. We came across cute little turtles sunning themselves on branches and rocks in the middle of the stream.         
	Our jeep was winding its way through a narrow path, flanked on both sides by thickets of elephant grass. I kept my eyes glued to the darkness of the grasses, hoping to repeat my tiger luck of Jim Corbett National Park. Evening descended on the jungle; it was time for us to leave. As our jeep left the grassland, I suddenly felt fiery eyes burning into my back... I turned around. Nothing.         
	But as they say, in the jungle, you may be watching the sunset or the animals, but the tiger is always watching you.         
	Going        
	Take a train or flight to Guwahati and hire a car to cover the 220 kilometres to Kaziranga. The national park can also be reached by road from Jorhat, which is around 100km away. Kaziranga can be visited from October to April-end.

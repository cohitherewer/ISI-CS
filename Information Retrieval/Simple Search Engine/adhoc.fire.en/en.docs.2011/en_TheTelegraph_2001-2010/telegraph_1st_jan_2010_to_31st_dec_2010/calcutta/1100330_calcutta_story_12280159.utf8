                      A requiem for the present                    The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place; from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spiders web Pablo Picasso        Aloke Paul creates in isolation and then when he is ready with a rich treasure-trove of paintings, he tiptoes his way back to the din of this mundane world. His paintings then take over his persona and communicate in lieu of him. Pauls ninth solo exhibition of paintings, Symphony 2, reveals the alchemy of primeval colours that ravages and burns the eyes. His figurines relentlessly question us behind their faceless masks, their pupil-less eyes that intrigue us by their hands without arms, by their wires abandoned by an invisible puppeteer. Pauls works are characterised by the new trend of globalisation of tradition. His works reverberate the distant echo of our mythical past and through technique of presentation, unfold contemporary fervour. He inculcates traditional sources and concentrates the experiences in the construction of his paintings, where, through fragmentation of structural surfaces, he builds up a tragic consciousness  extracting out of mythical past, a requiem for the present.

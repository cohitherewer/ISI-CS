The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Robbery at jewellery store 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Robbery at jewellery store 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Gold ornaments worth more than Rs 45 lakh were allegedly stolen from a jewellery shop in Bowbazar while it was closed between Saturday night and Tuesday morning.         
	At 10.20am on Tuesday, Indrajit Dutta, co-owner of S. Dutta and Co. Jewellers at 129/1 BB Ganguly Street, opened the store and saw drawers had been forced open. The jewellery had been taken out.         
	The display windows where gold-plated ornaments and imitation jewellery were displayed were untouched. The burglars failed to access the vault.        
	We have received a complaint from the owners of the showroom claiming that gold ornaments weighing 2.431kg have been stolen. An investigation has been started, said joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.        
	An officer of the local Muchipara police station said the burglars probably removed a part of the tin covering on the roof of the single-storey showroom and broke the lock of a small grille gate on the ceiling to enter the shop through a secret door hidden from customers.         
	According to the complaint, the thieves entered the showroom through the roof after breaking the locked grille gate that had not been used for years. But when we went there, we found the gate covered in cobwebs as if no one had touched it. Only the lock was broken, said the officer.         
	The gate opens to a room at the back of the showroom. Investigators found discarded clothes and books in the room.        
	The owner of the shop has been locked in a dispute with the landlord for several years.        
	It is surprising that the jewellery was kept in drawers and not in the vault and that the store did not have security cameras, added the investigator.

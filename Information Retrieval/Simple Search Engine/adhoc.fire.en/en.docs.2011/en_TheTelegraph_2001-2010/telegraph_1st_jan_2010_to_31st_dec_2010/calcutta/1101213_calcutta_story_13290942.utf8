The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | School plots Bypass shift
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      School plots Bypass shift
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 5-acre Bypass plot could be the new address of South Point school, which is looking to implement a Rs 65-crore expansion plan.        
	The space at our disposal is inadequate and so we are planning to set up a new building with all amenities, said H.V. Lodha, a trustee of the South Point Education Society.         
	About 12,500 students study on the two campuses of the school  at Mandeville Gardens, where classes I to V are taught, and Ballygunge Place.         
	The school had started with 20 students at Mandeville Gardens in 1954. The high school shifted to Ballygunge Place in 1970. The two campuses together occupy less than 1.5 acres. There is no playground because of the space crunch.        
	We are looking for a plot of about five acres, ideally not too far away from our existing campuses, said Lodha.        
	According to the plan, both the junior and senior sections would function out of the new campus. We are planning large playgrounds and rooms for extra-curricular activities in the new set-up, said Lodha.        
	An official said the school is interested in a 5-acre plot off the EM Bypass and had approached the land and land revenue department to acquire it.        
	We had asked the South 24-Parganas district authorities to survey the land. They have done so and sent us a report, said a department official.        
	The school authorities have searched for land near the existing campuses for over three years without success. They had also written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in this regard.

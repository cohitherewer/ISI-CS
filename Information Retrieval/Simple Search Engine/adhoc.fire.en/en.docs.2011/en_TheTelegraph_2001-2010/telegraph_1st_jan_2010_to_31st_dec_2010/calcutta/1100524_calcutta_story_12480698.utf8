The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Baby dead in drain
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Baby dead in drain
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A newborn was found dead in a roadside drain in Chetla on Saturday evening. Residents were led to the body by a few strays tugging at a piece of cloth wrapped around the baby.        
	A tag bearing a womans name was tied to the babys hand. The tag is the only lead we have. We suspect the body was dumped on Friday night or early on Saturday, said an officer of Chetla police.        
	Sleuths were yet to ascertain whether the baby was stillborn. We are checking the records of private clinics to find out whether any woman of the name written on the tag was admitted there, said another officer.

          OUR BUREAU                          Moon Moon Biswas (left) bathes her daughter at Uluberia station where their train was stranded for five hours on Tuesday morning. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Active medical cells, special teams to attend to operational emergencies, food stalls with sufficient stocks  passengers getting off trains at Howrah during the bandh were in for a pleasant surprise.        
	A senior railway official admitted that he had never seen such a sympathetic approach of his department towards passengers at various stations. We are trying our best to help those who have been stranded because of the bandh, the official added.        
	The authorities of all stations were asked to ensure that there was no shortage of food, water, milk and medicines, another official said.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee has inflicted several bandhs on Bengal but her ministry was on its toes to help those affected by one called by her political rivals ahead of civic polls across the state.        
	It was intolerable on the train as the air-conditioning system did not function for five hours when we were stranded at Uluberia. But there was enough food and water at the station. Besides, railway officials came and enquired about our inconvenience, said Goutam Biswas, a resident of Barrackpore.         
	Biswas  along with his four-year-old daughter Tanishka, wife Moon Moon and 55-year-old mother Prabhabati Devi  was returning from Mumbai.        
	At bigger stations like Howrah and Sealdah, special teams were set up to interact with stranded passengers and look after medical, commercial, engineering and electrical operations. Each team comprised four officials and a few other employees.         
	I have never seen so many medical units at Howrah station, said Ranadip Nag, a BPO employee in Sector V who commutes daily from Uttarpara. Nag arrived on a local train early in the morning but was stuck for hours.        
	Twelve-year-old Mithun Sarkar fell ill at Naihati station. Mithun, a cardiac patient, was travelling with his parents on a Sealdah-bound Santipur local that was forced to stop by bandh backers. Railway doctors attended to the boy and arranged for an ambulance to take him to a Kalyani hospital, from where he was referred to NRS Medical College and Hospital. But the child could not be taken to NRS because of blockades, said a railway official.        
	Food was served free to the passengers of the Howrah and Sealdah-bound Rajdhani trains which were stranded at Dhanbad and Asansol and also to those on the Duronto Express, said an Eastern Railway official.        
	South Eastern Railway officials said special arrangements were made at Kharagpur, Tatanagar, Rourkela and other stations to minimise the inconvenience faced by the passengers.        
	At Howrah, handwritten boards were put up with information on trains stranded at various stations. I have never seen such information boards, which were being updated regularly, said Sanat Bose, whose relatives were travelling on the Rajdhani Express.        
	A large number of trains, including the Dhaka-Calcutta Maitree Express, were stranded at various stations and several others were delayed or cancelled. As for the Maitree Express, immigration and customs checks were over at 2pm at Gede station but the train could not leave before evening.

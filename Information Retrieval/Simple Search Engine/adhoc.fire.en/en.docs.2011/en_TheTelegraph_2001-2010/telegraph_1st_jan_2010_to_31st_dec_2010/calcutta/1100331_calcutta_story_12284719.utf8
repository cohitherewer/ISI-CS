                      A cool welcome to Nabo Barsha         Long live the sun which gives us such beautiful colour. mdash; Paul C eacute;zanne
  As the scorching sun glows in the horizon and the parched earth pines for some succour, it is time to usher in Shubho Nabo Barsha or Poila Baishakh in Bengal. The Crafts Council of West Bengal (CCWB) is all set to welcome the Bengali Nabo Barsha (New Year) with an exhibition of clothing and home accessories made from natural fibres. The CCWB is working in tandem with the tribal communities to produce natural-fibre clothing that is not only comfortable as summer wear, but is also environment-friendly. An interesting part of the show is a unique live demonstration at CCWB rsquo;s marketing outlet, Artisana, where tribal weavers are seen working with bamboo, sisal, banana leaves, jute, among other natural fibres, to weave clothing and home accessories that are ideal for summer and at the same time affordable and pocket-friendly. Other attractions of this Baishakhi exhibition include silver accessories and weaves like Mangalgiri, Kota, Dhonekhali, Bengal tant, Benarasi, Jamdani, etc. A timely treat for all shopaholics indeed!

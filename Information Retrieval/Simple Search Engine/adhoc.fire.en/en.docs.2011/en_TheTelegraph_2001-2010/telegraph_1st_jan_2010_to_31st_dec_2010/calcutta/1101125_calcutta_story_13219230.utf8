The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Walk the talk on day of duality
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Walk the talk on day of duality
  - Little to gain from loss of Rs 100        ZEESHAN JAWED                                                   
	Ramjan Naskar had first picked up a red flag as a 12-year-old boy when his rickshaw-puller father, Rahim, took him to a CPM rally at Kakdwip in South 24-Parganas.         
	Attending meetings soon became a habit and the 38-year-old man, who now lives in a slum along the Tollygunge Panchannagram channel, claims to have attended hundreds of party rallies in and around the city over the past decade and a half.         
	Ramjan dutifully maintained the 26-year tradition on Wednesday, reaching the Metro Channel armed with a red flag to merge with the crowd of faces at the Left Fronts show of strength. Every person in this crowd wants solutions to the day-to-day problems in his life. Thats why he is here, said the stocky man in a white shirt and grey trousers.         
	So what did he gain from Wednesdays rally? Nothing that he could show. And what did he lose? His daily income of around Rs 100 by ferrying commuters on his rickshaw.         
	 But we have to come to make the rally successful, protested Ramjan, reconciled to the high opportunity cost of attending a party rally.         
	Nothing makes the political leadership smile wider than the sight of the rally faithful, made up of those like Ramjan. Wednesday was no different with the turnout of around 8,000 people on Day One of the CPMs week-long programme energising those on the dais to holler about corruption in Delhi, conflict in Nandigram and investment in Rajarhat.         
	But Ramjans core concerns  two square meals a day for his family of four, proper healthcare and an English-medium education for his sons Shabbir and Karim  didnt feature in any of the long speeches that continued till late in the evening.         
	There was no employment opportunity in our village and my father sent us to the city to supplement the family income. But every office I visited, they wanted some knowledge of English, recalled Ramjan, who belongs to a generation that missed out on learning English with the Left Front government abolishing English as a subject in primary schools.                     Ramjan Naskar gave up his days earnings to attend the CPM rally. (Sanat Kr. Sinha)        
	Rickshaw-puller Ramjan doesnt want his sons to drop out of school like he did and is willing to work extra hours to ensure they get a proper education. His only worry is whether the education that he can afford will be enough for his sons to get office jobs.         
	I was born the son of a rickshaw-puller and I became one as I didnt know English. I want my sons to do something better. But I dont know whether they can achieve that without studying in an English-medium school, he wondered.         
	His worries got drowned in Biman Boses animated speech on the Trinamul terror.         
	I can hardly understand what our leaders are talking about, admitted Ramjan.         
	Did his leaders understand what he was talking about? They would have, if only they had cared to listen.

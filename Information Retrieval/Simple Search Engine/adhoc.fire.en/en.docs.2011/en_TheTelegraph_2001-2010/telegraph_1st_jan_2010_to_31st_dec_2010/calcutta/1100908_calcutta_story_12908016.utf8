  Turnout half at tech hub          A STAFF REPORTER                           A CPM flag in the middle of a road in Sector V on the bandh day. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	The attendance at Sector V hit a record low on Tuesday as the Citu shutdown forced at least half the workforce of the tech hub to stay away.        
	The Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which looks after the civic affairs in Sector V, put the turnout at 50 per cent but insiders said hardly 30 per cent of the employees could report for work.        
	I am disheartened... the attendance is one of the lowest in the past five years, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris.        
	Bandh attendance in Sector V usually ranges between 80 and 90 per cent. Tuesdays figure was a record low, said Nabadiganta chairman S. Ahmed.        
	Techies who are otherwise not deterred by bandhs from attending office said they did not dare step out of home on Tuesday because of the 24-hour duration of the shutdown, the possibility of violence with Trinamul vowing to foil the bandh and the Citus decision not to exempt the IT sector.        
	Records suggest that the only occasion when the Sector V turnout was lower than Tuesdays was on September 20, 2005, when a Citu bandh dragged the attendance in most companies down to 10 per cent.        
	The last time the attendance dropped below 80 per cent was in June 2008, when the turnout was unofficially put at 55 per cent.        
	Many companies  including big ones such as Tata Consultancy Services, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Wipro Technologies  suspended operations except for some critical processes. A few  including IBM, Capgemini and Genpact  worked with skeletal staff.        
	Most companies had asked employees to come to work only if they could or to work from home.        
	A 24-hour bandh is a logistics nightmare. So many pick-ups and drops have to be organised. Thats reason enough for most companies to shut shop, said Kar.        
	Attendance was near normal at most BPOs in Sector V, with employees, including some on the evening shift, being brought in early in the morning. But smaller BPOs and tech companies that could not hire cars to ferry employees to work and back home chose to down their shutters.        
	Those who tried to come to work by themselves found their ways blocked by red chairs and flags at the Mahisbathan crossing, the entrance to Sector V from Rajarhat Expressway.        
	I was going to work on my motorbike from Baguiati but was stopped just outside Sector V. The bandh-backers threatened to deflate the tyres but I somehow managed to pacify them. I turned around and reached office through another route, said an employee of a software company.        
	Some employees were stopped near the Benfish crossing. Some women employees alleged that the Citu activists had frisked them but the cadres denied the allegation.        
	We started picketing at 7.30am and no one from our organisation frisked or stopped anyone, said Somenath Bhattacharya, the general secretary of the West Bengal IT Services Association.        
	How can Sector V be spared the bandh blues? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man kills mother, himself
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Man kills mother, himself
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 38-year-old man allegedly killed his 65-year-old mother and committed suicide by hanging himself from a ceiling fan in their home at Viveknagar in Khardah late on Tuesday.        
	A suicide note found in the room indicated that Tarun Karmakar, who had a jewellery shop in Maniktala, was neck-deep in debt. Cops suspect the debt burden had led to the murder and suicide.        
	The domestic help of the family raised an alarm on Wednesday morning when nobody opened the main door after repeated knocks.        
	Through the windows, we could see Taruns mother Jyotsna lying on the bed. We then alerted police who came and broke open the door, said a neighbour.        
	Taruns younger brother Dulal died a year ago. His elder brother Goutam lives in a separate house in Khardah and their three married sisters live with their families.        
	The bodies have been sent for post-mortem.        
	There were strangulation marks on Jyotsnas throat suggesting that Tarun had throttled her before committing suicide. We are interrogating Taruns brother and sisters, said an officer.

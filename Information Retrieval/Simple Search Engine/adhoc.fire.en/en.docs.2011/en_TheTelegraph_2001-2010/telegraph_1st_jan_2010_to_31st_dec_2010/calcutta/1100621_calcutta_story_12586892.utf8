The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tall air tower denied
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tall air tower denied

	A new and taller air traffic control (ATC) tower earmarked for Calcutta airports modernisation project has been dropped because of a cash crunch.        
	The Rs 150 crore ATC tower has been deferred. This is not considered a priority, a senior Airports Authority of India (AAI) official told Metro from Delhi.        
	The existing ATC tower, beside the international terminal building, is 112 feet and the proposed one would have been taller, providing a better view of the airfield.        
	Along with the new integrated terminal, new parking bays will be added and most of those will be on the remote side. Clear viewing of the flight movement will be a problem then, said an airport official.        
	The estimated cost of the Calcutta project has risen from an initial Rs 1,942 crore to Rs 2,525 crore. This has been approved by the AAI board, but minus the ATC tower.        
	At Chennai airport, the other state-run airport where modernisation work had started simultaneously, an ATC tower has been built with new communication, navigation and surveillance equipment.        
	There is some good news for Calcutta airport, though, with the authorities finally deciding to replace the old radar equipment. The three radar at Calcutta covering the east, west and north and also the approach radar were more than 12 years old and needed to be replaced long.        
	Last week, Delhi cleared the replacement of the radar. We are now selecting a new site to set up the antenna, said a senior official of Calcutta airport. The monitors of the three radar will also be replaced.        
	The geriatric radar system has often been forced shut for maintenance and the ATC personnel have had to switch to manual mode while handling nearly 1,000 flights every day, including the overflying ones.        
	The new radar will help in better monitoring of aircraft movement, the official said.        
	There are plans to set up two more radar at Jharsuguda and Katihar for flights on the western route. The area is so vast that the Calcutta radar is inadequate.

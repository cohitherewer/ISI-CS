The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fresh yield hope for onion price fall
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fresh yield hope for onion price fall

	The price of onion, which had hit a high of Rs 55 a kg last week before settling at Rs 36-40, is likely to take another three weeks to return to the normal level of Rs 28.        
	The price should come down to Rs 28 a kg once the new yield reaches us. But that will take around three more weeks. Till then, the price is expected to hover between Rs 35 and 50 per kg, said an official of the Posta Bazar Market Association.        
	The Posta market leads the pack in wholesale trade of onions in Calcutta, with Kidderpore and Janbazar sharing the rest of the market.        
	The price surge has been attributed to a lower than usual supply from Nasik, which contributes over 80 per cent of onion consumed in Bengal.        
	Supply of fresh onion from Nasik, Ahmednagar, Satara and Pune (sent out from Nasik) has gone down drastically, said an official in the agriculture department.        
	Erratic rainfall in Nasik is being blamed for the low yield in the onion belt of Maharashtra, though some observers also cite hoarding and forward trading in the crop for the crunch.        
	Acres of onion in Nasik had gone to waste following heavy showers in October, more than a month after the monsoon usually bids adieu to the region.        
	At the onset of the season, when abundant precipitation helps the crop, the region received little showers.        
	According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Nasik and its surrounding areas have received over 270mm of rain from October 1, against the long period average of 121.2mm, resulting in a rainfall surplus of 123 per cent for the period.        
	Prabhat Kumar Das, a spokesman for the Federation of Traders Organisations, said: While factors like forward trading in onion have contributed to the crisis, the unusual October rainfall in Nasik is the main reason for the drastic cut in supply and the resultant price rise.        
	Data with various traders organisations suggest that the number of trucks from Nasik  each carrying around 14,000kg of onion from Nasik  has come down from 70-80 to around 50 a week over the past month. The supply by train came down to 20 per cent of the usual 1,20,000kg.        
	Onion has become precious. Its been ridiculously overpriced for about a month now. We have cut down consumption as a result, said Nabin Purkayastha, a state government employee whose family of four has restricted its onion consumption to half for over three weeks.

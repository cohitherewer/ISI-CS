The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Delay devil in Metro full dry run 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Delay devil in Metro full dry run 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Metro Railway has suddenly started a dry run of the extended Birji-New Garia route, triggering an average five to 10-minute delay for each train without warning commuters about the schedule going haywire.        
	Since Saturday, trains that would earlier change tracks at Birji (Shahid Khudiram) station have been travelling another 2km to New Garia in preparation for the formal inauguration of the complete north-south route.         
	The extra journey with the existing number of rakes resulted in services being delayed by up to 25 minutes on Sunday afternoon, but the authorities didnt bother informing stranded commuters at any station about when the next train would arrive.         
	 I kept waiting for a train for over 25 minutes but there was no announcement. When a train finally arrived at the station, it was so crowded that I was jostled out of a compartment just when the doors were closing. I came out of Belgachhia station disgusted and hailed a taxi to Park Street, Lake Town resident Shinjini Ganguly told Metro.        
	Although Mamata Banerjee is yet to decide on a date for the inauguration of the last stretch of the southern extension, officials said they would continue to run trains on the full 25-km route.         
	So are train delays back to stay? We are adjusting the schedule according to the extended route. There wont be much delay from Monday, said a Metro official.

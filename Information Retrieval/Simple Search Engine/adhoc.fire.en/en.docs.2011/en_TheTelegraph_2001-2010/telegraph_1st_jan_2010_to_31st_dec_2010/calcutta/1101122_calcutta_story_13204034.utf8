The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | World Bank scheme to ease water woes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      World Bank scheme to ease water woes
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The steady decline in the ground water level across the state has prompted the government to launch a $300m World Bank-funded irrigation project that will include recharging of underground aquifers.        
	The state water investigation and development minister, Srikumar Mukherjee, said the five-month project was aimed at making 100 per cent cropped area irrigable from early next year.        
	Recent studies have shown that the underground water level has gone down critically in districts like Purulia and Bankura following a bad monsoon. We need to act before the same happens to Calcutta and the other districts. Thats why we have taken up the project, which should take us about five months to complete, Mukherjee said at Writers Buildings on Sunday.        
	The project  named Accelerated Development of Minor Irrigation in Bengal  would also bring down the arsenic levels in the soil and crops, which are inching towards the danger mark, the minister added.        
	World Bank is paying $250 million for the project as soft loan and the rest will be borne by the government.        
	Government sources said the loan would not put much burden on the exchequer as it had to be repaid over 32 years.        
	The government has already received Rs 17.5 crore, which has been allotted for the setting up of the project office in Salt Lake Sector V.        
	The alarming decline in the ground water level and poor irrigation facilities in several districts came to light once again after 11 districts were declared drought hit.        
	The government came in the line of fire for its failure to provide adequate irrigation facilities.        
	The World Bank-funded project will also benefit pisciculture, poultry and livestock farming, as those involved in such trades will be granted access to the ponds and channels that will be dug up to boost the irrigation infrastructure.        
	A state-level steering committee, comprising the secretaries of the departments concerned and chief secretary Samar Ghosh, met on Friday to discuss the implementation of the project, minister Mukherjee said.        
	The government, he added, has decided to add teeth to and increase the ambit of the West Bengal Groundwater Control and Regulation Act, 2005.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC heat on laxity in fire safety
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC heat on laxity in fire safety
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday slammed the owners of two highrises for not taking adequate measures to prevent a blaze and upheld the FIRs filed against them by the fire department.        
	The administration has every right to start proceedings against the building owners for not taking adequate fire-safety measures, Justice Dipankar Dutta ruled, acting on a petition filed by the owners challenging the legality of the FIRs.        
	Gandhi Katra at 131 Cotton Street, owned by Rurhmal Chowdhury, and the City Centre at 19 Synagogue Street, owned by Mahavir Agency, are among the 15 predominantly commercial premises against whom the fire department has lodged FIRs.        
	The complaints were filed following an inspection by a joint team  comprising representatives of the fire and power departments, police, the civic body and CESC  formed after the Stephen Court blaze on March 23.        
	Metro had accompanied the team during the inspection and highlighted the rampant violation of safety norms in most of the buildings under the scanner.        
	Referring to the fire at the Park Street landmark, Justice Dutta said: Many people died because of lack of proper safety measures. This type of thing should not be allowed to continue.        
	The lawyers appearing for the petitioners dubbed the FIRs baseless and challenged the fire departments authority to lodge such complaints. They also claimed that the department had not conducted a proper inspection before filing the complaints.        
	The lawyer appearing for the state said the fire department and the civic body had called a meeting of highrise owners at Madhusudan Mancha after the 100-hour blaze at Nandram in January 2008.        
	It was decided at the meeting that the owners would have to take special measures to prevent fire on their premises. But after the Stephen Court mishap, it was found that some of the old highrises were yet to implement the guidelines. So, the fire department has lodged complaints against the owners of 15 buildings, the lawyer submitted.        
	The lawyer later said non-bailable warrants might be issued against the owners. If the charges are proved, the owners can be jailed for five years. Special commissioner (II) Banibrata Basu, who headed the inspection team, said the ruling would strengthen the drive against tinderbox buildings.

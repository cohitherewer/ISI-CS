The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Durga from Kashmir
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Durga from Kashmir
                              An 8th century copper alloy image of Durga (Bhadrakali) on a chariot and destroying Mahishasura, from Kashmir                             
	Durga, the 10-armed goddess, who is one of the most popular deities in Bengal, once held her sway over the entire sub-continent of India covering Nepal and Baluchistan, where she is still worshipped as Hinglaj and venerated by Hindus and Muslims alike. Margs latest publication, Goddess Durga: The Power and the Glory, discusses her many facets through 10 essays by scholars who are Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist and Christian and are from this part of the world as well as from the West.        
	The editor of the book, Pratapaditya Pal, has written an essay on Durga worship in Kashmir long before the arrival of Islam discusses her iconography as Bhadrakali and Sharada and that of mother goddesses like Indrani, and the deitys links with Cybele, the nature goddess of the Greeks. It is a fascinating account of how her image changes from region to region of India with illustrations of the same.         
	In a second essay he throws light on why the number of Shakta Pithas (pilgrimage centres) came to be fixed at 51.        
	Two essays that Calcuttans will find interesting are Susan S. Beans on the unfired clay images produced in Kumartuli, in the stately homes as well as in the apartment blocks of today during autumn, and Tapati Guha-Thakurtas on how the entire city is transformed into a space both real and utterly unreal.         
	Guha-Thakurta traces the origin of art pujas and how they have moved away from commercial public kitsch. There are also accounts of the devis worship in the south.         
	Plays on the bookshelf         
	While publisher Seagull, with its anthologies on Utpal Dutt, Badal Sircar and Manoj Mitra, stayed clear of Calcutta Book Fair yet again, College Street publishers of theatre books combated hurdles heaped by government and the guild  no electricity the first few days, inadequate lighting later, flies, mosquitoes and filth.         
	It is a wonder but buyers do come and I am confident my sales will top last years, said Sourav Banerjee at stall 277.         
	Sourav is a theatre loyalist and allows nothing that is not theatre to roll out of his Kalabhrit publications just as his father Sajani Kanta Banerjee did with Opera for over 30 years. In the last two years Sourav feels Kalabhrit has proved that the clientele for theatre books is growing.        
	This year Kalabhrit has launched 16 anthologies, all priced at Rs 100. Many of the plays are being published for the first time. Manoj Mitras Oshtodhatu has three new plays  the dark and mysterious Gandhojale, comedy Hanumati Pala Ba Mandodari Haran and for children, Fancy O Nancy.

SEBANTI SARKAR

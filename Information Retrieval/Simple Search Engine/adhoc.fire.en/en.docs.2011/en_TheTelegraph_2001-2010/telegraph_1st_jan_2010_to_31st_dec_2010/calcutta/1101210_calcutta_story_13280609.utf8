                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Brigade comes home to Salt Lake
  -   Houses turn into rally raj galleries
        OUR BUREAU              RESIDENT CRY: WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO OUR TOWNSHIP?             Trinamul Congress supporters sit on the boundary wall of a private residence in Salt Lake while hundreds of others attending Thursday rsquo;s rally near the Hidco office block the way.

	An army of 25,000-plus Trinamul Congress rallyists descended on a Salt Lake hospital zone on Thursday, trampling the tranquillity of the township and leaving many residents wondering if the Brigade had come home.  
	Party workers who had gathered to protest land acquisition by Hidco for IT companies in New Town-Rajarhat blocked the entire thoroughfare in front of AMRI Hospitals despite their leaders promising to leave one flank free after shifting the dais by a mere 20 metres on Wednesday.        
	The rallyists vandalised a childrens park  maybe it reminded them of the much-mauled Maidan  sat on the boundary walls of private residences and relieved themselves in the open as their leaders spouted long speeches on how Hidco had allegedly duped Rajarhats landless.        
	Even the bylanes near the rally venue were blocked by processions marching towards the dais. Vehicles parked randomly added to the chaos. A van stopped just outside our house and 30-odd people got down. They parked the vehicle in front of our main gate. We didnt dare protest, said a resident of JB block. People who live in Salt Lake are not used to such muscle-flexing, he added.        
	By 4.30pm, the childrens park resembled a garbage dump with food packets and Trinamul leaflets strewn all over. Tea cups, paper plates and puffed rice littered the main road. A slogan in black ink, glued to a piece of thatch, also lay on the asphalt.         
	Sobha Sen, a resident of BA block resident, surveyed the remains of the day and exclaimed: What have they done to Salt Lake?        
	She said Salt Lake was looking like Brigade after a rally. Only uncivilised people litter like this, added Sen.                  
	The saving grace was confirmation from AMRI Hospitals that no ambulance or car carrying a patient was held up in the rally zone. Our ambulances somehow made it to the hospital, but many patients relatives coming to visit them did suffer, said an AMRI official.        
	Apart from those at AMRI, the rally was a nuisance for patients and people visiting Columbia Asia Hospital, a shout away. A party harping on the word change should not behave like the party it wants to replace, said a patients relative forced to walk 2km to catch a bus.        
	A notice from the sub-divisional officer of Bidhannagar had prompted Trinamul to shift its dais from in front of AMRI Hospitals by 20 metres on Wednesday. Although it was the first known instance of a party agreeing to move a dais, the tokenism did little to ease the woes of those who ran into the rally.        
	For J. Mitra of HB Block, walking his Labrador in the evening, the rally may have smashed the illusion that Salt Lake was immune to many of the problems plaguing other parts of the city.        
	A resident of the township for 20 years, Mitra said he had never seen a political meeting blocking a Salt Lake thoroughfare like it did on Thursday afternoon. Going by the tea cups littering the road, it seems the rallyists had a good time, he said.        
	A conservancy team from the Trinamul-run Bidhannagar Municipality arrived around 7pm to clean up the mess.        
	If challenger Trinamul laid siege to Salt Lake, champ CPM chose its favourite disruption zone for yet another mid-day show of might.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee spoke and those who stood listening to him blocked the entire Rani Rashmoni Avenue in the heart of the city during a programme organised by the CPM union of state government employees.        
	There were less than 10,000 people in the audience, but it was enough to trigger traffic chaos in conjunction with a Metro Channel meeting organised by an outfit that claims to work for the rights of the rural poor.         
	Although the Metro Channel meeting is a small one, managing traffic with two simultaneous rallies on is difficult, said a cop.  
	 Outraged by the rally raj reaching Salt Lake?

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 51-year-old woman was crushed to death by a bus on VIP Road, in Baguiati, while she was crossing the artery with her husband on Sunday afternoon.        
	Bani Das, a resident of Hooghly, was on her way to her brothers house in Kestopur when the mishap occurred.        
	The woman could not cross the road quickly after spotting the speeding Barasat-bound bus. The driver, too, did not slow down, said a witness.         
	Dass husband Krishna Chandra, who was walking a few feet ahead of her, escaped unhurt. The buses were flouting rules as there was no cop.... When I reached the middle of the road I turned around and saw my wife lying on the road, said Krishna Chandra.

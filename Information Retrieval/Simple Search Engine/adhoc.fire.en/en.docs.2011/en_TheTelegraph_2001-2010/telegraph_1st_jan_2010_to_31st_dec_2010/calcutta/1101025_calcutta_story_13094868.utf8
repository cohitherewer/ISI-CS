                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Masked men in jewellery heist
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The empty showcases of the shop that the gang looted at gunpoint on Sunday. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Five masked youths snatched ornaments worth Rs 30 lakh from a Howrah jewellery store at gunpoint on Sunday morning.        
	The incident occurred around 9.45am, shortly after three employees of RK Jewellers in Keshabnath Mukherjee Lane had opened the shop.         
	Police said the gang completed the operation without any resistance and fled with the booty on two motorbikes that sped away in different directions.        
	They pointed revolvers at the employees and took away all the jewellery on display. Two of the youths stood guard outside the shop. They cleaned out the shop in little more than five minutes and fled before anybody could react, said an officer at Bantra police station, where an FIR was filed.        
	Owner Jisukrishna Ari, who lives on the third floor of the same building, was at home when the heist took place. I rushed to the store on hearing screams, only to find all the jewellery gone, said Ari, 36.        
	Investigators have named Aris driver, who was spotted standing near the shop when the gang had barged in, as a suspect. Driver Dinabandhu Debnath, 52, had reported for work around 9.15am but allegedly left without informing anyone.         
	His sudden disappearance from the spot apparently raised suspicion about his involvement in the robbery.        
	He could not have been abducted in front of everyone. We suspect Debnath was a source of information for the gang, the officer added.

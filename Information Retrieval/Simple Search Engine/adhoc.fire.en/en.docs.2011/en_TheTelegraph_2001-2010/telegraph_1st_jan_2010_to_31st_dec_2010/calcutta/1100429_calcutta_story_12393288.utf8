          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two drunk officials of the Punjab State Electricity Board were arrested for allegedly showing pornographic pictures to a female passenger and physically harassing an airhostess on a Delhi-Calcutta flight on Wednesday evening.         
	Rajwinder Singh, 40, and Lalpreet Singh, 35, were handed over to officers of airport police station after the Jet Airways flight they were on landed in Dum Dum. The two were to work in a project in Rishra.        
	According to airline officials, Rajwinder and Lalpreet were drunk when they boarded the flight. After it took off, they allegedly started disturbing a female passenger by showing her obscene pictures on their cellphones.        
	The two were forcibly holding their cellphones in front of the womans face. She protested but to no avail, said an airline official.        
	The passenger finally screamed and called the airline crew. An airhostess came running and asked the passengers to behave.        
	The duo then physically harassed the airhostess, who alerted other crew members. The two were made to change seats, added the official.        
	The airline officials complained to us after the flight landed around 8.15pm and the two were arrested on the charge of outraging the modesty of a woman, said a senior officer of airport police station.

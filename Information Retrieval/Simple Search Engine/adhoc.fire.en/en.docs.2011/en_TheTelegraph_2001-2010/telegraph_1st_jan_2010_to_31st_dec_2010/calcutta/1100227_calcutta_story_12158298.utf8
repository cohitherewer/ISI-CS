  - Mentors to budding entrepreneurs          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                Bijeta Choudhury, who runs an architectural school and a firm, talks to a member of NGO I Create Foundation, during its 10th anniversary celebrations, organised at Rotary Sadan on January 15                
	Bijeta Choudhury, 29, did not want to work in a nine to five job in an office after completing her Bachelors in architecture. I wanted to start a Bengali magazine on the same subject, but had no idea how to go about it. I approached I Create Foundation after reading about them in the newspaper. It was under their mentorship that I was able to start the magazine in 2003, said Bijeta, who now runs an architectural firm and an architectural school in Salt Lake.         
	Manda Das, 32, had to start working in order to supplement her husbands nominal income. I began selling garments from door to door with a Rs 4000 loan from I Create in 2008, said the Howrah resident.         
	After a year, she set up a shop with a bank loan of Rs 1.5 lakh. I am the highest earner in the family now, she says.         
	Papia Roy of Howrah has always preferred to walk off the beaten path. She was selling incense sticks, when the women in her town, Bagnan, were doing zari work.         
	I wanted to do something that would reap higher profits, she says. She took up candle-making a year later, mobilising the unemployed youth in her locality.         
	Now, she has seven young men working for her, who sell her products from door to door. I receive a fixed amount every month from the sales and they keep the profit, she explains.         
	These were some of the many stories that surfaced on the tenth anniversary celebrations of NGO I Create Foundation, held at Rotary Sadan on January 15. The day saw the entrepreneurs displaying wares like incense sticks and candles, batik prints, painted earthenware, badhni saris and kurtis.        
	I Create was started in 2000 to encourage young people to become entrepreneurs through training, networking and business counselling, according to Sreoshi Moitra, the director of I Create, West Bengal.         
	The foundation, that has centres in Jaipur, Vadodara and Bangalore, follows a training curriculum developed by New York-based Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship.         
	The training programme, varying from one to three months, includes modules on developing soft skills, business plan preparation, sourcing funds, sales and marketing, said Moitra.         
	We have helped about 400 people start their own businesses since we began, by helping them channel their own resources or by helping them get bank loans, explained Moitra.

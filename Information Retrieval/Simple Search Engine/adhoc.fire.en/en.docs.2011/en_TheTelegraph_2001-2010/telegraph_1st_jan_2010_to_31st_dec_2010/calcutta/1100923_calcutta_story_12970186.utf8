The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hurrah for husband
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hurrah for husband
          MOHUA DAS                          Devisingh Shekhawat on Wednesday. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	His wife was under a chandelier in the glittering ballroom on Chowringhee, surrounded by heavyweights from India Inc. He was under the tubelights of a nondescript hall in a lane off CR Avenue, surrounded by his brethren from his hometown.        
	Devisingh Shekhawat managed to find his own little spotlight, amidst artificial flowers and Ganesha vandana, as Calcuttans from Sikar in Rajasthan felicitated Sikarka laadla supoot (favourite son of Sikar) on Wednesday evening.        
	He was the guest of honour for a motley group of 50 from the Sikar Nagarik Parishad, Calcutta even as his wife, as chief guest, was addressing over 300 members of the countrys management elite.        
	So would he rather have been at the Oberoi Grand by President Pratibha Patils side than on the third floor of Sikar Bhavan at 1A Ashutosh Dey Lane? See, I have a symbiotic partnership with her, the President. We co-operate with each other like friends. Im 77 and shes 75, we have the pleasure to live together at all times, he told Metro with a smile.        
	Shekhawat was the star, some of it because of his roots, the rest reflected glory. Hes like our father as hes from Sikar zila. And his wife is the supreme power in India, said Damodar Prasad Bidawatka, the secretary of the Parishad.        
	We have some proposals  broadening rail lines between Sikar and Delhi, a university in Sikar, more lanes on the highway connecting Sikar and Jaipur.... We hope that he will convey our requirements to his wife, he added.        
	Shekhawat did not seem to mind the attention he was getting as the Presidents husband, but he did deflect focus to the most powerful woman in Bengal. Mamataji is right here with you. Is there anything that she wants that cannot happen? Please add my appeal to your list, he smiled, before tucking into a Rajasthani thali of dahi vada, kachori and gajar ka halwa.        
	Soon, it was time for him to head back to Raj Bhavan. The President was waiting.

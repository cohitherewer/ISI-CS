	lApropos Bengali to English (April 25), I would like to add the following to the list of Bengali words that should be included in the English dictionary:           
	Kaka: In addition to its original meaning of uncle, it is a universal call to fellow Bengalis, like Dada.           
	Nyata: A frayed dirty rag, hardly the equivalent of the English mop.           
	Algochhe: Drinking without touching the rim of the container to the lips.           
	Sogri: Denoting cooked dishes.           
	Kelo: A mistake, usually a silly one.           
	Alu-bhaja: Pieces of fried potato, but not potato chips.           
	Soumen Paul, Howrah                     
	I have one more to add  aabdaar. Its like a request, but more than that.           
	Indrani Chakrabarti, Camac Street                     
	lYou can also include aantel, which has come to mean pretentious or pompous.           
	Surajit Das, Dammam, Saudi Arabia                     
	The article reminded me of some English words that should make it to the Bengali dictionary. Topmost are heavy as in Tomar jamata heavy hoychhe and cali (short for calibre) as in chheler cali achhe. Also, women in Bengali are always in a group, never singular As in Aste, ladies, as heard in every bus in Calcutta, even when a lone woman is getting off!           
	Mohammed Iqbal,           
	Garden Reach                               
	Apropos the question Do you think theres an age for fashion? (Barlieland, April 18), its undeniable that todays child no longer likes to be treated as a child, courtesy the influence  if not indulgence  of their parents. But there is little that most parents can do to swim against the tide. Children are exposed to too many extraneous influences. Adults are not necessarily to blame.             
	P.B. Saha,

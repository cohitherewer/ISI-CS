                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Single screen doubles to surviveplace
  - Standalone Hind in Rs 7cr makeover to become Hind-Fame multiplex										      PRIYANKA ROY                        CHANGE IS HERE: Hind Cinema on Ganesh Chandra Avenue that will reopen as a multiplex this month. Picture by Amit Datta				                                       
	Born as single screen: 1947. Died as single screen: 2007. Reborn as multiplex: 2010.        
	Three years after it shut down, the screen(s) will flicker once more at Hind Cinema this month. The first AC movie hall in town will throw open its doors as Hind-Fame, the first two-screen standalone multiplex in the heart of the city.        
	A single-screen cinema is no longer a viable unit. We realised that early and decided to take the multiplex route, said D.K. Jaiswal, chairman and managing director of Hind Palace Pvt Ltd, that owns the Ganesh Chandra Avenue hall.        
	High electricity costs, wage problems, pirated CDs, dwindling footfall and the plex boom around town prompted the conversion from single screen to multiplex, at a cost of Rs 7 crore-plus.        
	Hind-Fame will have two screens with a total capacity of 703 seats  336 in Audi I and 367 in Audi 2  down from 999 seats in the single-screen cinema. The screens will be on two levels, each with a snack counter.         
	The refurbished hall promises the usual plex points. Pushback seats, Dolby sound, a superior projection system and a clean ambience  Hind-Fame will have all the luxuries of a multiplex, said Rishi Negi, chief operating officer, Fame Cinemas. The Fame properties at Nashik and Aurangabad operate on the single screen-turned-multiplex format.        
	Hind becomes the second single screen in the city to take the plex route. Two years ago, Ajanta Cinema in Behala moved to a two-screen format. According to industry sources, the iconic Metro Cinema on Esplanade could be the next to tread the plex path.                          
	In 2006, Star Theatre on Central Avenue was re-launched as a multi-complex  a single screen with restaurants and stores in the same building.        
	As central Calcuttas first multiplex address, the management of Hind-Fame believes that it has a winner on its hands.        
	We are confident that the property will do very well because the catchment area is densely populated and is a mix of residential and official establishments. Plus, it will be the first multiplex in the area. I am sure we will start with a bang, said Negi.        
	A Chinese restaurant and a bar will also set up shop on the plex premises next year.        
	Hind has always had loyal patronage and we expect our old customers to come back from day one. We are looking at an occupancy of at least 60-65 per cent per day from the start, said Jaiswal.        
	So, chances are, you can take an extended lunch break from work in your central business district office and catch Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif (Tees Maar Khan) or Ajay Devgn and Kajol (Toonpur Ka Superrhero) in plex comfort this winter.              
	HIND HIGHLIGHTS        
	 Set up in 1947, was the citys first AC movie hall, with machines and carpets imported from England.

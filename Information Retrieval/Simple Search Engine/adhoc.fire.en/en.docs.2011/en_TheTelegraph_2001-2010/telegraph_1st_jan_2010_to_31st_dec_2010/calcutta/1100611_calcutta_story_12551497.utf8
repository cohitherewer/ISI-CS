                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      3 in family held on fraud charge
          A STAFF REPORTER                              Rabindra Narayan Bhaduri and daughter Debarati at the Sealdah court on Thursday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)				                                 
	A couple and their only daughter were arrested from their Sinthee home on the charge of cheating several people by promising them jobs in a nationalised bank.        
	Police said Rabindra Narayan Bhaduri, 55, Susmita, 48, and Debarati, 23, took between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh from each of their victims.        
	We have got the names of at least nine people who were duped by the trio. The total number of people fleeced by them might cross 50, said a detective department officer.        
	The cops started a probe against the trio following a complaint by Surya Saha 28, a resident of Beleghata.        
	Surya said he had paid Rs 1 lakh in cash and another Rs 10,000 through a demand draft after he was promised the post of a senior official in the bank, said a sleuth.        
	We have seized the CVs of several people who were approached by the family with job offers, the officer added.        
	Debarati, a Class XI drop-out, told the sleuths during interrogation that she and her parents had been running the racket for the past six-seven months.        
	Debarati had worked for a city-based financial firm for a few months. At the firm, she had stolen personal data, including the phone numbers, of several people and started approaching them over the phone, said an officer.        
	Rabindra Narayan and Susmita would gain the job-seekers confidence by telling them that one of their relatives was in a senior managerial position in the nationalised bank, the officer added.        
	The trio were produced in a Sealdah court and remanded in police custody for a week.

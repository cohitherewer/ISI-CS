The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Budget scrapped
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Budget scrapped
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The Trinamul Congress board has decided to scrap the civic budget for 2010-11, which was placed by the previous mayor and passed by the civic House on March 20, and table a new budget on August 11.         
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee told Metro that the decision was taken as the Left Front board did not follow established procedures and tabled a full-fledged budget instead of a vote-on-account.         
	We think the budget passed by the previous board was illegal. Since the date of the civic polls had been announced, though it was not officially communicated to my predecessor by the state election commission, he should have tabled a vote-on-account to meet the civic expenses instead of a full-fledged budget, said mayor Chatterjee.         
	Bhattacharyya refuted the charges. If the budget was illegal, why did the mayor spend money provided under it? he asked.         
	The former mayor said there was no legal bar on an outgoing board tabling a budget. The new board can revise the estimates according to their projections on revenue and expenditure, he explained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Merit mantra on debut day
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Merit mantra on debut day
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The undeserving and incompetent will have to go but those who do not fall under that category will be retained.        
	The message was loud and clear from Amita Chatterjee, the first vice-chancellor of Presidency University, when she met 60-odd teachers of the institute on Tuesday.        
	I understand that many of you have contributed immensely towards the development of this prestigious institution. I can assure you that if you really deserve to serve Presidency University and help it become an institution of national and international repute, you will be part of the faculty, a teacher quoted Chatterjee as saying on her first day in office on the College Street campus.        
	Former acting principal Amitava Chatterjee, along with a few other teachers and some non-teaching employees, greeted the VC with a bouquet when she arrived in a Maruti Ritz a little after 1pm.        
	The vice-chancellor was escorted to her room, where the principals of erstwhile Presidency College would sit. The brass plaque outside read Prof Amita Chatterjee, vice-chancellor.         
	After spending 15 minutes in her room, the VC headed for Bankim Sabhagriha on the first floor of the main building to meet the teachers.        
	She told reporters after entering the hall that the teachers who had left Presidency for other institutes would be considered for reappointment if they applied.        
	All the teachers who had left may come back through the new recruitment process, she said.        
	At the closed-door meeting, which lasted 40 minutes, the VC harped on merit as the sole criterion for appointment of teachers.        
	As the Presidency University Act is not clear on the contentious issue, the VCs resolve to give preference to merit came as good news for those who had been rooting for a talented faculty along with autonomy as the key to restoring the institutes lost glory.        
	Any good institution requires good faculty. Chatterjee can contact teachers from other institutions who will agree to take classes at Presidency for two-three months a year, said a former teacher.        
	What Presidency lacks is a strong faculty to conduct both undergraduate and postgraduate courses, added the former teacher, who had a two-decade stint at the college.        
	The VC, however, did not specify how the competence of the existing teachers would be ascertained. Nor did she announce a deadline for wrapping up recruitment.        
	Presidency now has 160 teachers in 18 departments. Eighty posts are lying vacant. Once it starts functioning as a full-fledged university, the faculty strength will go up to 400.        
	All existing teachers will function till the recruitment is over.        
	The VC made it clear that supporting the cause of autonomy would not be treated as a permit to becoming a permanent faculty member at Presidency University.        
	Most of the Presidency teachers had stayed away from anti-autonomy protests organised by the CPM-backed All Bengal Government College Teachers Association, some allegedly in the hope of retaining their posts in the university.        
	Getting quality teachers, however, will be easier said than done. I can understand the kind of responsibility that rests on my shoulders. Its a challenging task ahead, the VC said.        
	She also met representatives of the Presidency alumni association, that has long been advocating the cause of autonomy.        
	The VC later visited the gutted chemistry laboratories in the Derozio Building. If there is any lapse under the National Building Code, we will take corrective measures, she said.        
	Before arriving at the university, the VC had visited Bikash Bhavan in Salt Lake, where she met higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri. The minister promised me all help, Chatterjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road rogues enjoy easy run   Custody lost is battle lost
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Road rogues enjoy easy run
   Custody lost is battle lost          KINSUK BASU                                                  
	For every Suresh Yadav who is convicted of culpable homicide for a death caused by reckless driving, scores of drivers could yet get away with murder on the mean streets of Calcutta.        
	Almost two years after they started booking drivers responsible for road deaths under Section 304 of the IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), cops in the city are still struggling to plug the holes in the prosecution process.        
	You cant treat one Suresh Yadav being sentenced to eight years in prison (for mowing down nine persons on a Dalhousie pavement three years ago) as the norm. In most cases, once a driver is out on bail you might as well consider the case closed, admitted a senior traffic officer.         
	According to the Lalbazar files, the police have registered 18 cases under Section 304 against errant drivers over the past eight months but only two of them are still behind bars  one in judicial and the other in police custody.        
	The drivers who get bail invariably flee the city, never to be traced again. If the accused is not in custody or available for a court hearing, the case gets diluted, said an officer.        
	On June 29 last year, 71-year-old Santi Ranjan Sinha of Bhupen Bose Avenue was fatally injured when he was trying to board a minibus in the middle of the road and another, speeding from behind, knocked him down.        
	The accused, Jadav Kundu and Surojit Mullick, were granted bail after 59 days and have since been absconding. The cops, however, realised that the duo had jumped bail only when they didnt turn up for a hearing on August 27.         
	Unless the investigating officer makes a sincere effort to collect evidence to justify booking a driver for culpable homicide, its difficult to keep him in custody, said a senior lawyer.        
	The trailer driver responsible for last months fatal accident at the toll plaza on Vidyasagar Setu  five men returning home from work died in the mishap  was remanded in judicial custody allegedly because the police failed to lodge a strong case diary.        
	The accused, Rupesh Yadav, was arrested the day after the accident (on August 24) and booked for culpable homicide. But the case diary was not presented the right way and Yadav was remanded in judicial custody. Its a lapse by the investigating officer, said a Lalbazar veteran.        
	Yadav was finally remanded in police custody earlier this week after officers managed to plug the loopholes in the case diary.        
	Officers handling such cases claim that drawing up a chargesheet is not easy. The preliminary probe is carried out by the local police station. The fatal squad comes in if there are casualties. By the time the officers reach the spot, evidence usually disappears, said a sergeant.        
	Lack of infrastructure is a handicap. The entire fatal squad shares one vehicle, an officer pointed out.        
	It also doesnt help that most witnesses dont co-operate. In dealing with a case under 304 of the IPC, its vital to prove the drivers intent. Witnesses play a key role in proving this charge but getting them to talk is tough, said a member of the fatal squad.        
	For 49-year-old Ramesh Singh, who lost wife Manju Devi in a bus accident last month, such arguments add to the pain of losing a loved one. I just cant accept that the driver whose recklessness killed my wife will go scot-free, he told Metro.        
	Mohun Bagan official Debasish Dutta, in whose firm the five victims of the August 24 Vidyasagar Setu accident had worked, said he was determined to see the guilty driver punished. The law should take its course so that no more blood is spilt on the streets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | They battle the blues in the dusk of life
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      They battle the blues in the dusk of life
										      KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                
	Dinesh Jha, 70, and wife Shanti, 67, live alone in their Lansdowne Road home. Lack of career opportunities and economic stagnancy forced their children to leave the city of their birth. My son and daughter are both settled in Mumbai. There was little scope in Calcutta and so my son left; my daughter moved after marriage, says Jha.        
	So are they just another lonely couple in Calcutta limping along by the crutch of their memories?        
	Not really. The two are alone but not lonely. I keep myself busy so there is no time to feel lonely. My wife and I are early risers; we get up at 4.30am and go to Maddox Square for free-hand exercises. From 10.30am to 3.30pm, I am involved with shares and the stock market. My wife goes to kitty parties or meets some friends. After a bath we sit down for puja in the evening at 4.30pm and before we realise, its dinnertime, says Jha.        
	But how difficult is it? Its not difficult staying alone if you make up your mind. You have to be mentally strong.        
	That is where Manoranjan and Sikha Sarkar, aged 64 and 56, failed. The couple in Patuli wracked by loneliness after their only son took up a job in Bangalore lost the will to live and attempted suicide on March 4.        
	With the state still struggling to lay the ghost of the Nano to rest and the only growth in the city restricted to pockets of retail and realty, the exodus of sons and daughters is what retired engineer Shyamal Dasgupta refers to as cholchhe cholbe.        
	He is 72, his wife Deepa is 68 and they have had to get used to living alone. Their son and daughter left their Santoshpur home after college, he for Bangalore and she for Delhi.        
	What can possibly keep them back in Calcutta after completing school or at best college, he demands. This is just a town masquerading as a metro. It has some of the facilities of a metro but the opportunities of a town, Dasgupta says wryly.        
	Suneepa Dutta, 45, learnt that the hard way. After marriage we were in the US for some time and then returned to be close to our parents. But then we had to move to Mumbai; how long could my husband stay in Calcutta and stagnate? she asks.        
	Suneepas parents live with her elder brother but her husband Joydeeps parents stay alone in the city.        
	As do a growing number of people ageing and aged. Helplines in the city say that the number of calls from lonely elderly couples is rising steadily. There are 1,363 senior citizens registered with us who stay by themselves, out of which 600 comprise couples, says Shukla Taraphder of Pronam, a 24-hour helpline for senior citizens set up by The Bengal and Calcutta police.        
	Every day we try to make at least 30 to 40 calls to check if they are well. Pronam started with safety and medical help but now we give any kind of assistance because sometimes they just need to talk to someone out of loneliness, adds Taraphder.        
	Namita, 75, and Amiya Banerjee, 85, have registered with Pronam for part-time solace. My husband and I go through phases of extreme loneliness. We feel like going out but there is no one to accompany us. After joining this helpline, at least we have someone to call. Now we dont feel as depressed as we used to, says Namita from her Maniktala flat.         
	In their bid to stay afloat, the Banerjees have found other lifeboats  sometimes, they visit Ramakrishna Mission at other times Namita does a bit of gardening.        
	Frequent interaction with children and grandchildren acts as a great tonic for the elders. Take the Guptas of Salt Lake, he a retired lawyer and she a retired teacher. We visit our son in Delhi twice a year and they come down twice a year. The weeks in between are spent in anticipation of our next meeting with our two grandchildren, they smile.        
	Suneepa too makes it a point to spend as much time as possible with both sets of parents. We visit them frequently or get them over to Mumbai. We understand that their friends circle is shrinking because of death and disease and we are all that they have.        
	What about the time that the oldies have to spend on their own in Calcutta? We encourage them to keep busy. For example, my mother is actively involved in social work and does gardening too. My father is very active on the Internet and he even blogs, says Suneepa.        
	But how many septuagenarians are tech-savvy enough to use new-age tools to express themselves? So, Dignity Foundation Kolkata, one of the oldest helplines for the old in the city, encourages senior citizens to vent their problems, face to face.        
	We organise a chai-adda session four times a week in Salt Lake and Dhakuria where elders share their problems. We also have three qualified psychologists who counsel them, says Avijit Ghosh, the general manager of Dignity Foundation Kolkata.        
	Just about anything from cleanliness to godliness works. Participation in a religious community can often help the elderly find friends and solace, says psychologist Moharmala Chatterjee.        
	I go to my friends house, listen to old songs and watch the TV for news. If nothing else, I clean the almirah! says 68-year-old Gitika Mitra from Hatibagan, for whom be positive is a way of life.        
	Something that can be said about more and more Calcuttans in the autumn of their lives. My friends and I now refer to Calcutta as an old-age home and whenever we are down or miss our children we tell each other aal izz well, laughs Amitabha Sen, an 80-year-old widower who lives alone in Salt Lake with his Labrador called Happy.

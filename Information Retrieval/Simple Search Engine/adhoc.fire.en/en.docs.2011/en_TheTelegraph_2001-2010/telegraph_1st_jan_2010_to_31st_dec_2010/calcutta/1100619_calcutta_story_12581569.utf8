          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 24-year-old youth died after falling off the ninth-floor terrace of AG Towers on Park Street and died minutes later at hospital on Friday morning.        
	Police suspect Vivian Belgard, a Tiljala resident who had been working in the Assembly of God Church office in the building, committed suicide. Sources said Vivian had been upset over the past few days.        
	A probe has been ordered. We are waiting for the post-mortem report but it seems there was no foul play, said an officer of Park Street police station. We will speak to the authorities of the Assembly of God Church.        
	The youth landed on a trolley loaded with food which the church authorities were to distribute among local residents, before rolling over and hitting the concrete floor.        
	Strangely, there was not much bleeding, said a witness. Guards at the gate of AG Towers and some witnesses rushed to Vivians rescue and alerted the Mission of Mercy Hospital housed in the building.         
	He was immediately admitted to the hospital but died after some time. There were probably several internal injuries, resulting in multi-organ failure, the police officer said.        
	 Promotion: The deputy commissioner of police (detective department), Damayanti Sen, has been promoted to the post of joint commissioner of police (crime).        
	 Thief hunt: Officers of the detective department of Calcutta police on Friday made sketches of those who are suspected to have stolen items worth Rs 6 lakh from designer store Monapali on Thursday afternoon.        
	 Found dead: A 55-year-old caretaker, Deben Das, was found dead in his room in a building under construction in Baguiati on Friday. There were no injury marks on the body.

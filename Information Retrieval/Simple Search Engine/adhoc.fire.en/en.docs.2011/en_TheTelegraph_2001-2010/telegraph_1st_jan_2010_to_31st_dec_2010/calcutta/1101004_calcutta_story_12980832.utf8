The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja themed on music
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puja themed on music

	A north Calcutta puja is being themed on Indian classical music with which the neighbourhood has strong associations for nearly two centuries.        
	The pandal of the 71-year-old Pathuriaghata Pancher Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsab is being designed to highlight two musical instruments  the violin and the ghattam (a percussion instrument, actually a pitcher), which bring Carnatic music to mind.        
	The workshop of the puja, whose pandal is being erected on Pathuriaghat Street, is at No. 65, now a dharamshala. It was earlier the seat of the Tagores of the area, before Prasad, opposite Tagore Castle, came up.        
	When Metro visited the site, workers and puja committee members were busy producing motifs based on music by welding thick iron wire.        
	The joint secretary of the committee says the puja budget is Rs 5 lakh and the art work has been conceptualised and designed by Kamaldeep Dhar, who teaches in the sculpture department of Visva-Bharati.        
	Dhar, who spent his childhood on Darpanarayan Tagore Street in the same neighbourhood before moving to Santiniketan, says he learnt modelling idols in that area, and has designed prize-winning pujas on Nimtala Ghat Street and Hatibagan last year and the year before.        
	He feels the culture of south India has a close affinity with that of Bengal and he has tried to capture the cadence of melody by creating natural forms like the sun, birds and grass and other forms derived from Tantric art.        
	Once over, these motifs will resemble drawings done with steel wire. They will include figurative shapes as well and Dhar considers this art work an experiment. The ghattam will be placed at strategic points of the steel wire structure and the strings of the violin will be represented by steel wires. The background will be of foam painted over. Music will thus assume shape, colour and form.        
	Pathuriaghat has been a seat of music and culture for nearly two centuries. Here lived Bhupendra Krishna Ghosh, who started the All Bengal Music Conference, and his son Manmatha Nath Ghosh, who continued to organise what became one of the most renowned soirees in India. This was also the home of musicologist Sourindra Mohan Tagore.

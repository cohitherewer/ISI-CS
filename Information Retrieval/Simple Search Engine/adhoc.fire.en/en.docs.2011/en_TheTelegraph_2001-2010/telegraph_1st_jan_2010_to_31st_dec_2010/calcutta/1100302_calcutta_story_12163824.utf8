The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wedding budgets feel gold pinch
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wedding budgets feel gold pinch

	Pranab Mukherjee has turned the yellow metal red hot  the hike in import duty on gold is likely to singe wedding budgets and force the common man to opt for alternative gift purchases. The Union budget has hiked import duty on gold from Rs 200 per 10gm to Rs 300.        
	For silver, the import duty has been hiked to Rs 1,500 per kg, from Rs 1,000 per kg.         
	Its a big increase, which will affect both jewellers and customers, said Bachraj Bamalwa of Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons, who is also the vice-chairman of the All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation. Last year too, the import duty on gold was hiked by Rs 100 per 10gm.         
	City jewellers say that consumers would feel the pinch the most. Customers will have to pay around Rs 100 extra per 10gm. Thats a big margin and if it affects buying, our business will be hit too, said Bablu De, the working president of the Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee.        
	The skyrocketing price of gold during Dhanteras 2009 meant that jewellers made a profit more from an increase in net business than in terms of quantity sold.         
	Gifting gold is a must on certain family occasions, but with the hike in import duty, I will start looking at other gift items, said Anupama Mukherjee, a homemaker.         
	The hike has worried those tying the knot and their families too. I am planning to buy some gold as I will get married in a few months and I am very upset with the hike. The price of gold has gone up so much recently; the hike in import duty is only going to make it worse. And yet, for certain ceremonies you just cannot do without gold jewellery, said model Jessica Gomes.         
	Bamalwa is worried that the increase in duty may encourage smuggling. Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh have a lower import duty. With this hike, the margin will be widened and smugglers will find it profitable to smuggle gold into India from these countries, he said.         
	Agreed De. Between 2005 and 2008, India imported around 750 tonnes of gold a year. In 2009, when the import duty was increased, the volume came down to 450 tonnes. Which means that the rest of the metal was smuggled in. This year, the further increase in import duty will make smuggling even more attractive, he said.        
	However, not everyone feels the outcome will be drastic. The increase is marginal. Unlike other items, we pay a flat rate as import duty on gold and silver. Since the price of gold has gone up, we will still pay around 1.6 per cent of the price of gold as import duty, as before, explained Pankaj Parekh, the chairman (eastern region) of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.         
	If you are still sulking, buy yourself a toy balloon, its duty-free.

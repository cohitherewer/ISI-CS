The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tennis is a law amp; order game

	West Bengal police may have committed a double fault by requisitioning 30-odd private vehicles in the name of special law and order duty and using these to ferry visiting IPS officers and their spouses to and from a tennis tournament.         
	The requisitioned vehicles, most of them SUVs or MUVs, have been on tennis duty since 6am last Saturday, when officers from 22 states started arriving for the ongoing 11th All India Police Lawn Tennis Championship at South Club in Bhowanipore.         
	The requisition slip mentioned that I was to send my Scorpio to the Alipore police lines on Saturday, which I did without a murmur. All the vehicles lined up there were later taken to a fuel pump in south Calcutta where 20 litres of diesel each were allotted. My car was then sent to the airport to pick up two IPS officers, the owner of one of the requisitioned vehicles told Metro.        
	He realised that spl L/O duty meant providing car and chauffeur to top police officers enjoying a tennis holiday only on the eve of the five-day tournament, which ends on Friday with governor M.K. Narayanan as the probable chief guest.         
	 The receipt (see graphic) issued by the cops for the car registration papers and the drivers licence clearly mentions special L/O duty. What is the connection between special law and order duty and a lawn tennis tournament? the vehicle owner wondered.        
	The secretary of the tournaments organising committee, IPS officer Harman Prit Singh, hit the ball long on being asked why private vehicles had been requisitioned for a police tennis tournament on the pretext of special law and order duty.        
	 I thought you had called to know about the results of the tournament. We have organised this event and I am a tennis player. I am not bothered about what you are asking, sniped Singh, who is the inspector-general of police (headquarters).        
	Most other officers tried defending the police brasss decision, saying it was a normal practice to requisition vehicles for any official purpose categorised as law and order duty. Many vehicles were requisitioned during both Id and Kali Puja but nobody questioned it. This tournament has been organised in accordance with the central governments directive. So there is nothing unofficial about it, insisted an IPS veteran.         
	But what does the rule-book for requisitioning vehicles say?        
	Section 207 of the Motor Vehicles Act empowers the city police commissioner and the superintendents of police in the districts to requisition private vehicles only for law and order duty or for public interest. Lawyers said even the Election Commission, which requisitions vehicles for poll duty, needed to follow certain norms.         
	In the first place, the police have not been vested with the power to forcibly seize private vehicles. Even under special circumstances or in the event of an emergency, they need to clearly assign the reason for requisitioning a vehicle and cite the section of the law under which it is being done. The owner of the vehicle has the right to know that, said advocate Tamal Mukherjee.         
	The requisition receipts issued by the police dont mention any legislation.         
	South Calcutta trader Sachin Halder had stood up to the bully-boy tactics of the administration after his new Tata Safari was forcibly requisitioned for election duty in May 2009 despite pleading for exemption on the ground that his ailing wife needed to travel a long distance every week to meet her doctor.        
	Calcutta High Court ruled in Halders favour, ordering the sub-divisional officer of Canning to return Halders Tata Safari and compensate him for the period the vehicle remained in official custody.        
	A senior bureaucrat who did not wish to be named said it would have been appropriate for Bengal police to hire rather than requisition vehicles for a tennis event. Government departments routinely hire vehicles. Requisition is generally done only for emergency duty. Owners cant be forced to give away their vehicles on the polices whim, he added.        
	So is requisitioning all about exercising power or keeping conveyance costs down?        
	The manager of a car rental service in the city said the police seldom hired vehicles for any official purpose because requisitioning was easy as well as cheap. A Scorpio costs between Rs 130 and Rs 140 an hour, subject to the car being hired for a minimum of six hours. The police pay between Rs 250 and Rs 300, depending on the make of the vehicle, per day apart from fuel. It is a much cheaper option, he added.

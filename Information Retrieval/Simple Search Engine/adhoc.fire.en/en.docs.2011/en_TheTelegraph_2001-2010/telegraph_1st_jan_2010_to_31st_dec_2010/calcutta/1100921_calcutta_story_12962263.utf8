The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | All roads lead to Esplanade but never seem to get there
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      All roads lead to Esplanade but never seem to get there
										      Traffic Trauma ndash; TT for city                                    
	If you live and work in Calcutta, you just have to get to or pass through Esplanade on a weekday. And if you get to or pass through Esplanade on a weekday, you just have to be driven to despair. For, nothing moves. On a bad day  and that seems to be six days out of five now  what should have taken 10 minutes takes at least 30. If a protest meeting in Metro channel doesnt get you, a michhil on Rani Rashmoni Avenue sure will. If bad weather doesnt get you, poor traffic management sure will.        
	Metro set out on some of the key arteries leading to the heart of the city and found them all cruelly clogged. Isnt it time someone, somewhere took serious steps to decongest the city centre and reduce the precious minutes and hours wasted on the road to and from Esplanade?        
	Or do we just keep waiting for the Presidents next visit?

	 Maximum time it should take: 5 minutes        
	 Time taken at 2pm: 25 minutes        
	 Time taken at 6pm: 40 minutes            
	Moulali to Esplanade via SN Banerjee Road        
	 Distance: 2.3km        
	 Maximum time it should take: 7 minutes        
	 Time taken at 11am: 26 minutes

	 Time taken at 11am: 38 minutes        
	 Time taken at 7pm: 27 minutes        
	PRIME PROBLEMS        
	 Regular meetings and rallies in Metro channel and Rani Rashmoni Avenue reduce road width further and clog traffic. That is not where weekday rallies are to be held, say the court and the cops. But that doesnt stop anyone from calling a traffic-stopper meeting there        
	 No traffic signal or traffic cop at the approach road from Howrah town        
	 Heavy vehicular traffic between MG Road and Central Metro stations from arterial roads like Tara Chand Dutt Street, Colootola and New CIT Road        
	 Road width shrinks at the Ganesh Chandra Avenue crossing because of the Chandni Chowk Metro station        
	 Flow of traffic too heavy for road width at some key points, like at Park Circus        
	 Slow-moving vehicles like hand-drawn carts and rickshaws plying on stretches like SN Banerjee Road        
	 Pedestrians walking on the carriageway, often because of pavements being impossible to negotiate        
	COMMON-SENSE SOLUTIONS        
	 Implement rally ban in Metro channel and RR Avenue        
	 Put a basic traffic system in place near Howrah bridge        
	 Clear roads of illegal parking and vendors to increase road width        
	 Ensure that traffic signals work the way they are meant to        
	 Ban slow-moving vehicles on thoroughfares        
	 Free pavements of encroachment

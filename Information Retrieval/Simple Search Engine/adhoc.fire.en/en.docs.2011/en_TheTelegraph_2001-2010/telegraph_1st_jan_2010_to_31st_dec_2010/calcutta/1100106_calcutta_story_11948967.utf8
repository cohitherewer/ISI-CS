The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata, the twice born
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mamata, the twice born
										      OUR BUREAU                                          
	Date of Birth: 05.01.1955 (Its official, but not correct)        
	Date of Birth: 05.10.1955 (Nothing official about it, but correct)        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee beware, Mamata Banerjee is a miracle baby.        
	The curious case of two birthdays  exactly nine months apart  adds a different dimension to her seeming invincibility in the march towards Writers Buildings in her 55th year.        
	The Lok Sabha website puts down the railway ministers birthday as January 5.        
	But when her followers started trickling into her 30B Harish Chatterjee Street residence on Tuesday morning, armed with bouquets and best wishes, they ran into a wall of naysayers.        
	Apnara ekhaney ki korchhen? Aaj kono jonmodin tonmodin nei. Kono jinish newa jabey na (What are you doing here? Theres no birthday today. We cannot accept any gifts), said a Mamata aide, shooing away the bewildered birthday crowd.        
	But to add to the confusion, some Trinamul members had confirmed to another group that it was Didis birthday, thanked them for the flowers and told them to leave them all in the office.        
	What is happening? Is it or is it not her birthday? demanded an irate woman from Belghoria, waiting to meet Mamata from 5.30am.        
	The answer came several hours later from the (supposed) birthday girl herself. Irritated by queries about her date of birth at a press conference on Tuesday evening, Mamata later said: Today is not my birthday. And I anyway dont observe my birthday in any special way.        
	Just like her arch Marxist rival.        
	Family sources confirmed that October 5  and not January 5  was when Mamata Banerjee was born, in the year of Bill Gates and Nicolas Sarkozy.        
	She was apparently given a second birthday by her father, who had increased her age by nine months to make her eligible to contest an election. Mamata has not made a move since to correct that discrepancy and so she carries on with two birthdays.        
	I saw that it was her birthday on the Lok Sabha website. My mother who was a freedom fighter wanted to meet her so we came all the way from Shirdi (off Aurangabad). But now we are being told that it is not her birthday and she wont meet anyone, rued a Mamata fan accompanied by his 81-year-old mother.        
	A small crowd had started gathering outside the Harish Chatterjee Street house from 5.30am on Tuesday. Among them was a retired priest from Basanti in the Sunderbans, a group of women from Belghoria and a woman from Gorakhpur.        
	By afternoon, everyone had dispersed, stumped by a wrong un.        
	But one person wore a wide smile on learning that October 5 and not January 5 was the real thing  Tollywood actress and Trinamul MP Satabdi Roy.        
	That means we share the same birth date! I am so happy to know that, she told Metro. I had been getting text messages from many people asking me to wish Didi on her birthday today.        
	And what character trait does Satabdi share with her birthday mate?         
	I feel that we are both very emotional people. We work emotionally.        
	Mamata the Libran also shares her birthday with Kate Winslet.         
	Mamata the Capricornian would have shared hers with Deepika Padukone and Diane Keaton.

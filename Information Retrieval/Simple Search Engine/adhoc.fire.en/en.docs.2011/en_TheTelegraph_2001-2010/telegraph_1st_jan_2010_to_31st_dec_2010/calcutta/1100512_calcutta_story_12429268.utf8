The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt goofs up on cab scan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt goofs up on cab scan
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          A radio taxi in town                            
	The 270 radio taxis plying in the city have not been able to get their meters calibrated  a must under the Motor Vehicles Act  following a goof-up by the transport department.        
	The department is yet to include radio taxis among the approved vehicles under the Motor Vehicles Act though permits for such cabs were issued a year ago. As a result, public vehicles department officials are refusing to calibrate the meters of the radio cabs.        
	In the absence of calibration  a process by which PVD officials tune a taxi meter to the government-approved fare slabs  passengers cannot be certain about the authenticity of meter readings of radio taxis. The fare structure of radio cabs, which can be summoned over the phone, is Rs 15 for the first 2 km and Rs 3 for every 200 metres thereafter.        
	The transport department issued permits to the radio cabs without including them in the list of vehicles under the Motor Vehicles Act. All it requires to formalise the inclusion is a gazette notification, said a senior official of the department.        
	Dilip Bakshi, the deputy secretary of the transport department, said a circular had been issued to radio taxi operators, asking them to get the meters calibrated.        
	After receiving the circular, many radio cabs did report to the Salt Lake meter training centre, the only such facility in the city, but PVD refused to calibrate their meters.        
	The officials told us they could not calibrate the meters as our vehicles did not figure in the Motor Vehicles Act, said an official of Orix Auto Infrastructure Services Limited, one of the two radio taxi operators in the city, the other being Mega Cabs.

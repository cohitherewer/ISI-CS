	At 2am, Ritu Gupta was found hanging at her Pottery Road home. Ritu, who got married to Vinod around two years back, had a nine-month-old daughter. Ritus father Raghu Shau lodged a police complaint accusing her in-laws of driving her to suicide by mentally torturing her for dowry.        
	Vinod, his brother Manoj, Manojs wife Aradhana and Vinods father Ram Chandra have been arrested. A case of dowry death under IPC Section 304B has been started against them, said an officer.         
	On Thursday morning, a 42-year-old agent of an investment firm was found hanging in his Chitpur home. Neighbours said Subhas Pati had run up huge debts. In Paikpara, 32-year-old Subrata Saha was found hanging in his home. The cops said Saha had been suffering from depression.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Front meeting on fare hike
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Front meeting on fare hike
          OUR BUREAU                           Vehicle operators have been demanding a tax slash or fare hike since the rise in fuel prices                                  
	The demand for higher fares by cabbies and rationalisation of taxes on diesel by bus and minibus operators has prompted the Left Front to convene an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the options before the state government.         
	Sources said the meeting had to be called in the wake of protests by transport operators, who have set July 30 as the deadline for the government to declare its stand. Transport minister Ranjit Kundu has been asked to attend the meeting.        
	A CPI leader said: The meeting was not scheduled. It has been convened to find out from the transport minister what the unions are demanding, whether a fare hike is justified and whether the state government can provide any relief to the operators and also the common people.         
	Bus and minibus operators want lower taxes on diesel while taxi operators have been asking for a Rs 2x+6 fare structure, where x is the digital metre reading, in place of the existing Rs 2x+2.        
	At the meeting, the Front partners will decide whether to increase fares or reduce taxes or withdraw the cess on diesel to lower the price of the fuel, said a source. A section of the transport lobby and the Trinamul Congress have demanded that the sales tax on petro products, especially diesel, be slashed.        
	We have been repeatedly asking the state government to slash sales tax on diesel or replace it with the value added tax (VAT), said Tushar Sen, the president of the West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association.         
	The Delhi government on Friday decided to replace sales tax on diesel with VAT from July 20. This would bring the diesel price in Delhi down by Rs 2.50 per litre.         
	In Bengal, the sales tax on diesel is 17 per cent. Replacing that with VAT would reduce the tax rate to 12.5 per cent. The reduction would lower the price of diesel by Rs 1.5 per litre.        
	State finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who is also the chairman of the Empowered Committee of Finance Ministers, had earlier said any decision on a tax cut could be taken by the panel if a consensus was arrived at.         
	The committee will meet on July 21 and discuss the issue of petro product prices, said Dasgupta, adding that the Delhi government was in an advantageous position because it had access to development assistance.         
	The transport operators said they would wait for the government to take a call on the issue before deciding on their course of action.

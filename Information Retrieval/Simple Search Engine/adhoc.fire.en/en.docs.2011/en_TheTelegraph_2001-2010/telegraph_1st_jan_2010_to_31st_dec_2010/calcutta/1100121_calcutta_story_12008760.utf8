The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Body guards in lonely vigil
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Body guards in lonely vigil
            KINSUK BASU                                                Wednesday evenings vigil outside the cooler room of the anatomy department at SSKM Hospital that holds Jyoti Basus body. Picture by Pradip Sanyal       
	After a busy Tuesday when the flower-bedecked hearse bearing Jyoti Basus body arrived at SSKM, it was a bizarre Wednesday for a team of 15 cops assigned to guard the cooler room that holds his donated remains.        
	Its lonely out here. Thank god, I am not doing the night shift on the first day itself, remarked Sentry number 1 around 8pm, sitting on a wooden bench in the glass-door enclosure that leads to the locked cooler room of the anatomy department with posters of Basu on the exterior walls.        
	When Metro took a peek into the reception area where the guards have been deployed, Sentry 1 and four other guards  two of them with him and another two outside the backdoor  were waiting to be relieved by five colleagues in another half-an-hour.        
	Lalbazar has instructed Bhowanipore police station, under which SSKM falls, to make the best possible security arrangements in the anatomy department.        
	The designated drill for the 15-member team asked to guard the cooler room in three shifts  the 8.30pm to 6.30am is the longest one  is to check the locks on both doors every couple of hours.        
	We pull the locks to check whether they are secure. It seems a little strange but that is what we are here for, said Sentry number 1.         
	Sentry number 2, due to retire in five months, pored over a newspaper that he said he had read several times over during the course of the long late-afternoon shift from 12.30 to 8.30pm.        
	 I have worked in various police divisions throughout my career but this is definitely the most unusual assignment I have been given. I will have a story to narrate to my family once I return to my home state after retirement, said the veteran.        
	Sources at SSKM said the anatomy department was quieter than usual on Wednesday because everything, including the canteen next door, was closed for Saraswati puja.         
	For the police personnel on duty, the only diversion was the chatter emanating from the adjacent office where medical students and staff had organised puja. We couldnt see anything but heard voices throughout the day. That kept us engaged somewhat, said Sentry number 3.        
	And what did he think of being asked to guard a room containing Jyoti Basus body?        
	Do we have a choice? I look at this as just another task that I have been asked to perform, he said.         
	With the SSKM authorities yet to decide how and when they will use Basus donated body, it could well be a long, quiet vigil for the team of 15.

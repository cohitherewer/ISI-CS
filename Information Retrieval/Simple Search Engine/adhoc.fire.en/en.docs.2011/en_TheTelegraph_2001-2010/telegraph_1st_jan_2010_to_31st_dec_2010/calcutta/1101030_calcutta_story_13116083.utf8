The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brakes on cool ride
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Brakes on cool ride
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Metro commuters tryst with a cool ride ran into trouble for the second time in three days on Friday morning, with the authorities being forced to withdraw an air-conditioned rake following a snag in the braking system.        
	The driver of the train, which left Dum Dum at 7am, detected a problem in the braking system of the fourth coach from the front while entering Belgachhia station. The maintenance staff on board repaired the snag and the train left after a 10-minute delay.        
	But the problem resurfaced with the coach emitting smoke when the train entered Esplanade station at 7.30am.        
	We immediately vacated the train and sent it to the Tollygunge shed for repairs, said a Metro official.        
	The snag-hit train was the only AC rake in service as the other one in the fleet was taken off the tracks on Wednesday morning with a malfunctioning braking system.        
	The train withdrawn on Wednesday was pressed into service again on Friday evening. Each AC Metro rake makes three round trips daily.        
	The serial snags on the cool rakes left passengers fuming. We were eagerly waiting for the new AC rakes to arrive, hoping they would provide a comfortable ride. But it seems the new rakes are as prone to snags as the earlier ones, most of which need to be junked, said Ratnalekha Lahiri, a second-year Calcutta University student and a Metro regular.        
	Metro officials said they had flown in senior officials from Peramburs Integral Coach Factory, where the rakes were made, to look into the problems.        
	Besides, at least four experts are accompanying each train to tackle emergencies, said an official.        
	Some Metro officials have, however, maintained  on condition of anonymity  that the AC rakes were rolled out for commercial runs without proper trials.        
	Water crisis: Residents of large parts of south Calcutta continued to reel under water shortage for the third consecutive day on Friday, following a leak in an underground pipe.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Monsoon, finally!

	The monsoon finally hit town on Sunday, five days behind schedule but active and strong unlike last year when it had arrived a fortnight early, only to stay dormant for a month.         
	By 8.30pm, Calcutta had received 14.9mm of rain, which dragged the Celsius six notches below normal for a maximum reading of 27.8 degrees Celsius. Its official. The monsoon has arrived, declared Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Der aaye par durust aaye (arrived late but arrived strong), added O. P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.

	How does the weatherman know that the monsoon has arrived?        
	A combination of satellite images, rainfall readings and data charts along with the latitudinal and longitudinal progress of the Northern Limit of Monsoon (NLM)  also called the monsoon line  help weather scientists determine where and when the monsoon has hit.        
	What is the difference between Saturdays pre-monsoon shower and Sundays monsoon rain?        
	Till Saturday, the city had received spells of pre-monsoon showers as a result of the localised formation of thunderclouds. The showers were, therefore, for short periods. On Sunday, the city woke up to overcast skies with persistent rainfall till late in the afternoon.        
	What kept the monsoon waiting?        
	The delay in the arrival of the monsoon (the NLM had crossed north Bengal on June 2) was caused by the absence of a cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal, which could have pulled the monsoon flow towards the city much quicker.        
	What caused it to arrive on Sunday?        
	The weakening of the low-pressure area over the Bay, which was hindering the onward movement of the NLM, helped the monsoons progress overnight.         
	What can we expect from the monsoon in the short term?        
	The Met office says conditions are favourable for the monsoon to trigger intermittent rain with spells of heavy showers every now and then in the city. The Celsius is likely to dip.         
	What can we expect from the monsoon in the long term?        
	From June to September, the usual monsoon months, the city receives 1,216.4mm of rain on an average, with 59.7 rainy days. Meteorologists expect the monsoon to be normal over the long term this year. As on Sunday, the city had received 83.2mm of rain in June with six rainy days.        
	What can play spoilsport?        
	According to meteorologists, it is too early to predict global or local weather phenomena like the El Nino or the Madden-Julian Oscillation playing spoilsport like last year. Also, it is rare for such phenomena to recur in successive years.

                      A different world                    Right from its inception, Little Thespian has selected unconventional subjects for its plays. Based on Tennessee Williams The Glass Menagerie, its second production Patjhad is one that revolves around a family living in the turbulent hills of Darjeeling. It consists of Gayatri, a middle-aged woman, her son Indivar and daughter Yamini. Gayatris only ambition is to see her children well settled. She appears to be a devoted mother looking for a perfect match for her daughter, a person who will come and fill her life with happiness! But as the drama unfolds, it becomes clear that Gayatri lives in a world oscillating between illusion and reality. Her sporadic transfer between these two worlds is her only defence against the boredom and emptiness of her life. In fact, as Williams has claimed, it is the matriarchs unwitting cruelty that brings sorrow, failure and disharmony to the family. The characteristic feature of the play is that it cuts across boundaries, casts, cultures, spaces and brings us face-to-face with the countless middle-class families of this world. Their insurmountable will to live life against all odds, their hopes and their feelings will touch the hearts of the audience. Design and direction: S.M. Azhar Alam.                  Event: Play in Hindi, Patjhad, produced by Little Thespian When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Madhusudan Mancha

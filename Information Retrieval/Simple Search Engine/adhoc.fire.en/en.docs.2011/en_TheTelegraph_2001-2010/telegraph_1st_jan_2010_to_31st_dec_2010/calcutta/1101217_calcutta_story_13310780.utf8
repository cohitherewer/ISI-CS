	Heads of reputable private schools in the city want to help the civic body improve its primary schools but do not expect a partnership to yield results without sustained effort.         
	Representatives of 62 schools attended a programme at Town Hall on Thursday, where mayoral council member (education) Shashi Panja and Derek OBrien, an advisory committee member of the civic education board, spoke on the partnership plan. Mayor Sovan Chatterjee attended the programme.        
	There are two ways in which a private school can help. Its teachers and students can go over and teach at the corporation school. The private school can also invite students of the corporation school to its annual sports day or play, said OBrien.        
	The project would start in February with 10 pairs of schools, he added.         
	The principals of private schools welcomed the idea though some of them were unclear about particulars such as medium of instruction  most private schools that turned up at the programme are English-medium but the corporation schools are Bengali, Hindi or Urdu-medium.         
	Communication among teachers and students of the two schools may be a problem initially. So, the CMC will have to be patient and keep encouraging the teachers of the corporation schools. And the teachers themselves will have to be put in a lot of effort for the results to show, said Terence Ireland, the principal of St James School.        
	Sister Cyril of Loreto Day School, Sealdah, said all the private schools in the city had the means to help the less fortunate. Its important for private school authorities and students to not shut their minds against the poor kids.        
	The heads of the government schools who had been invited to the programme stayed away with Bethune school being the only exception.        
	The headmaster of Ballygunge Government School (Rupak Hembram) wrote to us saying that he was not sure of the (Bengal) governments stand on this initiative. After that, we did not invite many government schools although the vernacular medium of instruction in these schools would suit our purpose, said Panja.        
	According to her, the initiative would still help the 260 CMC primary schools in the city provide better education, upholding the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education.        
	According to the law, children between six and 14 are supposed to go to school but the corporation schools are only up to Class IV or V and the quality of education is such that the students cannot get admitted in secondary schools afterwards, said Panja.        
	She stressed the need to improve the infrastructure of the corporation schools. Corporate houses like L amp;T, Coal India and ITC and organisations like Rotary and Lions have approached us with offers to upgrade the infrastructure of our schools. Some have already started working with us, she said.

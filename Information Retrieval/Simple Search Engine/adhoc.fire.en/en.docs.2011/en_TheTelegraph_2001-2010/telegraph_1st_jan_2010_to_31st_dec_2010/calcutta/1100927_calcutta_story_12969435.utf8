The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Doctors on strike blame facility fault
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Doctors on strike blame facility fault
          RITH BASU                                        
	In his short career as a doctor, Vishal Parekh remembers a day in March 2010 most vividly. Not because he had performed a professional feat that day but because of the blows that relatives and friends of a patient who had died landed on his back.        
	The 22-year-old had felt completely helpless then. First, when he realised that the state-run hospital where he worked did not have the equipment and the medicines to treat the patient properly. And then, when the hospital could not provide him even the most basic protection against the misdirected wrath of the mob.        
	The patient was bleeding between the skull and the outer covering of the brain (extra-dural haemorrhage). The blood needed to be drained out immediately but we did not have the equipment or the personnel to do so using the burr hole technique, recounts the junior doctor.        
	We did not have hydrocortisone steroid, so we administered dexanethasone, which is not as effective. The patient died half an hour later. About 30 of his neighbours pushed us around and hit us saying that we did nothing to save him. The senior doctor on duty in the emergency ward did not even get up from his chair while all this was happening, he adds.        
	Junior doctors in all the state-run hospitals in the city face similar experiences with alarming regularity. Their recourse often is to go on strike  like the ones started at SSKM hospital and National Medical College and Hospital on Saturday and Sunday, respectively  that inconveniences patients a lot but improves facilities only a little.         
	Our emergency ward lacks medicines needed to treat common cases like a snake bite. If we ask a patients relatives to buy pills from outside when time is at a premium, they will understandably get agitated, says Gaurango Pramanik of the Junior Doctors Unity at SSKM.        
	The organisations demands include the addition of three sitting tables and six observation beds at the emergency outpatients department.        
	There is only one sitting table and no observation bed in the emergency ward. So we have to turn away patients who need to be under observation. Plus, we lack life-saving medicines, adds Pramanik.        
	The junior doctors also want blood tests, ultrasonography and other tests to continue 24x7 (samples have to be submitted and tests done before noon now) and portable X-ray machines for indoor patients.         
	To prevent violence against doctors, SSKM and Calcutta Medical College and Hospital now allow only two people to accompany a patient into a ward but the ban is rarely enforced.        
	We also want touts to be removed from the hospital premises. They are hand in glove with some senior emergency doctors and promise to get patients admitted if their relatives shell out money. The touts also provoke those accompanying a patient to become violent if he or she cannot be admitted, says a house staff of paediatric medicine at SSKM.        
	Junior doctors at Calcutta Medical College also allege that senior on-duty emergency medical officers take money from touts and the booty is shared with hospital administrators right up to the top.        
	Interns at the hospital received some of the equipment they had sought but not in enough numbers         
	The authorities fulfilled some of our demands after a few colleagues were beaten up and we started a ceasework in end-August, says a junior doctor.        
	We had asked for four blood pressure machines for the emergency ward, but got only one. Similarly, we dont have enough sucker machines (used in poisoning cases), boilers and other equipment. We dont even have enough trolleys, says a member of the junior doctors forum formed to press for the demands.        
	The long-term demands include an electronic display in the emergency ward showing the number of beds in each department and number of beds available.         
	A senior administrative official of Calcutta Medical College, too, feels that infrastructure improvements will go a long way in cutting down grievances of the patients as well as the doctors. But there are hitches. The extra trolleys and stretchers that we had provided recently on request from junior doctors are missing. We have lodged a complaint with the police outpost in the hospital, he says.        
	We are taking the demands seriously. For instance, we are trying to re-open the emergency orthopaedics operating theatre that was closed for repairs some years ago, adds the official.        
	The director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM, Pradip Mitra, claims there are many portable X-ray machines in the hospital, and not one, as alleged by the junior doctors. He, like junior doctors, feels touts are a big problem.

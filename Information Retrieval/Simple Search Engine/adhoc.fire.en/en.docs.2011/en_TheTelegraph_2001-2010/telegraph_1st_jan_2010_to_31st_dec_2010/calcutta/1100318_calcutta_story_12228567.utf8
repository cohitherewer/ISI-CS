          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Manzar Imam, a 33-year-old Taltala resident, was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the fake IPL ticket racket.        
	Imam used to work with Merazul Haque, the owner of a digital press in central Calcutta where fake IPL tickets were allegedly printed, said police. Haque and two others were arrested earlier in connection with the racket. Imam used to offer private tuition in the area. He is well versed in computers and might have been behind other forgery, said an officer.

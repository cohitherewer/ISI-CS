The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bomb hoax on flight
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bomb hoax on flight
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Bomb on board, scribbled on tissue paper on a SpiceJet flight left securitymen at Calcutta airport in a tizzy on Sunday.        
	No explosives could be found on the aircraft after two rounds of scanning. All 178 passengers on board the Chennai-Calcutta-Bagdogra flight were kept waiting for several hours in coaches  buses that ferry fliers between the terminal and the aircraft  while 34 of them could not fly to north Bengal during the day.        
	The flight had taken off from Chennai at 9.30am. While it was approaching Calcutta, an air hostess found a piece of tissue paper with the words Bomb on board scribbled on it in a toilet. She immediately alerted the pilot, who got in touch with the air traffic control at Calcutta airport. The message was passed on to the bomb threat assessment committee of the airport, said an ATC official.        
	Securitymen cordoned off the plane after it landed at the airport at 12.44pm. The passengers were offloaded and made to wait in coaches. Teams comprising security officers and bomb detection and disposal squad personnel scanned the aircraft and baggage twice before flashing the all-clear sign at 4.30pm.         
	Some of the passengers were interrogated but none was detained, said an officer. The passengers were allowed to leave around 3.30pm. But the 34 passengers scheduled to fly to Bagdogra were stranded as the flight was cancelled. It was too late by the time the security clearance came and the flight could not have landed at Bagdogra because of low light, said airport director R. Srinivasan.        
	A map of north Bengal, with Birpara in Jalpaiguri district marked on it, was drawn on another piece of tissue paper that was stuck on the back of a seat. Three Bhutanese students sitting on the row behind the seat were interrogated, said an official.

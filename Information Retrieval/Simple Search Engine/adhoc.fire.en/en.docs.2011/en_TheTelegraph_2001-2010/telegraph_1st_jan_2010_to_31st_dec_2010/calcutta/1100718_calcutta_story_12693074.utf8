The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | End of road for garages
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      End of road for garages
                              Roadside garages are struggling to survive                            
	When was the last time your car broke down on the road? Chances are not once, if you have a post-2004 model. And vehicles older than that but built in the 21st century might have had to make a few trips to the mechanics but will not smoke off in the middle of the road.         
	This is borne out by data available with the Automobile Association of Eastern Indias (AAEI) Breakdown Service. In 1986, the AAEI attended 14,476 breakdown calls. In 1994, the number dwindled to 4,507. In 2001, it stood at 2,565. In 2007 it was at 1,563 and in 2009, 730.        
	The association had to scale down operations at its Pramathesh Barua Sarani address. We had 20 mechanics in 1986, today we have only 10, says Suman Chattopadhyay, honorary secretary-general.         
	Sens Automobile at 4A Panditiya Road wound up five years back. The New India Motor Garage on Palm Avenue now stands empty. We have lost most of our clients, says Ashok Dutta, a manager.        
	The penetration of the automobile dealership and their multi-tier workshops is one of the reasons. There was always reason to get something done to the Ambassador or the Fiat, says Sanjoy Ghose, who runs Rajiv Auto Centre at Mandeville Gardens. Today, cars are made much better than before. Body corrosion, common in Ambassadors and Fiats, is rare in Alto, Santro or Wagon R.         
	The gear box, differential and axles were problem areas in older models. Today, we probably get a single gear box case a year. Earlier, there used to be four cases a week, says Ghosh. The suspension system of modern cars is also simpler with fewer components.         
	Spares are also a problem. Rahul Sircar of Electrical Enterprises says: Maruti sells its spares, but Hyundai, Honda and other companies are reluctant to do so, thus forcing the consumers to go to company workshops.        
	Most mechanics are not trained to handle the powertrain or the ECM. Companies have started using patented gadgets, said Rashid Mohammed of Ford Motor Company.         
	However, roadside garages survive at Bhowanipore, Mullickbazar, Park Circus and on the EM Bypass, doing dent and paint jobs that are low on technology and high on skills.                    ANASUYA BASU

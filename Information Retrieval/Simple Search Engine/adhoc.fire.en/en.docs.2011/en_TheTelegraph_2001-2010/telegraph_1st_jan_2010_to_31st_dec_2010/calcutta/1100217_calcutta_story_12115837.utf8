                      An undiscovered realm of art                              Jamini Roys pattern of line and form in his sketches and drawings serves as the main keynote to his ultimate expression. He derived this style from the Western method of determining form in divided planes which, surprisingly, is also the method found mostly in the Indian folk tradition of painting and making wooden and clay toys. This simple folk tradition attracted the artist who, already adept in the Western concept, found it easy to express himself through it. The Intimate Jamini Roy, the ongoing exhibition, showcases perhaps his earliest works in several pen and brush drawings, before he took to the palette. It offers a glimpse into his private world as most of these preliminary layouts are being displayed for the first time. The works can be divided into four groups: sketches in pen-and-ink that are key drawings for final paintings; bold brush drawings in Kalighat pata style; designs made in paper stencils with gouache finishing; and embroidered Kantha and Baluchari saree designs.   Event: An exhibition of the early works of Jamini Roy When: Till February 28; 3 pm 8 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

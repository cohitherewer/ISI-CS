The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man and machine in tandem
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Man and machine in tandem
                                          
	How does the automated teller machine minimise the cashiers job? What is the difference between a manned traffic light and an automatic one?         
	These were some questions addressed by Kishore Manohar Karandikar (picture below by Gopal Senapati), former head of automation at the Pune plant of Tata Motors, at a seminar on modern industrial practices. It was held at the Belur polytechnic institute Ramakrishna Mission Shilpamandira on February 6, as part of its 56th anniversary celebration.         
	While Karandikar spoke on the daily uses of automation, Debasish Ghosh, the associate director of Price Waterhouse Coopers, discussed robotics.         
	Machines are important in industry, but can never take the place of people in an organisation, said Karandikar.        
	Robotics is used primarily in industry for repetitive tasks, like assembling, said Ghosh. Automation will not intensify unemployment, for the increase in productivity would lead to greater investment, in turn increasing the number of jobs, he added.         
	Such industry interaction makes students better equipped to face the job market, said principal Swami Tattwajnanananda.         
	The day also saw prizes being given away to toppers of the state diploma exam for colleges under West Bengal State Council of Technical Education, in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.

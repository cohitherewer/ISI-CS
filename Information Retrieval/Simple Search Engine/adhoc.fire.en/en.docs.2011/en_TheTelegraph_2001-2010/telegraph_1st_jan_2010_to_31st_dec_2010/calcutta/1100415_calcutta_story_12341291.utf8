The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools shun grant yoke
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Schools shun grant yoke

	Six prominent city schools  all branches of Loreto  have decided to shun government grants for the sake of academic and administrative freedom.        
	Though the authorities will convey the decision to the school education department only after a formal approval from the teachers, the plan to chart a new course for the six schools with a combined strength of over 12,000 students is ready.        
	The government pays the dearness allowance (DA) to our teachers. But to avail the financial grant, we have to seek clearance on every minor administrative issue, said a principal of one of the schools.        
	The state government spends nearly Rs 25 crore every year to pay DA to teachers in 52-odd Anglo-Indian schools across Bengal, out of which 22 are in Calcutta.        
	To enjoy the governments financial largesse, the schools need its approval to implement development projects, recruit new teachers and initiate disciplinary action against errant staff members.        
	Getting government approval is a time-consuming process and the delays throw our plans haywire, said a Loreto principal.        
	A case in point is a move by one of the Loreto branches to switch from the state board to ISC that is stuck in red tape. The school had written to the government several months ago requesting a change in affiliation. It has also urged the government to allow it to start preliminary preparations for the switchover. But it cannot do so because the government has not responded to the request, said an official of one of the Loreto schools.        
	A section of Anglo-Indian schools run by the Church of North India had stopped taking the DA from the government from 2004 as the authorities chose administrative and academic freedom over grants.        
	With the salaries of school teachers rising by around 40-45 per cent with the implementation of the fifth pay commissions recommendations, refusing government grants will make balancing school budgets tough, admitted a school principal, refusing to elaborate on how the income-expenditure gap would be bridged.        
	The answer is simple.Either the authorities will raise the tuition and other fees or try to freeze the DA percentage and make up for the loss. Thats why we will oppose the decision, said Richard Gomes, the general secretary of the Association of Teachers of Anglo Indian Schools.        
	The cash-strapped state government is unlikely to persuade the schools to retain their DA-getting status, said a senior state government official. If they stop taking the DA, it will not be possible for us to keep a check on the school fees. But if the schools continue raising fees, they will face stiff resistance from parents, he added.        
	Though the schools are aware of a possible resistance from the teachers lobby and the problems in augmenting earnings through fees, they are determined to slip out of the clutches of government control. We can achieve excellence if we are allowed to grow the way we want to and if we can prove our worth, generating funds will not be a problem, said a principal.

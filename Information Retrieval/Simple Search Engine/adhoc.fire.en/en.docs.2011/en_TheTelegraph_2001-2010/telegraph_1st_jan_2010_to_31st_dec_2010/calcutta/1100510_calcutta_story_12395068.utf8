                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dance therapy for mentally ill 
          RITH BASU                          A dance movement therapy session                                   
	The first formal course in dance movement therapy, said to be effective in treating mental ailments, is underway in the city.         
	A group of 16, including four nurses of the government-run Pavlov and Lumbini Park Mental hospitals, are undergoing the certificate course, which will continue till June.        
	Kolkata Sanved, an organisation working with victims of violence and abuse since 2004, is conducting the course.         
	Dance helps one rediscover the body, articulate feelings and emotions, rely on oneself and connect and communicate. We have had very good results conducting sessions for the past two years at Pavlov and Lumbini Park. There is a need for trainers, said Sohini Chakraborty, the founder director of Kolkata Sanved.        
	The 100-hour course  designed in consultation with California-based dance therapist Bonnie Bernstein  comprises 46 hours of dance, six hours of theory, 20 hours of reading sessions and 28 hours of field practice in hospitals and homes.        
	Chakraborty, a well-known dancer, and Urmimala Sarkar, a professor of arts and aesthetics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, are conducting the dance classes. Ratnaboli Ray, the founder and member secretary of NGO Anjali, is conducting the theory classes.        
	In the course there is a lot of stress on the human rights of the mentally ill. We are teaching the trainers how to connect mental health with human rights and finally with dance movement therapy, said Ray.        
	Chameli Rani Saha, an employee of NGO Iswar Sankalpa and one of those undergoing the course, said: The course is very structured and is helping me to understand the mentally ill better. We are learning how to use dance to help the mentally ill come out of their shells.        
	Anuradha Das, a psychotherapist who has been using dance movement therapy to treat women who have developed mental illnesses after being subjected to domestic violence, found it to be a very effective tool.        
	Dance movement therapy helps women shed inhibitions about their body. It also releases stress and helps inculcate a spirit of teamwork, said the psychotherapist.

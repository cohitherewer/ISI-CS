                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Africa comes calling
          SUBHRO SAHA                                    
	The land of the Victoria Falls, among the seven natural wonders of the world, has come calling with a red carpet to woo tourists from Calcutta and the Northeast.        
	Zambia, which prides itself as the most peaceful African republic, has identified tourism as a priority sector in its fifth development plan, and is banking on the wanderlust of Calcuttans to boost its coffers.        
	We now receive around 820,000 foreign tourists a year and our target is to ramp it up to 1 million soon. We expect India, and Calcutta in particular, to provide a sizeable chunk of this traffic, Brig-Gen (retired) Allan D. Kalebuka, the acting high commissioner of the Republic of Zambia, said.        
	The senior diplomat from the nation located in the southern African sub-region was interacting recently with representatives of the citys travel trade in his missions first such roadshow in town to spell out the tourism magnets of Zambia, which has 1.5 million people of Indian origin among its 12.1 million population.        
	People know Zambia mainly as the land of the Victoria Falls, which is in Livingstone, our tourist capital. But, theres much more to our country, including 20 national wildlife parks like North and South Luangwa, Kafue, Luambe and Lower Zambezi, with great safaris and game ranching, besides shimmering lakes and vast flood plains, Kalebuka added.        
	The envoy assured tour operators that visa would be granted in a single working day. One can reach Lusaka, the Zambian capital, via Nairobi from Mumbai in seven hours flying Kenya Airways, or through Addis Ababa from Delhi on Ethiopian Airlines.        
	This is great news for Calcuttas travel trade. We have been selling primarily Kenya and South Africa to our clients all these years. Now a new African destination has opened up, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	Arjun De, the honorary consul of the Republic of Zambia in the city, promised continued dialogue between officials of the Zambia Tourism Board and Calcuttas tour operators.

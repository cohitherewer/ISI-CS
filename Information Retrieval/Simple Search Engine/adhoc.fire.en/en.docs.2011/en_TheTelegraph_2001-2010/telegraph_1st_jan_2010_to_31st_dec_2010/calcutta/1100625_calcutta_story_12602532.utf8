The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lost coach agony for passengers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lost coach agony for passengers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Passengers allotted berths in coach S7 of the Howrah-bound Doon Express were in for a surprise on Wednesday night as their compartment went missing. The passengers had to travel in other coaches where most of them were not allowed to sit.        
	A coach of the Kotdwara-Sarai Rohilla Express is attached to the Doon Express as S7 at Nazimabad station in UP.        
	The Doon Express arrived at Nazimabad around midnight, as scheduled, but the Sarai Rohilla Express was late by five hours. The Doon Express passengers would have been inconvenienced had we delayed their departure by five hours. So we allowed the train to leave without S7, said an Eastern Railway official.        
	A special coach was tagged to the train when it reached Gaya around 4am but most passengers of S7 were unaware of it. Rajesh Tiwari of Serampore, who had a berth in S7, said: I boarded another sleeper coach but the passengers there didnt allow me to sit.        
	Vinod Mondal of Burrabazar, who was forced to board an unreserved coach, had a similar experience.

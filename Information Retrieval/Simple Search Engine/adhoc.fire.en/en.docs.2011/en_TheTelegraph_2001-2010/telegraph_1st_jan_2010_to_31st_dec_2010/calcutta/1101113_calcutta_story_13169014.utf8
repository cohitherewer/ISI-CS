          A STAFF REPORTER                           Inside an AC Metro coach. A Telegraph picture                                  
	A passenger feeling suffocated in an overcrowded air-conditioned Metro Railway coach pulled the emergency chain seconds after the doors closed at Dum Dum station on Friday morning, leading to a 25-minute disruption in the service and cancellation of six rush-hour trains.        
	Metro officials failed to recall another instance of a passenger pulling the chain to get off an overcrowded coach.        
	The AC train, which entered the platform six minutes behind schedule because of a snag in the traction motor, remained stranded at the station for close to 20 minutes, till 10.59am.        
	Someone from one of the first four coaches pulled the chain, a Metro official said.        
	Many passengers of the train later told Metro officials that they had been feeling suffocated and would have passed out had the train not stopped and several of them got off.        
	The passengers blamed overcrowding and malfunctioning of the air-conditioners for the suffocation.        
	A Metro official partially denied the charge, saying: There was no problem with the air-conditioners of the rake. It was the overcrowding that had led to the situation.        
	The overcrowding, though, resulted from a Metro fault. The train, supposed to enter the platform at 10.34am, rolled in at 10.40am. Subsequently, passengers who would have been accommodated in two trains had the AC rake arrived in time, forced themselves into one.        
	After the doors closed, the passengers had problem breathing. When the train stopped after a passenger pulled the chain, the driver came down and realised that some of the passengers wanted to get out. The doors were immediately opened.        
	A Metro coach is built to carry a maximum of 312 passengers. On Friday, officials, said each of the first four coaches had at least 400 people.         
	The disruption led to the cancellation of three trains in either direction, with the ripple effect continuing after noon.

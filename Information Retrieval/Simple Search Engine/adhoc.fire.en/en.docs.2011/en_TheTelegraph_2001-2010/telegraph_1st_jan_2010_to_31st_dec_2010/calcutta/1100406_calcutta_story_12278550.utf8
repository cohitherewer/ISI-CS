The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Business bustle in shadow of flames 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Business bustle in shadow of flames 
          ARKA DAS                                    A clogged Canning Street; (top) electric wires hang over Ezra Street. Pictures by Amit Datta                                  
	Shops throwing up wares on pavements. Narrow alleys chock-a-block with vans waiting to be loaded or unloaded. Cars parked haphazardly almost anywhere. Trains of daily labourers carrying the goods on their heads. Over the head, like Damocles sword, hang live wires.        
	Bagri Market  spread across Ezra Street, Canning Street, Pollock Street and Manook Lane, a stones throw from Lalbazar  is a tinderbox waiting to be lit.        
	Ezra Street, a narrow alleyway that connects India Exchange Place with Canning Street, is lined with shops dealing in electrical goods. Since the mid-80s, at least three major fires have broken out in landmark estates here.         
	Residents played a key role in dousing the blaze in Mehta Building and Gandhi Building.        
	Neither police nor the civic authorities pay any attention to the state of affairs here. Over the past two decades, the entire area is being controlled by the business mafia. Members of the gangs run extortion rackets and put up stalls illegally, said Akhil Govila, a trader at Gandhi Building.        
	The situation is worse on Canning Street. The entire stretch is lined with buildings many of which have added floors illegally.         
	A section of traders alleged that a large number of shops on the street drew power illegally and that could lead to a disaster any moment.        
	Vans run riot on the thoroughfare, dumping goods or just casually parked to occupy space for the owners. In places, Matadors replace these vans, blocking the pavements and the thoroughfare as the traders take their time loading and unloading goods.        
	If any of the buildings catches fire, tenders will have a tough time accessing the spot through the clogged roads. The delay will prove costly.        
	Mustin Sir, a trader at Bagri Estate at the crossing of Rabindra Sarani and Canning Street, said: The entire sixth floor of the market is illegal. Passages inside have been encroached on, leaving little space to move. On the ground floor, even toilets have been sold to make way for shops.        
	In several places, he added, partition walls have been removed to make room for hole-in-the-wall shops. The building could collapse any day.        
	Asked about the lawlessness and the alleged apathy of the civic body, director-general (building) Gorachand Mondol said: There are around 1.5 lakh illegal buildings in Burrabazar. We cant do much about it.         
	Why are the police turning a blind eye to the illegal activities? Neither the traders nor the civic authorities have informed us about any unauthorised structures at Bagri Market.

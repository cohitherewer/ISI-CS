The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tummy-trim town
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tummy-trim town
          Calcutta prefers quick-fix fat reduction to the gym, says Priyanka Roy                          Slimming vest and pants, sauna belt and slimming tea: some easy fat-fighting options peddled on TV                       
	Early every morning, sometimes at the crack of dawn, and late every night, when people in call-centres work and the rest of the world sleeps or watches TV, the television set transforms into a gym. Or something close to it.               
	For that is the time when buffed-up men and curvaceous women  in tracksuit or shorts, some of the men bare-bodied  peddle a variety of items, each with a bizarre but interesting name, on home-shopping shows. Most of these items claim to work magic by helping the user shed weight, with little or no effort, and take away a lot of his money.        
	Maine yeh istemaal karke dus din mein paanch kilo ghataaye hai. Meri pati bahut khush hai! declares a middle-aged American woman jubilantly in heavily-accented, painstakingly-dubbed Hindi. Wearing what looks like an elongated stocking covering her from top to toe, a woman in her 30s walks out, claiming that the behtereen and adbhut item has helped lift her assets, making her four dress sizes smaller. The rest of the women in the audience nod their heads, smiling approvingly. Sometimes, a TV viewer is forced to stare at a sweaty stomach for a full five minutes. Its just the sauna belt at work, melting away flab at the push of a button. There is another that claims to make 7 kg disappear in 48 hours, with graphic details.         
	Everyone watches these ads, whatever time of the day or night they air in. Calcutta seems to be watching them a little more than the rest of the country. The citys fitness freaks are among the highest buyers of weight-loss equipment on television home-shopping networks. Calcutta ranks second, only next to Punjab and Chandigarh, when it comes to ordering exercise equipment, says a spokesperson for a home-shopping network based in Mumbai.        
	Calcutta is very fat.         
	Slimming exercisers, slimming belts, slimming pills, slimming tea the Calcuttan is pulling out all stops to go slim, television remote in hand. While beauty and home products sell most in the other metro cities like Mumbai and Chennai, our maximum orders for weight-loss equipment come from Chandigarh and Bhopal, followed by Calcutta, says another Mumbai-based home-shopping network which ships at least 20-25 pieces of fitness gear every month to homes in Calcutta. The sauna belt is a top Calcutta favourite followed by slimming tea, claim the home-shopping people. Fitness equipment which requires some effort isnt as popular.         
	Fat cutter is here        
	Is it the names  Slim Fit, Vibra Slimzzz, Fat Cutter, Cyclone Diet, promising an absolute, quick relief from fat  that have a particular appeal for the Calcuttan, as they have for Chandigarh and Bhopal? Is the Calcuttan gullible? Or is he or she just plain fat and lazy?        
	Weight reduction centres offer figures that are even more stunning.                               ( From top) Slimming vest and pants, sauna belt and slimming tea: some easy fat-fighting options peddled on TV       
	Of the total number of people who enrolled in VLCC centres across the country in 2008-09, a little more than 20 per cent was at our six centres in Calcutta. That represents a large number, says Veena Agarwal, the research and development head of VLCC.         
	At Vibes, another popular wellness centre that often guarantees an additional 5-kg weight loss when you pay for a 10-kg weight loss package, the highest number of people queuing up are from the city. Calcutta accounts for 38 per cent of our weight-loss clientele, while our centres in Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore put together account for the remaining 62 per cent, says Ankur Jain, the director of Vibes.         
	VLCC claims that their six centres in Calcutta have the highest number of people in the country opting for figure-correction procedures. Normally, the base circumference of the human body has a cut-off at 80 cm. In Calcutta, we have people with a base circumference of even 100 cm coming in for figure correction, says Agarwal. Calcutta has a lot more fat on its arms and thighs than the rest of the country, claims fitness trainer Sandeep Doshi. And yes, more men than women  it is a 70:30 ratio at VLCC Calcutta  want to lose weight.        
	It is not possible to know if the urgency to lose weight means that Calcutta has more obese people than Delhi or Mumbai. But the dependence on sauna belts and weight reduction centres points out that Calcutta, perhaps like Bhopal, is yet to catch up with the best professional services offered by the fitness industry. Or is shy with spending, as suspected. The city will make small, one-time investments and not big, long-term ones.         
	The equipment that can be ordered from the television shows start at Rs 2,000. A membership at a good gym costs around Rs 20,000 annually.         
	Gym grouse        
	Big chains are not very visible in Calcutta. There are 12 Golds Gym branches in Mumbai (including Navi Mumbai) and eight in Delhi (including NCR), while Calcutta has only two. Talwalkars, a Mumbai-based gym chain, has also set up shop in Calcutta, but is yet to take off. Calcutta has been a little slow in its response, it says. However, we are just a year old in the city while we have been around in Mumbai for decades. Calcuttans are getting more aware about the need to keep fit. Our clientele comprises people from age 16 to 65, says Pritam Kaur, the manager of Talwalkars at Salt Lake.        
	The rush to buy equipment that sheds fat readily also indicates the lack of physical culture in Calcutta and the quick-fix mentality.         
	The average Calcuttan is too lazy to even take out 10 minutes in a day to exercise. When it comes to fitness, Calcutta always looks for shortcuts, says fitness expert Preetom Mukherjee Roy.         
	If home-shopping networks are benefiting from a fat and lazy Calcutta, city fitness stores are also reporting a jump in sales. The sale of Body Slimmers, in particular, has risen from 10-12 per month last year to 20-30 every month this year, says Vasu Moryani of Bhagwati, which has stores at Metro Plaza and South City Mall. Calcuttans are even taking loans to buy fitness gear, adds Moryani.        
	Delhi and Mumbai have now graduated to more professional set-ups with proper trainers. Like the smaller cities of India, Calcutta is still in the early stages of the fitness drive, says Mumbai-based fitness expert Stephen Fernandes.        
	Food fetish        
	But what is it about Calcutta that makes it fat? Our diet, say the experts. The majority of our clients are from the business community of the city that is known to have an oil and sugar- rich diet, says VLCCs Agarwal. Calcutta is a food-rich city with food-loving people. It scores over any Indian city in terms of the variety of street food and sweets available, says nutritionist Hena Nafis. Calcuttans eat more carbohydrates, less proteins than people living in other metro cities, she adds.         
	The experts, though, claim that awareness levels have risen substantially over the last few years. Wider exposure and the fact that more and more women want to fit into western clothes has spurred this consciousness, says Ranadeep Moitra. With the party scene improving over the last few years and the fashion weeks coming in, Calcutta is now trying to look its best and play catch up with the rest of India, says Nafis. Vibes claims that its Calcutta clients are as young as 15 and as old as 85.         
	But for the time being, its sauna belts over the treadmill.         
	Fitness, if it came in a bottle, everybody would have a great body, actress-singer Cher had once famously declared. For Calcutta, it could be packed in a phial of slimming capsules.

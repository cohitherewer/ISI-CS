The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth held for train acid attack
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Youth held for train acid attack
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The man who allegedly threw acid injuring at least 10 women on a local train last week was held while travelling in a womens compartment on Monday.         
	Suman Das, 26, was among the several who landed in the GRP net during a drive against men travelling in womens compartments. He was on a Sealdah-bound train.        
	Officers started questioning him since his appearance matched the description provided by the injured women, who were travelling on Sealdah-Baruipur local. Das allegedly confessed to the crime.         
	GRP personnel, however, are in the dark about why he attacked the women and whether he had targeted anyone in particular.        
	There are many inconsistencies in Dass statements. He is in judicial custody now. We will interrogate him again once we get his custody, said a senior GRP officer.        
	According to the cops, the resident of Ghutiari Sharif in South 24-Parganas has a criminal record.         
	Following the attack, three women were admitted to Eastern Railways BR Singh Hospital. Two of them have been discharged after treatment. Mamata Panja, who had sustained 40 per cent burns, is still admitted to the hospital. Her condition is stable, said a doctor.         
	Dilip Mitra, the director general of police (railways), claimed Das was the only attacker. Witnesses, however, had said two youths had attacked them. Sources in the GRP said Das was not alone and he might not have been the only attacker.        
	Cops are yet to track down those responsible for robbing eight women on a local train near Park Circus station on Thursday afternoon.

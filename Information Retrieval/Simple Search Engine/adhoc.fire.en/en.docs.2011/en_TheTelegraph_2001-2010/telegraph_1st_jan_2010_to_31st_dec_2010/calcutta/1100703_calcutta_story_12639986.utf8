The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro smoke scare
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro smoke scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Passengers were evacuated from a Metro Railway train at Chandni Chowk station on Friday evening after one of the coaches filled with smoke, sparking panic.        
	As soon as the Kavi Nazrul-bound train stopped at the station around 5.55pm, passengers of the second coach from the front rushed out to the platform and alerted the driver.         
	All the passengers in the train were immediately evacuated and the empty train was taken to the Tollygunge maintenance base for a check-up, said a Metro spokesperson.        
	Another train carried the stranded passengers to their destinations.         
	A burning smell was coming from one end of the coach since I boarded the train at Belgachhia. As the train was approaching Chandni Chowk, the coach filled with smoke and we panicked, said Dhrubojyoti Chowdhury, a 70-year-old Gariahat resident who was to get off at Kalighat station.        
	The train was packed with people returning from office and there was a possibility of a stampede as passengers scrambled to get out the moment the doors slid open, said witnesses.        
	Passengers alleged that there was no announcement through the public address system about what had happened.

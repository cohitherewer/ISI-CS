The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rescue from moms jail
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rescue from moms jail
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 23-year-old woman was rescued from a flat in Howrahs Bally on Friday after her husband alleged that she had been kept in confinement by her mother for marrying without her approval.        
	The police coaxed the mother to open the door and let her daughter out. Shalini Thakur hugged her husband and wept as she stepped out.        
	Mayur Anand, 24, who works with a share-trading company, said the local police station had turned him away when he had first approached them five days ago. They only lodged a general diary, Mayur said. The diary entry does not necessitate a probe.        
	The same police station swung into action after he met CID special inspector-general Anuj Sharma in Calcutta on Thursday. A police team knocked on the Thakurs third-floor flat, off GT Road, around 2.30pm on Friday.        
	Shalini, who works with Metro Railway in Calcutta, had not been attending office over the past week. She lived with her mother Pushpa, 45, an Eastern Railway employee, since her fathers death seven years ago.        
	An officer of Bally police station said: Shalini jumped into Mayurs arms with tears rolling down her face and fell unconscious. She was weak because of the agony of the past few days. She later went to her husbands house in central Calcutta.        
	I met her five years ago and we got married on February 23 last year. It was a registered marriage. We decided to wait for the social marriage because both of us wanted to be sound financially. Last month, we decided to inform our families about the wedding, Mayur said.        
	Pushpa had allegedly tried to force Shalini to lodge a police complaint against Mayur accusing him of drugging and forcing her to marry him.        
	She locked me up in a room and even threatened to kill me when I refused to lodge the false complaint, Shalini told police. From her confinement, she had texted her plight to Mayur. An officer called and said today that they would raid her home along with two women cops and I should join them, Mayur said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cracks in her culture club   Alls not well in C-team
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cracks in her culture club     - Guess who was there for Mamatas lunchtime variety          MOHUA DAS                             ldquo;You rsquo;ve become even more thin, rdquo; Mamata Banerjee admonished actress June, before turning an affectionate eye towards her children Shivangini and Shivendra; (Below) Suvaprasanna played the hands-on host at his Raichak home                                       
	Two messages  a pleasant one and another not so pleasant  greeted Mamata Banerjee on Sunday afternoon when she reached the Raichak retreat of Suvaprasanna to attend the party the painter throws every January 31.        
	A sculpture  with a bleeding body in red lying amid hammer and sickle symbols  in the middle of the lawn symbolising the Lefts downfall in its citadel for 32 years must have made Mamatas day. You can call it the ruins of communism Its a reflection of change, said Suvaprasanna, host of the annual do which became high-profile since Mamata started attending it two years ago.        
	But the other message  evident in the long list of absentees  must have struck a discordant note as it meant that all was not well with her C-team. Several of her key cultural aides, from her fledgling support base from the arts and performing arts, stayed away and the absence was noticed. Unlike last year, this time I dont see too many intellectuals here... Bibhasda (Chakraborty), Shaoli Mitra, Bratya Basu are all missing, said painter Jogen Chowdhury referring to the no show of three theatre personalities.        
	Singer-turned politician Kabir Suman, who was the star performer at last years party, writer Mahasveta Devi and poet Joy Goswami were also conspicuous by their absence despite being invited. Actor-director Koushik Sen, who was invited last year but could not attend, was struck off the guest list this year.         
	Mamata reached the Raichak cottage around 2.30pm and was there till 5pm, mingling with guests, talking politics and also singing along to some of her request numbers.                          
	Several prominent Calcuttans  painters Ganesh Pyne and Samir Aich, actress June, industrialists Harsh Neotia and Sanjay Budhia and representatives from the citys diplomatic fraternity  turned up for the afternoon get together.         
	I make it a point to attend this party as I get to meet so many people from the world of art and culture. I like music, so I also come to listen to music. It feels good, Mamata told Metro, seated next to Suvaprasannas wife, Shipra.                    ldquo;The sculpture signifying the end of the Left Front. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya       
	But her feel-good factor must have diminished on Sunday, given the rifts in her culture ranks. In Sumans absence, Mamata had to be content with Soumyajit and Sourendra, who performed some of her favourite songs, including Aaguner poroshmoni.        
	A senior Trinamul leader said that a long absentee list at a programme attended by Mamata is a rarity, as her culture clan never misses the opportunity to be seen with her at both public and private gatherings.         
	I got a formal invitation to attend the party, but I didnt go I took the decision after consulting others, who didnt show up because they are also maintaining a distance from Suvaprasanna, said a prominent member of Mamatas culture clan on condition of anonymity.         
	Our message is clear We are with Mamata, but not with Suvaprasanna, said the key member of Mamatas culture brigade while adding that Mahasweta Devi had even skipped Saturdays railway programme at Nandigram to avoid a meeting with the painter.         
	Mamata first felt the tremors in her sushil samaj  who rallied around her during the Singur and Nandigram movements  during the drama that unfolded over Kabir Sumans resignation threat last November.         
	Suman made his falling out with Suvaprasanna, who is the chairman of the passenger amenities committee of the railways, public. So did some of Mamatas interlocutors  like Chakraborty and Mitra  whom she had entrusted with the responsibility to tide over the crisis.        
	He is one of the reasons behind the sharp division among Mamatas culture coterie People who have risen through the ranks in the party also dislike him because of his attitude, said a senior Trinamul leader.        
	But Mamata on Sunday appeared to be at home with the painter and his family. His constant reiteration to all and sundry that Mamata shob theek kore debe... Change is here, might have helped.

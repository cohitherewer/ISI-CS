The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old books going places
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Old books going places

	Long before the Internet was even thought of and people depended entirely on snail mail, books provided a natural link with thinkers and readers the world over. So I should not have been as surprised as I was when I received an email from David Nelson, the man behind the famous website of photographs of Calcutta taken by Clyde Waddell in 1945 uploaded by the South Asia Section of the Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania, who requested me to trace a book dealer named R. Bhattacharya of Mahesh Mukherjee Feeder Road in Ariadaha in north Calcutta. The phone number did not work but a colleague, who is an Ariadaha resident, discovered that the man had sold off his house and shifted to Sodepur, further north.        
	Nelson, who is the coordinator for Area Studies South Asian Studies/Cinema Studies Librarian of Van Pelt Library, wrote in another email that: I probably started buying almost 15 years ago when I came here. I used to get these old typewritten cyclostyled lists and they were quite varied. I would say his stuff is hard to get rather than rare but valuable all the same. I purchased from him a number of official Catholic texts, eg, decrees from Bombay and Calcutta in Latin (and some English) and some Hindi catechisms from the early 20th century. He has a large Sanskrit collection from which I have acquired a number of titles.        
	R. Bhattacharya turned out to be Rabindranath, a portly man of 52, not half as old as I thought he would be. His small house in Sodepur is quite predictably lined with books stacked neatly on shelves, for these, after all, are his stock in trade. A couple of old prints and an old map hang on the walls. Bhattacharya says preserving these is a huge problem as he cannot use insecticides  the use of chemicals is forbidden in libraries abroad. Moisture also kills books and the climate here is notorious for its humidity.                        Books from Rabindranath Bhattacharya collection. Telegraph pictures       
	He had already brought out some rarities before he sat down to be interviewed. The first was an 80-pager titled Maharaja Krishnachandra Rayasa Charitram (Life of Raja Krishna Chandra Roy), by Rajiv Lochana Mukhopadhyay printed in London in 1811. A translation of Bankim Chandras novel titled Krishna Kantas Will by Miriam S. Knight, Pentateuch of 1927 vintage in Hebrew, Vicarious Punishment in Hindustani with a printrun of 1,000 published by the Bombay Tract and Book Society in 1863, Tent on the Plain  A Sunday Stop for Sunday School Children Part III, printed at Secundra Orphan press in 1861. A Catalogue of the Plants Cultivated in the Honorable East India Companys Botanical Garden, Calcutta, and Serampore Botanic Garden printed in Bishops College, Calcutta, in 1845. He displayed several such moth-eaten and dog-eared volumes. Not really incunabula but volumes whose value has gone up because they are difficult to locate.        
	Bhattacharya began young  very young, at 14 in fact. His father was blind and his uncle brought him up. So he was forced to take up a job with an old book dealer in Shyambazar. So whatever he lacks by way of formal education he makes up for with his knowledge of old books which he has acquired through years of experience.         
	The Internet has made things easier for him. His job is to collect books from various sources and send an exhaustive list to collectors and institutions, mainly abroad, for some of these tomes can cost a fortune.        
	His area of interest is mainly art architecture, ancient Indian history and Sanskrit studies, his buyers are from the US, European countries like Germany and Switzerland, the UK and Japan. He scours old bookshops all over the city and particularly College Street for new stocks and occasionally discovers a treasure trove when the collections of old private libraries and institutions like St Xaviers College are disposed of.        
	He needs to keep tabs on possible sources through touts to whom he has to pay a cut. He purchases them in a lot and after he has separated wheat from chaff, the leftover is exhibited in his stall at the annual Calcutta Book Fair. So, unless he is able to sell them at a price three times what he bought them for, he cannot break even.        
	Ayurvedic books in Sanskrit are in demand in the Netherlands and Southeast Asian countries. One American collector is only interested in books on rajas and zamindars. He has to keep his customers varied tastes in mind.         
	When he was weaned on this trade and even later, he had to produce catalogues and mail these to universities whose addresses were available then in a listings book titled The World Learning priced at Rs 22,000.         
	Bhattacharya said the price of a book, of course, depends on its rarity. The 80-page book on Raja Krishnachandra Roy will command a price of Rs 120,000, whereas the Golden Book of Tagore published in 1931 by Modern Review  a limited edition volume with a printrun of 150  will cost Rs 25,000, although it is a much larger tome.        
	The enormous hike in postal charges, five times since April 5, and the long time it takes, 14 to 15 months, against six months earlier, for parcels to reach their destinations abroad has hit his trade. The closure of the Kidderpore docks is responsible for this delay, he stresses, and he never receives any payment till the consignment has reached its destination.

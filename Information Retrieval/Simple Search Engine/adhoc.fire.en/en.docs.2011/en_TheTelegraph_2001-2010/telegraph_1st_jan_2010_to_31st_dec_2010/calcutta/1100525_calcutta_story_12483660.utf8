                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      60kmph squall lashes town

	Darkness descended on Monday afternoon with the seasons second Norwester hitting town at 60kmph, accompanied by bouts of torrential rain that the Met office said could be the trend for the next 48 hours.        
	Till 5.30pm, the city had received 7.4mm of rain in 24 hours, less than Saturdays downpour that lasted longer but stronger in intensity over a short period.        
	The Patna Met office confirmed that Mondays squall was a Norwester. The storm hit Dhanbad and Bokaro with wind speed of 55kmph before moving towards south Bengal, an official said.        
	Calcutta has received far fewer Norwesters than normal this season. The first one came late on May 7 accompanied by 31mm of rain in 24 hours, the highest this summer.        
	Cyclonic storm Laila, which has weakened into a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, favoured Mondays thunderstorm. Under its influence, we expect more thundershowers over the next 48 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Cloud imagery from the satellite Kalpana-1 at 2.30pm showed convective clouds that trigger thundershowers over all of Gangetic Bengal.        
	The afternoon rain brought down the days maximum temperature to three notches below normal at 33.1 degrees Celsius, while the minimum was normal at 26.8 degrees Celsius.        
	The high humidity range of 64 to 94 per cent pushed up the discomfort index but the storm did cool down things.         
	The Celsius is likely to dip by a couple of more degrees overnight, said a Met official.

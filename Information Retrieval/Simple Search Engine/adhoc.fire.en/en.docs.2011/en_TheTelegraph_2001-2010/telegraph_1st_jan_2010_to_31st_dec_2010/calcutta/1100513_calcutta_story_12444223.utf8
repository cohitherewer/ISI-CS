                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      4 die in Arunachal gorge
          OUR BUREAU                                              Monika Dasgupta and Kaberi and Asim Bhattacharjee                                  
	Four tourists from the city died and three were critically injured when the Tata Sumo they were travelling in through dense fog skidded off the road and fell into a gorge in Jang in Arunachal Pradesh on Tuesday evening.        
	The victims were identified as Jadavpur resident Asim Bhattacharjee and wife Kaberi, in their mid-50s, and Monika Dasgupta, 53, and her friend Srilata Ghosh Dastidar, 50, both from Kestopur.        
	Asim was the manager of the United Bank of Indias BBD Bag branch while his wife was with the banks Santoshpur branch. Monika was a senior manager with the banks Sreebhumi branch.        
	The injured are Monikas husband Goutam, 58, mother-in-law Shefali, 85, and younger son Ritam, 18. The driver, too, was seriously injured.        
	The driver lost control and the car skidded off the road before falling 50 metres into a gorge between 7.30 and 8pm on Tuesday in Jang, around 50km from Tawang. The three injured tourists and the driver were admitted to a hospital in Tawang and later shifted to a Guwahati hospital, said Tawang police superintendent Sang Norbu Mosobi.        
	The tourists left the city for Guwahati on Sunday morning and reached Bomdila in Arunachal Pradesh on Tuesday morning. At Bomdila, they hired the Tata Sumo to visit Tawang, around 180km away.        
	Monikas nephew Bhaskar Palit, who reached Tawang with her elder son Ritwik on Wednesday morning, said armymen had rescued the injured from the gorge. The bodies of those who died were retrieved this morning. It seems the Sumo suffered a flat tyre and lost control.        
	Sports and Sunderbans development minister Kanti Ganguly had accompanied Bhaskar and Ritwik to Arunachal Pradesh but he did not go up to Tawang. He has been a big support for us, said Bhaskar.        
	Asim and Kaberis only son Anik, who could not travel with the couple as he was scheduled to visit the US for office work, has left for Tawang with an aunt to bring back his parents bodies. Srilatas cousin Santanu Guha, too, is on his way to Arunachal.

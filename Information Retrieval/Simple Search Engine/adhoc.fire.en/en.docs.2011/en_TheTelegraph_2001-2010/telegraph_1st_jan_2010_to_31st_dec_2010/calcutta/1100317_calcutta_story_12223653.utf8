The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SRKs acting offer to fire minister 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SRKs acting offer to fire minister 
          OUR BUREAU                          Bappi Lahiri joins Juhi Chawla to cheer the KKR at the contentious IPL Club Lounge at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday night. Heard in the stands: The only time the structure was under threat was when Bappi Lahiri started moving to the music. Picture by Pabitra Das                                  
	Fire services minister and sometime actor Pratim Chatterjee would be glad to act in a Bengali film with Shah Rukh Khan but the badshah of Bollywood must climb off his pedestal (read: the allegedly unsafe Rs 32,000-a-seat deck at the Eden Gardens).        
	Shah Rukh Khan called me (on Monday) and apologised. He wanted to come over to my house. He said he wants to do a Bengali film with me as part of the cast. I like him as an actor and told him that I would be glad to do a film with him but the disputed gallery cannot be occupied. If that is done, I will move court, Chatterjee, who has acted in a couple of films, told Metro on Tuesday.        
	So while Shah Rukhs apology and acting offer may have ensured that he hasnt burnt his bridges with the fire minister, the IPL Club Lounge dubbed marattok bipodjonok (extremely dangerous) by Chatterjee is set to be demolished and replaced with a safer one before the Kolkata Knight Riders next home match on April 1.        
	PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, whose department had allowed the stand to be used for the first two matches on condition that the organisers would accept responsibility for any mishap, confirmed that Team KKR had accepted the governments decision.        
	Shah Rukh Khan was very humble and apologised for the controversy...We informed the KKR on Tuesday that a new gallery would be constructed. Work will begin on Wednesday, said Goswami.        
	Off the pitch, Lalbazar and Writers Buildings spent the day writing letters to each other, and to the KKR. Acting on the FIR filed by Chatterjees department against the Cricket Association of Bengal over the allegedly illegal stand, the police wrote to the KKR management first thing in the morning, seeking clarifications on the seven points raised in the complaint.        
	Colleen Venning, a KKR representative, said in her reply that the structure had 14 fire extinguishers on the site with six outside and four each at the ground level and on the upper tier. The letter also said that gate No. 3, next to the structure, was wide enough for fire-tenders to pass.         
	Armed with the KKRs reply, the police commissioner wrote to the home secretary  with copies to the director-general and the principal secretary of the fire services department  stating that the cops were ready to demolish the structure, if the government wished so.         
	A similar letter to Sumit Sur, the officer-in-charge of the fire services department (headquarters), said the demolition should be completed before the scheduled 8pm start to the Knight Riders vs Chennai Super Kings match.        
	Late in the afternoon, minister Chatterjee said he had replied to the police commissioners letter. But Jawed Shamim, the joint police commissioner (headquarters), said no such letter had reached Lalbazar till 5pm.        
	At 8.20pm, a little after the Chennai Super Kings had lost their first wicket, a cheerful Shah Rukh took his seat in the deck of the IPL Club Lounge.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rizwanur kin plea in apex court
          OUR BUREAU                               
	The Supreme Court on Monday admitted an appeal by Rizwanur Rahmans mother and brother challenging the acquittal of former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and deputy commissioner Gyanwant Singh in the case relating to his death.        
	The apex court will hear the appeal  against the high courts decision to acquit the two senior policemen  on October 26.        
	The judges directed Kishwar Jahan and Rukbanur Rahman to serve notices on Mukherjee and Singh asking them to respond to the case.        
	Rahman had been found dead near railway tracks in Patipukur on September 21, 2007, just over a month after he married businessman Ashok Todis daughter Priyanka against her familys wishes.        
	After probing the death, the CBI had charged Ashok, his brother Pradip, one of their relatives, deputy commissioner Ajay Kumar, assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das with abetting Rizwanurs suicide.         
	Mukherjee and Singh were warned for allegedly being involved in the matter.         
	Kishwar Jahan and Rukbanur have claimed in the special leave petition they have filed in the Supreme Court that the state government had not taken disciplinary action against the two officers.         
	Mukherjee had been promoted to the chief of the Bureau of Police Research and Development after the Rizwanur incident. He retired on September 30.        
	Singh had been transferred to the enforcement branch of the state police.        
	The Rahmans had claimed Mukherjee and Singh had forced subordinate officers to pressure Rizwanur.        
	The Todis and the other accused had moved an appeal before the high court division bench. It found that the investigation process of the CBI was faulty and asked the agency to conduct a fresh probe.        
	The Supreme Court set aside the high court division benchs order.

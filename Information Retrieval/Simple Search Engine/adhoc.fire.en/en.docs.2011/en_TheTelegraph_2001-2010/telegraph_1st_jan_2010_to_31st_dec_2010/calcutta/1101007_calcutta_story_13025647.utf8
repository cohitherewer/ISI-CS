          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Inside Presidency University on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta                                   
	Presidency University may have got its first vice-chancellor but it will not register its first student before next year.        
	Students who were admitted to the undergraduate and postgraduate courses at the institution this year will remain Presidency College students and will be registered with Calcutta University, said an education department official.        
	Students who are admitted next year will be registered with Presidency University.         
	Students expressed disappointment at the decision. We were hopeful that we would get our degrees from Presidency University. The appointment of the vice-chancellor makes no difference to us as there will be no change in our status, said a first-year student.        
	For now, the 193-year-old seat of learning will function both as a college and a university. It will have two heads  vice-chancellor Amita Chatterjee, who will work as the head of the university, and incumbent principal Amitava Chatterjee, who will act as the head of the college.         
	The principals post will continue to exist as the structure of the college still exists. The principal will look after the needs of the students who had been enrolled as students of Presidency College, said Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri, the state higher education minister.        
	He did not spell out how long the principals post will remain.         
	The vice-chancellor will do the groundwork to upgrade the university to a centre of excellence.        
	The first job of the vice-chancellor is to start making arrangements for recruiting teachers for the university. She will also have to prepare to set up the various administrative bodies  faculty councils, executive council and the court, said a senior official of the department.        
	Once Presidency Colleges conversion from a fully government-controlled institution to a unitary university is complete, the current crop of teachers will have to take transfer to other government-run colleges to continue to work as state employees.         
	They will have to clear a selection process to continue teaching at Presidency University.

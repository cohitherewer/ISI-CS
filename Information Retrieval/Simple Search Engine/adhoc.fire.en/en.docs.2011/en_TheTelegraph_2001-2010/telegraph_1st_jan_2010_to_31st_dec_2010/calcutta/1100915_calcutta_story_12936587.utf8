The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Serial clicker of girls caught
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Serial clicker of girls caught
          RITH BASU                              
	A serial clicker was caught in the act while aiming his cellphone at a girl in Chingrihata on Tuesday after which 915 photographs  mostly of young girls  came tumbling out of his memory card.        
	With none of the women stepping up to lodge a complaint, a case could not be registered against Debabrata Debnath, in his 30s, who was taken to the Bidhannagar South police station and then let off with a warning.        
	This comes three days after a man was arrested for clicking a woman on his cellphone at the Netaji Bhawan Metro station and a day after police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had, through Metro, urged women to come forward and combat the growing menace of cellphone snaps.        
	At Chingrihata on Tuesday, a 23-year-old girl clicked by Debnath  who works for a company in the DLF Building of Rajarhat  feared what he could have done with her snaps retrieved from his picture folder, but chose not to register a complaint.        
	I am very new in Calcutta and yet I was ready to lodge a complaint. But when no other girl agreed, I decided not to get into this alone, said the girl from Durgapur.        
	If she had complained, the serial clicker could have been charged with insulting the modesty of a woman, by word, gesture or act and intruding upon the privacy of a woman under Section 509 of the IPC. The section is bailable but if found guilty, the offender can be imprisoned for a year.        
	The girl was standing at the Chingrihata intersection waiting for a bus, having missed her office pick-up, when she saw a man in a yellow shirt and trousers being attacked by some of her colleagues.        
	One of them explained that the man had been caught clicking girls at the intersection and his phone was found to have 915 pictures, including one of his wife and child.        
	The colleague of mine comes from Garia and this man was following her, travelling by the same auto and bus. He used to click girls even while pretending to be on the phone. As there were quite a few of our colleagues at the spot on Tuesday, he was challenged as soon as he clicked, said the girl.        
	When confronted, Debnath took out the memory card of his phone and tried slipping it into his socks but was caught.        
	He may have morphed the pictures and posted them on the Net.... Its so scary to find your photos in a strangers cellphone, said the girl.

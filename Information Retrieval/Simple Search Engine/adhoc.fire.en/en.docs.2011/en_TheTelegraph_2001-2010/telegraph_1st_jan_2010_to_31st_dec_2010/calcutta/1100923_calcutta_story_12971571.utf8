The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A city caught at the crossroads
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A city caught at the crossroads
                                          
	Getting stuck at key crossings is a way of life in Calcutta. Though the automatic traffic signals are supposed to turn green within 150 to 200 seconds, the waiting time at many vital intersections far exceeds that.        
	Continuing the series on the city that moves in slow-motion, Metro passed through some major crossroads in north Calcutta during peak hours. It wasnt a joyride.        
	Shyambazar        
	Minimum waiting time: Nine minutes. The five-point crossing is a stop-start-stop point, whichever direction you approach it from.        
	Why the go-slow: All roads leading to the crossing  from BT Road, Hatibagan, Jessore Road, Bagbazar and Maniktala  have constant vehicular pressure. Hawkers have overrun pavements, forcing pedestrians on to the road and narrowing the carriageway further.        
	What can be done: Removal of hawkers from near the intersection, for starters. Otherwise, only large-scale traffic re-engineering can help.        
	CR Avenue-MG Road crossing        
	Minimum waiting time: Ten minutes; the lights will go from red to green to red to green before you can pass.        
	Why the go-slow: Vital link to the central business district, on the north-south axis. Incessant traffic flow from nearby roads like Ganesh Chandra Avenue. Slow-moving vehicles like cycle-rickshaws and cycle vans dot the trade hub. No designated bus-stop, passengers stand on the carriageway.        
	What can be done: Fix non-peak time slots for slow-moving vehicles. Put bus stops in place and penalise buses picking up passengers between stops.                    
	Baguiati        
	Minimum waiting time: Seven minutes.        
	Why the go-slow: Enormous load, narrow connecting roads, parking anarchy (double-line parking is a common sight), bicycles and cycle-rickshaws are a constant menace.        
	What can be done: Stop illegal parking. Remove illegal makeshift shops eating into the carriageway.        
	Kestopur        
	Minimum waiting time: Nine minutes, on VIP Road. The intersection is perennially clogged.        
	Why the go-slow: The huge load on VIP Road, a vital link to the airport and the overpopulated northern fringes, poor traffic management and slack policing. Buses to cycle-rickshaws, everything runs riot here. Autos park as they please even within 5 metres of the intersection on VIP Road. Pedestrians use the carriageway in the absence of pavements.        
	What can be done: Build a footbridge for the large number of pedestrians crossing VIP Road. Ban cycle-rickshaws.        
	Moulali        
	Minimum waiting time: Ten minutes, from the foot of Sealdah bridge to the crossing.         
	Why the go-slow: The load is enormous, with busy arteries like APC Road, AJC Bose Road, CIT Road, SN Banerjee Road and Lenin Sarani converging here. Plus, the flow from Beleghata and College Street merging with the traffic on Sealdah flyover. Giant drainage pipes eat into much of the bus bay in front of NRS Medical College and Hospital. Slow-moving vehicles enjoy right of passage.        
	What can be done: Policing to be increased and improved. Remove the drainage pipes and ensure buses stick to the bus bay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | I found my name marked
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      I found my name marked
										      who stole   my vote?                        
	Avijit Roy, a resident of Beleghata (ward 34), tells Metro how his vote on Sunday was marred by the mark of a thumb.              
	I was planning to leave home around 1pm to cast my vote when my brother called me from the booth saying someone else had voted for me.        
	I rushed to Beleghata Deshbandhu Girls High School and found my name on the electoral list marked, indicating I had cast my vote.        
	The space meant for the voters signature had a thumb impression. In fact, all names on the list had such impressions against them, though only those who cannot sign are needed to put their thumb impressions.        
	The agents of the Left Front candidate in our ward said thumb impressions were being taken to speed up the poll process.        
	State election commission observer Kalipada Bhar later clarified that no order had been issued to polling officials to ask literate voters to put their thumb impressions.        
	I insisted on casting a tender vote. The presiding officer allowed it but I am not sure whether the right procedure was followed.        
	All through, the Left Front agents in the booth were abusing me for creating a ruckus.        
	Earlier, the CPM boys threatened to bash up my brother when he protested the electoral malpractice. When he asked the lone agent of the Trinamul candidate why he was silent, he pointed at his swollen, blood-shot eye.        
	The cops outside the polling station were seen turning away some boys and girls pleading with them not to cast any more votes. I know you have voted several times. No more please, an officer said.        
	At one point, the officer-in-charge of Beleghata police station rushed to the spot to disperse CPM men who had an altercation with cops and paramilitary personnel. The cadres claimed that Trinamul supporters were allowed to cast false votes earlier in the day.        
	I dont know who is right. I dont know who is wrong. All I know is that I lost my democratic right today for no fault of mine.

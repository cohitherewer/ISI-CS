                      Love and war                    To commemorate the 65th anniversary of Victory over Fascism, Eisenstein Cine Club and Consulate General of the Russian Federation in Calcutta (cultural department) present Love at the Time of War and After, a series of films on the theme of war and its impact on the lives of common people. To be screened today is the multiple award-winning French film, The Last Metro (Le Dernier Mtro; a scene from the film appears here) directed by Francois Truffaut. Set in German-occupied Paris during World War II, it tells the story of Lucas Steiner, a Jewish theatre director, and his wife, Marion Steiner, who struggles to keep him concealed from the Nazis in their theatre cellar while she performs his former job both as an actress and director of the company. A new play, Disappearance, in which Marion stars alongside a dashing young actor, Bernard Granger, provides a chance of financial salvation for the theatre, which is badly in debt. However, Bernards connections to the resistance and his growing passion for Marion threaten to bring disaster to the company.

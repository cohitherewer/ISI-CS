                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt rap for garden party

	The environment department has sent a showcause notice to the botanical garden following reports that a wedding reception held illegally on the premises had littered the greens with plastic items.        
	The garden  formally known as Indian Botanic Garden  and 40 other ecologically sensitive spots were declared no-plastic zones in 2004.        
	The show-cause notice was sent by Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the department and member-secretary of the state plastic management committee.        
	The garden authorities will have to explain by February 5 why plastic bags and cups were found on the premises. Its illegal to carry plastic items to the garden, Mukherjee said.        
	Government sources said violation of the no-plastic order would result in fines and other penal actions under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.        
	We also want to know from the authorities who had organised the January 24 reception, Mukherjee said.        
	When asked about the letter, garden deputy director Sheu Kumar said: We have to find out what kind of plastic items are banned on the premises. We always try to stop visitors from carrying plastic bags to the garden but there are trespassers. However, we have already started an inquiry into the January 24 incident.        
	Metro had reported how the wedding reception of Sumantra Bagchi, a Howrah trader with alleged political links, had destroyed the greens.        
	Food was illegally cooked in the open and the invitees lunched and littered under lawn umbrellas.        
	The next morning, liquor bottles and plastic plates and cups were found scattered on the greens.        
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta, who has moved court on the issue, said: How can we expect the garden authorities to implement the no plastic notification when they cut and sell trees and allow marriage reception to be organised affecting the greens?

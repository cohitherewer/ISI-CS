                      Fair for a cause        Lions International is a worldwide fellowship and service organisation spread over 205 countries with 1.35 million members. Prevention and cure of reversible blindness, child welfare activities, including counselling for anti-drug addiction amongst young people, and general health care programmes are some of the major activities taken up by Lions clubs. The Lions Club Of Calcutta (Presidency) has constructed its own multi-project centre at Regent Estate which presently has various outdoor clinics for eye treatment, ECG, osteo-physiotherapy, blood-sugar tests and homeopathy. Plans are afoot to start dental and pulmonary function test clinics. Facility for training for self-employment with special emphasis on technical education will also be created shortly. This centre will also start an Anaemia Free World and Sight For Kids programme. The Club, which presently has 37 members, is also engaged in organising blood donation, eye operation and health check-up camps. It also recycles books, clothes and toys for underprivileged children. Providing help to women for self-employment is also high on the clubs agenda. Since its inception in 1994, it has been successfully organising Utsav, an exhibition-cum-sale to raise funds for its various social service programmes and also for encouraging lady entrepreneurs to come forward and commercially explore and develop their talents.

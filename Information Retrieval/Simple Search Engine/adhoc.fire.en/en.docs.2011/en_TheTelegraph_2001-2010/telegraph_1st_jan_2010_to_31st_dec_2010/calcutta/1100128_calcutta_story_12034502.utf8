                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      GenX parade at R-Day
  - Children hooked on cyber warfare gape at real weaponry          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          Children at the Republic Day parade on Tuesday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	Sarthak Chatterjees father is an army officer but he owes his knowledge of heavy artillery to Universal Combat.        
	This Republic Day, a friend persuaded the Class VII student hooked on computer combat to log out of his virtual battleground and head for the Red Road parade to see a real tank. The trip turned out to be an eye-opener in more ways than one.        
	A tank looks so different, and huge, from near. Also, the Republic Day parade is far more interesting than I thought it would be, Sarthak, a student of Army Public School, told Metro.        
	For many among the large group of children in the crowd this year, their first Republic Day parade was as much about seeing the military equipment they are familiar with  thanks to computer games and films  as about being part of a national celebration.        
	Some parents convinced their children by saying that what they see on the computer screen or in films would be on live display at the parade.        
	 I was reluctant when my father asked me to accompany him to the parade. But I am glad I went. It was unbelievable to see Bofors guns, rocket launchers and aircraft passing by, said Rishwabh Mondal, a Class III student from Haridevpur who plays Air Attack and Call of Duty.        
	Ramen Mondal, a regular at the Republic Day parade, hoped he wouldnt have to try hard to get his son to accompany him from next year. My wife was bored but Rishwabh loved it, he smiled.                          
	According to police, the R-Day turnout was around 1.5 lakh, a few thousand more than last year. The pleasant weather may have played a part, said a senior officer.         
	The kids  some with their families and the rest part of chaperoned groups in school uniform  initially seemed restless. But the sight of a helicopter flying overhead and showering petals on the crowd perked them up.        
	For Class IV student Soumita Dutta, who had come with her parents, sister and relatives, the helicopter flypast was the highlight. We had initially planned to go to the zoo. I am so happy we came here instead, she said on Red Road.        
	So would the parade of military might inspire some of the children to think of a career in the armed forces?        
	Sarthak said he would rather be a computer programmer. My father may be in the army but my parents dont force me to do anything, he said.

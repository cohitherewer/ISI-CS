                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rs 1cr loot at courier office
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Jewellery and cash worth Rs 1 crore were looted from a courier firms office in Howrahs Domjur early on Thursday.         
	An armed gang raided the Blue Dart office after overpowering its lone guard a little after midnight while the employees were sorting consignments to be delivered and dispatched the following morning.        
	The 10-odd youths held the employees at gunpoint and snatched the cash and valuables before fleeing.        
	The cash component was around Rs 15,000. The rest was jewellery, said an official of the Criminal Investigation Department which has taken over the probe.        
	Its too early to comment but it seems the gang struck after surveying the office and the surroundings for a few days, CID inspector-general Soumen Mitra said.        
	Sleuths visited the spot with sniffer dogs and spoke to the employees but no one was arrested till late on Thursday. The officials have not ruled out insiders involvement. The gang possible knew that the employees handled cash and valuables at night, said an official.        
	The courier office is located close to National Highway 6, in a mixed pocket of residential buildings and commercial establishments. Residents said most shops downed shutters around 9pm.        
	Bihari Paswan, the guard at the office, said the robbers, armed with revolvers and choppers, had tied him up before barging in.        
	The employees later said they were too scared to follow the youths when they left. We could not even notice whether they came on motorcycles or by a car, said an employee. We never imagined such a robbery can occur at our office, said office manager K. Pereira.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Call to ease temple traffic flow
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Call to ease temple traffic flow
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Devotees at the Dakshineswar temple on Kali Puja                                   
	The authorities of the Dakshineswar temple have sought the support of the state government and police to ensure smooth traffic flow around the shrine on Kali Puja, when the footfall of devotees shoots up.         
	About 80,000 people usually visit the temple on the occasion and most of them are caught in the resultant traffic chaos, especially on the stretch between the gate of the shrine and the nearest rotary, popularly known as Rani Rashmoni Avenue.         
	We have written to the state chief secretary and the home secretary seeking help in managing traffic between PWD Road and the temple. The traffic chaos delays thousands of devotees on their way to the temple on Kali Puja, Kushal Chowdhury, the secretary of Dakshineswar Kali Temple and Debottar Estate, told Metro.        
	According to devotees and residents, rickshaws, autorickshaws and other small vehicles worsen the traffic clog.         
	By evening, as devotees head towards the temple to attend the evening prayer, vehicles simply refuse to move, said Asit Mukherjee, who lives in the area.        
	With work on the Dunlop flyover progressing at a snails pace, the authorities fear that traffic around the temple will be the worst this year.        
	We only have about 200 cops to man traffic across North 24-Parganas. Moreover, the stretch leading to the temple is in bad shape but we cannot do much, said a senior police officer.         
	The temple authorities have also called for more police deployment to frisk devotees entering the temple.        
	The security guards at the shrine have been briefed on how to handle a crowd and additional doorframe metal detectors will be installed to ensure that long queues do not form. We request the visitors not to carry plastic packets since that would prolong the scan. We would like to have a large police presence to control the flow of people into the temple, said Chowdhury.         
	Senior officers will visit the temple and its adjoining areas on Thursday to take stock of the security threats and prepare a blueprint for the deployment of forces.        
	Plainclothesmen will be posted inside the temple and armed officers will be on vigil at strategic points.        
	It would not be proper to discuss the security concerns but all the necessary steps are being taken, said an officer of North 24-Pargans police.

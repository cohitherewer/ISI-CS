The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Now, Kali with a twist
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Now, Kali with a twist
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                            Shiva, carrying Sati rsquo;s lifeless body, towers over Kali; (bottom) Kali stands atop the Ashoka pillar. (Sudeshna Banerjee)                                 
	What if the goddess Kali comes calling in a boat? Or a palanquin? Or has a dragon snapping at her feet? Be prepared to be surprised as you go round the pandals on Friday night. Some clubs have invested in idols that have romped off the beaten track, riding the fancies of their makers.        
	Youngsters seek idols with a difference, says Ananta Pal, who has set up shop on the pavement along Jadavpur University. No, he does not have an explanation for why Kali is riding the Ashoka pillar in one of his offerings. But I know it will find a buyer, he smiles. He has reason to be confident. He has sold off both the boat and the palanquin Kali.         
	The clubs are ready to pay more for variations, says Pintu Dey Roy, manager of Radharaman Pals studio in Baishnabghata. The studio this year produced a towering Ramprasad Sen on whose upturned palms Kali stands. The idol by itself would have fetched Rs 2,500. But the inclusion of Ramprasad allowed us to charge Rs 9,500.         
	The studio also made a green Kali flanked by two skeletons and an idol with 20 heads and 20 hands. We called it the bishwarup Kali, says Sushanta Pal, putting finishing touches to another idol seemingly walking out of a demons mouth. These idols require more labour. But they fetch good money. Yes, the trend is on the rise, he says.        
	The reason why was explained by members of Nabarun Sangha of Ramgarh while they loaded a vehicle with their Kali, dressed like a village belle. We are sure to pick up two prizes, one told the others.        
	Unlike in Durga Puja, the idols look is not specified in advance. We go and choose from the ready products, says a member of Paschim Balia Haritala Mandir Committee, taking to Garia a dancing Shiva towering over Kali, a sure crowd-puller.

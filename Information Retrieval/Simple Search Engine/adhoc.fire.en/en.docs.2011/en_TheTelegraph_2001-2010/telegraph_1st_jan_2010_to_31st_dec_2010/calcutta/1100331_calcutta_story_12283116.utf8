The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Students paralyse campus
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Students paralyse campus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A demonstration by students protesting complications arising out of the short duration of Calcutta Universitys BTech course paralysed the Rajabazar Science College campus on Tuesday.         
	About 50 students of the universitys technology faculty started a sit-in outside the campus around 10.30am and did not let students and teachers and other employees enter throughout the day.         
	The trigger was the refusal by some public sector undertakings to recruit technology graduates from Calcutta University on the ground that its BTech course is of three years, a year less than in most other institutes.         
	The agitating students want the university to persuade the companies to consider BTech graduates from CU for jobs.        
	Our course is approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE). The AICTE is the apex regulator of engineering and technology education in the country. The university must now convince companies that our course is not illegal and our degrees should be accepted by them, said a student.        
	Amit Roy, the secretary of the universitys science and technology faculty, admitted the problem and said it was not possible to extend the duration of the course.        
	The duration of our course is three years because ours is a postgraduate course. Only those who have BSc honours degrees can study BTech at Calcutta University. In other places, those who have cleared their Class XII exams can apply for admission to BTech courses, said Roy.         
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said: Its unfortunate that no one was allowed to enter the campus despite the authorities promising support to the students. We even promised to help students if they moved court on the issue. We are trying to solve the matter.         
	Eden stand cleared: The state government cleared the IPL Club Lounge at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday after the fire services and the public works departments expressed satisfaction over the measures taken by the Kolkata Knight Riders authorities.        
	Airport arrest: British citizen Sofia Ahmed, 29, was arrested at the airport on Monday night for allegedly stealing 10,390 (about Rs 7.7 lakh) from her husband, after immigration officials intercepted her acting on a lookout notice. She was about to board an Emirates flight to Dubai.        
	Her father, Wasir Ahmed, a British citizen, was arrested on Sunday in connection with the case.        
	Road to New Town: State housing minister and Hidco chairman Goutam Deb on Tuesday announced commencement of work on a 5km road between Ganganagar on Jessore Road and New Town Road on April 10.        
	Murder charge: Haji Jamil Ahmed, a 46-year-old trader based in Rishra, was arrested in Narkeldanga on Tuesday for allegedly murdering his neighbour Mohammad Javed, 28. Ahmed, who allegedly confessed to the crime, suspected Javed of having an affair with his wife.        
	Varsity deadline: Calcutta University has extended the last date for submission of registration forms for undergraduates to March 31.

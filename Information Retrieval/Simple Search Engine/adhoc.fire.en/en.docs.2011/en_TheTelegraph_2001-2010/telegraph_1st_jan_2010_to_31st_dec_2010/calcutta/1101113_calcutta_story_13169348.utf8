	A fire broke out in the fourth-floor attic of Hindu School on Friday morning, a day after a blaze gutted the second-floor computer room of the 193-year-old College Street institution.        
	Officials suspect a lighted match or cigarette end had triggered the fire that charred around a hundred discarded books lying scattered on the floor of the room, close to an open window.        
	By the time three tenders reached the spot, on hearing about the fire from police, school employees had doused the fire themselves.        
	Headmaster Shyamnarayan Banerjee said the school had not alerted the fire department as it was too small a fire.        
	Employees said some of the students alerted officials on the ground floor around 11.30am about smoke billowing out of the attic.        
	Our officials rushed to the spot and saw through the attic window that the books inside were in flames, said Banerjee.        
	The officials unlocked the grille door leading to the terrace, entered the attic and started pouring water on the flames.        
	We had no problem fetching water in buckets as the overhead reservoir was close to the room. The fire was put out in 15 minutes, said Tapan Dutta, a school employee.        
	Memories of Thursdays blaze still fresh in their minds, the parents who had stayed back to take their children home after school panicked on hearing about the fire.        
	We were worried sick till a school official assured us that things were under control and no one was injured, said Jayati Ghosh, the mother of a Class VII student.        
	A team of officials from the forensic department visited the school to probe Thursdays blaze in the computer lab, probably triggered by an AC.

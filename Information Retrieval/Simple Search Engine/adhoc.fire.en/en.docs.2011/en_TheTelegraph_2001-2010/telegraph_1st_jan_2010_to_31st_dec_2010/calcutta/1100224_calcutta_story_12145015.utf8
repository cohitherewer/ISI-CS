Pictures by Soumen Bhattacharjee                    PLEASE LET ME PASS: A patient in a car stuck in the traffic snarl                    GROUNDED: Fliers walk to the airport lugging their bags                                        
	A teenager was mowed down by a speeding private bus on VIP Road at Kaikhali on Tuesday evening, sparking mob fury that saw buses being torched, private vehicles damaged and airport-bound traffic choked for more than two hours.        
	Protesters first set fire to the killer vehicle (WB 25B 2351) and then turned on three other buses, including a new one bought under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission. Around 40 cars were targeted and police attacked, prompting a lathicharge and a spate of arrests.        
	With VIP Road resembling a battle zone, airport-bound commuters could not reach their destination on time, prompting the authorities to defer around 14 flights between 6pm and 7.45pm. Those who took the Rajarhat route, too, were not spared as the protesters blocked the point where the New Town flyover meets VIP Road.        
	 Terror-stricken commuters were seen running to safety with their hands raised and fliers walking to the airport lugging their bags and suitcases.        
	Around 4.25pm, Jehangir Hussain, 15, was playing with his friends in an open space off the airport-bound flank of VIP Road when their ball landed on the artery  the stretch aligned to the west to make room for the Rajarhat flyover.        
	Jehangir, a resident of Kaikhali Mistiripara nearby, went to fetch the ball when the Barasat-bound bus, which witnesses said was racing a bus on route L-238, ploughed into him. Several local youths immediately gathered on the spot but the bus had fled by then.        
	The police said one of the youths called a friend who lived down the road, gave him the registration number of the bus and told him to stop it.        
	Around 500 metres from the accident spot, the driver had to slam the brakes as a group blocked his way. As the driver and the conductors fled, the mob ordered the passengers out before setting the bus on fire.              
	Witnesses said while the bus was burning, more than 500 people circled Jehangirs body and blocked the airport-bound flank. They demanded that the chairman of the local Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, Tapas Chatterjee of the CPM, local Trinamul Congress councillor Karibul Islam and North 24-Parganas police superintendent Rahul Srivastava turn up and apologise for the accident, announce a compensation for the victims family and stop illegal parking on the stretch.        
	The protesters alleged that the residents of some housing estates on the stretch illegally parked their cars on both sides adjoining the flyover. The cars eat into the carriageway, adding to the risk of a mishap on an artery infamous for rash driving, said a protester.        
	As news of the arson and blockade spread, personnel from the Combat Force and Rapid Action Force from Madhyamgram joined the cops from the airport, Dum Dum, Baguiati and New Town police stations at the mishap site.        
	Senior officers pleaded with the crowd to lift the blockade and allow them to remove the body for post-mortem. But the protesters abused the cops and started heckling them. The police lathicharged the demonstrators, many of whom disappeared into the housing estates and construction sites dotting the stretch.        
	As the cop team cleared the protest point and marched north, the protesters emerged from their hideouts and proceeded south, venting their ire on vehicles stuck on the thoroughfare. Their first target was a CSTC bus bought under the JNNURM, which was soon reduced to ashes.        
	Another private bus and a minibus were also set on fire while bricks and stones collected from the construction sites were hurled at hapless private cars waiting for the logjam to clear.        
	The renewed arson prompted the police to rush back and resort to a second round of lathicharge. It was not before 7pm that the road was finally cleared and airport-bound traffic began to flow again.        
	An officer of Baguiati police station said 40 protesters had been rounded up.        
	Police superintendent Rahul Srivastava said: We are probing how the accident occurred and also the fallout.        
	Several airport-bound passengers, wary of missing their flights, walked to the airport, luggage in tow. Park Street resident Pradipta Agarwal, who had booked a ticket on an evening flight to Delhi, said: I was stuck in a taxi for around one-and-a-half hours. To catch the flight, I have to walk.         
	Six passengers missed the Jet Airways flight to Mumbai.        
	Some passengers missed Air Indias Bangalore flight and were accommodated on the Chennai flight.        
	IndiGo airlines flights to Nagpur, Guwahati, Mumbai and Delhi, too, were delayed. We had to keep the check-in counters open till the last moment to allow passengers to get boarding passes, said an Air India spokesperson.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stop, seconds before crash
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stop, seconds before crash
          OUR BUREAU                                          
	A local train overshot a red signal and came within 100 metres of an express charging down the same track about 17km from Howrah.        
	Daylight possibly saved hundreds of passengers at Sankrail around 3.20pm on Wednesday and spared railway minister Mamata Banerjee another embarrassment on home turf. The drivers of both the Panskura local and the Howrah-bound East Coast Express slammed the emergency brakes to avert disaster.        
	The express was travelling at 30km an hour and the local a little slower because it had to stop at Sankrail station, 300 metres away. They were a few seconds from each other when they screeched to a halt, a senior railway official said.        
	Without the emergency brakes, the local would have crashed into the belly of the express, scheduled to change tracks a few metres ahead.        
	Prakash Ray, a Bhagalpur resident travelling from Secunderabad, said the East Coast Express wasnt speeding but it jolted to a stop scaring us out of our wits. On the Panskura local, Sukumar Dalui of Kharagpur banged his head against the wall. Many of us were hurt as the train stopped suddenly, he said.        
	The passengers realised they had been on a collision course when they found the trains face to face. The railways said the two trains were separated by about 150 metres, though witnesses put it at not even 100 metres.        
	The local train driver, who overshot the signal by at least 200 metres, has been suspended. Prima facie, the driver of the Panskura local, R. Khan, had overshot the home signal (the last before a train pulls into a station), said Anil Handa, South Eastern Railways Kharagpur divisional manager.         
	Had Khan not overshot, he would have been waiting at the red signal allowing the East Coast Express to change tracks without a hitch.        
	The express driver, Suryakanta Behra, said: I was travelling at about 30km an hour because I had to change tracks. But then I saw another train on my tracks and slammed the brakes.        
	East Coast passengers protested when the train was being pulled back. Let your officers see how close we were to disaster, said one of them. The drivers were kicked and punched. The stationmasters office was ransacked and signalling equipment damaged. Train services in the Howrah-Kharagpur section were stalled for several hours.         
	A railway official said it appeared to be a case of human error but a systemic fault could also not be ruled out. There may have been an error in the signal.        
	On July 19, the Uttar Banga Express had overshot a signal at night and rammed into the Vananchal Express from behind in Birbhums Sainthia, killing over 60 people.        
	The railway minister has been having a rough ride with increasing accidents and allegations of lack of passenger security. Two Calcutta schoolchildren were allegedly pushed off a train overrun by ticketless travellers last month. On August 6, several compartments of the Sealdah-Delhi Lal Quila Express were looted in Bihar. On August 21, a gang had smashed the glass windows of the New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani in Uttar Pradesh, leaving the passengers shaken.

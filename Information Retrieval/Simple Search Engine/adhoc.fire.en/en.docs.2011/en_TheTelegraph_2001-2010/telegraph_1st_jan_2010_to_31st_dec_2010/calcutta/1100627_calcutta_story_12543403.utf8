	Ones taste in music is often a dead giveaway of ones age. One need not go far to discover that this is a self-evident truth. Listening to any request programme on the radio will prove me right, but radios have exited from our existence, so checking the exchanges on Facebook is a safer bet. On any given day most of the songs uploaded by middle-aged and older friends are either Bollywood hits from the 1950s to 1970s (golden age) or international pop/standards of the same era.         
	Even younger friends in their 30s, I have noticed, prefer to upload songs mostly of this period. Of course, nostalgia alone is not responsible for the choice, for the superlative quality of the singing, lyrics and accompaniments is undeniable. There is nothing synthetic about them either, for they were mostly recorded long before synthesisers substituted actual musical instruments, and sound engineers created products for the market, which may be several times removed from the real thing.         
	As many connoisseurs will agree, listening to a tune played on the synthesiser is the same as using digital technology to take photographs. However sophisticated digital cameras may be, digital prints never have the same depth of focus as silver gelatin prints taken with analogue cameras. I am aware of the controversies raging over these issues and without putting my foot in my mouth I shall limit myself to saying that old prints like old recordings have an inexplicable charm of their own, and it is a lot more than simple nostalgia.        
	Recently I had the privilege of hearing an old melody that has haunted me for years. In a way it sounded sweeter to my ears now than it did when I first heard the songs of Geeta Das droning out of the sound box of the hand-cranked gramophone. Although the 78 rpm disc is intact I had not been able to play it for years because the stylus is not available any longer.        
	But cutting-edge technology and the enthusiasm of Kamal Ghosh of Megaphone, who is 81, has made it possible for this very potent and once-popular song to be heard again. The graininess of the original was missing from the digitised version. The songs are Chhilo chand megher pare on one side, with Tumi je andhar on the other, both sung by Geetasri (a title conferred on artistes) Kumari Geeta Das, who in spite of her sonorous and deep voice had not recorded more than these two songs, both big hits of the 1940s. I have the disc, whose grooves must be encrusted with dust and grime, before me and going by the label it was produced by Senola, a Bengali music company out of business for ages.                  
	On the label is a peacock with its fantail displayed in all its iridescent glory, and the text says the music was composed by Sur-Sagar, Himangshu Datta by another name, and the lyrics were by Ajay Bhattacharya. The label mentions the raga in which the songs were composed. The first was Pushpachandrika, created by Himangshu Datta himself, and the second was Mishra Iman. As in many of this elegant and poetic music composers songs, the wistful tune is in keeping with the lyric that is all about the tragic consequences of the unrequited love between a Chameli flower and the distant moon. However corny this may sound in translation, its fragile beauty can never be appreciated unless one has heard Geeta Das sing it. Others have re-recorded this famous song in more recent times but Geeta Dass no-nonsense style is matchless.        
	But no one, not even Kamalbabu, had any clue about the singers identity. Veteran music critic Maitreyee Chatterjee asked me to get in touch with her colleague Swapan Shome, who directed me to Madhusree Datta. Her mother, Mala Das, also a singer, was Geetas sister. She put me in touch with Krishna Bose, who had a lot to say about her mother who died as late as 2002 at the ripe old age of 84. Geeta and Mala Das were born into the well-known family of Sreenath Das of Bowbazar. Her guru was the maestro Girija Shankar Chakrabarty, and as is clear from her style, thumri and light classical were her forte. In spite of her accomplishments she disappeared from the scene after her marriage. Her song was never heard again. Technology has done the trick.       SOUMITRA DAS

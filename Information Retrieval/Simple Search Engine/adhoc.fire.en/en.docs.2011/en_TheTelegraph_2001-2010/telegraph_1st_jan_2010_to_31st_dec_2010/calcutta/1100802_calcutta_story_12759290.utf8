The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Soggy Sunday shows the week
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Soggy Sunday shows the week
  - Clouds hold at least three more days of nagging rain          A STAFF REPORTER                          Shera, the mascot of the XIX Commonwealth Games, brightens up the grey Calcutta sky on Sunday. (Amit Datta)                                        
	Calcutta woke up to the sound of rain on Sunday and spent the day with it, the pitter-patter and the promise of more finally bringing the monsoon feeling to the city.        
	The first day of August brought with it 24mm of rain, which the Met office said could be the trend for the rest of the month.         
	The rain over the past two days is the result of the combined impact of a low-pressure trough over the city and a cyclonic circulation in south Bengal. It is going to rain at least for the next three days, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The weatherman confirmed that this was the citys first taste of a real monsoon this year. There have been a few low-pressure formations this season but no major cyclonic circulation in the citys vicinity, he said.        
	July was dry for the most part with the occasional sharp shower but no sign of the nagging rain that gets the Calcuttan worried about waterlogging and hungry for khichuri and bhaja.         
	The city received 238.72mm of rain through last month, only about 72 per cent of the average July rain recorded in Calcutta over the past 30 years. Over 40 per cent of it  96.2mm  came down on the last day of July.         
	The deficit in what is usually the wettest month for Calcutta was the worst this decade.        
	The monsoon arrived on June 13, and Calcutta has had more than the usual number of rainy days since, but not enough rain. The story of the skies changed late on Friday, with over 96mm of rain between midnight and Saturday morning, the highest in a day this season.         
	The Queens Baton for the Commonwealth Games arrived to a downpour and travelled from the airport to Victoria Memorial through streets devoid of the flag-waving schoolchildren who would otherwise have lined the pavements.        
	It couldnt be a better stay-at-home Sunday. The sound of the rain and the colour of the sky made sure I had nowhere to go, said Avantika Basu, 23, a management student who lives in Gol Park.        
	 The romance of the rain is best felt on a Sunday, said Dhurjati Mitra, 52, a state government employee from Maniktala.        
	Monday may be different.         
	Several low-lying parts of the city were under knee-deep water on Sunday, but not too many people were complaining. A weekday deluge could be different, though.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tipsy female flier grounded
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tipsy female flier grounded
  - Bar to behind bars          SANJAY MANDAL AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                                                  
	A 30-year-old woman used a 90-minute break between flights to get high in a bar near Calcutta airport on Monday, only to land behind bars after allegedly misbehaving with fellow passengers, airport staff and security personnel.         
	Priyambada Chowdhury had arrived in the city from Agartala on an Air India flight at 2.15pm and was to board a 4.30pm SpiceJet flight to Hyderabad when her spirit of adventure ostensibly got the better of her.        
	By the time she got back to the airport from the bar on VIP Road, Priyambada was having trouble staying on her feet in front of the check-in counter.         
	She fell on some passengers in the queue, inviting a rebuke. Then she went berserk, misbehaving with anyone who tried to reason with her, said an officer.         
	Witnesses said Priyambada, in orange top and white trousers, abused and shoved several passengers. She also misbehaved with the staff of SpiceJet, said a CISF officer.         
	SpiceJet immediately barred Priyambada, who was returning to Hyderabad after attending a wedding in Agartala, from the flight.        
	As she continued pushing and arguing with the airline staff, CISF personnel were called in to calm her down, which seemed to make Priyambada angrier. We had no option but to hand her over to the police, said an airport official.        
	Priyambada, who the police insisted was slurring till late in the evening, said she was from Durgapur, where her widowed mother lives. She stays in Hyderabad, where she is employed with a reputable pharmaceutical company.        
	She told us that she had gone to the bar because she had nothing else to do in between flights, an officer said.        
	Passengers turning up inebriated is not uncommon but Priyambada is probably the first female flier to be arrested at the city airport for drunken behaviour.        
	She is being charged with drunken behaviour and physically obstructing government officials from discharging their duties, said a police officer.        
	Both are bailable offences but Priyambada can apply for bail only on Tuesday.

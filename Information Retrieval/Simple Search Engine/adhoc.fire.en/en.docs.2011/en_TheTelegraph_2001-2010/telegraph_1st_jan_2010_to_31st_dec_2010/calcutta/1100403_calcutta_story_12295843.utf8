          A STAFF REPORTER                          The elephant after it was brought to the zoo                                  
	A six-month-old elephant that was brought to the city from Danton in West Midnapore on February 2 died at Alipore zoo early on Friday. The elephant had got separated from her herd and had to be brought to the zoo after the herd refused to accept her back.        
	The elephant was unwell for the past few days. All efforts were made to save her, but nine out of 10 elephant calves who get separated from the mother do not survive, said zoo director Raju Das. On Thursday, we administered around five bottles of saline to revive her but she died on Friday, he added.        
	According to the director, the calfs immunity was underdeveloped because she was deprived of mothers milk.         
	When the calf was brought to the zoo, it had an injury on one leg. Zoo officials said the herd had damaged crops in Danton and the villagers had taken out their anger on the baby elephant, which had got separated from the herd.         
	In the zoo, the calf was kept in a 30mx25m enclosure with a bed of straw and a tarpaulin sheet. Her diet included 1-1.5 litres of baby food mixed with minerals, vitamins and a digestive every two hours, said her keepers. Four doctors and four attendants looked after her since she was brought to the zoo. But she was small and weighed only 100kg, said Mohammed Sanir, one of the attendants.

	The high court on Friday asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to file an affidavit by March 9 stating the steps it had taken to open malaria clinic-cum-laboratories in all 141 wards in the city. The bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice P.C. Ghosh passed the directive after CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh submitted that his client had scrapped the plan to set up a hospital in Kalighat for malaria patients. Instead of setting up the hospital, the CMC has undertaken a programme to open clinic-cum-laboratories in each ward for malaria patients, Ghosh said.

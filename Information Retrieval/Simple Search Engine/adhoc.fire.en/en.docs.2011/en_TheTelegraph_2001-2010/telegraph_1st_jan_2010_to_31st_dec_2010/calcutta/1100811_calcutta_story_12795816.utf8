The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Upkeep hitch in Metro glitch
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Upkeep hitch in Metro glitch

	Poor maintenance of the vital third rail triggered the twin snags that had stopped Metro rail in its tracks and paralysed peak-hour traffic on the streets above for over four hours on Monday, sources said.        
	Officials said they were still trying to zero in on the exact reason for the third rail shifting towards the track at two places, causing friction with the power supply apparatus of trains passing by. But most admitted in private that the fault lay with maintenance, or the lack of it.        
	Between Kudghat and Tollygunge, the third rail had shifted along a stretch of 100 metres. The misalignment at Esplanade was around 30 metres. It is surprising that both these snags went undetected until motormen pointed them out, said a senior official.        
	The distance between the track and the third rail is 650mm but the misalignment had reduced that gap by several millimetres, triggering sparks when trains entered Esplanade and later snapping the traction current collector of a Dum Dum-bound train near Tollygunge.        
	The traction current collector is an iron plate attached to the train to draw power from the third rail.        
	Maintenance staff had to realign the rail with crowbars. When the traction current collector grates against a loose stretch of the third rail, misalignment occurs. Regular maintenance can avert this, said an engineer.        
	Metro Railway officials came up with the usual litany of problems, mainly shortage of maintenance staff.        
	The authorities are yet to recruit maintenance staff for the third rail along the extended southern section between Tollygunge and Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul). The problem has been compounded by the reduced staff strength in the old section, the official added.         
	Sources said 42 maintenance personnel, divided into two teams, were earlier deployed for the Dum Dum-Tollygunge section. The staff strength has since been reduced to 34 with some employees retiring and many going off the roster because of illness. It has become difficult for the existing staff to shoulder the workload, an official said.        
	The two maintenance units are at Shyambazar and Jatin Das Park stations. A third was planned at Bansdroni (Masterda Surya Sen) but never set up. Surveillance and maintenance of the third rail is usually done at night. But between Tollygunge and Kavi Nazrul, there is hardly any surveillance, said a source.

	Workplace: Park Street         
	Walk or wheels? Walked 45 minutes till Gariahat, from where he hitched a ride on a motorbike.        
	Bandh bite: I could not have taken the day off under any circumstance. The company vice president is in town and he reached office before me. A bandh only aggravates the suffering of the common man.

	Workplace: Alipore        
	Walk or wheels? Cycled from home to post.        
	Bandh bite: I consider it my duty to defy a bandh. Also, its easy cycling through empty and pollution-free roads. When one can reach office, why stay at home?

	Home: Alipore         
	Workplace: Jawaharlal Nehru Road

	Workplace: His furniture manufacturing and interior design shop on Park Street, one of the few open on Monday        
	Walk or wheels?Drove to his shop.        
	Bandh bite: I thought of completing some pending work on bandh day. If some customers come in, it would be a bonus. I think a bandh doesnt serve any purpose.

	Bandh bite: I took so much trouble to reach office but the union members didnt let me and three colleagues in. It was frustrating; bandhs are useless.

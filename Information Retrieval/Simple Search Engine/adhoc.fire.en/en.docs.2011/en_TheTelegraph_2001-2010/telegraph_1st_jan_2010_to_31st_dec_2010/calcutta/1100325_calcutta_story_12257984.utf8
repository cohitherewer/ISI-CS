The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fear next door, relief across road
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Unfamiliar feel to favourite street
  Fear next door, relief across road
          POULOMI BANERJEE                                            quot;He (Leander) was very shocked and worried. He asked whether I wanted to move out of the building for a few days quot;  Jennifer Paes, Leander Paes rsquo;s mother, a resident of block III of   Queens Mansion      
	Stephen Court neighbours had said on Tuesday that they were potential victims too, given the tinderboxes they lived in. Metro explored on Wednesday what that meant.                
	Place: Queens Mansion, adjacent to Stephen Court        
	The scene: Blocks I, III, IV and V are in a state of disrepair. Block II fares better. Sadly, the facelift came about only after a fire broke out last year, say residents.        
	The look: Naked wires and cables formed a thick mesh near the stairs. Open meter boxes and switch boxes made for a scary sight. In some blocks, the walls near the hanging wires and behind meter boxes were damp. Thick cables ran across the crumbling first-floor terrace.        
	Elevators: Not well-maintained. The emergency phone outside one was out of order, as was the firemans switch. The emergency bell inside the elevators work, though only occasionally, residents said.         
	I was trapped inside the lift on Saturday and the caretaker said he couldnt do a thing about it. I was hyperventilating and kept punching the buttons. Every time I pushed the second floor button, the lift inched down a little. I was afraid that it might crash. When it finally reached the second floor, I just got out and ran, said Jennifer Paes, Leander Paess mother, a resident of block III.

	Emergency exits: None. Residents said emergency stairways were removed by the landlords years ago.        
	Firefighting: Some of the blocks have small fire extinguishers, but nobody knows if they work. Also, keeping an extinguisher that small for an entire block is laughable.        
	Voices: There was a fire in our block last September. We just wrapped wet towels around our faces and ran out. After that we didnt have electricity for a month. We had to do up the block at our own cost, said Ahmed, who lives on the fourth floor of block II.         
	I have repeatedly contacted the landlord, but to no avail. There are so many elderly people living in Queens Mansion, sighed Paes. She said Leander had called after hearing about Tuesdays fire. He was very shocked and very worried. He asked whether I wanted to move out of Queens Mansion for a few days.        
	The owner of a showroom in the building voiced a collective fear: Queens Mansion is the next victim, waiting to be burnt down.              
	Place: Park Mansion, diagonally opposite Stephen Court        
	The scene: The wires looked recently installed. Electricity meters were arranged in neat rows, within boxes.        
	Elevators: Under repair        
	Emergency exits: Spiral metal stairs in all the blocks, said residents.        
	Firefighting: A fire extinguisher and sand buckets in most blocks        
	Voices: The condition of this building used to be really bad. The wiring was old, naked cable and wires used to dangle almost everywhere. Parts of the balcony crumbled and fell. There was a fire in 1998, said a resident.         
	She added that the condition had improved in the past one year. The wiring was redone. We were also asked to use concealed wiring inside the flats. Now the elevators are being repaired.         
	Restaurateur Nitin Kothari, a resident of Park Mansion, said: The wiring has been recently re-done and the old elevators are being replaced, thanks to the Pauls (of the Apeejay Surrendra Group, as landlords).

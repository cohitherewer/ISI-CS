The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Transporters stick to   strike threat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Transporters stick to   strike threat
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Transporters are unhappy with the increased diesel subsidy of Rs 2 per litre and have threatened to go on strike if the state government refused to grant more sops.        
	At a meeting in transport minister Ranjit Kundus office at Writers Buildings on Wednesday, the transport operators demanded either a subsidy of Rs 4.90 for every litre of diesel they consumed or a fare hike. The minister, however, refused to relent.        
	The operators claimed that the price of diesel had gone up by Rs 4.90 per litre since the last fare hike in July 2008. Following the last round of fuel price hike, the price of diesel in the city has increased by Rs 1.95 to Rs 39.94 a litre.        
	The meeting (in Kundus room) was pointless. The government is unwilling to negotiate. What it is offering is unacceptable to us, Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, said as he stormed out of the meeting.        
	We will launch an agitation if the government refuses to meet our demands within 72 hours. A strike cant be ruled out, added Das.        
	Taxi operators will wait till August 31 for the government to spell out its stand before deciding their course of action.        
	The state government had on Monday doubled the subsidy on diesel for buses, minibuses and taxis to Rs 2 per litre. The operators will have to submit their fuel bills to the government and at the end of each month, Rs 2 for every litre of diesel they had bought would be deposited in their accounts.        
	We have gone out of our way to lessen the burden on the transporters. The state government has agreed to forgo Rs 200 crore to shell out the subsidy. What more can we do? asked Kundu.        
	Countering the ministers assertion, Tarak Nath Bari of the Calcutta Taxi Association said: A subsidy of Rs 2 per litre means little to us. The subsidy should be increased to Rs 4.90 per litre. If the government cannot afford it, it should allow a fare hike.        
	Fatal mishaps        
	Two men died in separate accidents in the city since Tuesday night.        
	Rabindranath Bolar, 61, was run over by a bus at the BT Road-Dum Dum Road crossing around 11.20pm on Tuesday. Cops took the Dum Dum resident to RG Kar hospital where he was declared dead.        
	Neelmadhab Debnath, 52, was mowed down by a vehicle near the Ultadanga crossing on Wednesday morning. Debnath was taken to RG Kar hospital where he was declared dead. Robin Singh, 70, was seriously injured after he fell off a private bus at Harish Mukherjee Road-Hazra Road crossing on Wednesday morning.

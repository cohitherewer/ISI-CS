                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Tryst with Truffaut, date with Antonioni
  - CELLULOID SURPRISE FOR STUDENTS ON CU COLLEGE STREET CAMPUS          SEBANTI SARKAR                          Denzel Washington in Spike Lee rsquo;s Malcolm X, one of the films screened at the CU film festival                        
	For students of Calcutta Universitys (CU) College Street campus, Freeze Frame, the film festival organised by the media studies department from January 12 to 15, in association with American Center and Cine Central, was a refreshing change from morning lectures.         
	Many students got their first glimpse of masters like Truffaut, Antonioni, Solanas, Makhmalbaf at Ritwik Hall, where the screenings were held. Young people need to be exposed to different kinds of films. With students films, there is always the possibility of finding something experimental and avant-garde. For, at this stage of their lives, the film-makers are not burdened by other material considerations, said Sinjini Bandyopadhyay, head of the English department and the coordinator of the festival.        
	Inaugurated by CU registrar Basab Choudhury, the festival also included an exhibition of film stamps from across the world. Part of philatelist Dipak Des collection, the stamps commemorated films like Vittorio De Sicas The Bicycle Thief, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, as well as film personalities from Satyajit Ray to Kajol (a stamp from Republic of New Guinea).

Starting from April, it will train youngsters from five to 17 years of age and will be open to students from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan too.

	Each day of the festival was dedicated to a particular theme, with interactive sessions to go with each days programme.         
	While A Tribute to Classics saw Antonionis Zabriskie Point and Truffauts Day for Night being screened, Reviewing Contemporary Cinema included Kim Ki-Duks 3-Iron and Makhmalbafs Once Upon A Time, Cinema. A Date with Hollywood included Spike Lees Malcolm X and Billy Wilders The Front Page.        
	The students film competition included 25 shortlisted entries, from film studies departments of institutions like Jadavpur University (JU), CU, Rabindra Bharati University and Loreto College. Many had financed their own films, shot using personal video cameras with friends and relatives as actors.        
	The worst were laughable but one was often pleasantly surprised by the perspectives offered and the use of different techniques, especially considering the constraints students face. At such festivals, students get to interact with peers and general viewers and learn how to better themselves, said Pallab Mitra, a young professional editor who had come to cheer friends.        
	The isolation, bewilderment and insecurity of everyday living were common themes in many films. They offered glimpses of many lives, including a rat-killing Granny, a childless woman, sex workers and endangered tribal cultures. A selection of students films from foreign universities was also screened.         
	Abhishek Chakravarty of JU topped the students film contest, while Sajid Ali and Indra Mohan of hotel management institute NSHM came second and Subhodip Roy of Roopkala Kendra came third.

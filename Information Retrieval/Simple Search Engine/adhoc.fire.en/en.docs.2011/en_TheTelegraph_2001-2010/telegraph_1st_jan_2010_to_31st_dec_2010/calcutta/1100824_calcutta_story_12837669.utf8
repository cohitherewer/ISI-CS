The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HS rethink to remove laxity in Class XI
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HS rethink to remove laxity in Class XI
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Class XI is robbing Higher Secondary students of their competitiveness in Class XII, a review of this years exam results has revealed.        
	Since the syllabus was bifurcated in 2007, many students have been aiming to get promoted to Class XII with the minimum aggregate of 30 per cent in the annual test knowing that it wont count in the Higher Secondary exam. What they dont realise is that taking it easy for a year can become a habit, said a veteran teacher who participated in the exercise.        
	The trigger for this exhaustive review of the Higher Secondary education and evaluation system was a marginal drop in the pass percentage for the first time in five years.        
	Based on the findings, the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education has decided to introduce a string of steps to stem the slide  from extra internal exams and stricter monitoring of attendance to changes in the syllabus and the grading system.        
	 There is a need to restructure the Higher Secondary education and examination system to ensure that students perform better. The process has already begun, Onkarsadhan Adhikari, the president of the council, told Metro.        
	The council is set to convene a meeting with various teachers organisations before Puja to finalise a timeline for the implementation of the proposed steps.        
	A series of meetings between council officials and Higher Secondary teachers from across Bengal were held since the results were declared in June to trace the factors responsible for the 1.3 per cent drop in the success rate.         
	Sources said most teachers felt that the decision to hold the Higher Secondary exam on the basis of only the Class XII syllabus had affected both academic performance and attitude.        
	The rule book states that every student must have 75 per cent attendance. But low attendance has become the norm in many schools. The authorities are forced to allow these students to sit for the board exams under pressure from guardians, local organisations and even political parties, said a senior official of the state council.        
	Apart from stricter attendance rules, the council has proposed more internal exams  particularly in Class XI  to keep students on their toes.         
	The council has also decided to alter its five-point grading system. Explaining the logic behind the move, an official said that only 5.01 per cent of the examinees were placed in the highest A+ grade (80 100) this year.        
	We need to drastically raise the percentage of high scorers to be on a par with the central boards and ensure that our students are not sidelined in the college admission race, he added.        
	The syllabus is also being revamped on the lines of the ISC and CBSE curricula.

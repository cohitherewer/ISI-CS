The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flyover stuck in city logjam
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Flyover stuck in city logjam
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                                
	The road meant to fly over the most dreaded bottleneck on the way to the airport from the city will miss its deadline by at least a year for reasons familiar to Calcutta, from faulty planning to absence of co-ordination among the various agencies.        
	The 1,300m four-lane flyover, connecting EM Bypass with VIP Road and giving Ultadanga the slip, will not open before March 2011, said engineers working for over two years now.        
	When work on the project, being implemented jointly by the state and the Centre under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) started in 2008, it was supposed to end in March 2010. The deadline was first pushed to June 2010 and then to Puja 2010 and March 2011.        
	There is still a lot of work to be done. The beams and concrete slabs on the stretch over VIP Road are yet to be put up. The road that the vehicles will take after descending on VIP Road needs to be laid. In the present situation, they will hit the divider separating VIP and its service road, said an official of Martin Burn Ltd, the state government agency contracted for the construction.                
	The executing agency for the project, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, claimed that 90 per cent of the flyover was complete. But for the ordinary commuter, who takes at least 20 minutes to cover less than a kilometre from the Bypass to VIP Road during rush hour, anything less than 100 per cent is of little use.         
	When Metro visited the site two days after Puja, there were only a handful of workers. A lone official was sitting at the makeshift Mackintosh Burn office below the flyover. That official said there is still a lot of work to be done. Several small things like putting the horizontal beams below the flyover for support and completing the fencing are also to be done, he added.         
	The Centre has withheld the last tranche from its share for the Rs 68-crore project because of the delay.        
	The urban development department had approved the flyover in August 2006. It was supposed to be operational by March 2010. Since that has not happened, the last instalment of Rs 3.32 crore has been held back. It would be released when there are signs of completion of the project, said Union minister of state for urban development Sougata Roy, a Trinamul Congress MP.        
	The official at the construction site blamed the delay on lack of planning by the CMDA. Proper planning and co-ordination with the traffic police could have smoothened the process of construction over the Bypass and VIP Road. They were missing. Many a times our scheduled work had to be put off because of heavy traffic on VIP Road, said the official.         
	The story would be the same for most infrastructure projects in the city: red tape, pilferage, corruption by contractors, allegations abound.         
	The contractors engaged for the Bypass-VIP job were hopeful of a March 2011 completion not because work had picked up pace but because the elections were due in summer.        
	Till then, commuters will have to keep cursing the endless clog at Ultadanga and residents will have to bear with life amid the rubble that has made even walking difficult on certain stretches.         
	The spillover effect of the Ultadanga chaos directly affects the Hudco-Bypass crossing and snarls snake deep into Salt Lake past PNB during the peak hour.         
	For people living in Salt Lake and places like Sreebhumi, Lake Town, Bangur, Baguiati and Kestopur, the wait has been endless.        
	The flyover could have been a lifeline for us. But for the past three years we have only been seeing pillars and beams, complained Tarun Chatterjee, a Salt Lake resident who gets stuck at the Hudco crossing every day.         
	I was once stuck on the slip road for almost 30 minutes on the way from the airport because huge beams and concrete were blocking it.

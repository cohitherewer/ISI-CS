                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bridge victim body found
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A body found floating in the Hooghly near the Belur Math ghat was identified on Sunday as that of 20-year-old Saurav Dhar, who was beaten up and thrown into the river from Bally bridge on Thursday.        
	An uncle of Saurav identified the body, which was spotted on Saturday morning.        
	Amrikpal Singh, 21, has been arrested on the charge of killing the Belghoria resident.        
	Singh told police that he had been plotting to kill his uncle and had paid Dhar Rs 90,000 to arrange for a revolver. Dhar, however, failed to bring the gun.        
	Last Thursday, when Dhar asked for another Rs 15,000, Singh decided to teach him a lesson.        
	A prolonged interrogation of Singh, whose businessman father died around a year ago, revealed that he had teamed up with some of his friends to kill Dhar, the son of a retired CESC official.        
	Sleuths said they had got the names of four of his accomplices but refused to divulge them for the sake of investigation. A friend of Dhar, Raju Bose, has been detained for questioning.        
	The cops have learnt that Singh had called Dhar on Thursday night to his Dunlop house, where the gang beat him up. The youth was then blindfolded and taken on a motorcycle to Bally bridge, from where he was thrown into the Hooghly.        
	The youths hands were tied before he was thrown into the river. The post-mortem report revealed he was then alive, said an officer of Belghoria police station, where a murder case has been lodged.        
	While investigating a missing complaint lodged by Dhars family, the police found that Singh had called Dhar and sent him text messages several times on Thursday morning and afternoon but not once since the evening.        
	We picked him up as he was a suspect from the very beginning. He admitted to the crime during the interrogation, said the officer.        
	Neighbours in the Prafulla Nagar locality of Belgoria said Dhar had been in bad company and had links with local criminals.        
	nComplaint: A police complaint has been lodged against two promoters  Kanu Maity and Gopal Banerjee  after the boundary wall of a cold store constructed by them in Salkia, Howrah, collapsed on Saturday.

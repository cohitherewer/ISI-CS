The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | What and why of Presi upgrade
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      What and why of Presi upgrade
          OUR BUREAU                                                                  
	On the first day of Presidency University under a vice-chancellor, confusion reigned among students and teachers about the 193-year-old institutions new avatar. What will happen to the students? Will they cease to belong to Calcutta University (CU)? Will the college teachers become university teachers?         
	There is also confusion about the governments sudden decision to scrap the college principals post and hand over the reins to the VC after asserting that the college head will continue in the post till the transition was complete.        
	A Metro guide to what the upgrade means.              
	Is Presidency now solely a university?        
	Technically yes. The government had issued a gazette notification in July to convert the college to a university. However, a college within the university  the erstwhile Presidency College  is still in operation.        
	Why is the Presidency College set-up in existence even after the upgrade?        
	The second and third-year students of the undergraduate courses of the erstwhile Presidency College, which was affiliated to CU, will remain students of the college and CU will award them degrees when they complete their courses.         
	The second-year students of the postgraduate courses will get their degrees jointly from Presidency College and CU, a system in practice since CU had granted Presidency academic autonomy to run postgraduate courses on its own.        
	What is the status of the first-year students of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses?        
	The first-year undergraduate and postgraduate students are registered with Calcutta University. They will have to be migrate en masse to Presidency University if they are to get their degrees from Presidency University.        
	If they do so, Presidency University will have to conduct BA and BSc Part I and MA and MSc Part I independently for the first time in 2011 itself.        
	Will the first-year students migrate to Presidency University?         
	Whether they do so or not will depend on the new Presidency VC.        
	Now that the institution is an autonomous body, the new university will first have to consider whether they will be able to hold the Part I exams next year, said state higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri.         
	A clearance is also needed from CU to change the students registration.        
	Vice-chancellor Amita Chatterjee said: The proposal to bring the first-year students under Presidency University will be considered.        
	What is the status of the Presidency College teachers, officials and non-teaching employees?        
	According to the Presidency University Act, 2010, all employees of the college will continue to work for the university in their existing capacities till the posts are filled up by the university or the incumbents are posted elsewhere by the government.        
	If Amitava Chatterjee was asked to continue as the acting principal, what problems might have cropped up?         
	The coexistence of two posts of heads  the acting principal and the vice-chancellor  could have led to administrative problems.        
	Now that the acting principals post has been abolished, the VC will act as the sole head of the institution and all the employees will have to obey her orders.        
	On what logic had the government decided to allow Amitava Chatterjee to continue as acting principal?        
	The government probably wanted to ensure that the students of the college did not face problems but the possibility of administrative hitches made it change the stand.    
	Presidency may have become a university but the 136-year-old, three-storey building closest to its main gate still says Presidency College in bold (picture above). 
  Will that name go for good, the first vice-chancellor of the newly anointed university was asked on Monday. ldquo;I have to think about that. There is University College, London, but here it has been named Presidency University, rdquo; said Amita Chatterjee. 
  An alumnus, she admitted that sentiment is attached with the name Presidency College. ldquo;I understand, rdquo; she said with a smile.  
	 ldquo;There is no record of when the name Presidency College was first painted under the giant watch, but it is believed to be as old as the main building, which came up in 1874, rdquo; said Subhas Ranjan Chakraborty, who taught history at the college for 22 years. 
  ldquo;The name could have been Presidency College University. After all, the college has a history of 193 years, rdquo; added Chakraborty, who was a student of Presidency College in the 1960s.  
	Many former students echoed him. ldquo;There have been heated debates in the alumni association room about the renaming of the institution. The majority view is that the name Presidency College should not be wiped off, rdquo; said alumnus Bivas Chaudhuri.

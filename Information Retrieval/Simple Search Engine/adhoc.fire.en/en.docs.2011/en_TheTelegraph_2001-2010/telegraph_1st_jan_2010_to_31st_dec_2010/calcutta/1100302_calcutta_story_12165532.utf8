                      Remembering Archi                    The youth of the present are a bewildered, confused lot. A dark, unfathomable and vast abyss lies between their needs and desires and their ability to communicate or justify them. Perhaps this is why they are victims of uncertainties and mental conflicts. Often leading lonely, insular lives, they can neither accept lifes hardships and failures nor find the resilience to fight back. All these reasons were in some way responsible for the death of 22-year-old Archi Paul, who took her own life in a moment of emotional weakness and vulnerability a year ago. Archi, the ongoing group exhibition of sculpture, is being hosted in her memory, and through it attempts to understand and better empathise with troubled young minds. Featuring works by veteran and young artists, the show highlights emotional and psychological deficiencies from which contemporary youth suffer. Themes like loneliness, unrequited love, selfishness, insecurity and loss of innocence resonate through the show like alarm bells sounding a warning to people inhabiting a callous, apathetic society. Participants: Shankar Ghosh, Tapas Sarkar, Sudarshan Pal, Kinkar Saha, Subrata Paul, Sunil Das, Ashit Paul, Samir Aich, Sanatan Dinda and others.

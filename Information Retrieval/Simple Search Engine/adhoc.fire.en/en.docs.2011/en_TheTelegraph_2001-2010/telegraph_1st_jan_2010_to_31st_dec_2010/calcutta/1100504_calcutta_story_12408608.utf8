The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Legal eagle chants for change
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Legal eagle chants for change

	Mohammadi Tarannum has a problem. The CPM candidate from ward 66 cannot explain her USP to the majority of her electorate. The party bosses are billing the 34-year-old  a PhD in law  as the most academically qualified candidate among those contesting the civic polls but her credentials alone are unlikely to win her the election on May 30.         
	This is one of the most backward areas in the city with very high illiteracy rate. There is no point telling residents what I bring to the table as a candidate. Their concerns are different, says the teacher-in-charge of Surendranath Law College.         
	According to data available to the public, the literacy rate in the ward is slightly more than 56 per cent, well below the Calcutta average of 73 per cent-plus.         
	Not just illiteracy, only a few hundred homes in the ward of 58,000 voters get the Calcutta Municipal Corporation water supply at home. Most households bank on the civic bodys water tanks that make a round of the area daily.         
	The social infrastructure is also very poor. There arent enough doctors, there arent proper schools, says Tarannum, a former student of Lady Brabourne College who graduated from Hazra Law College.         
	She blames outgoing councillor Javed Ahmed Khan for the state of affairs.        
	Despite holding the councillors post for the past 15 years, he has not done anything to address key problems affecting the common people, says Tarannum.        
	Unlike her opponent, Rafat Javed, she was into politics as a student. But this a different ball game. In fact, it is the beginning of a new chapter in my political career.         
	She is aware that the fight ahead is tough and is slogging on the campaign trail to win over voters. Her day starts at 6am and within an hour she is on the road, meeting voters. She heads for college after a couple of hours. The real campaign starts after she returns around 4pm and continues till 9pm.         
	I meet people and listen to their problems. They are disillusioned with the current councillor and want change. I promise them that I would meet their expectations if they vote for me and I have received a positive response, she says, adding that poribortoner hawa (winds of change) is blowing in her ward.        
	Asked how she beats the heat, the mother of a three-year-old boy smiles: I only carry two litres of glucose and mineral water. My opponent is also feeling the heat of non-performance and water is the main reason.        
	Providing meetha paani (clean drinking water) to residents is the first thing on my agenda. This was Javed Ahmed Khans slogan when he became councillor 15 years ago. I have taken over his slogan as he has failed to fulfil his promise, she says.        
	According to her, roads in her ward are in a very bad shape and remain inundated during monsoon. Lack of schools and healthcare are the other major problems.

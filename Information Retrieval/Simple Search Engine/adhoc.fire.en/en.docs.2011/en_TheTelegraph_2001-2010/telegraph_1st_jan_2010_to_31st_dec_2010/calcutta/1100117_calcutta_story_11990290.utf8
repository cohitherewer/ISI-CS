The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Holy whip lash
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Holy whip lash

	Those who went to hear a metaphysical discourse from the Dalai Lama last Sunday were treated to dollops of humour as a bonus. In between addressing queries from the audience on reincarnation and reforms in China, the spiritual leader had a nine-year-old walk up to the stage and ask: What is the meaning of happiness? The septuagenarian leaned forward, inspected the little questioner over the rim of his glasses, and replied with a glint in his eyes: At your age, happiness is holiday.         
	He recalled an anecdote from his days as a young boy. He and his brother shared a tutor, but he had already been identified as the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. Dalai Lama is holy. So the tutor had two whips  for me, the holy whip; for him, the unholy whip. But let me tell you there was nothing holy about the whips lashes, he grinned, as the audience broke into laughter.        
	Again, in response to a query on his diet, he remembered the time he had jaundice. My eyes became yellow, nails became yellow. Then was the only time I truly became the Living Buddha.

	An eminent disciple of the Dalai Lama had visited the city just a few days before His Holiness. Samdhong Rinpoche attended a meeting of all religions organised by the SREI Foundation. The five-day symposium was held to find an answer to rising intolerance and materialism.        
	Rinpoche, the Prime Minister of the Tibetan government in exile, remembered a time when he came to the city often. In the 1970s and 80s, when I was living in Benaras, I used to come regularly to Calcutta. It has changed in the past 10-12 years. It has grown, but growth does not necessarily mean development, said Rinpoche. Tibetans have great respect for Bengal, because some of the earliest Buddhist missionaries in Tibet were from Bengal, he said.         
	The world is passing through a crisis. Violence has become so rampant because some people profit from it, said Rinpoche.         
	The Tibetan leader in exile advised the gathering to read Gandhis 1909 piece Hind Swaraj, where he said Gandhi had discussed the problems that the world is facing today.         
	We need different religions because people are different. Religious intolerance as a term is contradictory, he said.         
	The meet was attended by the representatives of various religious traditions as well as physicist and author Mani Bhaumik, yoga guru Bikram Choudhury and former Union minister Arun Shourie.         
	Addictive adda        
	Perhaps Charulata would have loved it. Amal too, reading aloud his creations to a captive audience, loving the sound of his voice. The actors behind these characters certainly do. Soumitra Chatterjee, who played Amal, and Madhabi Mukhopadhyay, who played Charulata in Rays film of the same name, stepped into the Coffee House on December 10 and said they adored the place. They were part of an event to celebrate 50 years of the Coffee House being run by the Indian Coffee Workers Co-operative Society.        
	Chatterjee recounted his association with the adda haunt since 1949: Coffee House-e coffee-r chaite addar nesha ta beshi (The adda in Coffee House is more addictive than the coffee), he said.         
	Theatreperson Rudraprasad Sengupta, elocutionists Jagannath Basu and Urmimala Basu, CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta, playwright and actor Manoj Mitra and director Ashok Vishwanathan were also present. Five senior members of the workers society were felicitated.

                      Hope for life amidst its ruins        Full of zeal, passion and enthusiasm in their hearts, the young participants of Tarang, the ongoing group show, seek to capture the essence of life in the contemporary world and, in the process, discover and assess their own selves. These artists of Santiniketan Practicing Artists Network (Span) approach their art with a self-determined purpose of finding hidden meaning from the chaotic and turbulent mesh of modern life. Yet, each artist creates a visual language of his very own, in an attempt to establish his distinctive artistic persona. While a resigned melancholy pervades the work of Rajendra Kumar Pradhan, Pradip Kumar Patra reacts angrily to universal human problems. Sekhar Baran Karmakar explores the beauty concealed in the depths of a painful existence. Other participants include Apu Dasgupta, Mahmud Hussain, Sabir Ali, Naba Kumar Maji, Sajal Kaity, Mrinmoy Debbarma and Bimalananda Roy.

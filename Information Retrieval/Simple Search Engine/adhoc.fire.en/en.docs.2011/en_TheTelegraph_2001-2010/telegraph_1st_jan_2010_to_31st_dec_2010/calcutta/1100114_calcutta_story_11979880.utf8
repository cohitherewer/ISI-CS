The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bandh in protest cradle
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bandh in protest cradle
  - Lalu hails Bengal as rail roko pioneer on shutdown day          OUR BUREAU                                                      Rail roko at Baghajatin   station on Wednesday.   (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)        
	On a day when a CPM bandh crippled rail and road, a former railway minister and Bihar chief minister rubbed it in. Rail roko ke baare mein to Bharat ko Bengal hi sikhaya hai (Bengal taught India about rail disruptions), said Lalu Prasad, soon after paying a visit to the ailing Jyoti Basu.        
	Lalus comment would make Team Bengal squirm but it could also prompt George Fernandes (health permitting) to announce a rail roko to protect his claim to fame in Indias protest politics  launching the 1974 railwaymens strike, supported by Left trade unions, that stopped trains in their tracks for two days.        
	That was the first major rail blockade in independent India, though small blockades were reported during the late-1960s in Bengal, said a senior railway official.        
	Far removed from the quibble over the parentage of rail roko, the Mondal family of Diamond Harbour could only pray that Wednesdays blockade was lifted before an ailing relative breathed her last. We received word this morning that my grandmother in Sonarpur is critically ill. For the past four hours we have been trying to make our way there (45 minutes on a normal day) without success, cried Bapi, 14, while his parents tried desperately to hail a van rickshaw.        
	A total of 105 EMU trains on the Sealdah South section of Canning, Lakshmikantapur, Diamond Harbour and Budge Budge were cancelled because of the bandh.        
	Things were no better for those trying to make their way by road to hospitals, schools or offices on Thursday morning from the bandh-hit pockets of South 24-Parganas. Cardiac patient Subhasis Mitra, 45, and his wife Ranjana were waiting in vain for over an hour at Mukundapur on the Bypass to get back home to Basirhat, after a vital check-up at RTIICS.        
	Tanuma Patra, a Class XII student of Army Public School, Ballygunge, had to walk home to Garia station from Ruby. If she was left wondering who would benefit from Wednesdays bandh, she was at least luckier than Mou Basu, a student of Class VIII. Her father Tapan Basu was taking her to school on his scooter around 8.45am when they were stopped and heckled by lathi-wielding bandh supporters near Gangulybagan.        
	There were similar stop-and-scare moments for those trying to brave the bandh at Garia, Baishnabghata, Baghajatin, Santoshpur and even Behala, though that was meant to be exempt from the bandh.

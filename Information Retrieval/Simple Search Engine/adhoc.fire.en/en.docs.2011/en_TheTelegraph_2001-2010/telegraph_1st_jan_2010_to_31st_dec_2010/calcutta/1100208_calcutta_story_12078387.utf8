The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops spy killers of Vedic accused
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops spy killers of Vedic accused
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Kelobabu                          
	Police claim to have identified the killers of Mohammed Abdul Hai, alias Kelobabu, who was shot near his home in Haroa, North 24-Parganas, on Saturday evening.        
	Saifuddin, who was with the victim when he was killed, identified one of the shooters as Kader Mollah, a former aide of Kelobabu. There were two others who we dont want to name right now, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Saifuddin suffered bullet wounds and has been admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.        
	A preliminary probe has revealed that the murder was the fallout of an inter-gang rivalry but sleuths have not ruled out the possibility of a Vedic Village link to the crime.        
	Kelobabu  once a close aide of Gaffar Mollah, the main accused in the Vedic Village arson case  was arrested on August 27 last year for his alleged role in shooting a villager during a football match in Rajarhat and the subsequent arson at the luxury resort on August 23.        
	The 38-year-old, the first among the Vedic accused to have been picked up, was released on bail on December 8 as the cops failed to prove that he was present during the firing and the arson.        
	The police have spoken to Rupa Bibi, Kelobabus wife, and a few others. He used to tell me after his release that his life was in danger He said he knew that some of his former aides were trying to kill him, Rupa told Metro on Sunday.        
	The sleuths are still not clear about the motive behind the fatal attack on Kelobabu, whose name figured in over a dozen cases of murder and extortion lodged with several police stations in the Rajarhat area.        
	We have learnt that he and his gang members had a fight with another gang in the area last week. The killing can be fallout of that. We are also probing other angles, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	A section of sleuths fears that Kelobabus death might dilute the case against Gaffar but Srivastava ruled out the possibility.        
	The public prosecutor at the high court has told me that the case against Gaffar Mollah is strong even without Kelobabu, the district police chief said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Abducted boy on recovery path
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Abducted boy on recovery path
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Aman Gupta with his mother in their Howrah home. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Howrah boy Aman Gupta is recovering from the trauma that had triggered aggressive behaviour and other abnormalities after his return from captivity.        
	Doctors treating the three-year-old at a Dobson Road nursing home said Aman was making satisfactory progress and could be released within a couple of days. The reports of the tests he went through are all normal.        
	Nursing home director Bijay Kejriwal, a paediatrician, said: The boy has been behaving normally since the morning and can now recognise his parents. I allowed his mother to walk him in the corridor for 20 minutes.        
	Amans mother Anju said she found nothing unusual in the boys behaviour in the morning. He seems to be regaining his cheerful mood. I am waiting to take him home.        
	The abductors released Aman in Bihars Bakhtiyarpur on Friday night and he was brought home the next morning.        
	Hours later, the boy started tearing at his hair. He bit his mother and could not recognise his parents.         
	The boy started having convulsions around 10pm, prompting the parents to take him to Belur State General Hospital. Doctors suspected he was suffering from epilepsy and advised the parents to shift him to a hospital better prepared to tackle such cases.         
	The family members then took the boy to the Dobson Road nursing home where doctors said the boys abnormal behaviour was the manifestation of the trauma he had suffered during his week-long captivity.        
	Key accused Rakesh Singh, once a colleague of Amans father Pappu, is yet to be arrested. An officer of Bally police station said: As of now, we are in the dark about the motive of the abduction. We know Rakesh is the mastermind but the entire plot will be clear only after he and his aides are arrested.

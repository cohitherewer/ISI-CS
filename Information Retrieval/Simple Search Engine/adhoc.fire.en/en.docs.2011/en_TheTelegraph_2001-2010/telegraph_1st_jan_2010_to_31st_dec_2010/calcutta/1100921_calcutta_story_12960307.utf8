The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro back on time track 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro back on time track 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	Metro Railway has turned the clock back.        
	For the first time in many months, the citys transport lifeline has run like clockwork over an entire fortnight, thanks to a series of operational changes intended to restore its reputation.        
	The changes took effect on September 6 and hardly any train has been delayed since, a senior official said on Monday.        
	The Metro Railway think tank had held several meetings at the start of the month to sort out operational problems that had not only triggered frequent breakdowns but also slowed down the citys fastest mass transit system.        
	One of the changes that has made a big difference is increasing the running time from one end of the route to the other from 40 to 43 minutes, and adjusting the train schedules accordingly.         
	Metro had reported how the mismatch between the official running time and the actual time taken to cover that distance was throwing schedules haywire.        
	The technical team has also reduced the turnaround time for trains at New Garia station, the last stop on the southern extension where empty rakes go to change tracks.        
	The re-commissioning of a refurbished rake that was out of service for a long time has apparently added to the on-time performance.        
	Sources said maintenance, one of Metro Railways weak links, had also improved over the past three weeks along with co-ordination among various departments.        
	The citys transport lifeline had suffered more breakdowns than at any other time in its 26-year history since the inauguration of the extended section between Tollygunge and Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul) last year.        
	According to motormen, part of the blame lay with the running time being rescheduled to 40 minutes to cover the extra distance without the addition of modern rakes to the ageing fleet.         
	Now that things are back on track, will Metro remain punctual?        
	A senior official warned that relief could be temporary if infrastructure wasnt upgraded soon. Once the final leg of the route till New Garia is opened to passengers, the existing infrastructure wont be able to handle the additional passenger load, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Paper mix-up triggers JEE jitters   Power blip adds to   JEE woes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Paper mix-up triggers JEE jitters     - Wrong trunk brought from police station strongroom to Howrah centre          OUR BUREAU                          JEE examinees sweat it out at the Bidhannagar Municipal School centre on Sunday without fans and lights. Amit Datta                                        
	A trunk containing question papers of the wrong exam was brought to a JEE centre in Howrah on Sunday, leaving 235 engineering aspirants biting their nails for an extra half-an-hour till the correct paper arrived.        
	The delayed start to JEE 2010 at Gramya Hitakari Girls School, near Andul Road, was apparently caused by a careless mistake for which neither the examination authorities nor police would accept responsibility.        
	The trunk containing the question papers was kept at Domjur police station and brought to the exam centre under police escort. How were we to know that they would give us the trunk containing papers of Calcutta Universitys undergraduate exams (slated for Tuesday) instead of the one where the JEE papers were kept? demanded Ruma Pal, the headmistress of Gramya Hitakari Girls School.        
	The authorities didnt realise that the wrong trunk had been brought to the centre even after the key wouldnt match with the lock. They broke the lock in the presence of the JEE observer, only to find sealed packets with the Calcutta University stamp. The papers in the trunk turned out to be that of the BA, BSc and BCom exams, said an official.        
	Observer Anirban Basu accused officers of Domjur police station of being callous and irresponsible. They blamed us for the mix-up instead of admitting that they had given us the wrong trunk. The exam began at 10am, instead of 9.30am, he said.        
	Headmistress Pal, who had gone to Domjur police station with a clerk around 9am to ask for the sealed question papers to be escorted from the strongroom to the centre, didnt notice that the trunk was not labelled.                                
	This is the first time our school has been designated a JEE centre. We had no idea that such a mix-up could occur, she said.        
	The confusion left most of the examinees rattled. Rituraj Banerjee, a student of Eicher School in Gurgaon, said he became so tense that his mind went blank for almost 30 minutes. Fortunately, I calmed down and the test went off well for me, he added.        
	As the exam finally got underway, a team of three assistant controllers of examinations from Calcutta University arrived to check whether the seals of the packets in the first trunk were tampered with.        
	As of now, there is no evidence of a paper leak. We will lodge a complaint against the police after a meeting on Monday, an official said.        
	The officer-in-charge of Domjur police station was unavailable for comment.        
	If a paper mix-up plagued JEE in Howrah, a feeder glitch forced 480-odd examinees in the Bidhannagar Municipal School centre to write the first test without electricity. It was terribly hot inside and the light was inadequate. We had a hard time concentrating, said Aditya Ghosh, an examinee.        
	A few students complained about not being able to finish the paper. Power was restored to the Salt Lake campus only at 1pm.        
	At Mrinalini College in Barrackpore, JEE observers nailed a proxy examinee appearing for a candidate from Bihar, Bikash Singh, while matching his photograph with that on the admit card.

                      Flower power                    Flowers have a special appeal to all of us. We love to look at pretty flowers blooming all around us, and this is specially true during winter and spring, when nearly all the finest varieties of fragrant flowers bloom at their biggest and brightest. Flowers create an atmosphere of happiness and cheer, wherever they are. They also add a formal and elegant touch to any environment. From corporate boardrooms to bedrooms, flowers help to create a lasting impression. Plus, they are also beneficial to the environment, cleansing the air and fighting climate change. Flowers also symbolise love, friendship, peace and innocence, ideas and virtues that must be encouraged in the modern age of dissent, animosity and violence. To highlight the concept of flower power, The Agri-Horticultural Society of India presents Winter Flower Show 2010, to be inaugurated by Commodore C S Ajad (Naval Officer-in-Charge, West Bengal) today at 3 pm. This years flower show will feature various types of special winter flowers, showcasing the possibilities of beautifying interiors and exteriors with flowers that also help reduce pollution to the environment.

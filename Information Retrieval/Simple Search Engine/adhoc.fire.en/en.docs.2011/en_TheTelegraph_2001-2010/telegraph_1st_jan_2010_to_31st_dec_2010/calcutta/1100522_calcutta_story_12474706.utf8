          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The results of Madhyamik examination would be declared on May 26, the board announced on Friday after receiving the green signal from the state government.        
	Metro reported on Friday how the results of the examination were ready but could not be published because the government had not given the mandatory go-ahead. Sources in the board had suggested that the government was wary of poor results affecting the ruling coalitions prospects in the upcoming civic polls.        
	The results would be declared at 9am and made available on the Net and through SMS from 11am, said board secretary Partha Roy. Schools would distribute marksheets the same day, said an official.        
	Websites where the results would be uploaded include www.wbbse.org, http://wbresults.nic.in, http://results.banglarmukh.gov.in and www. wbsed.gov.in. Students can SMS WB10 (space) roll number to 56505, 57777 (BSNL), 56730 (Vodafone), 543212222 (Airtel), 56506 (Reliance) and 55456 (Idea).

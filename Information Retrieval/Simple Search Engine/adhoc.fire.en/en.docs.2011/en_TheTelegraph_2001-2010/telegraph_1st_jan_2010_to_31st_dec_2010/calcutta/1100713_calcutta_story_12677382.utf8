The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Street with a Spanish heart
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Street with a Spanish heart
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Fans watch Spain carve out a hard-fought victory against the Netherlands at a Sudder Street cafe.   Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Red was the colour of the night from Seville to Sudder Street.        
	 Shouts of Yo soy Espanol! (I am Spanish!) rang out loud in the city of Mohun Bagan and East Bengal till early of Monday, transporting Spaniard Manuel Jesus Gallardo Barco to his hometown Seville thousands of miles away.        
	 This is the best day of my life I will always remember Calcutta and this caf (Taberna Vasca) because this is where I saw and celebrated Spain winning the World Cup for the first time. This is almost like home, screamed the middle-aged Spaniard from among a crowd of happy faces that had just spilled out from the caf to the street.        
	For more than two hours before Andres Iniestas right-footer to the net broke the dogged Dutch, Taberna Vasca (better known as Rajs Spanish Caf) on Sudder Street in central Calcutta was a cauldron of oohs and aahs punctuated by shouts of vamos (lets go) and the occasional strains of La Bamba or chants of Espania.         
	This is not going according to the script, fretted one of the 80-odd fans seated on the floor of the caf around the 75th minute, as David Villa lay sprawled on the ground.        
	Had she been watching the frustration welling up in that rectangular room from far, Dutch fan Esther Berg would have been glad she headed for the exit before the match started. It is too crowded in here and the Spanish supporters are really loud. I think I will watch the match somewhere else, Esther, dressed in Dutch colours with dabs of orange on her face, had told Metro as she stepped out of the caf a little before midnight.        
	The few British, French and Indian fans who stayed back rooted for the Spaniards. We will win. If we have come this far, we have to win, shouted Alberto Tio, trying to keep the spirits high amid the rough-and-tumble of the battle unfolding on the projection screen.        
	We are telling them, See the cup but dont touch it, quipped 28-year-old Ignacio Polla, a volunteer for Missionaries of Charity.         
	But by extra-time, with the scoreline still 0-0, the wisecracks were dying down. Alberto couldnt sit any longer. He stood up, followed by a few more fans.         
	Come on, Espania, shouted a pretty face even as Iniesta ran into the Dutch box, right foot ready to meet the ball in that history-making fraction of a second.        
	After 118 minutes of waiting to exhale, it was finally time for celebration, and to hug and to cry. This is the best thing in the world, exclaimed Ignacio. Now we can say even more proudly that we are Spanish, added Alberto, hurrying to join the gang already dancing on the street.        
	On soccers big night, Sudder Street also found a reason to proudly flaunt a Spanish heart.

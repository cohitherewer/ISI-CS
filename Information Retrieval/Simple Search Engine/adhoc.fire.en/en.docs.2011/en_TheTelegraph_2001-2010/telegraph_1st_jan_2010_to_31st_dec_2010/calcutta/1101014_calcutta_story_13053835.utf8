The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Early birds catch festive first flush
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Early birds catch festive first flush
  - Pandal-hoppers target Panchami-Sashthi          POULOMI BANERJEE AND JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                    (Top) The Sashthi morning group of pandal-hoppers; the two sisters on Panchami night. (Bishwarup Dutta and Aranya Sen)                                        
	Two sisters, one 23 and the other 24, one an incurable pandal-hopper and the other a first-timer, out on Panchami night.        
	A motley group, the youngest 37 and the oldest 72, pandal-hopping on Sashthi morning.        
	The trend of early bird pandal-hoppers is growing, year on year. Yes, a growing number of people are going pandal-hopping from Panchami, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters). The problem is that offices are still open and last-minute shoppers are also out, making it very difficult to manage the traffic, he added.        
	But for many, a Panchami night or Sashthi morning still works better. Take floral artist Kavita Poddar and gang, driven by the desire to avoid the peak-day rush and enjoy the art and craft of pandals and idols.        
	The purpose of our Sashthi visit is to appreciate the works of art that are displayed during Durga Puja. If we have to stand in serpentine queues and rush through, the purpose gets defeated, said Poddar, flanked by sister-in-law Padma Jalan, neighbour Oindrilla Dutt, friends Sujata Sarawgi, Ashis and Sonali Sarkar.        
	Most being self-employed, we have the luxury of moving around with ease rather than be pushed around during the big festive days, said Sarawgi, a handloom weaver.        
	Cousins Pratiti Chatterjee and Radha Mukherjee chose the first-mover advantage for ease of passage and the convenience factor, and all for a cause.        
	Usually I go pandal-hopping on Ashtami-Navami, but since this is Radhas first Puja in Calcutta, we decided to go out as soon as possible, said Pratiti, a Salt Lake girl now studying at the Delhi School of Economics.        
	Ive heard a lot about Puja in Calcutta. Ive been told that its the best thing in the world, said Radha, a Mumbai girl now studying at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.        
	Starting out from Salt Lake, the girls first stop was College Square for the lights, Maddox Square for the idol and the ambience, Deshapriya Park, Samaj Sebi, Ekdalia Evergreen and Singhi Park.... Finally, calling it a night after 2am, Pratiti pronounced her Panchami verdict: Tonight was nice, but Id still prefer to pandal-hop on Ashtami or Navami.        
	But for the Sashthi group of puja-goers with an eye on detail, Wednesday was the last chance to tour some pandals at their own pace.        
	The Goddess in her shakti form at Behala Nutan Dal, the buoys and earthen pots at Barisha Club to symbolise the wait for rain, the dokra work at Barisha Udayan Palli all prompted Poddar and Co., starting out from New Alipore at 8.30am and spending close to five hours on the road, to pause and admire, discuss and debate the works of art.        
	A luxury that only early pandal-hoppers can afford.

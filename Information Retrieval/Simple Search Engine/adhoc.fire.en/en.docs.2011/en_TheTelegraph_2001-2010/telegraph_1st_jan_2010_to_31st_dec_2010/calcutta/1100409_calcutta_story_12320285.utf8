                One of the nozzles of an oil tanker caught fire while diesel was being unloaded from the vehicle at a petrol pump on Bhupen Bose Avenue, near the Shyambazar five-point crossing, on Thursday afternoon. Three tenders went to the spot but the petrol pump employees had doused the blaze by then with fire extinguishers. Daman Rai, the driver of the tanker, and Babusona Dolui, a petrol pump employee, suffered injuries while fighting the flames.     Lakhinder Singh, a 60-year-old resident of Behala Parnasree, died on Thursday afternoon after a scuffle with three men on Strand Road. Police said Singh was walking down the road when a Maruti van brushed against him. Singh got into an altercation with the driver, Krishnendu Das, and passengers Basant Poddar and Sunny Poddar, both residents of Salkia. A scuffle ensued. Soon, Singh sat down on the ground, complaining of chest pain. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police arrested the driver and the three passengers.    Students gheraoed Vidyasagar College principal Tapan Kumar Mishra for several hours on Thursday after he refused to allow about 100 students to appear for BA/BSc Part I examinations because they did not have the minimum attendance required. The students lifted the gherao late in the evening.     A 17-year-old boy was held at Amta in Uluberia on Thursday for allegedly kidnapping eight-year-old Sanju Jalali from the Lake police station area. Police said the teenager worked in a factory near Sanjus house and knew the child. The youth allegedly persuaded Sanju to accompany him to his home in Amta on Wednesday. On Wednesday evening, residents of the area became suspicious after seeing the two near Haridwarpur rail station. They later confined the teen to a room and alerted the police.    The body of 40-year-old Madan Mondal was found floating in a ditch, near Nalban, late on Wednesday. Preliminary investigation suggested he was drunk and had drowned while taking a bath in the water body. His wife Arati Mondal alleged on Thursday that he was killed over a land dispute.     A speeding truck lost control and hit another goods vehicle which mounted on a footpath at the College Street-Mahatma Gandhi Road crossing early on Thursday and ran over three sleeping men. The trio were rushed to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital from where two men were released after treatment. Mohammed Sikander, 23, was shifted to a nursing home. Both trucks were seized and one of the drivers was arrested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fraud in dead mans name
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fraud in dead mans name
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Printing press owner Sachin Sharma was bewildered when he received a letter from Bank of Rajasthan six months ago thanking his long dead father for opening an account.         
	His bewilderment turned to shock when he discovered that a stranger had opened the account in his fathers name and was using it to route black money.         
	On the basis of the traders complaint, Calcutta police arrested Kishore Loharuka, the accused, and his associate Dipak Sau on Wednesday night.        
	We found that a company based in Himachal Pradesh had deposited a cheque for Rs 1.2 lakh in the account that was opened in Sachins father Raj Kishores name. The money was later transferred to an account in the Hare Street branch of Union Bank, said joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.         
	Loharuka is the owner of the Union Bank account and a beneficiary of Raj Kishores account. Another cheque for Rs 21,000 had been deposited in the dead mans account. That money is yet to be transferred, added Sen.        
	According to the police, Loharuka had opened several accounts in the names of dead persons and was using those to channel back black money that he had lent to companies across the country.        
	He was picked up from his Bangur Avenue residence. Sau was arrested at Golabari.        
	Sau was hand in glove with bank officials who helped Loharuka open bank accounts without physical verification. All the documents submitted while opening the accounts were forged, said Sen.         
	The duo have been remanded in police custody.

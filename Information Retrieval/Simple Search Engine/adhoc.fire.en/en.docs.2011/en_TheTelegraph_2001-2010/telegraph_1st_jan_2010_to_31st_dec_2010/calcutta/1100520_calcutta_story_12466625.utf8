                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hope ray for blood disorder

	For Tapan Dhara, father of three-year-old Buddhadeb, a thalassaemia patient, Mercy Hospital on Park Street has been a ray of hope in the darkness. The Midnapore resident has enrolled his son in the hospitals daycare programme, under which young patients from poor backgrounds are given free blood transfusions. My son is well today, thanks to the hospital, he said.         
	On May 7, the hospital observed World Thalassaemia Day with fun activities for its young thalassaemia patients. It included everything a child could ask for: a candy floss counter, Mickey Mouse, a ventriloquist and a drawing competition.         
	Thalassaemia is a genetically transmitted blood disorder that causes anaemia. We provide free transfusions to kids who cannot afford the treatment, said Sanjay Prasad, CEO, Mercy Hospital.        
	Ten-year-old Debduti Haldar has made many friends at the hospital in the past month, when she began coming to the hospital for treatment. Today was like a birthday party. I wish we were given soft toys like the small kids, smiled the thalassaemia minor patient.        
	Her friend, 14-year-old Arka Ghosh had visited hospitals across India for treatment before coming to Mercy Hospital in 1995. We sketched in the afternoon and each one of us got gifts. I loved the candy floss and picking out my loot from the pinata, he said.

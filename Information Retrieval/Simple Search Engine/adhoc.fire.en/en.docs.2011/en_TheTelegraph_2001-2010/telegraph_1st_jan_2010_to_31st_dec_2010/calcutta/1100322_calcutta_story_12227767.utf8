	Investigations into the defence scam allegedly perpetrated by former Ordnance Factory Board chairman Sudipta Ghosh have revealed kickbacks of around Rs 100 crore.        
	Weve so far seized Rs 1.5 crore and over Rs 4 crore worth of assets from Ghosh. Among the seized items are Ghoshs properties in Calcutta and Delhi. The details of his several accounts in overseas banks are being examined, said a CBI officer.        
	Ghosh was arrested in May last year in his Alipore house on the charge of masterminding the defence scam, which involved fixing defence deals with Indian and foreign firms for a hefty cut. Cash and jewellery worth several lakhs of rupees were seized from his four houses in the city.        
	Its clear from the documents that Ghosh and his accomplices had received kickbacks of Rs 100 crore, the officer said.        
	Sleuths claimed to have zeroed in on several properties, mainly land, he had bought in his wifes name in Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai. We have also frozen his bank accounts and lockers but are yet to get a clear idea about his saving accounts in overseas banks, a sleuth added.        
	The investigating agency has identified the foreign firms that had allegedly paid kickbacks to Ghosh and his team and has been trying to get in touch with them through diplomatic channels.         
	The defence ministry has approached Interpol to know the antecedents of the firms, mostly based in Singapore and Malaysia.        
	Most of the ordnance deals were allegedly struck from 2007 till Ghosh retired in April 2009. We have prepared a list of Ghoshs aides, who were mostly from Delhi, he said.        
	The CBI has so far arrested two of his associates  brother-in-law Asish Bose and Pradeep Rana, Kanhaiya Lal Das. None worked in any ordnance unit.

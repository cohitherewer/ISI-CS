The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Loot on train to Howrah
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Loot on train to Howrah
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	At least 20 passengers on the Howrah-bound Amritsar Mail were robbed late on Monday and three of them were injured when dacoits attacked them with knives and pistols.        
	According to railway officials, the raid took place between Dumrao and Raghunathpur stations in the Danapur division of Bihar, with the dacoits targeting S-10, a non-AC sleeper coach.        
	Angry passengers staged an agitation at Danapur, filed complaints with the government railway police (GRP) and alleged that the security personnel on the coach made no attempt to stop the dacoits.        
	Two of the dacoits were already on the train posing as passengers. One of them pulled the chain between the two stations for the others to board the coach and go on a looting spree, said Arvind Kumar Mishra, 30, who suffered a gash in his thigh while trying to resist the dacoits.        
	There were around 10 armed dacoits and they were shouting at the passengers to hand over all cash and valuables, added the resident of Pratapgarh in Uttar Pradesh, visiting his sister in Howrah.        
	The dacoits allegedly held a five-year-old boy, Nizamuddin Sheikh, at knife-point when his mother refused to hand over her ornaments.        
	The two Railway Protection Force (RPF) men standing near one of the doors did nothing to stop the dacoits, alleged Lakshman Malwani, who suffered a head injury.        
	After about 20 minutes, the dacoits jumped off and fled.        
	The train arrived at Howrah around 12.20pm on Tuesday, five hours behind schedule. Passengers staged a protest and submitted a complaint with the Howrah GRP.

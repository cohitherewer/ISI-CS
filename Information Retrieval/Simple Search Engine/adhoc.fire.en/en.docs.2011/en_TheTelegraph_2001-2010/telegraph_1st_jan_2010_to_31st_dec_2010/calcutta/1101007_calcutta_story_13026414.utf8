          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                               
	A high court division bench on Wednesday commuted the death sentence of Nikhil Yadav alias Nikku, who had murdered Ravinder Kaur Luthra in her Ballygunge Circular Road flat, in February 2007, to life term in jail. Nikku had worked as help in the flat for seven years.        
	The bench comprising Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice Asim Roy held that Nikku had committed a heinous crime, but as it was not a rarest of rare crime, he was being awarded maximum punishment other than capital sentence.        
	Ashit Luthra, the husband of Ravinder Kaur, said: The sin that Yadav had committed is unpardonable. I am not going to get my wife back. He added that he had not decided whether he was going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the verdict or not.         
	The additional district sessions judge of Alipore had sentenced Nikku in August 2008.

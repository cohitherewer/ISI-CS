The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rally chokes city heart 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rally chokes city heart 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	The CPM labour wing inflicted another round of disruption on the city the day after Left parties brought the city to a halt to protest the fuel price hike.        
	The demand of para-teachers to be treated as permanent employees gave the Citu an excuse to choke the heart of the city and inconvenience commuters on Tuesday.        
	The north-bound flank of Jawaharlal Nehru Road, opposite Metro cinema, had to be closed for more than three hours as around 5,000 para-teachers backed by five Left organisations held a rally under the Citu banner in Metro Channel to voice their demand.        
	Senior Citu leader Shyamal Chakraborty and finance minister Asim Dasgupta spoke at the rally.        
	Police said the western flank of Jawaharlal Nehru Road, near Metro Channel, was blocked from 12.54pm to 3.42pm.        
	As both north and southbound traffic was squeezed through the eastern flank, vehicles moved at a snails pace. It took me over 20 minutes to reach Dharmatala from Park Street in my car, said Ayan De.        
	Most commuters complained that it took them around 15 minutes to cover the 50-metre stretch between the SN Banerjee Road and Lenin Sarani crossings on JL Nehru Road.        
	On an average, Metro Channel hosts a rally on four days a week. It has become a headache for us, said a senior traffic police officer.        
	The police diverted the routes of many vehicles on Tuesday. We diverted much of the north-bound traffic through Mayo Road and Rani Rashmoni Road, while many vehicles moving south were diverted through GC Avenue, said another officer.         
	But the diversions failed to avoid snarls. The queue of north-bound vehicles, standing bumper-to-bumper, extended till the middle of the Park Street flyover while the rally was on from noon to 3.30pm.        
	Citu leader Chakraborty later justified holding the traffic-stopper rally, saying his organisation was fighting for the rights of teachers.        
	There are 70,000 para teachers in the state who work on a contractual basis. They are fighting for a permanent job, the leader said.

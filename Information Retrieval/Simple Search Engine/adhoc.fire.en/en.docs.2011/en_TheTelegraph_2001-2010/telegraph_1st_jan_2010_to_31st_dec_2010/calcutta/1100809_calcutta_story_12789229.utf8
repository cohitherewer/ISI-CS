                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Family fun with gadgets galore at home and on wheels

	As he turns the cars ignition, Rahul, 37, connects his iPod to the deck. His two kids switch on the headrest monitor, an in-car entertainment panel fixed behind the head of the seats and sit back to watch a downloaded Ben 10 cartoon video. Stuck at the signal, Rahul logs into UberTwitter from his BlackBerry and updates his status.         
	He glances at the LCD monitor that serves as the rear-view mirror for navigation and checks what the kids are up to. The younger one is busy with a PlayStation Portable that fits snugly into the fingers of the 10-year-old. The elder one, 11, has plugged the Tata Photon Plus USB into Rahuls MacBook Pro and is peering into the screen.        
	Welcome to a day in the life of a wired family on the move in Calcutta.        
	Of course, the digital connect doesnt stop there. When Rahul reaches home, his wife Sheela will be shaping up on the body-slimming machine, till the alarm on the all-new intelligent microwave goes off  lunch is ready. The kids will scramble for the iPad  the wireless router assures connectivity anywhere in the house  which doubles as remote for the lights and TataSky Plus. And Rahul will plug in both his BlackBerry and iPhone  the Powermat can charge up to three mobile phones at a time.        
	Families and homes in Calcutta are becoming more tech-friendly and 40 to 50 per cent of what we sell are home-related gadgets. They range from the iPad, iPod dock speaker system, Kindle (e-book reader) and gaming consoles to smaller gadgets like karaoke mics that start at Rs 9,000, says Vasu Moryani of Bhagwati, a gadget shop in Metro Plaza and South City Mall.        
	Customers are also extending their wired world beyond their homes. Entertainment monitors for the car, routers for the office, everyone wants to go mobile, which was not the case a few years ago, he adds.        
	The top-selling gadgets at his stores in South City and Metro Plaza are the iPad and the iPod dock.        
	Going wireless is the most significant trend. The number of wireless routers we sell has multiplied. On a weekly basis, we sell 15 to 20 pieces of routers of multiple brands. You can take a laptop all around youre not confined to a place. Its wire-free and clutter-free. The sale of portables has always exceeded the sale of desktops. It was there from day one but now its increasing, says Sanjay Chordia of Imagine, Apples premium store in the city. The leading router brands are Apple (AirPort Express), Linksys, Belkin and Netgear.        
	Living digital is the trend for new homes. After the 2am party deadline, homes are the new hangout. I have just got a flat in Ballygunge that I will do up with a home theatre, a 48 LED TV, WiFi, home automation through an iPad and maybe a DJ kit. This informal lounge-like, high-on-entertainment den will be the destination for chilling out with friends, says 27-year-old businessman Mukesh Agarwal.        
	For most buyers, convenience is the keyword. Direct-To-Home (DTH) set boxes come with SMS options to record what you miss on TV. If I am in a meeting and realise that Im going to miss a game or a programme, I can send an SMS to the given number and the new Airtel set box will record it, says Pooja Basu, 28, who works with an NGO.        
	Health-related tech tools in luxury homes are also in demand. Massage chairs and body-slimming machines are selling well. The spurt in spas has increased the demand for massage chairs at home. We sell two to three a month, starting at Rs 95,000 and going up to Rs 2.5 lakh. For those unwilling to spend so much, massage cushions for Rs 12,000 are in vogue. Eye and head massagers come for Rs 9,000, says Moryani of Bhagwati.        
	Greater Internet penetration means the need to feel connected and so enter, gadgets with WiFi compatibility. So, the idiot box needs to act smart. Nowadays, consumers are looking for value add-on features when they buy tech tools for the home. For example, some models of the new Sony Bravia television set are WiFi compatible. So you can log on to YouTube and view the Net on your TV with a virtual keyboard. Gaming consoles like the PlayStation 3 is also WiFi compatible, so one can play games online on the PS3 network, on your TV, says Pulkit Baid, the director of Technocity on Sarat Bose Road.        
	There is even pressure on everyday electronics goods  like the refrigerator, microwave, washing machine and air-conditioner  to turn intelligent.         
	They have alarms, or beeper systems which set off when the clothes are washed, or the water is cooled, or the meal is ready. The new Hitachi follow-me air-conditioner senses the presence of a human, and swings in that direction to cool that area first. Obviously, all this goes with the idea that technology makes life simpler and convenient, adds Pulkit.        
	Increased customer support being offered to buyers of high-end tech tools, is an indication of people and homes going wired. Previously, only Vodafone and Airtel were authorised to provide customer support for the iPhone but from July 1, both our stores (at City Centre Salt Lake and New Town) have been given the green signal by Apple. We used to offer support and provide solutions before but now its official. The number of customers who come or call us in a day are around 15, adds Chordia of Imagine.

                      A celebration of life                    Come winter and Calcuttans gear up to take a fresh stock of their annual cultural calendar, and a mere glance at it gives immense relief to the stimulating mind thirsting for quality cultural programmes. Events galore and one can pick and choose ones preferred genre. For theatre lovers its time to fasten their seat belts as curtains go up and the much-awaited 10th Vodafone Odeon Theatre Festival kick-starts today. The nine-day fest, to be held in association with t2, hosts nine plays for the discerning audience. Beginning today with the much-anticipated Kuchh Bhi Ho Sakta Hai (directed by Feroze Abbas Khan), to be performed solo by ace theatre/film actor Anupam Kher, the fest promises to be potpourri of ideas, directors, actors et al. A vital point to be taken into account here is that a number of productions by different groups will showcase (and interpret) the works of Tagore on the occasion of the Bards 150th birth anniversary. Hence, Rangakarmees production of Tagores Chandalika shares space with Pramita Mallicks operatic rendition of Mayar Khela, or Abhijit Sens interpretation of Raja and Sekhar Samaddars Gora vie for attention along with the multi-lingual production, Arup Ratan, by the students of Jadavpur University, Department of English. The much-acclaimed production, Out of Bounds (Direction: Tina Johnson of Platform) will be staged tomorrow. Our own city boy, Mir, and his group, Bandage, join the melange to regale audience with his very own brand of wry humour in two experimental productions, Sabse Bada Nautankibaaz (Hindi) and This is Not Theatre (English).

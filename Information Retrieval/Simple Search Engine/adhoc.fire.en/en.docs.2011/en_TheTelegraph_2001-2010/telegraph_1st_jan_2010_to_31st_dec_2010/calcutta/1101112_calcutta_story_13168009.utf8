The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Campus lab a tinderbox
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Campus lab a tinderbox
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The charred computer laboratory of Hindu School on Thursday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	A blaze like the one at Presidency University may break out in any educational institution dealing with hazardous chemicals, a survey by Metro has revealed.        
	Two chemistry laboratories of the College Street institution were gutted in the dawn blaze on October 29. Ten days later, a fire scare singed Asutosh College when some chemicals stored outside a laboratory got soaked in water.        
	In both cases, firemen alleged lack of safety measures on campus.        
	Metro came across similar lapses during its visit to chemistry laboratories in a host of colleges and universities around town.        
	A tinderbox lowdown...              
	What did we see in most campus laboratories?        
	The labs are small compared with the number of students. Most labs do not have fire-alarms or smoke-detectors.         
	There is no regular checking of the electrical wire. The air-conditioners, refrigerators and electrical fittings are old.        
	The laboratory employees are ignorant about basic precautionary measures, while the students and teachers have no clue how to use fire-extinguishers.              
	What are the basic fire-safety requirements?        
	The labs should be spacious. Electrical fittings like plugs and wires connecting gadgets that are used round-the-clock  such as refrigerators, ACs, shakers and coolers  should be checked regularly to prevent any leak.        
	There must be adequate fire-extinguishers and sand in every laboratory.        
	Students, teachers and lab employees must be trained in using fire-extinguishers and basic firefighting.        
	Every lab must have smoke detectors and fire alarms.        
	There must be an emergency telephone connection outside every lab for students and staff to alert the authorities in an emergency.  Why is the Presidency blaze (and Asutosh scare) being seen as a wake-up call?   Firemen said after a preliminary probe that a short-circuit in the refrigerator might have triggered the Presidency blaze. This prompted the authorities of several other institutions to run a check on their electrical cables. The findings are not too satisfactory, even alarming in some cases.  The Asutosh scare was triggered when smoke filled the air after water fell on metallic sodium during a clean-up.  An official of the higher education department said none of the employees knew that metallic sodium coming in contact with water could lead to a disaster. There could have been a massive fire engulfing the whole building.  What are the main fire hazards in a lab?  Presence of explosives and inflammable substances used by students for experiments.
  Electrical wires and appliances, and leaks in gas lines and burners. 
  Almost round-the-clock functioning of some gadgets, such as refrigerators, ACs, coolers, shakers and hotplates.
  Lack of enough trained hands to tackle an emergency.  What are the possible fallouts of a lab fire?  Fires that break out because of misuse of combustible substances or mistakes committed by students can be controlled by extinguishers. But those originating from electrical appliances, short-circuits or weak cables can be disastrous, especially if they occur at night.

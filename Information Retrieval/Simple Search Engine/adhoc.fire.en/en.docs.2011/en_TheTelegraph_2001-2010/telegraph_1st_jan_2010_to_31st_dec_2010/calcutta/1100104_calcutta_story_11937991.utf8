The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jesuit boost for Afghan students
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Jesuit boost for Afghan students
          RITH BASU                          A special training programme in Afghanistan                                  
	Education in Afghanistan has got a boost, thanks to the efforts of Indian Jesuits  including two from the Calcutta province, Maria Joseph and Sahaya Jude  who have been training students and teachers in the war-torn country for the past four years.        
	Apart from teaching students technical subjects and English, we are also running training programmes for teachers. On completion of their course, they will fan out across the country so that education can flourish in Afghanistan, said Joseph, 36, who has been appointed senior adviser for technical education to the Afghan governments ministry of education.        
	In collaboration with the ministry, Joseph is working on a plan to produce 1,000 trained technical teachers in the next five years. He is also restructuring the training modules and supervising their implementation.        
	The Jesuits first attempt at boosting education in Afghanistan was in May 2002 but the project had to be abandoned as the situation there was too volatile.        
	The efforts resumed in 2005, when two Indian Jesuits  A. Santiago and Noel Oliver  started teaching technical subjects to a group of 65 students at Herat University, near the Iranian border.        
	The number has now soared to 400. For the past couple of years, we have been teaching at the universities in Bamiyan and Kabul as well, said Joseph, who was in Calcutta recently.        
	The Jesuits efforts have resulted in the commissioning of the National Institute of Management in Kabul last March. Another centre, the National Institute of Computer Technology, is likely to be opened soon in Kabul.        
	Earlier, Joseph had brought a batch of teachers of agriculture for an exposure tour to the Pune Agricultural College and the Mahatma Phule Agricultural University at Rahuri in Maharashtra.        
	Education in Afghanistan has suffered because of the many wars and continuous internal strife the country has seen and there is a shortage of trained teachers  a gap that the Jesuits are trying to fill, said Father Provincial George Pattery, the head of the Jesuits of the Calcutta province.         
	He went to Afghanistan in December 2009 to oversee the initiatives. The students and teachers there are very eager to learn and appreciative of our efforts to that end.... I found it remarkable that girl students remove the veil from their faces while speaking to us as a mark of respect, said Father Pattery.

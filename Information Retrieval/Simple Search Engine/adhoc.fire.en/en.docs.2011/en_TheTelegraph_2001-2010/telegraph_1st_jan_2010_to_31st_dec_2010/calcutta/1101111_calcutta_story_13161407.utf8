	To answer the question, Why is Calcutta airport such a mess? (November 1), the facilities at Calcutta airport are awful, particularly the touts and taxi-drivers. The airport reflects the state of apathy that Bengal is in today.             
	Every service provider at the airport seems to be spoiling for a fight. Since the government is unable to ban touts, they should be legalised, with a fixed rate for each service.           
	Moreover, there is a lack of civic sense among fliers and those who come to drop off or receive fliers.           
	S. Mukhopadhyay,

	Calcuttans are too busy with politics. Instead of caring about their own life, they are busy with the CPM or the Trinamul. Politics is the most popular masala discussion on public transport and among friends. Calcuttans are world-renowned lazy people (when in West Bengal). What else can you expect from their airport?           
	Indrasish Ghosh,

	I do not see any problem in seeking money for helping passengers with their luggage. If the airport authorities cannot provide the services that they ought to, why should we blame these so-called touts for trying to earn some money? Even in the US, there are people who earn money by offering such services to the elderly at airports.           
	However, maintaining the infrastructure at the airport is entirely the job of the government. Basic infrastructure is not the responsibility of touts. Whatever happened to the much-publicised modernisation of Calcutta airport? We want to know of the status of the project.           
	The best alternative is to close down the airport. This is a perfect solution for a city that appears to be nowhere on the map of Happening India. We can have a small airport to cater to the needs of our politburo and Didis ministers. The rest of us can travel by train or bus.           
	Dhruba Basu,
  Prannath Pandit Street           
	The authorities and developers of Calcutta airport must learn a lesson from Hyderabad and Bangalore airports.           
	The moment we step out of the domestic or international terminals in Calcutta, we feel like we have entered a bazaar. It would be better if we left dirty politics out of the modernisation of Calcutta airport.           
	Saurik Ginoria,

	Lack of civic sense and professionalism among Calcuttans is perhaps the biggest reason behind the airport mess. Add politics to it and you have a recipe for disaster.           
	Sluggishness is the key word in every government department. Lethargy rules here. And the Citu-backed unions are the biggest patrons of such irresponsible employees.           
	It is astonishing that the AAI cleaning employees earn a minimum of Rs 40,000 per month. Can they start working at least for the sake of the salary they are drawing?           
	The fliers are also no lesser evils. They will reach late at the airport and expect things to go smooth. Creating chaos, quarrelling, throwing away whatever they can and discarding trolleys anywhere come naturally to them. No wonder the airport is in such a shambles.           
	Usha Subramanian,

	The infrastructure is pathetic at Calcutta airport. The rude attitude of immigration officials at the counters makes one feel that Calcutta is not even close to being called a City of Joy.           
	Shahnawaz Alam,
  Address not given           
	I agree with all the comments made about the airport. Calcutta should not claim itself to be a metropolis with such an awful airport.           
	The place swarms with touts, crooks, dishonest cabbies and unprofessional employees  all out to make a fast buck with no signs of police control. Like the rest of Bengal, the airport has degenerated into utter bedlam.           
	Nandini Guha,
  Calcutta           
	I was travelling from London to Calcutta and had a stopover in Mumbai. I was travelling by an Indian airline and we were told by officials in London that airline officials would help us with our luggage at Mumbai airport. But these turned out to be touts, who asked for money for the service. The problem of touts plagues not just Calcutta but possibly every other airport in India.           
	Varsha Saha,

	It is very difficult to locate the taxi one is allotted at the pre-paid counter at Calcutta airport. The taxi drivers often force passengers to hand over the coupon so that they can encash it before starting off. The touts are a menace.

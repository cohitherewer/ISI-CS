The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire fuels race for political gains
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fire fuels race for political gains

	Dhobitala slum in Tangra saw a rerun of what Number 4 Basanti Colony in Ultadanga had witnessed  the race among parties to win over fire victims ahead of the civic polls.        
	Political leaders of all hues are making a beeline for the Tangra slum where a blaze gutted 86 shanties on Wednesday night. Kamalesh Das, the officer-in-charge of Tangra police station, said at least 350 people had been left homeless.        
	Eighteen tenders fought for close to three hours to douse the blaze, which officials said had spread fast because most shanties were stacked with inflammable materials such as rubber and plastic.        
	The leaders, apart from promising the victims help to rebuild their homes, ensured that their respective party flags fluttered prominently at the blaze site.        
	The flags were put up in the morning. We will be happy if we gain something from this race, said Mohammad Shakil, an auto driver who lost all his possessions in the fire.        
	Jainal Sheikh, 60, too hopes that he gains from the show of competitive compassion. Sheikh, who walks on crutches, ekes out a living by begging. One of my crutches was burnt in the fire. How will I move around now?        
	The civic body and an NGO have opened medical camps for the victims. The administration is providing them with food and other relief materials, such as blankets and tarpaulin sheets.        
	Among the CPM leaders who turned up at the site were mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and ministers Manab Mukherjee and Debesh Das. Sudip Bandopadhyay and Javed Khan of the Trinamul Congress, too, showed up.        
	Number 4 Basanti Colony, which was gutted on January 12, saw a similar turnout of leaders, led by Mamata Banerjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Both camps promised to rebuild the ravaged homes but there is little headway since. The victims are still staying in two relief camps, run by the Trinamul and the CPM-controlled civic body.        
	Sombhu Majhi of Basanti Colony said: The slum was gutted in 2001, too. We were flooded with promises but nothing happened.

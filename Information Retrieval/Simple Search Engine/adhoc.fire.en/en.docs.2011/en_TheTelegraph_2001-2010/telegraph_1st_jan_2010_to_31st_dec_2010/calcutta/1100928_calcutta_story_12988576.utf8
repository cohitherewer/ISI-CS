                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Petrol cuffs on student leader
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A former student of Heramba Chandra College was arrested on Monday on the charge of instigating two students to sprinkle petrol on the principal and threaten self-immolation.        
	Sashi Bhusan Tiwari, a leader of the student wing of the Forward Bloc, was arrested following an FIR by the college authorities.        
	The students he allegedly instigated  Chand Prakash Singh and Mukesh Tripathi  are missing.         
	The duo had on September 25 allegedly doused themselves with kerosene and sprinkled some fuel at principal Khagendranath Adhikari while protesting irregular classes. One of them also threw a matchstick at the principal.        
	Tiwari had graduated from the college almost a decade ago. On Monday, he tried to force his way into the campus after it reopened following a weeks closure over the alleged self-immolation bid.        
	Cops posted outside the college gate called Tiwari and he walked up to them unsuspectingly, possibly because he thought the police wouldnt dare arrest a student leader from near the campus.        
	But as soon as he approached the cops, Tiwari was bundled into a jeep and taken to Lake police station.        
	Supporters of the All India Students Bloc demonstrated in front of the college and blocked roads at Gol Park, demanding Tiwaris release. The blockade affected traffic in the Gariahat-Gol Park-Dhakuria area for nearly an hour in the afternoon.        
	Tiwari has been arrested on false charges. We will launch an agitation from Tuesday if he is not released, said Students Bloc leader Abhisek Nandi.        
	Principal Adhikari said students would have to show their I-cards at the gate while entering the college.

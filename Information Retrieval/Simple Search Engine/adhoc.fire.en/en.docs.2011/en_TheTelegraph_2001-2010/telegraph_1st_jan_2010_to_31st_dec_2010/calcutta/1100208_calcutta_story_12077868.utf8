          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two advanced machines used in diagnosing and treating coronary artery diseases have become operational in a city hospital.         
	Intravascular Ultrasound (IUVS) and Rotablator, installed at the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, help cardiologists understand the nature of an arterial block and remove thick plaque.        
	Plaque, made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in blood, accumulates in the arterial wall over years, leading to stenosis (narrowing of artery walls) and heart attack.        
	An IUVS machine shows a clearer image of an artery than an angiograph. It also shows whether the plaque is soft or hard in nature, making it easier to determine whether the patient requires angioplasty, coronary bypass surgery or drug therapy, said Debdutta Bhattacharya, a consultant interventional cardiologist at the hospital.        
	There is confusion over the choice of treatment method in 20 per cent cases. The IUVS machine will solve the problem, said cardiothoracic surgeon Kunal Sarkar. According to doctors, the machine also shows whether a stent was properly implanted in an artery through angioplasty.        
	Rotablator is effective against plaque with high calcium content.In these cases, angioplasty is not a viable option. But the rotablator breaks crystal effectively, said B.P. Pandey, an interventional cardiologist at the hospital.

          DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA                          defiant death trap: 174 CR Avenue has escaped the axe since 1996. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha                                        
	If you do not exist, you can grow as tall as you want to.        
	If it is true of Alice in Wonderland, it is also true of a building in Calcutta.        
	The building at 174 CR Avenue, a stones throw from Ram Mandir, is nine storeys high. Each floor has an area of 5,000sq ft. The building houses several busy establishments, including the sprawling Shyam Market on the ground floor, outlets and offices on the higher floors and residences.        
	People come and go. Shyam Market sells brocade and tissue and sequined salwar kurtas. There are 12 gaddis on the second floor and the third to eighth floors have residential flats, not less than 1,500sq ft each. Water from the windows overhead dribbles on the passers-by and one hopes its the AC. But even if the water leaves wet spots on the shirt, it could be an illusion.         
	For the building doesnt exist. Because it ought to have been demolished long ago, and the CMC cant bring itself to say that it has not done its duty. Ironically, of course, it is the CMC that issued three demolition orders against the building for being unauthorised and unsafe  experts have claimed that it is likely to collapse at any moment: a death trap supported by weak columns and beams.        
	The CMC orders were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1996. But the CMC has done nothing to pull down the building in all these years. That suits everyone just fine.        
	The corporation doesnt collect tax from the building, as issuing tax notices would be acknowledging its own inability to demolish the structure, which would amount to contempt of court.        
	The property tax due till date is over Rs 4 crore, including interest and penalty.         
	Many shop-owners did not require trade licences. The CMC stopped issuing licences from 1996, for again, to issue the licence, the CMC would have to acknowledge that the building exists. When the Trinamul came to power in the CMC in 2000, they issued trade licences again.        
	Rabindra Gupta, office-bearer of the tenants association, says: The association maintains the building. No one pays rent, since technically there is no structure.         
	The mayor admits the CMCs guilt. It was an offence on the part of the CMC not to demolish the wholly illegal structure standing at 174 CR Avenue, says Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. But he adds: The main problem is not the demolition but vacating the building before demolition.        
	Vacating the building follows a court order. Bhattacharyya admits that over Rs 4 crore of property tax is due from the premises and claims the CMC will soon send a distrant warrant to the owner of the premise. If the owner fails to shell out the amount we will start the process of attaching the property, he adds.         
	It is about a seven-cottah plot. In Calcutta, property tax on vacant land is higher than on the built-up area. The annual valuation of the plot is being calculated on the basis of the market price of land at CR Avenue near Ram Mandir, says Aniruddha Mukherjee, the chief manager (revenue) of the CMC.        
	The trouble goes back to the Seventies.        
	In 1977, the CMC asked the owner of the building, Durga Devi Bhagat  Bhagat was the original owner; Shyam Lal Agarwal and Sons, the first lessees, purchased the property and Santosh Agarwal, son of Shyam, is one of the current owners  to stop work as the structure had not been authorised. Shyam Lal Agarwal moved the city civil court and got an interim order restraining the CMC from interference and added a floor.         
	This became Shyam Lals modus operandi. Till the mid- Eighties, the CMC issued one notice after another against the building, but the owner moved court and got an injunction. As the case moved from court to CMC to court, floor after floor was added. The building grew and grew, like Alice, rapidly, and in 1980, it had soared to 14 storeys. All unauthorised.        
	The attempts to hem the building in continued. In April 1981, the deputy municipal commissioner (building) of the CMC passed two demolition orders: one for demolition from the seventh to 10th storey and the other for demolition from the 11th to 14th storey.         
	The same year the Supreme Court dismissed the owners petition, authorising demolition up to the sixth storey.        
	The tenants jumped into the fray. In 1982, they moved the Supreme Court against the demolition of the 13th floor but their special leave petition was dismissed.        
	The building stood stubbornly.         
	In 1990, city architect (now director-general, building) Gorachand Mondol filed an affidavit saying the building continued to be unsafe and was likely to collapse any moment. Claiming it was a death trap, Mondol told the court it is impossible to regularise such a building. He also pointed out the number of columns in the building are over-stressed (between 69.282 per cent and 117.2 per cent) and the beams are over-stressed (between 75 per cent and 264 per cent), which makes the structure very unsafe.         
	On April 20, 1996, the Chief Justice of India, S.P. Bharucha, and Justice S.C. Sen held the owner first and thereafter the tenants responsible for abusing the process of court for the unauthorised structure that is hazardous and unsafe. this is a case in which exemplary cost should be awarded.We further direct that no court shall entertain any suit or proceedings in relation to this particular building in carrying out the three demolition orders of the CMC.        
	It was then that the four top floors were demolished. Finally the building shrank a little.         
	But that has not made it safer. The main entrance is dark. There are two creaky lifts and the only staircase moves up for eight floors, littered with wood shavings and other waste matter in sacks. The landings are flooded with water from an unknown source.         
	At the gaddis, people are so busy stocking up on childrens hosiery that they do not have time to look anywhere else.         
	The stall-owners at Shyam Market, mostly Hindi-speak ing, are adept at luring customers. They roll out bales of brocade and tissue and chat women up, not letting go till something is bought.         
	But ask them about the building, they say they do not know anything. Though on the neighbouring Mukta Ram Babu Street, everyone knows the building that ought to have been demolished. And Santosh Agarwal, the owner, accuses the CMC of not carrying out the demolition and issuing trade licences.         
	No one can, however, miss the several gods and goddesses painted on the tiles of the staircase of 174 CR Avenue leading to the first floor. Are they holding the building up?

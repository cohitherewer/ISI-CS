                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lawyers at CJ door to enter high court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Employees demonstrate at a high court entrance. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Lawyers approached the chief justice to enter the high court after striking employees kept the gates shut for the second consecutive day on Thursday to press for the implementation of a revised pay scale.        
	Some lawyers on Thursday tried to persuade Group D employees, who are among the 1,700 who have started the indefinite strike, to let them in but were turned down.        
	Groups of protesters have been picketing near the gates. Only the gate meant for judges has been kept free.        
	A six-member delegation of the high court bar association met Chief Justice J.N. Patel at his residence in the morning. The lawyers told the chief justice that they were not allowed by the protesters to fetch their gowns, case documents and books kept in the bar association rooms and hence could not take part in proceedings in subordinate courts, said Uttam Majumdar, a former secretary of the association.         
	The chief justice said he had been trying hard to solve the problem quickly. But at the same time, he requested us to convince the agitating employees to allow us to enter the court, added Majumdar.        
	Tapas Bhanja, a lawyer of the court, also went to the chief justices residence in the morning and filed a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding penal action against the agitators who were preventing the lawyers from entering the court building.        
	The chief justices residence is also treated as a court. So I went there and filed the PIL, Bhanja said.        
	When the lawyer visited the court in the afternoon, some agitating employees rushed to him, said witnesses. Bhanja soon left in a taxi.        
	The assistant secretary of the bar association, Sanjay Bardhan, said: Lawyers are not against the employees. Their movement is against the state government, not us. Then why wont we be allowed to enter the court?        
	The state judicial secretary, K.Y.S. Manhas, and two other senior officials of the state finance department met the chief justice on Thursday in his high court chamber.        
	Nothing emerged from the meeting, said a finance department source.

	Police on Tuesday recorded the statements of four members of the central Calcutta family that was allegedly harassed and assaulted by a group of drunk cops on Sunday night.         
	Metro had reported on Tuesday how some officers in an inebriated condition had allegedly assaulted the family members after they got into a heated exchange with an auto driver.         
	The family members, along with their lawyer, went to New Market police station on Monday and recorded their statements before Subroto Ghosh, an assistant commissioner of police who would conduct an inquiry into the incident.         
	They questioned us individually and then registered our statements. The assistant commissioner assured us that if found guilty, the cops would be punished adequately, said Irfanur Rahman, 26, who had suffered bruises during the alleged attack. His mother-in-law Shaheen, 45, said she needed three stitches on her palm.

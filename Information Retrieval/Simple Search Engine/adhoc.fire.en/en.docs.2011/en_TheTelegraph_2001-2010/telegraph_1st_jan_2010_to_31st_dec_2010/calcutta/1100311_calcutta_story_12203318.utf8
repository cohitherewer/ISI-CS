	For the first time in its history, the visual arts faculty of Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) is holding its annual art exhibition of the works of award-winning and talented students at the Victoria Memorial Hall. The week-long exhibition of 150 works, ranging from paintings, graphic art, sculpture and installation, was inaugurated by governor M.K. Narayanan on Monday evening.         
	The juxtaposition of works by budding artists and the splendid colonial architecture of Victoria Memorial and its wealth of statuary and paintings was, indeed, striking, and Narayanan, too, commented on it in his inaugural speech. The governor is the chancellor of this university.        
	The visual arts department of RBU began as a painting department in 1972, and from its fourth year, began offering specialisation and started five departments.         
	It shifted to the Emerald Bower campus on Barrackpore Trunk Road in 2002, where its annual art exhibitions used to be held. Hiring space outside the campus was beyond its means, and these exhibitions failed to pull any visitors. Nobody bothered to visit them, although the students and teachers put in much effort to organise them.        
	As the last resort, the Victoria Memorial authorities were approached. They readily agreed to the proposal of hosting the show.         
	With a deadline of only a fortnight, both teachers and students burnt the midnight oil to mount it. The inaugural ceremony began on the grand staircase facing the statue of Queen Victoria. Quite a large number of people had gathered for the ceremony.         
	Students sang Vande Mataram and a Rabindrasangeet. The governor launched the catalogue. He said Calcutta was a city of culture and the exhibition, that is nicely timed with Tagores 150th birth anniversary, will give art lovers the opportunity to interact with artists in the backdrop of colonial art.

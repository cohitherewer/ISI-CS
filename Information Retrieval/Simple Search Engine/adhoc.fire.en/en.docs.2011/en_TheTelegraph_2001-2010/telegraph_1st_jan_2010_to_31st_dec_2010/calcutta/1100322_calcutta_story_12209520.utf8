The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Euro realty eyes city tie-up 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Euro realty eyes city tie-up

	Europe has come calling with investment overtures for Calcuttas realty sector in a move deemed a first by experts.         
	Organisers of Expo Real, the largest European B-to-B trade fair for the international property and investment market, an annual event in Munich, met senior members of Credais state chapter in the city recently, offering a match-making forum with international investors and tech titans at the October event in the south German city.        
	The worlds gaze is on India now, and we would like to take this opportunity to build a bridge between Indian real estate projects and European resources at Expo Real, and Calcutta is a good kick-off point for us, Eugen Egetenmeir, the managing director of Messe Mnchen GmbH, the organisers of the trade show, told city realtors.        
	The three-day business-driven event focuses on commercial real estate  office, logistics, retail, tourism, infrastructural real estate and residential portfolios. The 13th edition will be held at the New Munich Trade Fair Centre from October 4 to 6 this year, and the organisers hope to host an exploratory delegation from India for the first time.        
	This is a wonderful opportunity for the local real estate trade to underline its strong fundamentals and gain valuable exposure in the European market, pointed out Credai Bengal president Pradeep Sureka.        
	We will probably take a fact-finding delegation of Indian developers to the Munich trade fair this October, and Calcutta should throw up a sizeable number to join that team. Based on the learning curve, our projects can be actually showcased in Europe for the first time, perhaps from the next edition itself, observed Santosh Rungta, the national president of Credai.        
	The Messe Mnchen team agreed a scoping delegation would be the ideal platform to build on, since at Expo Real, Indian realtors can meet international investors and money. Claudia Boymanns, the exhibition group director, who also flew down from Munich to meet the Calcutta realty group, added: Expo Reals extensive programme of conference events speakers gives participants insight into the latest trends and innovations in the property, investment and finance market.

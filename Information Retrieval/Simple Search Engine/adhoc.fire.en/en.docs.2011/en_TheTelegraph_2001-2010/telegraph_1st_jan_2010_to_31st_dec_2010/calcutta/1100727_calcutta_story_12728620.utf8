                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Battle for Bypass plot 
            OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                      
	A familys battle to reclaim a prime plot off the EM Bypass received a boost on Monday with Calcutta High Court asking the government to explain under what law the land was acquired and divided among six companies.         
	Justice Indira Banerjee said in her interim order that any construction by the six stakeholders on the disputed 5.2-acre plot (315 cottahs) at Nonadanga would be at their own risk given the dispute over acquisition and payment.        
	The companies will have to abide by the final verdict, she said, seeking complete details of the seven-year-old land deal from the urban development department.        
	The six companies that own the land  around three km west of the Milon Mela fairground  are Wockhardt (now Fortis) Hospital, Maruti Udyog, Arisan Properties (owned by the Apeejay Group), Calcutta International School, the Jnananidhi Trust and a joint venture between the South City and Merlin groups.         
	Fortis has already raised a nine-storeyed building on its 90-cottah share, for which it had paid the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) Rs 4.5 crore.        
	The family of the original landowner, late Sushil Roy Mondal, has accused the government of not only forcibly acquiring the plot but also refusing to pay for it. Lawyers for the family explain the delay in filing the case  the petition was admitted this April  by saying their clients wasted six years running from one department to another.        
	The principal secretary of the urban affairs department, Debashis Sen, claimed to be unaware of the court order. I can comment only after I go through the details, he said.        
	Fortis CEO Vishal Bali insisted that his company had scrutinised all the land documents and found those to be in order. Moreover, the CMDA assured us that the acquisition was done in accordance with the stipulated procedures, he told Metro.        
	Would the company stop construction? Our hospital was to be commissioned in three to four weeks, he said.        
	A spokesperson for Maruti blamed the government for the turn of events. The plot was allocated to us many years ago. We paid Rs 70 lakh (for 11 cottahs). But it turned out to be a disputed property. We wanted to build an office and a training centre there. Every time the state government allots us a property, it turns out to be disputed, he said.        
	The official said the CMDA had promised to provide an alternative plot.        
	Merlin MD Sushil Mohta said his company had not started construction yet. However, we are confident that the CMDA has done a proper job and it is just a matter of time that the case will be resolved, he added.

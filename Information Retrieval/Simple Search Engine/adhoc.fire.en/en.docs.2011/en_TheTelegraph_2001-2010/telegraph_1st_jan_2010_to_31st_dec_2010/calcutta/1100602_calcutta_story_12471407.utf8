The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Naked gun at Maidan joyride 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Naked gun at Maidan joyride 
          PRIYANKA ROY                                            
	Shah Rukh may soon be out of work  if the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has its way.        
	The seven-year-old horse who wakes up at 4am and trots around the Maidan carrying smiling couples and excited children every day has, along with around 50 of his colleagues, caught the eagle eye of the champions of animal rights who are pushing for a ban on horse-drawn carriages.        
	PETA has launched a suitably eye-catching campaign with Bollywood wannabe Nargis Bagheri in nothing but a body stockings atop a horse made of wood with the catchline: Dont be taken for a ride; horse-drawn carts are cruel.        
	Hear it from the Garam Masala actress: The government in Delhi is helping to phase out horse-drawn tongas and giving the tonga drivers alternative income and employment options. In Calcutta, the government can do the same.        
	Over the years, the number of tongas in the city  which originate from a depot at Rajabazar and ply along the Maidan  has dwindled from 6,000 to a mere 50.        
	Tongas are no longer used for transport. Abhi woh shaukeen cheez ho gayee hai. They are used in weddings and for fun rides, says Noor Alam, one of the oldest tonga drivers in the city, with over 40 years experience.        
	The PETA argument against the tonga is two-fold: the condition of the horses and the perils of getting too close to city traffic. The pathetic condition of the horses used to ferry visitors to and from Calcuttas Victoria Memorial is a sorry sight, says Poorva Joshipura, the chief functionary of PETA India.        
	Tell that to the tongawallahs and feel the whiplash. We treat our horses very well. We give them enough to eat and let them rest in the shade during the afternoon while we sleep under the blazing sun, declares one tonga owner.        
	At the end of the day, most tongas are parked in the Rajabazar stand. Some are kept on the Maidan while others sleep in the stables of Alipore and Park Circus.        
	The other PETA pique is the traffic threat to horses. With the number of vehicles on the road increasing every day, horses are out of place on congested streets. Horse-drawn carriages have already been banned in Paris, London, Pune and several US cities, says Joshipura.        
	The tonga owners  in business for close to 150 years and now busy offering a joyride along the citys greenest stretch  see red on the safety slur. In the 20 years that I have been driving a tonga, I havent witnessed a single accident involving a tonga on Red Road, protests Mohammed Ashraful, a third-generation tonga driver.        
	The tongas start from opposite Victoria Memorial and travel along the road adjacent to the race course. They take a U-turn near the cannon at Fort William just before hitting Red Road. This is the route that police have specified for us. Even when we drive the tongas on the road, we make sure to keep to the side and not come in the way of traffic. We turn back before cars start speeding on Red Road, explains Ashraful.         
	The majority of tonga drivers have visiting cards and can be contacted over their mobile phones. Most of the horses are bought from the Sonepur Mela in Bihar. A few are also bought from Calcutta.        
	With or without being in the PETAs line of fire, the tongas are trotting towards the finishing line. After all, GenX is steering clear of the slow-coach calling.        
	Today, the younger lot is not interested in carrying on the tradition because it is low-paying and requires a lot of skill. A ban will be the final blow, says Alam.        
	No wonder the PETA campaign with Nargis the rider in next to nothing  I want to expose the truth, she says, justifying her dare-bare act  draws a dirty look from the tonga-wallahs.        
	This woman can end the joyride of some ordinary people and kill our sole source of livelihood, laments Ashraful.

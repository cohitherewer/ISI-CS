                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Terror link in airport detention
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 35-year-old businessman from Dhaka with alleged Al Qaida links was detained at the city airport on Wednesday evening on his way to Kerala.        
	Nawaz Abdur Rahim was sent back to Bangladesh on Thursday. He was travelling with his father Niaz Rahim to attend a wedding in the southern state. The two reportedly own an automobile parts business in Dhaka with a turnover of $200 million.        
	They arrived in the city from the Bangladesh capital on a Jet Airways flight and were stopped by the immigration authorities. Niaz was allowed to proceed to Kerala.        
	The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the US had issued a lookout notice for Nawaz because of his suspected terror links, said a source in the Intelligence Bureau.        
	Immigration officials did not confirm that Nawaz was detained because of his alleged terror links. He was sent back because of irregularities in his travel documents, said an immigration official.         
	IB sources told Metro that the Bangladesh authorities had not allowed him to travel to Malaysia earlier this month.        
	Nawazs family had migrated from Kerala to Dhaka after Partition.

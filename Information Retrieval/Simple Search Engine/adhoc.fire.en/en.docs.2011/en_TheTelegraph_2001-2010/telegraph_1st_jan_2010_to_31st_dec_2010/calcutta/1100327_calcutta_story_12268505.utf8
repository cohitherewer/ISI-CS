	The Stephen Court fire seems to have spooked the citys minders and residents enough to finally take action against risky buildings and review fire-safety measures.         
	The police, civic body and the fire services met on Friday and drew up a list of 10 fire-prone large residential and commercial premises and three slums in central Calcutta. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will start sending caution notices to these premises from Saturday, asking traders associations, owners, lease-holders or occupiers to take fire-prevention steps.         
	The premises were shortlisted after a joint inspection by the five-member investigation committee appointed by the government in the wake of the Nandram Market fire on January 12. The committee comprised senior representatives of the police, CMC building department, fire and emergency services, state forensic science laboratory and CESC.         
	The residents on their part have started convening housing committee meetings. We have decided to keep the terrace door open at all times, to be used as an alternative escape route in case of a fire, said Kumar Aswani of Apsara Apartment on Park Street.         
	The residents said they would hold fire drills twice a year, keep the driveway free of cars to make way for fire tenders and cover basement pipes with some flame-retardant material.         
	At Chowringhee Apartment in Chowringhee Lane, all 20 flatowners have also been given keys to the terrace after it came to light how a locked terrace had trapped scores of residents at Stephen Court.        
	Commercial establishments too have started reviewing their firefighting preparedness. The Air India authorities took stock of safety measures at the regional headquarters on CR Avenue on Friday.         
	Soham Banerjee, a resident of a highrise in south Calcutta, however wondered whether these were just a knee-jerk reaction to Tuesdays horrifying images or a long-term improvement for the city.         
	Only time will answer that.

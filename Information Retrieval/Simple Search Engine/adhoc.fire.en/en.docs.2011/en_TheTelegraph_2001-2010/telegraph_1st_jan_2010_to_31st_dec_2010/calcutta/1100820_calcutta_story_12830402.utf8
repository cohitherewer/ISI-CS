                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Torture cop gets bail
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to a policeman accused of torturing his wife after he told the division bench that he had apologised to her with folded hands.        
	The lawyer appearing for Dinesh Chandra Roys wife Tapasi confirmed to the bench of Justice Asim Banerjee and Raghunath Roy that the constable had apologised to his client.        
	The bench, after granting Roys bail, asked state lawyer Pradip Roy to ensure that the cop behaved properly with his wife and report to the court any complaint of violation.        
	On August 3, the bench had declined to hear Roys anticipatory bail plea and asked him to first apologise to his wife with folded hands. Unless you carry out the order, this court will not hear your petition, the bench had said.        
	The court had also said that if the constable refused to apologise to his wife, it would ask his superiors to take stern action against him.        
	Roy, 27, and Tapasi, 21, were present in the courtroom when the bench granted the bail.        
	They came to the court separately but left together.        
	Roy, posted in Cooch Behar, had married Jalpaiguri resident Tapasi in December 2009. State lawyer Roy said the cop had taken dowry during marriage. But he kept pressuring his wife to bring more money from her father. When Tapasis father refused, the constable started torturing her mentally and physically.

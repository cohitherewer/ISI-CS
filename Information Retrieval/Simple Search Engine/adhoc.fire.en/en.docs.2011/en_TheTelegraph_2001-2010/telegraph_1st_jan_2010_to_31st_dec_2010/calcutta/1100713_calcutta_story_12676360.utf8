The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Banker shot dead on way back home
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Banker shot dead on way back home
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 50-year-old bank manager returning home from work was shot dead minutes after getting off a local train at Sodepur, on the citys northern fringes, on Monday evening.        
	Witnesses said three youths waylaid Pulak Chakrabarty, employed with Allahabad Bank, while he was walking along the rail tracks and fired what appeared to be two shots at point-blank range around 7.15pm. As the victim slumped to the ground, the killers ran down the tracks and were out of sight before anybody could go after them.        
	Chakrabarty, posted in the Allahabad Bank branch at Shantipur in Nadia district, was taken to Panihati State General Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. A preliminary medical examination suggested a bullet was lodged in his lung.        
	Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas, said a personal grudge or a dispute pertaining to the victims job could be the murder motive.         
	Investigators are checking whether Chakrabarty had fallen foul of anybody involved in realty. There is a real estate boom in and around Sodepur and bank managers are sought after by realtors who need loans. We are investigating whether Chakrabarty had snubbed anyone in the business, said an officer at Khardah police station.        
	The murder occurred in front of the LIC Housing Complex close to Chakrabartys residence at 27 Mandela Park.         
	 He had got off the Sealdah-bound Shantipur local on platform number 4 of Sodepur railway station and was walking along the rail tracks instead of the main road because that is the shorter route to his home. The area around the platform is thickly populated and remains crowded till midnight, an investigator said.        
	Nobody could provide a clear description of the killers, though.         
	 It happened all of a sudden. I was standing with my friends when I heard two loud noises that sounded like firecrackers. As we tried to find out where the sound was coming from, we saw a man lying on his abdomen and three youths running along the tracks. We rushed to his side and found blood gushing out of the wound on his chest, said Ratan Halder, a youth residing in the area.        
	Neighbours of Chakrabarty, survived by wife Kaberi and teenaged son Pratyay, said they knew him to be a gentleman who was unlikely to have any enemies.         
	We cannot imagine that someone would want to kill a man like him. He had good relations with all his neighbours, said Chaitali Ghosh, who lives next door.

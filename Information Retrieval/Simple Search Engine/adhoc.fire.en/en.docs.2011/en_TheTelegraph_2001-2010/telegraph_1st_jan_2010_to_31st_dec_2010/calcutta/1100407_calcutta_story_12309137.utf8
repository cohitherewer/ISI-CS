The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blaze fails to prompt fire alert
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blaze fails to prompt fire alert

	Commercial and residential buildings in the city remain oblivious to the threat of fire even after 43 lives were lost in the Stephen Court blaze. Metro assesses the preparedness of two buildings in tackling a fire:               
	Building: Baiju Chowk, P-12, near the Howrah bridge approach road.        
	Condition: The G+7 building is a wholesale and retail garment market with 70-odd shops. Around 300 people who work in the building and about 600 people who visit the shops daily have only one staircase at their disposal.        
	Sacks of goods are piled on the first and second-floor corridors, which would make escape difficult in an emergency and lead to quick spread of a fire. The electric wires form a maze on the ground floor and a single spark can result in an inferno.        
	Workers voice: There would be a stampede in the serpentine corridors and the solitary staircase if a fire breaks out, said an employee of a sari shop on the second floor.        
	Flat owners version: We have taken some fire-protection measures but they would not be enough in an emergency. The building being old, we cannot construct another staircase or an exit route. The only option is to build a bridge to the nearest building, which would help in evacuation in case of a fire, said Pramendra Parakh, a member of the Baiju Chowk Flat Owners Association.        
	Building: Dwarka Apartment, 7 Sarat Bose Road.        
	Condition: Like at Stephen Court, the door to the roof of the eight-storeyed residential building remains locked to protect the mobile towers that have been installed. The water tank is on the terrace. According to residents, the developer violated the sanctioned plan so that offices could be set up in the building.        
	He had promised to build a second staircase if the residents allowed the first floor to be used commercially but has not done so. Unauthorised constructions have come up on the ground floor.        
	Tenants voice: All of us would die if a fire breaks out. We have written to the civic body and police but no action has been taken, said Ashok Puturkhia, a trader who lives with his family on the third floor.        
	Promoters version: The cellphone towers came up in 2002 after taking consent from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. As far as I know, the door to the terrace remains open but I will find out. We will soon build a second staircase for those who visit the offices, said Dilip Singh Mehta, the promoter of the building.               
	Officialspeak: The civic rules make it mandatory for corridors of all commercial buildings to be free of any obstruction. There should be proper firefighting equipment, said Dipak Sarkar, the deputy director (fire prevention) of the state fire services.        
	An officer of Bhowanipore police station said they were looking into the allegations of the residents of Dwarka Apartment.                    IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI AND JHINUK MAZUMDAR

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Politics draws campus blood   Parents in shock over loss of life and sight
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Politics draws campus blood     Parents in shock over loss of life and sight
          OUR BUREAU                            Swapan Koley (top) and Souvik Hazra                                       
	The parents of two victims of violent student politics on either side of the river spent Friday chasing answers to questions that have wrecked their families in more ways than one.         
	In Andul, Howrah, 22-year-old Swapan Koleys father Srikanta has been asking anyone who visits him whether he had erred in not stopping his youngest son from taking such a keen interest in campus politics.        
	We have always voted for the CPM but we never got involved in politics. I would advise him to be careful about his SFI connection, but maybe I should have been more stern with him, 60-year-old Srikanta, who owns a cigarette shop at the Andul bus stop, told Metro.        
	If Srikanta has been left doubting whether he was indirectly responsible for his sons death in the alleged attack by Trinamul student activists, Behala boy Souvik Hazras father is desperate to know whether his son can regain vision in his damaged left eye.        
	I wanted to take him to a Hyderabad eye institute today itself but didnt get flight tickets. I have booked tickets for Saturday, said Hazra, a state government employee.        
	Souvik said he could see things when a doctor at the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology within Calcutta Medical College and Hospital removed his bandage in the morning to clean the wound.        
	The doctors had told me that my left eye was permanently damaged. But I refuse to give up, said Souvik, an English honours student at Asutosh College.         
	Souviks left eyeball was ruptured after being hit by a brick during a skirmish between SFI and Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad activists. He was sipping tea with friends outside the college on Thursday afternoon, barely a couple of hours after the Andul campus clash that claimed Swapans life.        
	While Souvik was caught in the crossfire, Swapan got sucked into the escalating CPM-Trinamul rivalry that has turned the campus into a political cauldron.        
	Friends at Prabhu Jagabandhu College said Swapan would straddle three different worlds  a newspaper boy by morning, a dedicated BCom student by day and a budding SFI leader outside the classroom.        
	He wanted to do well in life and he worked very hard for it. He distributed newspapers in the morning to fund his college studies, cried father Srikanta, who had earlier lost the eldest of his four sons in a road accident.        
	Police have filed an FIR naming 13 accused, only one of whom is a student of Prabhu Jagabandhu College. Sourav Santra, a Trinamul Chhatra Parishad candidate for the college election, has been arrested but the rest were absconding till late on Friday. Sourav claimed to be unaware of who was behind the fatal assault.        
	Swapan, 22, was to file his nomination for the student union elections when a clash broke out around 1pm. Witnesses told police that a brick hit him on the back of the head during the skirmish, causing a gash. Two friends were taking him to hospital in a rickshaw when goons hired by our rivals assaulted them at Rajapul, said an SFI activist.        
	Chased by the assailants, Swapan entered the single-storey house of local trader Palash Biswas and ran up the stairs to reach the terrace. I was on the terrace when I saw this frightened stranger running towards me. Around five men armed with bamboo poles followed. When I asked who they were, one of them hit my leg with a pole, said Palash.         
	The assailants hit Swapan repeatedly before pushing him off the edge of the terrace and fleeing.

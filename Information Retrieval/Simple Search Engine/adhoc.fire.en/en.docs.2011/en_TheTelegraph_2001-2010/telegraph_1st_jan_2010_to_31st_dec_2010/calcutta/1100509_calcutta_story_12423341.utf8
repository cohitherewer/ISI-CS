The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Entertainment is the key
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Entertainment is the key
                              Mallika Sarabhai                            
	She is the fiery Draupadi of Peter Brooks The Mahabharata. She castigated the Narendra Modi government during the Gujarat riots, took on L.K. Advani as a candidate for the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. A choreographer, publisher and writer, she is also the director of the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts. Yet the only tag Mallika Sarabhai, who turns 53 on Sunday, will accept is that of communicator  one who is willing to stand on (her) head if it helps to convey what she has to say.         
	In Calcutta to shoot for a film sponsored by Public Service Broadcasting and to meet up with the workers of NGO Sanved, Mallika spoke to Metro.                 
	You were born into an elite family, the daughter of Bharatnatyam exponent Mrinalini Sarabhai and space scientist Vikram Sarabhai. How early did your concern for social inequities begin?         
	We were brought up to believe that since we were given so much, we have to open windows to others. But for me the crucible was the five years spent enacting Draupadi when I was forced to reach within and find the essential, fearless me.         
	Post-Mahabharata, I knew that the dancer and activist had to merge. In my dance, I am a purist who when needed also uses mime, music, drama, masks and puppets. In a way I am still true to Natyashastra which makes no distinctions between art forms.         
	To depict the Rani of Jhansi I used Kalaripayattu, the martial art of Kerala, but I trained for four months. I provided English subtitles to the Tamil and Telugu songs accompanying Bharatnatyam, but I also sought out and showcased the traditional bhajans of Kerala as they were before their Bollywoodisation.         
	Films, television, straight plays, such as the recent Ahmedabad ki Aurat Bhali-Ramkali (based on Bertolt Brechts The Good Person of Szechwan), are all important for me as ways to touch more people.               
	Isnt there the risk that activism makes the performances preachy?         
	No, my thumb rule is Mazaa aana chahiye (It should be fun)  no matter what your issue is, it has to be riveting so that even those whom you attack are glued to their seats. This is where my capacity as an entertainer is challenged.         
	Performance is a very strong language. When you collaborate with different forms you can find new vocabularies but most NGOs opt for agitprop that make everyone fall asleep.               
	Most of your work  Sitas daughters, Shakti, Chandalika, Chitrangada, Western Woman  centre around women. Would you call yourself a feminist? How much of your work is seen by the deprived women in the villages and slums?         
	Yes, I am a feminist because no matter what the issue, whether it is hunger, violence, health or education, women are always at the bottom rung. If you say the Dalits are the most exploited, I will tell you that the Dalit woman is even worse off because she is also exploited by the Dalit male. Darpana is designed to work with and for all levels of the society. There is one wing that works at the grassroots level, auditioning and training people from these communities, who in turn go around the villages. We did that with Adivasis in 30 villages of Rajasthan and with Bhawai artistes of north Gujarat.               
	What brings you to Calcutta?         
	Unfortunately not a performance, as it was three years back. This time it is a documentary on the shrinking diversity of street food thanks to McDonaldisation and the fifth anniversary of Sanved whose work on dance as therapy was an eye-opener.               
	A word on Tagore, since you have performed so many of his works         
	Gurudevs Where the mind is without fear is my anthem and my dream for the world. His vision is astonishing. Tasher Desh and Chandalika are even more relevant today than in his time.                     SEBANTI SARKAR

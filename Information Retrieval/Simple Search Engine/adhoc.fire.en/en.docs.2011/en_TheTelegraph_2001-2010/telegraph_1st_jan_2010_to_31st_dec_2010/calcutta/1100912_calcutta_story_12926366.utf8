	cuttans keep away from the gym:             
	 There are few good, well-equipped gyms in the city. And, the good ones are often far from ones locality. Unless there is a gym near ones house it becomes difficult to work out.           
	 Lack of personal attention in most local gyms. There is usually one trainer for every five or more members.           
	 There is also a shortage of latest equipment in the smaller para gyms.           
	 Often a general exercise and diet chart is prescribed for all the members. Thus few get the desired result.           
	 A gym in Calcutta often turns into an adda destination instead of a workout zone.           
	 Often many women are shy to use a unisex gym.           
	 Finally, most cannot devote much time to working out after a hard days work.

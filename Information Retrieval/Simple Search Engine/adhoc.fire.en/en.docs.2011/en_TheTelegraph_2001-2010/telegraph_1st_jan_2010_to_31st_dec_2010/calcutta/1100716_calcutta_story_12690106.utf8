The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja organisers in plea to simplify pandal rules
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puja organisers in plea to simplify pandal rules
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Durga puja organisers have floated a forum to push for advance notice on official guidelines for the celebrations rather than last-minute mandates that even divine intervention might not be able to fulfil.        
	Around 75 organisers have come together to form an umbrella organisation called Forum for Durgotsab, formally announced on Thursday, to represent them in official interactions.         
	This is the first time that big-banner pujas, which usually compete for footfalls and awards, have joined hands for a common cause.        
	Every year, after we have finalised all the plans and the pandals are well on the way to completion, the state administration suddenly wakes up and officials from different departments start making visits. Every agency starts issuing guidelines on its own. This lands us in trouble with weeks to go for the festival, said Partho Ghosh, the vice-president of the forum and representative of Shibmandir, reading from a mission statement.        
	The forum wants the administration to clarify its stand six months before the Puja. We want to abide by all rules and regulations but for that we need the administration to co-operate with us. Surely nobody wants to stop a puja from being held, said president Nitish Saha, representing Ahiritola Sarbojanin Durgotsab.        
	The gathering included a representative of all the member pujas. Our first meeting was in January at Sanghashree with 37 puja organisers attending it. The idea (of a forum) was mooted there. Since then, we have gone from strength to strength. Around 170 pujas have been contacted and our membership is growing, said Rajat Sengupta of 66 Palli.         
	Another demand of the pujas is a single-window clearance facility for all the permissions that a puja committee needs.         
	We have to knock on at least five doors  police, the fire brigade, the municipal corporation, the power utility, the Pollution Control Board... Nowadays, the number of volunteers available for puja-related work is not what it used to be. So it would be a big help if all documents can be submitted and permissions obtained from the same place. We would also like a liaison officer to be appointed to facilitate the process, said Saha.        
	Swarup Biswas of Suruchi Sangha, the joint secretary of the forum, pointed out the need for clarifications on the existing rules and court orders. For instance, the police consider a road to be the metalled portion while in the eye of the civic body it is the wall-to-wall space. This creates confusion while interpreting rules pertaining to the space to be left at the sides for pandals on roads.        
	The forum members have already met police and fire department officials. We hope to solve all problems through discussions, Biswas said.

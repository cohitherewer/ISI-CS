The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teachers on minister desk
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Teachers on minister desk
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A group of part-time college teachers on Tuesday afternoon sat on the desk of state higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri and ate khichuri and alur dom to protest the delay in implementing a government order allowing them to work till the age of 60 with an enhanced pay.        
	The minister was caught unawares when scores of members of the Part-Time Teachers Association of College and University, controlled by a non-CPM group, forced their way into his chamber at Bikash Bhavan in Salt Lake and started shouting slogans.        
	The teachers had organised a kangali bhojan (feed the poor) in front of Bikash Bhavan at noon to protest the delay and their representatives were supposed to meet Ray Chaudhuri around 4pm.         
	Around 1pm, a section of the teachers tried to storm into the 10-storeyed building to meet the minister. The guards tried to stop them and a scuffle ensued. In the melee, some teachers managed to proceed to the fifth floor, where the ministers office is.         
	With women in front, the group went past the fifth-floor guards and entered the ministers office. Some sat down on the chairs while others parked themselves on the desk and started eating the khichuri and alur dam they were carrying with them.         
	The minister remained seated in his chair, almost shivering in anger, said witnesses. He was heard shouting: Behave yourself. Is this the way teachers should act?        
	School education minister Partha De, whose office is on the same floor, rushed into Ray Chaudhuris room. The agitators then started shouting slogans against both of them. In the pandemonium, De fell down on the floor.         
	After much coaxing by officials and police, the teachers left the office around 3pm.        
	We have issued the order for the benefit of the teachers. The teachers should understand that the government has to follow a procedure to implement such decisions, Ray Chaudhuri said later.         
	The government issued the order two months ago and is doing nothing to implement it, said Ellora Biswas, the association convener.

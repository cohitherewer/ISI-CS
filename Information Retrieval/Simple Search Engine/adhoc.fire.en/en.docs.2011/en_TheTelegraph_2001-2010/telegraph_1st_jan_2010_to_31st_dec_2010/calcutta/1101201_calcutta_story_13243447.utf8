                      A midsummer nights dream        The course of true love never did run smooth  William Shakespeare              Mayar Khela, or the game of love was Tagores first musical play where he employed colour and beauty in the form of his most expressive contribution to Bengali literature  Rabindrasangeet. As part of Vodafones Odeon 2010, in association with t2, Bhawanipur Baikali Association performs Mayar Khela, this evening to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore. This is a tale of every human heart, where conflicting currents of passion and eternal commitment towards ones ideal collide and then overflow to create new and mesmerising horizons of enchantment. This play of illusion circles around the characters of Amar, Pramoda and Shanta. In a sudden springtime spell, cast by the Mayakumaris (maidens of illusions), Amar embarks on a quest to find his true love. In his pursuits, he is torn between his two loves  Shanta, his loving and ever-faithful companion, and the beautiful and frivolous Pramoda. Thus is created the famous love triangle in Mayar Khela. Direction: Pramita Mullick

	A 73-year-old retired teacher, who has almost lost an eye to glaucoma and suffers from throat cancer, has been taking classes gratis at his old school for 12 years in a state where the government had to ban private tuition so that teachers do not neglect classes.         
	Prasanta Kumar Banerjee completed 50 years of teaching Bengali and history at Srimat Swami Praganananda Saraswati Vidhalaya this year. A former student of the school, he was only 22 when he returned to the campus as a teacher, shortly after his graduation.        
	He had retired in February 1998 but his passion for teaching soon drove him back to the classroom. The Shibpur resident had cut down on classes only a year back, on the advice of doctors who had diagnosed his throat cancer.         
	I love teaching, especially those who are considered backbenchers. From my experience, I know each student can do well if he is taught properly and confidence is instilled in him. Poverty and family problems keep many children from performing to their potential.         
	In Banerjees case, poverty forced him to concentrate on studies so that he could contribute to the family income. His father Jatindranath, an employee of the Survey of India at Shillong, Meghalaya, had died when he was only a year old, leaving the family of eight desperately in need of money.         
	They returned to their ancestral home in Shibpur. Prasanta and two of his elder brothers were admitted to the primary section of Shibpur Dinabandhu Institution. In Class IX, he failed twice and had to switch to Praganananda Saraswati Vidhalaya.        
	At Shibpur Dinabandhu Institution, I was a backbencher. Those of us who sat at the back were treated shabbily. At Praganananda Vidhalaya, the then headmaster, late Makhanlal Chattopadhyay, was a wonderful teacher. He encouraged and motivated me. I soon became better at studies. That was when I realised that teaching with care and affection could turn a bad boy into a good one.        
	Banerjee returned to Praganananda Vidhalaya in 1960 after completing his BA from ND College, Howrah.        
	Soon after joining, I discovered that there were many students who needed extra care. I asked them to come to my home for extra classes, for which I did not take money. But since I believe that students should give their teachers gurudakshina, I used to take a haritaki (chebulic myrobalans), a poitey (sacred thread) and 25 paise from each.        
	Milan Chakraborty, a Howrah doctor who is one of the many students whose future Banerjee shaped, recounted: All students, whether they were meritorious or not, liked to attend sirs history and Bengali classes. He taught so well that the classes seemed fun.         
	When Banerjee requested the school authorities for permission to continue teaching after retirement, they agreed readily. He has continued taking free classes since then, battling glaucoma that robbed him of sight in his left eye, and now, cancer.        
	These days I take three or four classes a month. After taking class for a few minutes, my throat gets choked but I do not want to stop, said the teacher.

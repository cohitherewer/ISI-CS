The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mate denies rivalry
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mate denies rivalry

	Nupur and Debabrata Bose refuse to return to their Salt Lake home for fear of being haunted by memories of their only son Santanu.        
	My wife has been passing out every now and then since hearing the news of our sons death, said Debabrata.                
	Santanu (picture right), the lead eastern vocalist in a new fusion band, drowned in a Santoshpur pond allegedly while taking a dip with a bandmate on Monday evening.        
	Santanus bandmate Suman Chatterjee denied Debabratas allegation that a rivalry within the band led to the death.        
	The 22-year-old had left his EB 332 home to check the sound-proofing of the bands newly-rented practice pad on the ground floor of a two-storeyed building in Santoshpur.        
	Santanus father lodged a police complaint, alleging foul play against his sons bandmates Suman Chatterjee and Subhajit Dasgupta and the owner of the Santoshpur house, P.K. Pal.         
	I knew Santanu for over two years and there was no rivalry between us, said Suman. He recalled that Santanu had reached the Santoshpur house around 11.30am on Monday along with Saikat, another band member. Saikat left after some time, while Santanu, Suman and Subhajit kept practising.        
	The landlord joined us and we played till 4pm. Subhajit and Pal had meanwhile brought momos. After eating the food, Subhajit and Santanu went to bathe in a pond nearby. I was sitting on the bank, said Suman.        
	Santanu told me he could swim. But once in the water, he seemed to be in trouble. I asked him to come up but he did not. He suddenly lost his footing and drowned. Subhajit tried to save him but could not, recalled Suman.        
	Santanus parents refused to believe Sumans version. My son always stayed away from water as he could not swim.... Why did the landlord not come to my sons rescue? cried Debabrata.        
	Metro could not contact Subhajit.        
	Police on Wednesday questioned Pal and some witnesses. Statements by the witnesses suggest the boy had slipped and drowned, said an officer.

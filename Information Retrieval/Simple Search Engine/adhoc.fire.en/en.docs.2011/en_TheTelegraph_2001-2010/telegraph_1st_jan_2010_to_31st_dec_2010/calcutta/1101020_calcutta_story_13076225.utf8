The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Back to the drawing board for AC Metro
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Back to the drawing board for AC Metro
  - Puja after-effect: additional cool rakes on hold, case against subscription           SANJAY MANDAL                          A crowded AC rake on a Puja day                                        
	Metro Railway has slammed the brakes on the rollout of more air-conditioned rakes this December, pushing the deadline to March 2011 so that engineers can go back to the drawing board and remove the glitches responsible for stalling services.        
	The German software that controls the locking system of the doors on the new coaches  manufactured at the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Perambur on the outskirts of Chennai  is to be tested for glitches based on feedback from Metro engineers and motormen.        
	The braking system, display boards and public address system are also undergoing tests for improvement, a Metro Railway official said.        
	The two prototype coaches that joined Metro Railways ageing fleet on Mahalaya have had a rough ride with doors and the brakes functioning erratically, delaying trains at rush hour.         
	Initially, there were plans to get at least two more AC rakes by December. But with some alterations becoming necessary to ensure smooth services, it will be March by the time more rakes are added to the fleet, a railway official said.        
	Eleven more AC rakes are supposed to roll out of the Perambur factory, helping Metro Railway phase out its old trains and improve punctuality and passenger comfort.        
	The hi-tech doors on the two prototype AC trains have been a problem from Day 1, taking more time to open and close than those on the older, non-AC rakes. The problem was compounded by the Puja rush with the doors sometimes opening at least thrice at each station.        
	Commuters stick their hands, feet or bags between the flaps in a bid to board the train before the doors close. The software is so sensitive that anything between the flaps can cause the doors to malfunction, an official said.        
	The two AC trains have also overshot the platform on a few occasions with motormen yet to get a hang of the braking system, different from the one used in the older rakes.        
	Engineers from the German firm that wrote the software installed on the doors have been asked to customise the code to match the technical specifications provided by Metro Railway.         
	We have been sending feedback on a weekly basis since the AC rakes arrived in July and August. Although the commercial run started only 10 days ago, we have been testing the rakes since they arrived. Our engineers have been downloading data from the AC rakes about speed and brake function, which should help identify and remove the glitches, the official said.        
	The challenge for the German engineers is to make the doors open and close faster without compromising safety.        
	Different components of the AC train like the brakes, doors, traction and air-conditioning are operated with individual software integrated into a hub that resembles the central nervous system.        
	Basically, if one particular software is modified, the main software would also need to be tweaked, said an engineer.        
	The braking system of the AC train depends on passenger load. The power of the brakes is adjusted by the built-in software, based on an increase or decrease of load.        
	During the Puja week, each rake would carry nearly 3,500 passengers against the stipulated capacity of 2,800. Overcrowding not only puts pressure on the rakes but also reduces their speed, an official said.

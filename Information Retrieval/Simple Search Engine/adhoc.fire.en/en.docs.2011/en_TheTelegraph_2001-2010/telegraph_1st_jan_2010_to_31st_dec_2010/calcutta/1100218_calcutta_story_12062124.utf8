	The diamond jubilee celebrations of the childrens welfare home and primary school of NGO All Bengal Womens Unions (ABWU) on February 3 saw kids as young as seven performing confidently before US consul-general Beth Payne, who was the chief guest.         
	The programme, that took place at the homes 89 Elliot Road address, included dance performances to Rabindrasangeet Mamo chitte, Salil Chowdhurys Ujjwol ek jhank payra and American pop group Pussycat Dolls version of A.R. Rahmans Jai ho.         
	I am glad that ABWU is ensuring that the kids have access to education, smiled Beth, who loved the Jai ho performance. Past students who had secured a first division in Madhyamik received medals.         
	In 1987, the NGO started an old-age home for women, a majority of whose inmates were immigrants from Bangladesh. The childrens home and primary school were started for their children.         
	At present, we have 198 girls, from the age of five to 18, said the president of ABWU, Ratna Sen, who hopes to open a home for children affected by AIDS soon. Our girls learn weaving, block printing and cooking, besides going to school, she added.        
	An exhibition of handicrafts, including embroidered bedsheets, cushion covers, by the kids was also open for visitors. A letter, from Australian resident Krishanu Chaudhuri, whose mother had lived in the home 50 years ago, adorns a wall of the home, a testimony to the NGOs work.

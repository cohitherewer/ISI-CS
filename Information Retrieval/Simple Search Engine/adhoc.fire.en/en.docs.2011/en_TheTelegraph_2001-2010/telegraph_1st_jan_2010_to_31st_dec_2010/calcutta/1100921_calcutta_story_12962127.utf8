                      Loss of privacy                    Privacy might no longer be part of our individual or collective needs, it is probably one of several moral ideas that have become impossible to sustain owing to the transparent and porous characteristics of our communication technologies. The five artists in Say Everything, who live and work in urban India, examine the relevance of privacy in a social, political and personal context. Sajad Malik highlights how personal profiles of social networking sites are being used as a medium to register protest as well as to impose oppressive ideologies in Kashmir, where he lives. Shreyas Karle and Sukanya Ghosh traverse the mindspace in discovering new perceptions of privacy. Pushkar Thakur comments on how the e-identity of an individual is emerging to be a personal reflection of his true identity. Urban India is an exploding quantum of people who live in herd-like invasive structures in Baptist Coelhos voyeuristic windows (picture here).                    Event: An exhibition of installation and new-media works by Sajad Malik, Shreyas Karle, Sukanya Ghosh, Pushkar Thakur and Baptist Coelho When: Till October 31 (except Sundays); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Experimenter, 2/1 Hindusthan Road

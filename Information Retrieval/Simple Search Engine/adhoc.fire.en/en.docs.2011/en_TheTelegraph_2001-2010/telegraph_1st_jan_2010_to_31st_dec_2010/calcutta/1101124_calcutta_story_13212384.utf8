          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two men were arrested on Monday night for allegedly trying to sell 314 bigha (about 104 acre) of railway land to a trader, claiming that it belonged to farmers.         
	Only after shelling out Rs 1.38 crore as advance payment did trader Satyanarayan Gupta realise that the land was the proposed site for a freight terminal and a coach manufacturing unit of South Eastern Railway.         
	The 59-year-old trader, who owns a pulse mill, had been approached by a group of brokers in February 2009.        
	They had somehow got to know that I was looking for land to set up another pulse mill. They showed me a plot near Sankrailjala near Sankrail railway station. Once the deal was struck, I had paid them Rs 1.38 crore in phases, said Gupta, who lives in Shyampukur.        
	The sale agreement was signed at the 2E Canal East Road office of the dal mill association in Ultadanga. The entire plot was to be sold for Rs 21.98 crore at the rate of Rs 7 lakh per bigha.        
	The brokers allegedly mislead Gupta into believing that the farmers who reportedly owned the land had accepted the advance he had paid.        
	Only after other traders expressed willingness to buy 50 bighas of the 314 bighas that I had paid an advance for, I made some enquiries and found the land belonged to the railways, added Gupta.        
	He then asked the brokers to return the money. When the brokers did not return more than Rs 25 lakh after months of pleading, Gupta had lodged a compliant with the Sealdah court under Article 156 (3).        
	Based on the complaint, officers of Ultadanga police station arrested two of the accused, said deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) Pallav Kanti Ghosh.        
	It is shocking that someone bought a plot without verifying its ownership. The plot had been acquired by South Eastern Railway, said a railway spokesperson.         
	The arrested were identified as Kamal Majumder, 38, and Moinuddin Lashkar, 45. Both were picked up from their home in Howrah on Monday night. They were remanded in police custody for 13 days.        
	Five other suspects  Swapan Ghosh, Firdaus Middey, Iqbal Hussein, Shitalaprasad Gupta and Barunangshu Dey  are absconding.

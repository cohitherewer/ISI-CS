	A 38-year-old man waiting for a train at Park Street Metro station around 8.30pm was injured when he was pushed from behind by commuters rushing for the door, causing him to stumble and ram his head against the moving train. Police took him to SSKM from where he was shifted to Apollo Hospitals by his family.

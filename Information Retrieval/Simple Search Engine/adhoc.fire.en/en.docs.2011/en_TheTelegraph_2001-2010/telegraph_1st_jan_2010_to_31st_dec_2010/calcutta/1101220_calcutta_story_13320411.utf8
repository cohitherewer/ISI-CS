The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Circus of destruction   Circus cooks   up a   storm
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Circus of destruction         ZEESHAN JAWED AND JAYANTA BASU       ttforcity: SAVE THE GREEN                      Posters put up by residents at Park Circus Maidan.

	Park Circus Maidan wore the look of a circus clown with a sad face on Sunday, failing to hide the pain behind the greasepaint as the big top came to life with the civic body playing ringmaster.        
	Olympic Circuss first-day-first-show got underway against the backdrop of growing resentment among residents of the area over the Calcutta Municipal Corporation handing over the refurbished greens to a circus without any safety net for the surroundings.        
	Apart from pitching tent with tonnes of equipment under it, the circus has dug up the greens to set up kitchens, toilets and living spaces for its army of 200 employees and assorted animals.         
	Metro revisited Park Circus Maidan hours before the circus opened in the evening to assess the impact of the plunder on the greenery and the residents who are planning a legal battle to save it.        
	The tent        
	A split-level enclosure more than one-fourth the size of the 15,000sq feet tent has been created for the circus acts by digging up the greens. Two smaller tents supported by iron rods and bamboo poles burrowed into the ground stand adjacent to the main structure, barricaded with corrugated iron sheets. Almost half the maidan, including the portions where children used to play until 10 days ago, has been shorn of grass.         
	The impact: Almost every dug-up portion will need more than cosmetic work to be restored to their original state. According to experts, replenishing the damaged greenery would take a long time, not to speak of the effort and money.        
	Although the scale of the events may be different, the environmental consequences of holding a circus on a ground like this are similar to that of hosting a book fair. The cost of restoring the greens to their original state is also very high, said Somenath Mukherjee, a social forestry expert in the state forest department.        
	The covered area invariably bears the brunt with the carpets and jute mats cutting off both oxygen and sunshine, permanently damaging the green surface.        
	Air pollution is also a factor with the entire area turning into a dust bowl whenever a circus is on.         
	The kitchen        
	The kitchen is almost like that of a large restaurant, designed to cater to as many as 200 people, day and night, for 12 weeks. The giant ovens are ignited thrice a day to prepare food using both LPG and charcoal.                                                        
	If that isnt damaging enough, at least 300 hawkers are expected to invade Park Circus Maidan on each day of the circus. These hawkers, most of them selling food, will also light ovens and litter the greens.         
	The impact: According to green activists, the green patches where cooking is being done would be almost impossible to restore without planting grass afresh. Smoke will add to the destruction.         
	An average footfall of 1,000-plus every day could also cause re-suspension of dust in the entire area because the grass cover is already lost, said an expert on pollution.        
	The air quality inside the tent could be far worse as it is an enclosed area without proper ventilation. I will request the environment department to measure the level of pollution inside the tent, said green activist Subhash Dutta.        
	The toilets        
	As many as 200 makeshift toilets standing on bamboo poles with aluminium sheets as walls have been set up for the circus employees and visitors, turning a part of the ground into a giant lavatory. Residents of the area are also wary of the usual threat of people relieving themselves wherever there is a tree or a wall.        
	The impact: So many open toilets without a proper sewage outlet spells danger for the groundwater reserves of the area, say officials.        
	The waste will percolate down the mud surface, causing germs to spread. Its a scary prospect, said an official of the environment department

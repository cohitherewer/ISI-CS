          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court admitted a public interest litigation seeking a judicial probe into alleged irregularities in the distribution of New Town plots from the quota of Goutam Deb, the Hidco chairman and urban development minister.        
	The hearing has been scheduled for October 1.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya asked Hidco, the implementing agency of the Rajarhat township, to file an affidavit within three weeks stating details of the distribution of plots from the chairmans quota.        
	The bench also directed the petitioner, lawyer Ramaprasad Sarkar, to collect more details about plot distribution from the information commission and file a supplementary affidavit.        
	Since the petition was based on a report in The Telegraph  Deb signals end of quota, published on August 29  the bench ordered that the newspaper be added as a party to the case.        
	Advocate-general Balai Ray challenged the petition, saying: This court should not admit the petition as it is based on a baseless report. The report says that no advertisement was published before the distribution of plots in Rajarhat. In reality, advertisements were issued. He produced a copy of the advertisement in the court.        
	Petitioners lawyer Sushanta Pal submitted that the advertisement was related to the distribution of 95 per cent of the New Town plots. The case is about 5 per cent of the plots the chairman had distributed illegally, Pal added.        
	The chief justice then read The Telegraph report and decided to hear the case.

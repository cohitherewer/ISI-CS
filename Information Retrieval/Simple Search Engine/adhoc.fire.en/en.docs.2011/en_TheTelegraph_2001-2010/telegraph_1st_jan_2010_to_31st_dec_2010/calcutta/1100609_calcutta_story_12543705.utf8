The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayor in a hurry breaks protocol
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayor in a hurry breaks protocol

	Mayor-select Sovan Jol Chatterjee strode into the Calcutta Municipal Corporation on Tuesday to convene a meeting on monsoon waterlogging, drowning protocol in his eagerness to take charge and leaving the outgoing board smarting from the premature farewell.        
	The monsoon will have hit Calcutta by the time our board takes over. So I wanted to review the preventive measures that are being planned to combat waterlogging. The problem of poor water pressure in the added areas (including his ward 81) also needed to be discussed, argued Chatterjee, officially still only a borough chairman.        
	As Chatterjee walked into the conference room, he was joined by fellow borough chairman Firhad Bobby Hakim and two more Trinamul councillors, Sachchidananda Banerjee and Rajib Deb. The quartet then summoned municipal commissioner Arnab Roy, joint commissioner Shahidul Islam and the departmental heads, including chief engineer (civil) P.K. Dhua, his water supply counterpart Bibhas Maity, head of drainage and sewerage Amit Roy and finance chief Debotosh Dasgupta.        
	The meeting lasted one-and-a-half hours, by which time word had reached mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya about his successor allegedly overstepping his brief to hold a meeting before being even sworn in.        
	I am appalled by the newly elected dispensations utter lack of respect for tradition. This is not only a breach of protocol but also an insult to the mayors chair, he told Metro late in the evening.        
	Chatterjee had arrived to a buzz at the CMC headquarters around 2pm with visitors and employees coming forward to shake hands with him as he walked up the red-carpeted stairs leading to the first-floor chambers of those who matter in the municipal corporation.         
	He stole a glance at the office of the mayor with the nameplate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya still on the door before entering the conference room to its right.        
	Although no civic official would confirm it, everyone apparently knew Chatterjee would be holding a meeting with them in the conference room.        
	Meeting over, Chatterjee declared that the discussions were fruitful. The municipal commissioner has called us on Thursday for a detailed meeting on the points that were raised today, he said.        
	He then took a leisurely walk down the corridor and posed for photographers before climbing down the stairs.        
	Was he sending a message by convening a meeting of the heads of civic departments even before taking over as mayor? Kajei dekhte paben (My work will speak for itself), Chatterjee said, getting into a silver Mitsubishi Pajero.        
	As the SUV sped away, tongues started wagging about the first controversy of the would-be Trinamul regime at the civic headquarters. According to CMC Act of 1980, Bikash Bhattacharyya is the boss till such time the new board is sworn in next week. A borough chairman cannot convene a meeting of all departmental heads, said an official.         
	Tushar Mukherjee, a senior functionary of the secretary department, said it was disturbing to see the mayor-select showing scant regard for protocol. In my 30 years of service, this is the first time I am seeing a mayor-in-waiting act like this, he added.        
	Citu leader Amalendu Bhattacharyya, who recently retired from the civic body, termed it as a brazen breach of convention.        
	I was associated with the CMC for 48 years, and no previous mayor had ever done anything like this, he said.

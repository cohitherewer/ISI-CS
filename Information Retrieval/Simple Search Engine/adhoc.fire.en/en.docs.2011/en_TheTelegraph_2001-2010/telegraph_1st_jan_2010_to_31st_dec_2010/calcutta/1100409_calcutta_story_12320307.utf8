                      Search for style                    A trained artist from the Government College of Art, Jamini Roy did not have an auspicious start to his brilliant career. His early life was scarred by extreme poverty and hardship, which obviously affected his work. Though his landscape painting and portrait painting had a distinct post-impressionist stamp, his early works lacked the character that his later works exuded. Initially, he was known for making life-like portraits and earned his living through drawing portraits of soldiers during wartime. Before that, he tried his hand at all type of works including painting theatre backdrops. His impressionist landscapes are outstanding, but following the Western artists of his time, he painted in various styles and drew portraits of Van Gogh, Gauguin and other artists and characters. He also painted some nudes and women in various forms. However, he soon realised that he needed to draw inspiration from his own culture and so turned to living folk and tribal art for inspiration. He was most influenced by the Kalighat pata, with its bold, sweeping brush-strokes. What he wanted to capture was the essence of simplicity embodied in the life of the rural people to make art accessible to a wider section and to give Indian art its own identity. Jamini Roy: A Painters Journey, the ongoing show, highlights the stylistic changes that the master artist passed through before reaching his signature style.

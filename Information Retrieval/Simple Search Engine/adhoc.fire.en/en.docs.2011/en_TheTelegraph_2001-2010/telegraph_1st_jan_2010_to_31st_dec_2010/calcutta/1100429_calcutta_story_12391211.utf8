The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puff ban penalty set for May debut
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puff ban penalty set for May debut
          RITH BASU                          The Metro report on February 23 on the delay in implementing the puff ban                                  
	The cigarette ban law that came into effect in October 2008 is set to finally get some teeth more than a year and a half later, when Calcutta police start collecting a Rs 200 fine from those who light up in public.         
	All 48 police stations in Calcutta will slap fines on violators of the tobacco law from May 15, said K. Harirajan, the additional commissioner of police in charge of the implementation of the law.        
	Not a single person has been fined under the law so far as introduction of receipts (for those who are fined on the spot) and challans (for those who cant pay on the spot) were caught in red tape.         
	The first step in the enforcement process is the sensitisation of the officers-in-charge of the 48 police stations at a workshop on May 8, to be conducted by the Cancer Foundation of India and Calcutta police.         
	The officers-in-charge would be first told about the dangers of tobacco use and then would be briefed about the highlights of the law, including where and how fines could be imposed. For example, the road is a not defined as a public place in the law and hence, one can smoke on the road, said Harirajan.        
	The officers-in-charge will also be handed over challans and receipts, which they would distribute among officers of their police stations. Officers of the rank sub-inspector and above can slap fines for the puff ban violation in offices, stations, eateries, hospitals, educational institutions and other places.        
	According to Sutapa Biswas, the executive director of the Cancer Foundation of India, the NGO helping Swasthya Bhavan implement the law, the first section of the ban deals with smoking in public places.        
	The other sections deal with sponsorship and direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products, sale to and by minors, ensuring there are no shops selling tobacco products within 100 yards of educational institutions and pictorial warnings on packets of tobacco products that are to be changed every year. These aspects of the law would be implemented subsequently, she said.        
	Sources in the health department said challans and receipts had been forwarded to the education, panchayat, transport, information and culture and tourism departments as well as to the Sealdah division of the railway.        
	There was a problem regarding where the money collected as fine would go but that was sorted out last month with the creation of a separate section under the finance department. Once the police start collecting the fine, the other authorities too would start to do the same, said a health department official.         
	Biswas said states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Rajasthan had enforced the law but not effectively. Delhi and Chandigarh have been successful. But only Bengal has a flat fine of Rs 200. In other places, the fine is up to Rs 200. We have also managed to plug the loopholes so that the drive can be sustained, she said.

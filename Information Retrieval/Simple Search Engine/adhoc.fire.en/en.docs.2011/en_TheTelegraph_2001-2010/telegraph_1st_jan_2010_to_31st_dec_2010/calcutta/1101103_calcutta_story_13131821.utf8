The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Probe into assault on bag girl
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Probe into assault on bag girl
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Metro Railway has set up a three-member team to investigate the case of Nisha Elizabeth Gregory, who was humiliated, abused and assaulted by security personnel at Jatin Das Park station on Sunday for demanding that her bags be checked by women.        
	The team watched the video footage of the incident  reported by Metro on Tuesday  and interrogated the staff on duty on Sunday.        
	From the video footage, it seems Nishas brother, Nibin, had pushed a lady on duty after a heated exchange between them. Then the male police officers jumped on him, said a Metro Railway official.        
	Nisha appears to have said something provocative to a lady officer who retaliated by grabbing her by the hair and dragged her to the floor. The personnel on duty said Nisha had also manhandled Bandana Pal, who was four months pregnant, but that was not visible in the footage, added the official.        
	Metro officials, however, admitted that two male officers from the Civic Police team working for Metro Railway Police had wanted to check Nishas bags when she asked for a lady officer as they contained some personal items.        
	Metro Railway public relations officer Pratyush Ghosh said if anyone was found guilty, adequate action would be taken.        
	Nisha, who was still in pain and shock on Tuesday, will submit her complaint to the police on Wednesday.

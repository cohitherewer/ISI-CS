The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus kills boy in Rajarhat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bus kills boy in Rajarhat
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Airline employees delayed by the blockade at Rajarhat. (Soumen Bhattacharjee)                                  
	A 10-year-old boy riding pillion on his uncles motorbike without a helmet was crushed under the wheels of a private bus after being flung off the two-wheeler following a collision near the Rajarhat Expressway on Sunday morning.        
	Ishan Kayan, a student of Class IV at St Stephens School in Dum Dum, was headed for private tuition when the accident occurred in front of Loknath Mandir, triggering a two-hour blockade at the Chinar Park intersection off City Centre 2.        
	Witnesses told police that the bus on route 211 hit the motorbike head-on around 10am, throwing both Ishan and his uncle Sourav Kayan off the two-wheeler. The rear wheels of the bus went over the boy before the driver slammed the brakes. His uncle was lucky to land on soft mud, said Ananda Saha, who sells flowers in front of the temple.         
	Ishan, the son of an accountant with a real estate company, was declared dead at a nearby nursing home. Uncle Sourav, who wasnt wearing a helmet either, is being treated for head and chest injuries.        
	The family lives in a single-storey rented house at Loknath Park, less than 300 metres from the accident site.        
	Police quoted witnesses as saying that Ishan might have suffered fatal injuries even if the bus didnt run him over. We dont know the outcome of the post-mortem yet but the boy apparently fell on the road with such force that a fatal head injury cannot be ruled out. Not wearing a helmet is the worst mistake one can make on a motorbike, an officer said.        
	Residents of the area damaged the bus involved in the tragedy after its driver and the conductor fled.        
	A group of protesters blocked the road for half an hour from 11am before moving towards the Chinar Park intersection, where they stalled traffic till around 2pm.         
	Airline staff and passengers headed for the airport and Sunday shoppers coming towards City Centre 2 through VIP Road were hit the hardest.        
	The blockade was lifted only after the chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality, Tapas Chatterjee, and PWD officials promised to hold a meeting with representatives of the residents on Monday.         
	Traffic is always heavy on this stretch but you will hardly find a policeman. More accidents are waiting to happen, said homemaker Mala Mukherjee.

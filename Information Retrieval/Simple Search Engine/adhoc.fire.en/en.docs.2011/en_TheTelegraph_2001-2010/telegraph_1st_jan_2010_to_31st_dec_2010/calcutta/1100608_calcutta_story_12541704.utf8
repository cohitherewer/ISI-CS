The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Call of duty for lawyer with firm loyalties
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Call of duty for lawyer with firm loyalties
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                            
	Sunday had ended with a congratulatory call and Monday began with one for Calcuttas new deputy mayor, only the second woman in 86 years to come close to cracking the corporation glass ceiling.        
	First-time councillor Farzana Alam, a 46-year-old lawyer and mother of a seven-year-old son, looked tired after barely two-and-a-half hours of sleep but wouldnt let exhaustion come in the way of savouring her moment of triumph.        
	I have been third-time lucky (having lost her first two elections in 2000 and 2005), and the deputy mayors post is a bonus. I answered congratulatory calls and messages till 2.30am and woke up at 5am to a call from a relative, Farzana told Metro on Monday afternoon, taking a break from treating colleagues in the high court to sandesh and a sip.        
	Born and brought up at Nalanda in Bihar, Farzana hails from a family of Congress members but cut her teeth in politics by joining Mamata Banerjees Trinamul soon after its inception in 1997. I had just shifted to Calcutta after getting married (to civil lawyer Abdul Momen). I have literally grown along with my party, said the woman known for her oratorial skills.        
	So how has life changed for Farzana since? Its a huge responsibility that Mamatadi has entrusted me with. I intend starting with my ward (28), where there are heaps of garbage to be cleared. Sanitation and water supply are my priorities, she said.        
	Farzana wouldnt be drawn into any comparison with lawyer-turned-civic boss Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya but did say she was confident of doing a better job than him. Bikashbabu may be a better lawyer but I am sure that I will address the citys civic needs better, she declared.              
	But wouldnt it be difficult juggling her duties as a wife, mother, lawyer, ward councillor and deputy mayor? Je raadhe se chul-o baadhe (she who cooks also ties her hair), smiled Farzana, who unwinds by listening to music.        
	Farzana used to sing well but doesnt do so now because boktrita ditey ditey gola bhenge gechhe (lectures have ruined my voice).        
	For husband Abdul, his wife being named deputy mayor means more for him to do at home. She travels extensively with Mamata Banerjee, being the best Urdu orator in the party. I think I will be able to manage our home in her absence for the sake of the citys welfare, smiled Momen.

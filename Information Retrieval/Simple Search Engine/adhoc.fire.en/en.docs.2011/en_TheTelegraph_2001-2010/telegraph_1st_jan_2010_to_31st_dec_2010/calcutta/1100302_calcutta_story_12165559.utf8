          Onthespot - Subhas Sarovar                                    (From top) The scum-coated Subhas Sarovar; pigs roam on the premises. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Subhas Sarovar, once a pretty patch of water and green located in east Calcutta opposite Swabhumi, is turning into a hellhole, thanks to utter neglect by the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) that is entrusted with its upkeep.         
	The Sarovar is awaiting a turnaround as promised by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC), which has already crossed its June 2009 deadline to start work. WBTDC officials said a foundation stone-laying ceremony would be held on March 4.         
	Visitors to the Sarovar grounds are now greeted by pigs foraging in litter dumps. The area is dirtied by slum dwellers who have occupied large parts of the greens. Some have even built concrete structures.         
	Despite pollution control board placards declaring Subhas Sarovar a no-plastic zone, polythene bags and plastic packets are what one finds strewn all around.         
	The water body is an eyesore too. The parts of the lake where squatters throw litter, wash clothes and bathe are coated in a thick layer of scum.         
	A joint venture by the WBTDC and CIT, the 91.59-acre Subhas Sarovar is being developed as a major tourist spot at a cost of Rs 4.9 crore. Landscaped parks, an anglers deck, a rock garden, an open-air theatre, a cafeteria and a parking lot are some of the proposed features at the new-look Subhas Sarovar. Work will be carried out in two phases, with the entire area divided into six zones.         
	The WBTDC blames the Calcutta Metro Rail Corporation (CMRC) for delaying the Subhas Sarovar project.         
	We had finalised the blueprint and work was to start in June 2009, but the CMRC made temporary structures on the premises for the East-West Metro. So, our project couldnt take off. The CMRC has agreed to vacate the area soon and so we have floated tenders. We hope to begin the project in March, but work in zones 3, 4 and 5 will begin only after the Metro work is over, said T.V.N. Rao, the managing director of WBTDC.         
	The CMRC will need the Subhas Sarovar premises till 2011 for its work on the East-West Metro. We have reached a consensus. Lets see what happens, said CMRC managing director Sumantra Chowdhury.         
	Between June and December 2009, little maintenance work was carried out at Subhas Sarovar. The CIT cites the East-West Metro work for the no-maintenance  the CMRC has dug up various parts of the Subhas Sarovar premises. So, how can we keep it clean? reasoned a CIT official. But areas left untouched by the CMRC are also in a shambles.

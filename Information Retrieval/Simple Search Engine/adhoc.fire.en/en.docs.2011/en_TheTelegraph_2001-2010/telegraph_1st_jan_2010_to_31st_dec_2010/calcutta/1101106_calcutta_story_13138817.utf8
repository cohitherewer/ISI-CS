	Couch potatoes, beware.        
	The Central Board of Secondary Education has made outdoor activities compulsory for students from Class I to XII.        
	Till Class X, it has to be a regular 40-45-minute exercise. Students of Classes XI and XII must participate in games or physical training or yoga for at least two periods of 90-120 minutes each every week.        
	The prescribed activities for students up to Class X range from sports to scouting, guiding, swimming, gymnastics, yoga, gardening and serving under the National Cadet Corps (NCC) or the National Service Scheme (NSS).        
	The circular, issued on October 27, reached CBSE schools in the city earlier this week. Physical education and sports activities during school hours reduce boredom and help keep students attentive in the classroom, said CBSE chairman Vineet Joshi.        
	They (physical education and sports) also limit violent behaviour and develop life skills, the order added.        
	The outdoor activities will be graded along with academics in the annual report card.        
	The move was essential to push the reluctant children outdoors, said the principal of a reputable school. It has come at a time when students are burdened by severe stress because of their syllabi and social pressures.        
	A certain fitness level is essential for good academic performance, said psychologist Mahua Ghosh.        
	Some schools, however, are worried about how to implement the order. Playing is definitely good for children. But it may be difficult to allot 40-45 minutes everyday for games and physical education, especially for those between Classes IX and XII, said Birla High School principal Mukta Nain.         
	Several schools, like Birla High School for Boys and Apeejay School, Park Street, dont have playgrounds. What will their students do?        
	According to the order, the schools unable to arrange for regular outdoor activities because of constraints like lack of space and trained teachers and adverse climate, have to organise activities such as aerobics, meditation and yoga.        
	A Birla High School teacher said: We may not have a playground but we have a basketball court which the students also use for throwball or volleyball and other activities.        
	Karate and yoga classes may see a higher attendance now, said the teacher of a school without a playing area.         
	The lack of a field is not a constraint. It is up to the teachers to create enthusiasm among the children, felt Apeejay principal Rita Chatterjee .        
	The board had earlier decided to implement a programme to tap the latent talent of students in fine arts, sports, music and creative writing.         
	But psychologist Ghosh cautioned that sports must not add to a childs burden. The outdoor activities may not bring relief to the students if they are forced to participate or if there is to too much of competition, she said.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench on Friday directed the city civic body to pay poor senior citizens their central government allowance of Rs 400 per month either by cheque or money order.        
	The bench comprising Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice B. Bhattacharya issued the directive on a public interest petition by a resident of ward 6.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has been disbursing the allowance in the names of at least three residents of the area who had died, the petitioner had complained.        
	The local councillor, Suman Singh, had prepared the list, said the petitioners lawyer.         
	Exploiting the loophole in the system, a councillor or a civic representative can sign a dead persons name and collect the cash, the lawyer argued.

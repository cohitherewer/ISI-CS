                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sisters injured in mishap
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two sisters, 11 and 13 years old, were critically injured after a speeding car hit them on Taratala Road while they were on their way home from school on Friday morning.        
	Jyoti and Vandana Verma were trying to cross the busy road through a gap in the divider around 10.45am when the car  travelling at 70kmph, according to witnesses  knocked them down and sped away.        
	The children have been admitted to SSKM Hospital with head and spine injuries.        
	Jyoti, 11, suffered serious injuries in her right eye and on the back of her head, while Vandana, 13, sustained a major haemorrhage in her head. A CT scan has been conducted on both the girls. They might also have suffered spine and waist fractures, said a doctor.        
	Vandana and Jyoti joined us this year. They used to walk home to nearby Rabindranagar after school every day, said Kiran Sharma, the headmistress of Alipore Takshal Vidyapith for Girls High School in Taratala.        
	A preliminary probe by police suggests that the driver of the car was at fault but residents blamed other factors as well.        
	The gap in the divider was made following requests from residents of the Mint Colony. Had there been no such gap, the students would have used a designated spot to cross the road. Besides, there are no speed-breakers around, said Santosh Jana, who runs an eatery close to the accident spot.        
	The nearest zebra crossing is 200 metres away.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC rooms to get AC
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	After Writers Buildings, it is now Calcutta High Courts turn to beat the heat. The employees will soon have air-conditioners in their office rooms.        
	In the first phase, rooms on the second floor of the old building and third floor of the Centenary Building would be air-conditioned. The decision followed a pen-down strike by the employees who alleged it was impossible to work without AC. The registrar general of the court, Tarun Gupta, has directed the state PWD to find out the estimated cost.        
	Welcoming the move, the vice-president of the Calcutta High Court Bar Association, S.S. Roy, said: The HC should also provide similar facilities in the Bar Association rooms where many lawyers work.        
	Roy also alleged: The present chief justice has promised to address our demands for adequate medical facilities, potable drinking water and clean toilets. But till date nothing has been done.

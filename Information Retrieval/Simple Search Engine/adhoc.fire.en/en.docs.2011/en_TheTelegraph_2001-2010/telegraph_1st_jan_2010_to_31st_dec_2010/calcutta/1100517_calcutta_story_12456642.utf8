          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has summoned for questioning family members of the three youths whose bodies were found beside railway tracks near Dum Dum last month as their statements contradicted the findings of the investigation.         
	The family members made contradictory statements, which are not tallying with the evidence such as the call records of the youths cellphones. Calls had been made from some mobile numbers to the trio. The family members had claimed that they did not know the callers. But our investigation revealed that it was not true, said a CID investigator.        
	The post-mortem had revealed that Ankur Sengupta, Ratan Saha and Tridib Das had died of injuries on their bodies.

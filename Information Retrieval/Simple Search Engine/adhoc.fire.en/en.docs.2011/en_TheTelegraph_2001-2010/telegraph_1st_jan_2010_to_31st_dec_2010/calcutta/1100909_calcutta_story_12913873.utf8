The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Consumer forum asks bank to pay damages
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Consumer forum asks bank to pay damages
          RITH BASU                              
	The Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has asked Citibank to compensate a septuagenarian customer with Rs 3.5 lakh and pay him Rs 10,000 as litigation cost for not forwarding his cheques to a medical insurance company as promised, leading to his policy lapsing.         
	The 72-year-old city-based senior engineering consultant had filed a complaint with the consumer forum in May 2009 praying for a compensation to the extent of Rs 5 lakh for negligence and deficiency of service by Citibank.        
	When contacted by Metro, a senior Citibank official at the banks Mumbai office said he was not aware of any such order.        
	I had taken the credit card in early-2005 only because of the medical insurance plan that was being offered at a discount along with it. In 2006, I started getting inflated bills from the bank. Later that year, when my policy was not renewed on time, I found out that the bank had not forwarded the cheque I had issued to pay the annual premium to the insurance company, said the consultant, a resident of Shakespeare Sarani.         
	Citibank had then responded to his letter of complainant by putting accounts in order but the same thing recurred in 2008, leading to the policy lapsing.        
	Now that the insurance has lapsed, my wife, who is 62 years old, and I do not have a policy to cover our medical expenses, he added        
	In its order (No. 15, dated July 23, 2010), the consumer forum had said Citybank was guilty of not forwarding a cheque of Rs 9,180 to the insurance company which exposed the complainant to extreme harassment, suffering and mental agony.        
	The order also stated that the bank was guilty of deficiency of service and unfair trade practices.        
	The forum found Citibank guilty of charging the complainant under fictitious heads like Citi awakening charge in his credit card bills.        
	I used to pay only for my actual spendings and kept writing to Citibank to reverse the extra charges. In 2006, they had once responded to these letters by bringing the bill amount down from Rs 1,975 to  Rs 20.50. They had also tendered an apology letter, which I had submitted in court, said the complainant.

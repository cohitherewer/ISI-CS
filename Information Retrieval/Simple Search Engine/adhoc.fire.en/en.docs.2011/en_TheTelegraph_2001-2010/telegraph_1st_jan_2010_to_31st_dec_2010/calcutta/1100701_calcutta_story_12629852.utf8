The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Classes against ragging
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Classes against ragging
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Jadavpur University is going to introduce motivational sessions for students to discourage ragging on campus.        
	The university has appointed professional counsellors who will take classes with second, third and fourth-year students of all 34 departments of the university.        
	According to JU authorities, poster campaign against ragging and punishing offenders are not enough to stop the crime.        
	Incidents of ragging have come down in the university though there have been one or two cases in the last few years. We want to bring that down to zero, said Pradip Narayan Ghosh, the vice-chancellor of the university.        
	In the past two years there have been three reported cases of ragging and those found guilty were handed out severe punishment, including suspension and expulsion.        
	Many students dont even realise what they do in the name of socialising is actually ragging. But they need to be explained what ragging is and why no one should be ragged, said Ghosh.        
	The classes will begin on July 6 and end on July 18, a day before admission begins in the university.        
	The heads of the departments have been asked to arrange for two periods for each class in each department. Smaller departments will have combined classes for the different years, said a JU official.        
	The JU authorities feel the new measures will complement those already in practice and will be more effective in curbing the menace.        
	The measures are in tune with the University Grants Commission guidelines. We expect better success with this method, said pro-vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta.        
	The university, following the UGC guidelines issued after a Supreme Court ruling banning ragging, has set up a central anti-ragging committee and anti-ragging squads in every department and in the hostels as well.        
	It is doubtful if counselling can curb ragging altogether, but definitely it is a welcome move. Ragging as was practised even three years ago does not happen anymore, said a fourth-year student of engineering.        
	Many of our former students have expressed willingness to give guidance to the present students, said a JU official.

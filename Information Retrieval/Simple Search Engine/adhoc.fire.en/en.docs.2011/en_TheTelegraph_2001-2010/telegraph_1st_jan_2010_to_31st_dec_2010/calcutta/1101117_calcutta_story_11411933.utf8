  - Mayor threatens to stop trams, minister dares him to          DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND SUBHAJOY ROY                          CORRIDOR OF UNCERTAINTY: Passengers rush to board a tram in the middle of AJC Bose Road in Mullickbazar. Post-dereservation, trams have no demarcated stops. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                        
	The Trinamul Congress mayor is threatening to ban trams from roads and the CPMs transport minister is asking whos he.        
	The sparring leaders have opened up a new front in the battle between the two parties over infrastructure projects in town.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has told the Calcutta Tram Corporation (CTC) that the citys oldest mode of mass transport will be barred from roads if safe stops for passengers are not created.        
	With the tracks being concreted, there are no designated tram stops and passengers have to wait in the middle of crowded thoroughfares to catch the slow-chugging two-coachers.        
	If the CTC does not take steps to ensure commuter safety, the civic authorities will have to think of not allowing trams to run in the city, mayor Sovan Chatterjee told Metro.        
	We are against the plying of trams in the present form, where passenger safety is compromised, he added.        
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu shot back: Who is he (Sovan) to not allow trams in Calcutta? If the mayor has a problem with trams, he should speak to me first.        
	Earlier, tram tracks used to run along a reserved and raised portion of the roads. After the tracks were concreted and dereserved to ensure more road space for vehicles, the tram lanes became the smoothest part of the roads for speeding vehicles, putting in peril waiting passengers or those getting down from trams.        
	We wait on the pavement. Once we spy a tram, we cross the road and take up position along the tracks. It is really risky, said Swarup Biswas, who often takes the tram between Ballygunge Phari and Mullickbazar.        
	No vehicle slows down seeing a passenger waiting for a tram, sales professional Mrinal Bose, 21, said after hopping on to a tram at Ballygunge. We get down waving at the cars to slow down and praying that nothing goes wrong.        
	Ironically, the decision to dereserve the tracks was taken in September 2004, when Trinamuls Subrata Mukherjee was the mayor. No one in the Trinamul had opposed the move then, minister Kundu pointed out.        
	When I was the mayor, the condition of the tracks was appalling, said Mukherjee. In some places, the tracks were a foot above the road level. My stand forced the state government to spend about Rs 30 crore on dereservation.        
	What about the incumbent Trinamul mayors tirade against trams? Im not against trams. It is the only pollution-free surface transport in the city, said Mukherjee.        
	The CMC has conveyed its concern about lack of passenger safety to the city police and the CTC.        
	Around 130 trams ply every day, carrying nearly 1.5 lakh passengers. Calcutta is the only Indian city to still have trams, which were introduced in 1880, at least two decades before the hand-pulled rickshaw arrived.                    
	A CTC official admitted that the absence of properly demarcated stops had made it hazardous for passengers on thoroughfares like Syed Amir Ali Avenue, Rashbehari Avenue, SP Mukherjee Road and APC Road.        
	Who was to blame? The tracks were concreted by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners following a decision by the state government, said CTC managing director P.K. Chattopadhyay.        
	The problem does not exist on Lenin Sarani, College Street or Elliot Road as the tracks run along the sides, Chattopadhyay pointed out. Earlier, all the tracks were laid that way. But the alignment was changed as the police wanted more road space.        
	The transport department had formed a committee to find a solution, but its suggestions were deemed impractical. Among them was introducing a signalling system for trams. Calcutta police, which was part of the committee, has not made a suggestion yet. Police officers pointed out that no accident had taken place.        
	An accident is waiting to happen, said CMC mayoral council member (civil engineering and roads) Firhad Hakim.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has invited the citys realty fraternity to help the civic body ensure better safety standards in upcoming residential projects and also provide technical inputs to shore up safety in tinderboxes like Stephen Court.        
	There is ample scope for handholding between the CMC and the private sector in not only alleviating the housing shortage, but also to ensure better safety and security in old residential building blocks, mayor Sovan Chatterjee said after inaugurating the Credai-Bengal property fair Home Front 2010 on Saturday.        
	The new mayor, who also sought greater private participation in affordable housing and slum redevelopment, was presented by Credais state chapter the Mumbai model being followed by Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry  a public-private initiative with the Maharashtra government to redevelop the Dharavi slum.        
	Promising to find a replica for Calcutta, Chatterjee said: There are many housing schemes being implemented by the CMC under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission for the weaker sections of society. Private developers should come forward to help us in this cause.        
	The Credai-Bengal brass will put their heads together with civic officials to work out the modalities of this handholding in affordable housing and slum redevelopment.        
	Over 20 million sq ft of residential built space will be ready for all income groups in and around Calcutta over the next two years, and more than 40 realtors from the city are showcasing their projects at Home Front 2010 (Netaji Indoor Stadium, August 28-30).        
	The objective of Home Front 2010 is to showcase the immense growth opportunity of realty in Calcutta and West Bengal, said Pradeep Sureka, the president of Credai-Bengal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rs 6000cr science project 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rs 6000cr science project 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics has started work on a Rs 6,000-crore basic research and technology development facility for which it needs 150 acres of land, preferably around the city.         
	The institute plans to set up over 10 years a high-energy, third-generation synchrotron light source, the fifth in the world after the facilities in Japan, Germany, France and the US.         
	Over 40,000 scientists and engineers across the world use synchrotron light for basic research and technology development in atomic and cluster physics, condensed matter physics, chemistry, materials science, nano science, structural biology, crystallography, geo and environmental science, and medical science.        
	The project will open new vistas, particularly for the automobile and pharmaceutical industries in India, said Milan K. Sanyal, the director of the institute.        
	Capacity building for the project will continue till it begins in earnest in another three to four months, he added.        
	The crores for the project are expected to be allocated in the 12th and the 13th Five Year plans.        
	We have not yet decided whether the project will come up in Calcutta or not. We prefer Calcutta, of course. We need 150 acres of land, easily accessible from the airport and away from railway tracks and highways (for minimal pollution), said Sanyal.        
	Asked if the state government had offered such land in or around Calcutta, Sanyal said: Secretary-level discussions are on with both the Centre and the state. We have asked both to help us.

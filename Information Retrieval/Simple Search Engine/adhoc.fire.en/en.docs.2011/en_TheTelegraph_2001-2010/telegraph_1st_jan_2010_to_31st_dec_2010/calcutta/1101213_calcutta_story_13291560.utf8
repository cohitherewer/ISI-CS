                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Xaviers boost to village school

	The extended parts of a primary school set up in a South 24-Parganas village by the alumni association and the National Social Service (NSS) wing of St Xaviers College was inaugurated on Sunday.         
	Paikhala Primary School started its journey in 1999 on a plot of land donated by a resident. Four years later, the St Xaviers College Alumni Association and the NSS built four pucca classrooms  for classes I to IV.         
	On Sunday, a new office, a staircase and a toilet of the school were inaugurated by Fr Felix Raj, the St Xaviers College principal.         
	The school now has a computer that allows students to learn basic operations. Plans are afoot to add a floor to the school building and start classes till the eighth standard.        
	Our real dream will come true when one of you sitting here will pass your Class XII board examinations and join St Xaviers College. We promise to help you, Fr Raj told the 190 wide-eyed students of the school at the launch.        
	St Xaviers College started supporting first-generation college-goers this year by admitting five such students after significantly lowering cut-off marks and providing them accommodation in the hostel against a token fee.         
	We raised Rs 10 lakh at our first international alumni meet in Bangkok this year to offer scholarships. Some needy students, including first-generation college goers, are getting stipends of Rs 2,000 per month, from the fund, said Yogesh Chopra, the philanthropy convener of the alumni association.        
	The scholarship is shaping lives just like the primary school is spreading hope in the Paikhala village, populated primarily by Muslim peasants.         
	One of the teachers at the school, 30-year-old Sairath Pailan, had to walk 3km to the nearest school every day when he was a student. He was all praise for the alumni association members and the St Xaviers College students who visit the school and teach.        
	Batches of youngsters from Paikhala are also taken to the Park Street institute for three days, under a project Fr Raj calls college to village, village to college.        
	Some students of the first batch will be appearing for their Higher Secondary examinations next year and we are very proud of them. It would be great indeed if they could study in St Xaviers College one day, said Pailan.        
	Fourteen-year-old Amirul Sardar, who cycles 7km to Jhanzra High School after passing out of the Paikhala school, dreams of studying at St Xaviers, the first autonomous college in the state.        
	I like to study, especially geography and Sanskrit, and when I grow up I want to come back and teach here. I want to be like the dadas from St Xaviers who come to teach in the primary school on Sundays, he said.

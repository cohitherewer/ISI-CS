	Ten-year-old Aritra Das (picture below with chief guest mayor Sovan Chatterjee) left the Science City auditorium with a smile on his face on July 4.         
	This years recipient of the Priyamvada Birla Brave Hearts award resumed regular classes at South Point High School this year, despite suffering from aplastic anaemia. The award is given by the MP Birla Smarak Kosh. Aritra was attending the schools annual prize distribution programme.         
	In 2008, Aritra was diagnosed with a rare form of hypoplastic anaemia, a condition that causes low haemoglobin and platelet count.         
	After undergoing painful bone marrow biopsy and blood transfusion, he was found to suffer from aplastic anaemia  a condition where the body does not produce sufficient new cells to replenish blood cells.        
	We feared that we might lose him, said Chandana, Aritras mother.                   
	But after a two-year break, Aritra has started school in Class III. Even though he can no longer play his favourite sport, cricket, this youngster is determined to nurture his other dreams. He dreams of becoming a scientist.        
	Several other awards, including the Founders Medals for best all-round performance, awards for co-curricular activities, Special Talent and Special Grant awards were also given away under the MP Birla Smarak Kosh category. All the awards carry a Rs 7,500 or Rs 5,000 cheque, a medal and a certificate.        
	Class XI students Manosij Ghosh Dastidar, Anarta Roy, Aritra Chowdhury and Abhiroop Lahiri received Special Awards for their prize-winning projects at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in California. Said Principal Jayati Solomon: Our students are making the school proud by showcasing their achievements before the student community abroad.        
	Former South Pointer Anandaroop Chakrabarti received Rs 53,000 as passage money to Columbia University in New York to pursue his PhD.         
	The Special Talent Award went to Riddhi Sen of Class VI for his achievements in the field of theatre. Son of actor Koushik Sen, he has acted in plays by Sens theatre group Swapnasandhani.  
	What rsquo;s on your mind this week            
	Aversion to adoption  
	 While recently reading about the children who were rendered orphans by the Haiti earthquake in January, I was saddened to think that in our country, adoption is still a distant thought for many. Most Indian families will think twice before adopting a child. Even those who have difficulty having children prefer going for expensive procedures like in-vitro fertilisation. Some even look for surrogate mothers before considering adoption. A few like Sushmita Sen (pictured below with daughter Rene), who has two adopted children, are the exception rather than the rule.   
	 India rsquo;s population is increasing every second. Why can rsquo;t we spare a thought for the poor souls rotting in orphanages, in need of a home and a family? They have as much right to education and loving parents as a child growing up in the loving arms of his family. When will we get over notions like one rsquo;s ldquo;own flesh and blood rdquo; and give an innocent child a chance to live and be loved?

	THE DIARY  
	Footloose  With your modesty You try to keep me grounded, 
  But by your silly fetishes 
  I won rsquo;t be surrounded. 
  Try your best to stop this flight, 
  To blow off the fire 
  I will ignite. 
  I rsquo;ll believe in myself 
  All the more, 
  That my routine 
  Will not be a bore. 
  I will tread this forest Without any maps, 
  Will learn after falling Into all its traps. 
  So off I go composing my own tune, 
  To the pain of reason, 
  I remain immune.

	Why is it?  Why is it always 
  That those we love 
  Are the ones that go away? 
  When all we need is their presence: 
  A look that can make your day. 
  A smile that brings the world alive, 
  A word, and suddenly, all seems fine. 
  We want nothing, 
  but their love, alone. 
  Nothing more than an assurance, 
  That they are with us, Through shine and storm. 
  Is it too much to ask 
  To be with those 
  Who make up your heart?

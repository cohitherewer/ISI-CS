The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water woes for Stephen Court residents
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Water woes for Stephen Court residents
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          The water tanks that cannot be filled on the roof of Block III of Stephen Court. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	D.K. Bibra had signed a risk bond on April 28 so that he could immediately return home to Block III of Stephen Court. Three weeks later, he and his family members were finally able to move back to the Park Street address they were forced to leave after the March 23 blaze, but are still having to manage without water supply.        
	The Bibras are an exception. While residents have been trickling back into Block IV, lack of water has stopped most of those who live in Block III from moving back in.        
	Civic officials have been saying a wall underneath the water tanks of Block III is weak and would not be able to support the weight of the filled tanks, said Bibra.        
	He, along with some neighbours, had offered to install a plastic water tank at a place the civic experts deem safe. The authorities accepted our proposal but are yet to tell us where we should set up the tank. We have been visiting the civic body almost daily for the information, added Bibra.         
	With the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) sealing the water pipes, the Bibras have been buying drinking water and paying a man to fetch water from the roadside municipal tap.        
	There are other problems too. The entrance to the block has been dug up so that underground cables could be installed for supplying electricity to the upper floors.        
	Because of the ongoing work, the staircase that leads to the terrace remains dark. Mounds of rubbish also make the climb difficult. On the roof, Bibra pointed at the mobile towers. If tanks filled with water are hazardous, how could the mobile towers be allowed to remain? They are very heavy, he said.        
	Patience Traub, a UK resident who owns a flat in the block, said: The authorities keep saying that their primary aim is to rehabilitate us but how can one move back when there is no water.        
	Even if a plastic tank is installed, residents could find it difficult to fill it up since Stephen Court Ltd owns the Block III pump. We sought permission to operate the pump since its owners are absconding but CESC did not allow us to, said Bibra.         
	In desperation, residents of Block III had asked Block IV residents to provide them with water. They declined saying that a resident was operating his own pump in Block IV to draw water, added Bibra.        
	The long wait for things to be put into place is testing the patience of Block III residents. Every morning, I visit Stephen Court and wait, hoping something concrete would be done today. I was supposed to return to the UK some days back but had to extend my visa and stay back, said Patience.        
	Residents of Block IV who moved back in the first week of May have problems of their own.        
	We had been operating our own pump even before the fire. But we cannot do anything about the lift, which the authorities have prohibited us from using. Since I cannot walk, my children were worried about what would happen if I had to step out in an emergency. So I have shifted to their place, said Nimmi Johar, a Block IV resident who had moved back on May 3.         
	CMC director-general (buildings II) Debasis Kar, who is in charge of the work at Stephen Court, was not available for comment.

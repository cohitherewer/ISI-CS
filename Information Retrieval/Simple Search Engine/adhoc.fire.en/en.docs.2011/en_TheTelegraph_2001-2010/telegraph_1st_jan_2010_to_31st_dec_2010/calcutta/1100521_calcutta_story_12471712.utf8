          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three men were arrested on Thursday for allegedly trying to kidnap Bishnupur trader Ashok Mondal, 65, from outside an Alipore bank.         
	Police said Thakurpukur residents Pradip Singh, 37, Balai Sil, 32, and Barun Kumar Chanda, 52, had dragged Mondal into a taxi but the trader managed to alert a constable posted on Judges Court Road.        
	When the constable gave chase, the trio pushed Mondal out of the cab. They were arrested later, said an officer.         
	The police said the trio had learnt from a source that Mondal had sold off three cottahs of land for Rs 27 lakh recently. The three had snatched Rs 1 lakh from Mondal a month back, the officer said.

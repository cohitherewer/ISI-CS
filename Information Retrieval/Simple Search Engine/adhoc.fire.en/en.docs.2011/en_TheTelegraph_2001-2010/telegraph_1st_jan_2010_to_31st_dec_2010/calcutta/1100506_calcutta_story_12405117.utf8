The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Theatre therapy to soothe teen troubles
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Theatre therapy to soothe teen troubles
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                     Students of St Augustine School perform The Caucasian Chalk Circle; (above) a play by students of The Heritage School                                  
	A Class XII student of Apeejay School was asked to write a play on addictionand she came up with Addiction to Work, based on her own feelings of neglect at home while her parents pursued their careers.         
	Initially work for them was a necessity but it soon became an addiction. The play helped me express my feelings of neglect, of rejection. I felt better, says the girl. After the play was staged, many guardians came up and spoke to the teachers about how to set things right at home for their kids.         
	Dramatics is no longer just an SUPW (Socially Useful Productive Work) option. City schools are using the stage to address student issues and counsel troubled teens, be it combating parental pressure or rejection by the peer group.         
	Children find it easier to voice their emotions through drama, says Rita Chatterjee the principal of Apeejay School, where drama is compulsory for students of Class V and above.         
	The emphasis is on bringing to the fore thoughts and emotions that students would otherwise be reluctant to share. At Calcutta International School, drama is offered as a subject for the O level exams (classes IX-X). It will soon be included in the A levels (classes XI-XII) too.         
	Principal Anuradha Das says it is easier for adults to address issues like childrens trauma through dramatisation.         
	Their own problems take a back seat when they place themselves in other peoples shoes, she points out.         
	Schools are also waking up to the opportunity offered by dramatics to peek into the childs mind. Instead of addressing a childs psychological problems head-on, we project it as happening to other characters, says Chanda Dutt, an English teacher at St Augustine School who conducts drama classes.         
	Teachers have found drama particularly effective in dealing with the trauma of kids coming from broken homes.         
	A Class XII student of St Augustine School had scripted and staged a play questioning why adults become parents if they cannot take care of their children. The play was performed a couple of years ago, but students still identify with it. We have staged it on several occasions, said Richard Gasper, the academic inspector of the St Augustine Group of Schools.         
	At Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, a Class XI girl whose parents were filing for divorce had retreated into a shell. But she gradually opened up in drama class, first confiding her problem to her teacher and later even her friends.         
	Theatreperson Nivedita Bhattacharjee who conducts drama classes at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy feels dramatics work as a shared therapy.         
	Role play helps students realise that they are not alone, that their problems are not unique, she says.         
	At The Heritage School, drama lessons are held for classes V to IX for two hours a week, while at Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, the classes are scheduled twice a week for middle-school students.         
	Through role-play students are individually counselling themselves, identifying with the characters and learning how they overcome problems, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla.         
	Shri Shikshayatan School is planning to include drama in their co-curricular activities from June.         
	Rudraprasad Sengupta feels theatre provides liberation from the straight-jacketed models that schools train their students to follow. But he adds a word of caution.         
	Schools should not just pay lip service to drama therapy. It should be a holistic approach, involving teachers, parents and the school authorities, says Sengupta, the director of Nandikars Children Ensemble.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Idol makers date with Cup idols
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Idol makers date with Cup idols
  - Footballs famous five, some showing feet of clay, sculpted in fibreglass          MOHUA DAS                          Sunil Paul with Rooney, Messi and Kaka at his Kumartuli workshop on Sunday. (Amit Datta)                                        
	Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Thierry Henry may be showing feet of clay in South Africa but Calcutta would like its World Cup idols to be made of sterner stuff.        
	So fibreglass rather than fragile clay is Kumartulis material of choice for a giant tribute to the four under-performing soccer stars  along with the lone ranger Lionel Messi  as part of a Cup festival in town.        
	Artisan Sunil Paul and his assistants have been racing against time to complete the life-size likeness of the five soccer heroes, who are to be placed against a 15-foot ekchala inside a Deshapriya Park pandal complete with lights, likely to be from Chandernagore. The idols will be on display from July 6.        
	Unlike puja idols, we are not using clay because that would make them prone to damage if carried around. Fibreglass costs more but is also far tougher, Paul, 66, told Metro.         
	According to Paul, sculpting a real-life personality is not quite the same as making a puja idol. For a Durga idol, we depend on our imagination to give the face an expression, he explained.         
	Black-and-white close-ups of all five players dot the walls of the Kumartuli workshop, guiding the 20-member team of artisans trying to perfect each players expression and pose.         
	One small mistake and you could go totally wrong with the face, said Paul, smoothening out the rough edges on Kakas face.         
	The idols, with natural skin tones as in the wax models at Madame Tussauds, will be dressed in their team jerseys with a ball each at their feet.         
	This is not the first time that Paul is sculpting sporting idols. The first time I did something similar was in 1996, during the cricket World Cup. I made around 12 idols of players like Vivian Richards, Wasim Akram and Md Azharuddin with plaster of Paris, recalled Paul.

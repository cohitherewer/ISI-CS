          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A trip to Tarapith took a tragic turn for a 24-year-old student from Barasat who died after the car she was returning in with her mother and a family acquaintance met with an accident in Burdwan, near Ilambazar, on Thursday afternoon.        
	Tanusree Dutta, a BBA student at a private institute in Salt Lake Sector V, and the other injured were taken to a health centre in Panagarh, from where they were sent to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital after first-aid.        
	Family sources said Tanusree, who was on the front passenger seat, died at the medical college on Thursday night. Tanusrees mother Chhabi Dutta and family friend Amba Gupta, who were sitting at the back, were injured and are being treated at Kalpataru Hospital in Barasat.        
	Amba suffered spine injuries while Chhabi was injured in her head and chest. Hospital sources said the condition of both was stable. The driver, Raju, was also injured and admitted to hospital.        
	Family sources said the group had left their Salbagan home in Barasat for Tarapith in an Alto early on Thursday. They offered puja in the Kali temple in Tarapith and started for home around 2pm.        
	While the car was plying on National Highway 60, a vehicle hit it from behind. The driver of the car lost control and hit a truck in front.        
	Debesh Ganguly, the secretary of the residents association of the apartment block where the Duttas and the Guptas live, said: As soon as news of the mishap reached us, Tanusrees father Shekhar and a few local residents left for the spot. They reached Ilambazar in the evening and brought the injured to Barasat. Tanusrees body came on Friday after post-mortem.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Iftesham Chowdhury                                  
	A father who lost his daughter to corporal punishment pleaded with a city court on Monday to book the accused teacher for homicide under non-bailable sections of the Indian Penal Code.         
	Armed with a high court order passed in July 2009, Chowdhury Mansur Rahman moved three petitions before an Alipore court seeking justice for his daughter, Iftesham, who studied in Class II at Bidya Bharati Girls High School in Mominpore. The girl had died on November 27, 2008, after her yoga teacher allegedly slapped her in class.         
	In his first petition, Chowdhury pleaded with the court to start a case against yoga teacher Anita Das under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), a non-bailable section carrying a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.         
	After the girls death, police had charged the teacher with death due to negligence (Section 304A), a bailable offence punishable with up to two years in jail. Subsequently, Das had surrendered in court and got bail.        
	Das had allegedly slapped Iftesham so hard that her head had rammed against a wall. Das and other teachers of the school had allegedly forced the girl to do yoga even as she was crying in pain.         
	Later in the day, Iftesham had fallen unconscious in school and was admitted to hospital, where she died.        
	After Das got bail, Chowdhury and his wife Nazeen had approached the high court in April 2009. Justice Sanjib Banerjee had asked Ifteshams parents to lodge a case under Section 304 against the teacher in a lower court.         
	My client has sought cancellation of the accused teachers bail, said Tapas Bhanja, the lawyer appearing for Chowdhury.        
	In his second petition, Chowdhury said that some other teachers of the school, including the headmistress, should also be booked because they had allegedly forced his daughter to attend classes even though she had complained of severe headache after Das had slapped her.         
	In his third petition, Chowdhury requested the Alipore court administration to appoint a district sessions judge of the court to hear his cases because an ordinary judge does not have the authority to hear cases under Section 304.        
	An ordinary judge was hearing the case till now, but the high court has allowed my client to start a case against the teacher under Section 304. So my client requested that a district sessions judge be appointed to hear his cases, Bhanja said.        
	After hearing Chowdhurys petitions, the court appointed a district sessions judge to hear the cases.

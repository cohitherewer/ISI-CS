          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have failed to catch a sweeper who allegedly molested a young patient at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital on Friday. The incident came to light on Wednesday when a Trinamul-backed workers association submitted a charter to the college principal, demanding action against the accused and more security on the premises.         
	The sweeper, in his 30s, is an employee of an agency engaged by the hospital. Hospital sources said he had pulled a hand of the patient, in her 20s, while she was sleeping on Friday morning. The woman, a resident of Hooghly, was admitted to the female section of the medicine ward the day before with high temperature. The girl raised an alarm and the youth fled in the melee. He has not been seen in the hospital since Friday evening, said Utpal Dutta, the principal.         
	The girls family members submitted a written complaint to the principal on Saturday afternoon. We have lodged a complaint with Bowbazar police station, said Dutta.         
	A case has been lodged against the sweeper was all the police said on Wednesday.

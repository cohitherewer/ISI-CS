The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro move against Left bandh   Road, sky to be crippled
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro move against Left bandh     - Mamata out to prove a point, warns staff against joining shutdown          OUR BUREAU                          Action replay: The city awaits another forced shutdown on Monday                                        
	Mamata Banerjees Metro Railway could be the only public transport on the move in a bandh-hit Calcutta on Monday.        
	Metro sources said the authorities were pulling out all the stops to keep trains moving during the bandh, though the railway minister on Sunday asked Trinamul workers not to actively oppose the 12-hour shutdown  in the same breath as denouncing it  called by Left parties to protest the recent fuel price hike.        
	Senior officials are said to have warned the employees that staying away from work on Monday would invite disciplinary action. An official has told the employees that there might be a break in service if they dont turn up tomorrow. Its unprecedented, said a source.        
	The Metro Railway Workers Congress, backed by both the Congress and Trinamul, has hired pick-up vehicles for employees to ensure that all 213 trains the Metro runs on a weekday could roll on.        
	We have made arrangements for employees from outside Calcutta to put up with their colleagues in the city or spend the night at various stations. We had tried to maintain normal service during earlier bandhs, too, but this time we are taking extra measures so that commuters are not inconvenienced, said Tapas Mukherjee, the general secretary of the union.        
	Sources said the railway ministry under Mamata, who many believe is on the track to Writers Buildings, was determined to keep Metro moving to score a point against the ruling Left, which has finally got an issue to flex its muscles following a series of electoral debacles.        
	But if the city runs as usual underground, on the surface its feared to come to a standstill from 6am to 6pm.        
	Railway officials said suburban and long-distance trains would be affected while most flights scheduled to leave or arrive at Calcutta airport during the bandh stand cancelled.        
	A majority of buses, minibuses and taxis, too, would be off the road.                          
	We have made all plans to run trains but services will be affected if there are blockades. The RPF doesnt have the authority to remove squatters. We will approach the state administration if there are blockades, said a railway official.        
	Airline Operators Committee said 40 flights on Monday had been cancelled. Around 25 flights in the morning have been advanced before 6am, while the departure of 25 flights has been pushed beyond 6pm, Vijay Matta, a member of the committee said.        
	Air India said it would operate all its morning flights as schedule but some scheduled for the afternoon will be clubbed with those in the evening.        
	Even if Metro runs its trains, commuters will have a tough time reaching the stations as the bandh will cripple road transport. On a normal day, around 12,000 private and state-run buses and 35,000 taxis hit the road. On Monday, there will be hardly any.         
	We dont support the strike but are helpless as the Left Front has called it. We cant bring out our vehicles though we feel for the commuters. The transport network will be paralysed tomorrow, said Swarnakamal Saha, a Trinamul Congress MLA and key leader of the transport operators lobby.        
	Plying taxis on a bandh day is risky. We have reports that most of the taxis will stay off the road, said Tarak Nath Bari, of the Left-affiliated Calcutta Taxi Association which has around 14,000 members.

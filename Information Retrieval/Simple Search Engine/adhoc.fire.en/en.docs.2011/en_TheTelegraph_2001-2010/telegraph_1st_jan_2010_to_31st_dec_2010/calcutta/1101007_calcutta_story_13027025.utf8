                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      VC takes guard, students wait     - lsquo;I rsquo;m here to read the pitch rsquo;      MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          Students of Presidency University wait in vain for their first-vice chancellor to show up on Wednesday afternoon. Picture by Amit Datta                                              
	Presidency Universitys opening batsman strode out to the middle at 1.10pm on Wednesday to meet the state higher education minister and formally accept the vice-chancellorship.        
	Amita Chatterjee, 60, entered Bikash Bhavan a touch nervous, but that did not curb her footwork.        
	I have come to read the pitch as I gear up to take my stance as an opening batsman, she told Metro, carrying on with the cricket metaphor she had chosen in her first reaction to her selection on Tuesday.        
	The first vice-chancellor of the new university left her New Alipore residence around 11.30am on Wednesday for Salt Lake but  in what some might construe as hints and forebodings for her new role  got caught in terrible traffic snarls and reached after 1pm.        
	The Presidency alumnus, who has taught philosophy at Jadavpur University for 31 years, then rushed to meet minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri in his fifth floor chamber.        
	Did she feel the butterflies in her stomach the morning after? It has slowly started sinking in. I am still a little apprehensive, but excited at the opportunity of course, she said.        
	Chatterjee met the minister in his chamber for an hour from 1.15pm. When the photographers were called in, she greeted the flashbulbs with a nervous smile.                    Amita Chatterjee at Bikash Bhavan on Wednesday. (Amit Datta)      
	It will take some time getting used to all this attention, she later told Metro.        
	She has had to cope with the attention from around 3.15pm on Tuesday afternoon, 15 minutes after she received the fax informing her of her appointment to the hot seat.        
	There have been hundreds of phone calls and as many interviews and requests for interviews. Ive hardly had time for myself since this happened, said Chatterjee.        
	While entering Bikash Bhavan, when she approached one of the ground-floor elevators meant for regulars, officials came rushing to escort her to the VIP elevator.        
	She was a little hesitant and somewhat embarrassed. She greeted all of us with a smile, said an official of the education department.        
	At 2.15pm, Chatterjee was taken upstairs by Satish C. Tewary, the higher education secretary, for some paperwork to formalise her acceptance.        
	Did the minister have any tips to offer? We had a discussion on my role. He was quite helpful, she said.        
	An official of the department said Chatterjee was briefed on her new role and promised cooperation.        
	The minister, according to the official, heartily congratulated her for her selection and gave her a few pointers on her preliminary duties when she assumes office after the Puja vacations.        
	At 3pm, she was finally done for the day and looked a little tired. Asked if she would visit Presidency on the last class day before Mahalaya, she said: No. Not today, unfortunately. It is quite late and I have some engagements.        
	So Chatterjee would not be seated in the VCs chair before the first week of November, when the College Street campus reopens. She would be busy with conferences abroad between October 12 and 20.        
	Waiting for the VIP elevator on the fifth floor, she showed Metro her copy of the Presidency University Act 2010. I told you yesterday, my first job would be to read this thoroughly. That is exactly what I am going to do now, said Chatterjee.         
	I must familiarise myself with the Act before I do anything. These are the first steps with a new university. I must tread carefully, she added.        
	But what was her reading of the pitch on day zero of her big test? Its a good pitch. I liked it. Now I wait to face the first delivery, she smiled.

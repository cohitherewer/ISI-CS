	Mohammad Ali Park, better known for its traffic-stopping Durga puja, has got back its green cover. Renovated by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) at an approximate cost of Rs 60 lakh, the parks gates were thrown open on March 12.         
	The 40,000sqft ground has been split into three separate zones  a childrens corner covering 10,000sqft, a playground occupying 20,000sqft and another green enclosure of 10,000sqft. Ornamental iron railings have replaced the concrete half-walls, and the boundaries are paved with tiled pathways and benches.         
	The childrens corner has been done up with swings, slides, sea-saw and merry-go-round. We are waiting for the park to open. Despite living right across the road, I could never send my son to play in the park because it has always been a den of criminal activities, said Kinari Madani, a resident of Krishna Bihari Sen Street.         
	It remains open from 7am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm daily.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lights out at Writers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The first-floor corridor of Writers Buildings, where chief minister Buddahadeb Bhattacharjees secretariat is located, went without power for eight minutes on Wednesday evening.         
	Bhattacharjee was preparing to leave Writers for the day when the lights went out. The power returned two minutes before the chief minister took the lift to the ground floor at 5.15pm.         
	A CESC official said there was no disruption in supply. An official of the PWD, which is responsible for maintaining the state secretariat, declined comment. A Writers official said brief disruptions in power on the first-floor were common.

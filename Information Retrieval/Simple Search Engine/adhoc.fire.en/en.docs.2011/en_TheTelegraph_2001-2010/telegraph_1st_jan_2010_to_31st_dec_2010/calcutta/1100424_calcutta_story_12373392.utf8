The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Just do it on street illegal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Just do it on street illegal
            OUR BUREAU              City snapshots: where violation is a way of life            HAWKER HAVEN: Spot the Gariahat pavement if you can             CHOKED CHANNEL: The stretch opposite Metro cinema            WHEEL DEAL: Illegal parking in the city centre            BAN BOO: Two-stoke autos rule the road            SMOKESCREEN: Old and polluting buses            RIGHT OF WAY: Just another weekday rally at Esplanade                                
	Welcome to the city of street illegal  others envy and our pride.        
	Where else would you find an administration willing to not only condone but empower you to do whatever you want, be it through official sanction like the new, improved hawker policy or by simply turning a blind eye to every violation in the book?        
	Hawkers on the pavement, banned autorickshaws on the road, traffic-choker rallies at the city centre, puja pandals in front of your gate and tinderbox buildings across town  these are just a few of the illegal things about Calcutta that have acquired the de facto stamp of legality over the years.        
	Metro draws up a list of illegal things for the government to declare legal before the elections and earn a few more Brownie points from a city that seems to believe that whats wrong is whats right.              
	Legalise traffic violations: The citys traffic congestion  apart from the few Puja days when police show us that if they want they can  is bad enough, so why not a law legalising common traffic violations like jumping signals? It would surely be welcomed by every citizen in a hurry. It would also spare Lalbazar some boring paperwork, including the formality of sending a challan to the I-care-two-hoots-about-rules offender almost three months after the violation.        
	As and when the government comes up with such a law, honk to that.        
	Legalise jaywalking: The right to cross the road wherever and whenever is the Calcuttans birthright. Just raise your hand, stop the approaching vehicle in its tracks, give the driver a Dirty Harry glare if he dares bring the wheels too close to you and saunter/scurry across depending on your mood. Every Calcuttan thinks he/she is a traffic-stopper, laughs a cop on duty on Park Street.        
	So, just legalise jaywalking and dont bother what happens to those behind the wheel.        
	Legalise illegal floors: The citys illegal floors survived the Nandram disaster two years ago and can surely brave the Stephen Court blaze as well. Fire safety is important but think about all those people (read voters) who stand to lose their homes and shops if the government carries out its threat to demolish all illegal floors in town.        
	We suggest that the government instead strengthen municipal provisions that enable illegal floors to be added any time.        
	The government may also consider giving realtors specialising in floor additions a tax holiday. After all, they are the ones playing the lead role in the rise and rise of Calcutta.        
	Legalise polluting vehicles: If you are one of those who think that climate change is a canard spread by a handful of greens, you would surely appreciate a legislation banning protest against pollution (Metro has been guilty of that crime).        
	A few diseased lungs and asthmatic children arent a bigger issue than the livelihood and convenience of thousands of citizens disadvantaged by the ban on poison-spewing autos, buses and taxis.        
	 The government may consider inviting all two-stroke three-wheelers back to the streets as some of them are plying on the sly anyway. The cost-conscious Calcuttan can then go back to enjoying his Rs 6 ride on a two-stroke auto without his environment-friendly conscience pricking him. He was never happy with the swank, low-floor buses anyway. They hog so much road space and dont allow overcrowding.        
	Legalise latecoming: Writers Buildings may have rewritten its attendance rules last year but compliance has been nothing to write home about. Given the circumstances, the Left Front government could consider giving government employees back their freedom to be officially late for office as a pre-election gift. Such a step might even win back the support of the disgruntled Writers brigade, reflected in the dwindling employee attendance at political rallies organised by the ruling party.               
	Legalise littering: Calcuttans may profess to be the countrys most cultured people but we love to litter. There is a civic law that states that anybody caught littering, spitting, urinating or defecating in public is liable to be fined, though nobody bothers following or enforcing it. So why bother keeping such a law? Just do it, we say. As in all of the acts mentioned above.              
	Legalise filling up of water bodies: Its happening everywhere, so why the fig leaf? We suggest the government declares that the earth has too much water and too little land and so water bodies can easily be filled up and turned into housing complexes. After all, realty is the only booming business in town.        
	Legalise traffic-stopper rallies and Metro channel meetings: The police say these are illegal but they are helpless to stop them. Why even try? Let them be. Declare them legal. Like on many other counts, then let the matter drag on in court. Calcutta anyway has been reduced to a crawl, why feign the need for speed?        
	Legalise streetwalking: They are now everywhere. From Salt Lake to Southern Avenue, Park Street to Kankurgachhi. Often with police vans or jeeps as escorts. The government could consider giving them hawker-like, zone-specific identity cards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Royal salute for home-grown hero   Gentle giant of the greens
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Royal salute for home-grown hero     - Morning after, RCGC greens aglow with Arjun Atwals US PGA glory          SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY                                                        
	The morning after, the notice board at Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) said it all  Arjun Atwal, his arms spread wide, like the king of the world; Arjun Atwal cradling the trophy, like a boy with his precious toy; Arjun Atwals match statistics that won him the Wyndham Championship on the US PGA Tour.        
	The 181-year-old club famed for its fairways was basking in the triumph of its 37-year-old son of the soil on Tuesday. He started his golf here. It is a moment of great pride. He has put Calcutta, Bengal and RCGC on the world map. In America, they have announced that he is a product of RCGC, smiled club CEO M.M. Singh, after a round of golf.        
	The proudest, of course was H.S. Atwal, Bindi to friends at the club, after being up two nights on the trot  one to watch his son become the first Indian to win US PGA glory and the next to celebrate. Royal is where he grew up. His first tournament on the tour was the Indian Open, at RCGC, he told Metro, before leaving for Delhi. He was into cricket, hockey and football, but I told him to play golf, an individual game where it is all on your own merit and not on sifaarish. He practised hard and today he is where he is.                          
	Almost as proud with Arjuns achievement was Sheikh Jaan Mohammad, caddy to the Atwals on the Royal greens. I watched the whole game live from 11.30pm on Sunday. I was thrilled. Oto raate aar ki korbo, ekai lafachhilam barite (That late into the night, I was just jumping with joy alone at home), he smiled.        
	Sheikh Jaan Mohammad is a fan of Arjun the person. He is a rare human being, always so relaxed and jovial.... The course is closed on Monday, but I remember he once came on a Monday and played with friends like Gaurav Ghosh.        
	Royal loyalists old and young spoke of Indias latest sporting hero with fondness and pride. Ashit Luthra, the Indian Golf Union president, who watched the city boy play at RCGC during his growing-up years described Arjun as an outstanding player and one of the most calm people on the course, even under stress.        
	Arjuns poise on the putt is something that every youngester teeing off at the Royal would want to emulate. He is my favourite. He is so composed. I want to play like him some day, smiled Kunal Naidu, 11. Karan Bhuwalka, 14, in between bites of his sandwich after a round, marvelled at how Arjun had kept his composure to win the big one.        
	Luthra had the Kunals and Karans in mind when he said the robust junior programme at RCGC would get a big boost from Arjuns winning ways.        
	And the blue-eyed boy will return to a Royal reception. When he comes in November, we will have a felicitation for him and a big party. He came here last year, but this time will be very special, said CEO Singh.

	April is turning out to be the most fashionable month for Calcutta. And not just because of the IPL star parade passing through town.        
	The first two days of April were dedicated to Sabyasachi Mukherjees summer collection exhibited at 85 Lansdowne. Next up is Savoir Faire at Taj Bengal, a lifestyle exhibition held in association with t2 on April 6, followed by the third edition of Cherry Orchard in Hyatt Regency, also in association with t2 on April 10. The fashion fest will end with Dev R Nils new collection launch at 85 Lansdowne on April 13.        
	Shalini Nopany of 85 Lansdowne puts down the April attraction to a troika of reasons  summer weddings, excitement of ushering in new collections and putting together a wow wardrobe for a summer holiday. Add to that the Bengali New Year and thats reason enough for the city to go shop shop shop.        
	With Sabyasachis Rs 7,900 bait  the starting price tag to attract first-time Sabya buyers as well as bring back label loyalists  the city lapped up its favourite designers designs at the Hazra Road-Sarat Bose Road style stop. It was so crowded and the designer present himself was an added attraction, said shopper Nandita Burman, who dropped by at 85 Lansdowne to check out things and pick up a few.        
	The focus now shifts to a long list of outstation labels that the city is waiting to feast on. Earlier it was essential to travel to Delhi or Mumbai for Indian pret but now with these exhibitions coming to town, shopping is far more enjoyable, provided of course the collections are not six seasons old, says 30-year-old Shivani Agarwal, a resident of Wood Street and a label shopper.        
	The collection criterion is vital because the city is often perceived  and with some justification  as the dumping ground for dead stock. And so event organisers have asked the designers to bring current collections 2010 only.        
	After the first two editions of Cherry Orchard, we have realised that having big brands on the bouquet is not enough, relevant (read new) collections are more important, says Shradha Saraf, who along with Shilpi Goenka, has made the event happen in town.        
	Some of the countrys best labels will be on offer on April 6 and 10. Gauri Bajorias Savoir Faire will host Salvatore Ferragamo (its third visit to the city) and will also see Delhi designers Varun Bahl and Gaurav Gupta mix with Hyderabads Vinita Pittie.        
	Cherry Orchard will see Anuj Sharma and Nitin Bal Chauhans quirky creations mix with straight lines by Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna and the breeziness of Priyadarshini Rao juxtaposed with the sexiness of Rina Dhaka.                          
	Pricing is another key feature to make or break such a style show. Savoir Faires USP, says Gauri, is its competitive price tags.        
	Last time was more like our trial run for us. Unfortunately, we had some unreasonably priced pieces and the city rejected them immediately. This time, we have asked designers to think about Calcuttas price sensitivity, she adds.         
	To end the suddenly stylish phase, Dev R Nil will be displaying their new collection that they intended to show in the delayed Kolkata Fashion amp; Lifestyle Week on April 13. Its all about the summer bride so the timing is right, says the duo from Howrah.        
	With the city seeing so many starry summer statements on both ramp and rack, heres hoping that the style splash rubs off and we see a better-dressed Calcutta by fall-winter.

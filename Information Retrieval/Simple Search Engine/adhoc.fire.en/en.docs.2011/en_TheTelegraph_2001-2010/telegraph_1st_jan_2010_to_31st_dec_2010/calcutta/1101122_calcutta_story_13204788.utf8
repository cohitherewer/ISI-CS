          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	About 2,000 pool cars will stay off the road on Monday with the North 24-Parganas unit of the Pool Car Owners Syndicate, which has over 600 members, deciding to join the strike by the Bengal Car Pool Welfare Association.         
	The association members went off the road on Friday to protest the ban on ferrying children in unregistered Tata Magic, Tata Winger and Maruti Omni. The strike will continue on Monday.         
	Pool cars that operate between Patipukur and Barasat will not ply on Monday, said Sushanta Banerjee, the secretary of the association.         
	Our crackdown on illegal pool cars will continue, said transport minister Ranjit Kundu.        
	Most of our pool cars are of the type that have been banned. We want the minister to give us some time, said a member of the syndicate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | We love Puja, but... hate   the last  lap   to it
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      We love Puja, but... hate   the last  lap   to it
          We cant stay away from the city during the five festive days. But we wish we could have run away for a few weeks while Calcutta geared up to welcome the Goddess and her brood. Metro draws up a list of pre-Puja peeves that made us go Grrrrrr!                                     
	Traffic trauma              
	Almost a month before the voice of Birendrakrishna Bhadra on AIR heralds Devipaksha, we become acutely aware of Durgas impending journey to earth. Thats because our journeys across town come to a grinding halt.        
	The first slowdown sign? Bamboo frames of pandals that crop up almost overnight, narrowing Calcuttas slim streets to size-zero passageways. Then the shoppers come out, first in twos and threes, in the evenings and on weekends, till its raining people on the streets of Calcutta, at any given time of day.         
	Asked about the worst-hit part of town ahead of Puja, Calcutta chorused: Kasba to Gariahat. Regular commuters on the stretch say earlier the traffic jam would start from the Cornfield Road intersection and continue into Bijon Setu. Now the queue of vehicles reaches Bosepukur. It takes me 30 to 45 minutes to reach Ballygunge from Bosepukur now. I would earlier cross the stretch in eight to 10 minutes, rued Chaitali Chatterjee, 29.         
	Negotiating Gariahat is a feat in itself. Every day when I go to college or return home, I shudder to think that I have to cross Gariahat, said Samadrita Sengupta, a student of Presidency College, who lives in Bakultala on the EM Bypass-Rashbehari connector.         
	Police pinned the blame on a dug-up stretch near Gariahat. Almost half the road on both flanks has been dug by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, said a traffic cop.         
	Dug-up or not, its much the same slowdown story across town. Theres a mandatory halt of at least 15 minutes at the Shyambazar five-point crossing, the Sealdah flyover will make you crawl and the devil help you  the gods have surely failed  if you need to cross Elgin Road or South City Mall, particularly after sundown.        
	Pre-Puja commuting is a drain on your wallet too  and were not even going into the time-is-money thing here. If the huge bill you run up every time you hop into a cab, thanks to the waiting time and road diversions, is a bother, the auto-cracy of the three-wheeler is galling. On the Rashbehari-Gariahat stretch, the Rs 5 fare becomes anything between Rs 8 and Rs 15. On the Gariahat-Jadavpur 8B route, be ready to shell out Rs 10 to Rs 15 instead of the usual Rs 6.        
	Add to that the heightened honking as everyone wants to go somewhere in a hurry and gets nowhere and you have every reason to turn a deaf ear to the festive run-up.        
	Pavement peril        
	Puja proves Adidas right: impossible is nothing. Just when you thought that you couldnt possibly gripe any more about the citys pavements  or the lack of them  you realise how acutely you miss whatever sliver of sidewalk was available to you. Take the road in front of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation that leads to New Market. Cars are not allowed on this stretch near New Market because the pavement has disappeared under hawkers and the deluge of shoppers has to jostle down the carriageway.         
	Every 10-15 minutes, the Metro disgorges a sea of bodies at Esplanade and a Leviathan creature seems to rise from the depths to envelop the poor pedestrian in its sweaty folds.        
	The crowd squeezed me against this woman and her oily bun kept rubbing in my face. I almost gagged and somehow managed to turn right towards Sreeram Arcade, said an angry Piyali Chatterjee.         
	At Gariahat, its against the law to take the pavement if you are not a Puja shopper. At least thats what the hawkers would have you believe. On the pavement near the Anandamela crossing, a girl was seen frantically trying to elbow her way out of the crowd, then bursting into tears.        
	Metro madness        
	Stranded on the road, elbowed off the pavement and robbed by the auto driver, the harried Calcutta commuter thinks its safe to duck underground. Despite its recent snag-tainted past, the Metro Railway remains our best bet. Or so you think.        
	The Metro compartments, already overcrowded since the extended route became functional last year, are ready to burst, particularly as one approaches the city centre.         
	Before Puja, the maximum rush is seen in the afternoon and evening. Last Monday, the afternoon-evening footfall was around 3lakh. It is between 2lakh and 2.5lakh around that time of day the rest of the year, said a Metro official.         
	As the doors slide open, the mad scramble to get in and out at the same time resembles a free-for-all wrestling bout with no Commonwealth medal to play for. The tussle also means the doors close late, the train leaves late and the chain reaction upsets the entire Metro schedule. Then theres the suffocation, the pushing and shoving, the stench and, above all, the anonymous asura in jeans and tee: the molester-on-the-prowl.        
	If only we could stay home.        
	Parking woe        
	If you think its smooth sailing for those driving around, just think traffic snarls, parking perils and descendants of Dracula as parking attendants. They not only refuse to return the balance but also demand a hefty tip with a growl that goes, Pujor aagey kichhu deben na, naki? grumbled Sweta Chakraborty, a resident of Southern Avenue and a victim of ruthless parking attendants in Gariahat last week.         
	At New Market, the minimum is Rs 20 before Puja, up from Rs 10 the rest of the year. We dont have any extra earnings. How will we manage our festival expenses unless people like you pay up? barked an attendant on AJC Bose Road when asked why he was pocketing the change.        
	Gift grumble        
	Whats Durga puja without new clothes? Much of the thrill of Pujo ashchhe hinged on the arrival of new clothes from aunts, uncles and grandparents. How we loved to sift through our Puja spoils and agonise over what to wear on each of the five festive days. Then we grew up and the tables turned. Yesterdays recipient has become todays giver and more often than not, hes going to the store kicking and screaming.        
	I hate buying clothes for myself, let alone for people I have barely met twice in my life. But my wife drags me to store after store to buy gifts for her entire clan! Do I look like I have a gold mine? cribbed Patuli resident Sankar Ghosh (name changed on compassionate grounds).        
	The worst are the years when you land your first job or tie the knot. My mother-in-law has hinted that we must buy four shirts and seven saris for the extended family this Puja. And they must be top quality to reflect her sons status. If shes so keen, why didnt she produce a top quality son, I wonder, muttered a pretty young Metro commuter to her friend, struggling with shopping bags from designer stores that didnt seem to hold either saris or shirts.        
	Chanda trouble        
	Burning a bigger hole in our fast-emptying pockets is the stream of chanda-seekers. And every one of them is apnar parar pujo, boudi.        
	The faces may wear a smile but the tone says it all: Chanda na diley pujo ta hobe ki kore? We want to snap back, but we gulp down our grumble and meekly reach out for the wallet.         
	If you are a new homeowner, youre easy meat for the chanda hounds. Theres a puja opposite our new building. The organisers have demanded Rs 10,000 from each flat. When we said we would discuss the matter at our building committee meeting and decide on the amount, the leader of the looters said: Whatever amount you decide on, remember that it shouldnt be unacceptable to us! fumed a resident of Hazra Road.        
	The worst part? The goons know they can get away with it. In the name of the Devi, of course.

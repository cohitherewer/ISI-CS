The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Repair boost for markets
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Repair boost for markets
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has decided to allow tenants to repair an unsafe market complex or katra without the owners consent if there is a consensus among themselves.        
	If the traders in an unsafe market come together with a proposal for a major repair work such as recasting the roof, reconstructing a staircase or creating an underground reservoir for firefighting, the civic authorities will allow them to do so.        
	According to civic records. there are about 3,000 unsafe market complexes in the city with at least 50,000 tenants. More than 2,000 of the markets are in north and central Calcutta.        
	For public safety, we have decided to allow the tenants to take up major repairs on their own if the landlords are reluctant to give their consent, mayor Sovan Chatterjee said.        
	In an old city like Calcutta, most of the market buildings are nearly a century old. The CMC can at best put up an Unsafe Building board in front of such markets. But that does not deter thousands of shoppers from visiting the unsafe buildings daily. Incidents of fire are frequent, the mayor added.        
	Director-general (building) Debasis Kar said the roofs and staircases of most of the private markets are in a poor state. The owners are not keen on repairing them mainly because of low rent. If a landlord comes forward with a proposal for reconstruction, the CMC will offer them incentives, such as extra floor space, said Kar.

	It was the first big performance on stage for many, but these young ones showed little signs of nervousness. They enjoyed enacting parts from the Panchatantra Tales or reciting their favourite poems before a large cheering audience, while proud parents clicked them in action.         
	The event was the junior fest, Abhivyakti, organised by Delhi Public School-Ruby Park at their primary school building on November 26.

	The contests included sit-and-draw, clay-modelling, recitation and story-telling.         
	The theme of the story-telling session was Panchatantra Tales. Teams from each school had to narrate and enact a part from the book.         
	In the sit-and-draw and clay-modelling events, the children were asked to create anything they fancied. Most chose to draw a festive scene or landscape. The clay models were mostly of animals and birds.

	The quiz club of La Martiniere for Girls organised an inter-school competition last month as part of their 175th anniversary celebrations. Twenty schools participated in the preliminary rounds.         
	The finalists included Birla High for Boys, St James, La Martiniere for Girls, Delhi Public School-New Town, La Martiniere for Boys, Don Bosco-Park Circus and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.         
	A new quizzing format  Infinite Bounds  was followed in this event. All the teams sat in a semi-circle on the dais and the questions went round either in the clockwise or the anti-clockwise direction.         
	There were no theme rounds. All questions tested the general knowledge of participants based on audio and visual clips.        
	Quizmaster Charanpreet Singh managed to keep the mood exciting yet tense. The first half of the quiz went clockwise and the second half anti-clockwise, with 22 questions being asked in each round.         
	Packed in between was a special visual round. Young girls from the All Bengals Women Union performed on stage and participants were asked questions on what they saw.         
	Birla High School for Boys got off to a promising start in the first half, but in the anti-clockwise round they went neck-to-neck with St James School.         
	We started catching up in the anti-clockwise round. We knew answers to most of the questions, said 16-year-old Addway Bandopadhyay of St James.         
	I think the quiz was tough, but we rose to the challenge, felt Aritrik Das of The Heritage.         
	In the end, it was a tie-breaker that clinched the quiz for Birla High for Boys.         
	The second round was more challenging for us, but we kept a cool head and thats what got us through, said Siddhant Agarwal, who along with teammates Kartikeyi Desai and Varun Dalmia, was awarded the winners trophy.

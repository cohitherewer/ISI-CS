The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Collision close call on runway
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Collision close call on runway
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A tragedy was barely averted at Calcutta airport on Monday morning when the pilot of a plane cleared for landing spotted another aircraft on the runway and did a go-around.         
	Airport sources said a Jet Airways plane carrying 154 passengers from Bangkok was approaching the airport for landing around 10.35am when the pilot noticed the other aircraft about to taxi for take-off from the same runway. In a split-second decision, the pilot aborted landing and remained airborne till the other aircraft took off. It was a close call, an official said.        
	The aircraft readying for take-off was Air Indias Calcutta-Delhi-London flight with 75 passengers on board. An inquiry has been ordered.        
	The Air India flight was supposed to have taken off before the Jet Airways plane landed. The Air India pilot admitted to a slight delay after getting clearance, sources said.        
	But an Air India official insisted that the delay was marginal. The flight was given clearance for take-off at 10.30am and was airborne at 10.38am.

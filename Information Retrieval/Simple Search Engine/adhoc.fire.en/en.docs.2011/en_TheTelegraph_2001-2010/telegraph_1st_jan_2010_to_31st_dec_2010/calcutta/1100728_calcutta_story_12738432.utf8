The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tutors protest census rule
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tutors protest census rule
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Schoolteachers enrolled as census enumerators for the city walked out of a training session on Tuesday after being told that the headcount would have to be conducted beyond school hours.        
	The session, conducted by Calcutta Municipal Corporation officials and attended by around 300 teachers, was held at Town Hall. The teachers rose to their feet in protest, and some walked out, when the civic officials announced that they could not skip classes for the census duty.        
	How can we work beyond school hours? Many of us come from the outskirts. Besides, female teachers will feel unsafe if they are asked to conduct census in the evening, said Ashoktaru Mukherjee, an agitating teacher.        
	Mukherjee demanded that the teachers enrolled for census be relieved of school duty and urged the civic officials to talk to head-teachers and make necessary arrangements.        
	Civic officials, however, stuck to their stand, citing census rules.        
	Election commission rules state enumeration work will be treated as additional duty.... If any teacher does not turn up for enumeration without approval, an FIR will be lodged against him/her, said joint municipal commissioner Saidul Islam, who was present at the training programme.        
	This is the first time the national census authorities have made the CMC the nodal authority for the city.        
	An enumerator on an average has to visit around 150 households and submit the data within a month of starting work. They will be paid a remuneration of Rs 600.

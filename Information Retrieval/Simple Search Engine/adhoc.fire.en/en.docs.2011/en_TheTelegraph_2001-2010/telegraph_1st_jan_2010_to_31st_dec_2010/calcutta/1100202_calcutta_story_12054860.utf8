The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Warmer days rob winter nip 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Warmer days rob winter nip 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The average daytime temperature in the city is likely to continue its upward climb over the next 48 hours.        
	The current conditions would persist for at least two days. The temperatures are likely to rise a little. The cold feeling will be missed in the first half of this week, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The minimum temperature on Monday was a degree below normal at 14.1 degrees Celsius, while the maximum was a notch above normal at 28.8 degrees Celsius.        
	The clue to the missing nip in the air, however, lay in the bright sunshine, the low humidity  which fell to 26 per cent  and weak wind flow.        
	According to the weatherman, the temperature ranged between 23 degrees Celsius and 28 degrees Celsius for most of the day. A couple of weeks ago, the temperature had been hovering between 18 degrees Celsius and 23 degrees Celsius for the major part of the day.        
	Though the cold, dry northwesterlies are still prevalent over the Indo-Gangetic plains in lower levels, they arent strong enough to restore the nip to Calcutta, as of now, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Delhi.        
	The northwesterly wind-flow over the Indo-Gangetic plains is likely to intensify from Wednesday, restoring some chill, added the official.        
	However, winter is not over yet. According to a senior scientist of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida, Calcutta still has at least three weeks of winter left and there are hopes of a dip in the mercury.        
	Winter is very likely to stay till around February 20. A strong western disturbance or a low-pressure formation could radically alter the ongoing conditions, to usher in a fresh cold phase, he told Metro.

	Students seeking to pursue overseas courses thronged the American Center on September 26 to attend the US University Fair.         
	Organised by the Council of International Schools (CIS), in collaboration with the United States India Educational Foundation (Usief), the fair saw representatives from 29 American institutions, including Pennsylvania State University, NorthWestern University, Tufts University and Brandeis University.         
	These universities wanted to interact with the students and help them select the right course. Then, we can follow it up over email, explained Jessica Ricker, the associate director of admission, Connecticut College, and the tour leader of CIS.         
	We are also providing students with financial help, based on their need and merit, she added.         
	I wanted to inquire about the SAT requirements and the importance of its score. I will be taking SAT this year so that I can concentrate on my board exam next year, said Aniket De, a Class XI student of Delhi Public School, New Town. He wants to pursue liberal arts in the US.         
	Other hot picks for city students were biophysics and biomedical and courses that offer placement opportunities.         
	Universities also tried to bust common myths about studying in the US. So many students ask about the importance of SAT scores. The score is taken into consideration partially but we pay more importance to school performance. We have a huge response from India, second only to China, said Mary Adams, associate director, Penn State University.         
	The team will travel to Delhi, Dehra Dun, Mumbai, Bangalore over the next two weeks.

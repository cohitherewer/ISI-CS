	Calcutta University wants police to investigate how a trunk containing Part III question papers was taken from Domjur police station to a state JEE centre in Andul, Howrah, and its lock broken open on Sunday.        
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das wrote to the director-general of police on Monday urging cops to be more careful while handling university question papers kept at various police stations.         
	The BA, BSc and BCom Part III exams of the university, which started on Tuesday, would have had to be deferred had the sealed packets containing the question papers been opened at Gramya Hitakari Girls School, the JEE centre, said a university official.

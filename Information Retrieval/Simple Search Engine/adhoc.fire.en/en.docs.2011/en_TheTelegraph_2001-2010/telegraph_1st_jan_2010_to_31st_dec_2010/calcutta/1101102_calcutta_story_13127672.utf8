The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girl assaulted over bag check
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girl assaulted over bag check
                              
	Nisha Elizabeth Gregory, 28, was on her way back to Delhi on Sunday after spending a week at home when she was humiliated, assaulted and arrested by police officers manning Jatin Das Park Metro station. Her crime? Demanding that her bag be checked by a woman and then protesting the harassment by the gang in uniform.        
	The 28-year-old resident of Mominpore, who hails from Kerala and now works for an NGO in Delhi, narrated her horror story to Metro:        
	At the entrance to the station, around 2.30pm, a policeman was about to check my bags when I told him that I had some personal items so it would be better if a lady officer ran the check. The policemen started shouting at me for daring to teach them their job.        
	I was scared and also did not want to get late for my flight at 5.30pm. So I allowed the men to check my bags and went in.        
	At the security check-point, a man in uniform asked me to open the bags and again I requested for a lady officer.        
	The man started shouting at me and then one of the three women officers sitting there stepped forward. She went through my bags and when she was done, I asked if I could go in. But then a lady in a red sari said that I could go nowhere till she checked my bags.        
	I protested. I told them that I had been subjected to three checks already and that they should have proper scanners in place if they wanted to check luggage like this.        
	I started to move through the metal detector frames when the lady in the red sari grabbed my bag, pulled me towards her and slapped me. I instinctively swung my bag to protect myself and before I knew it all three women had pounced on me.        
	I was dragged to the floor by my hair.        
	When my mother (Leepamma), father (Gregory Antony) and brother (Nibin, a second-year student of St Xaviers College), tried to intervene, they too were attacked. My brother was hit with a stick and dragged along the floor to an office room. I heard one of the cops saying take him away from the security camera.        
	I kept shouting at them to let my brother go but they said this was how criminals were treated. I kept asking them what crime I had committed but they kept abusing us and hitting us. They hurled racial and religious abuse at us.        
	The torture went on and on till all four of us were dragged up the stairs and pushed into a waiting police van.        
	We were taken to Bhowanipore police station where more torment awaited us. One of the cops from the station, Sangeeta Mahato, filed a complaint against me for kicking her in the stomach when she was four months pregnant.        
	I kept telling them that I was the victim of police brutality for no fault of mine but no one paid any attention to my pleas. I was not allowed to file a complaint either.        
	I could see my father, who is asthmatic, struggling to breathe and my brother in pain. I was helpless.        
	Help arrived in the form of a Congress leader from our locality, Saiyad Imtiaz Ahmed, who hired a lawyer and arranged for my bail. That was around 7.30pm.        
	I was numb.        
	I had to go to Alipore court on Monday to sign my bail bond for a fine of Rs 800.        
	I have never felt so humiliated and helpless. Ive been born and brought up in this city. This is my home and I always speak so highly of it. But this is where I was assaulted and treated like a criminal on Sunday. Why?        
	Nisha and her family met government under-secretary Tanmoy Chakraborty, and the assistant commissioner of police, Sujit Mitra, and were granted a patient hearing.        
	But when Metro contacted Pratyush Ghosh, the chief public relations officer of Metro Railway, he said: She had asked for a lady officer to check her bag but she was in the bathroom. Then she and her brother lost their cool and hit the on-duty policewoman. We have video footage which we will check on Tuesday.        
	Nisha will register a complaint at Lalbazar on Tuesday, for which she has deferred her departure for Delhi.                    CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

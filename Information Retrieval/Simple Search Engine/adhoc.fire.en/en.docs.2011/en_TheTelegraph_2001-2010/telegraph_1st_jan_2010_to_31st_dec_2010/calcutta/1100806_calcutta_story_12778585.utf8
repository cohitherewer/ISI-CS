The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City centre stopathon
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City centre stopathon
          A STAFF REPORTER                       The Esplanade crossing clogged by an SUCI rally. (Pradip Sanyal                          
	Trinamuls martyrs day or SUCIs memorial day, the one thing constant in the life of the Calcutta commuter is the traffic-stopper rally.        
	A 4,000-strong crowd of Suci supporters did on Thursday afternoon what a Trinamul turnout estimated to be 400 times larger had done a fortnight ago  throw traffic haywire from the heart of the city down to its arteries from 3pm till 6pm.        
	If the rally on Rani Rashmoni Avenue paralysed the city centre, over 1,500 cars headed for a function-cum exhibition at Taj Bengal around the same time brought traffic to a standstill on Belvedere Road near Alipore. A burst of heavy rain in parts and drizzle elsewhere compounded the stranded commuters misery.        
	If a thoroughfare like Rani Rashmoni Avenue is cut off during rush hour, you can imagine the pressure on all other roads adjoining the Esplanade area, the deputy commissioner of traffic police, Dilip Banerjee, told Metro.        
	SUCI supporters took over both the Howrah and Esplanade-bound flanks of the road, seemingly determined to match the disruption quotient of Mamata Banerjees July 21 show of strength. The instant snarls caught the cops off guard, who were then forced to divert vehicles through the narrow New Road to Mayo Road before re-routing them towards Dalhousie.        
	Vehicles heading for Esplanade and Central Avenue were diverted down Esplanade Row East. The result was a ceaseless crawl of cars, buses and mini buses mostly filled with commuters returning home from work. The ripple effect was from the Moulali crossing till Bhowanipore.         
	SUCI leaders offered the usual lame excuse about the rally being an annual affair meant to foster unity. We commemorate the death anniversary of our founding general secretary Shibdas Ghosh as memorial day, said Amitabha Chatterjee, a member of the SUCI state committee.        
	But why choose a thoroughfare to hold a rally? We would have held the event on the Maidan. But it has been raining and the grass is wet, said a leader standing near the dais.        
	Pradip Ranjan Chowdhury, a 57-year-old employee of All India Radio, said the SUCI supporters didnt leave space even to walk to the Esplanade Metro station. I tried to weave my way through the crowd but felt so suffocated that I turned back, he said.

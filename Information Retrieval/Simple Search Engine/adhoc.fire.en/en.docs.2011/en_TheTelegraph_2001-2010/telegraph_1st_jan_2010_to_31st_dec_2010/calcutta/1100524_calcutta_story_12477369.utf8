The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Witnesses ignore fire probe panel 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Witnesses ignore fire probe panel 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The commission probing the Stephen Court tragedy is still waiting for a witness to describe how the blaze that killed 43 in the Park Street address two months ago spread.         
	Eight people have appeared before the 12-member commission so far but none of them had anything to say about the fire.        
	According to sources, seven of those who had deposed before the panel were from the fire services department. They spoke about problems in the department. The eighth witness expressed concern over the cellphone towers atop Stephen Court.        
	Despite the scale of the tragedy, no one has bothered to appear before the commission and say what he or she had seen on the day. A witness account is crucial, said a member of the commission, which comprises cops, firemen and officials of the civic body and other agencies.         
	Those who want to make a deposition before the commission can do so at the deputy commissioner (south)s office on Park Street on Monday, added the member.        
	The state government had set up the committee to probe the tragedy six days after the blaze. On April 13, the committee had sought witness accounts on the tragedy. Advertisements were published asking witnesses to turn up at the committees office at Jal Sampad Bhawan in Salt Lake.        
	Hundreds of people were in the building when it caught fire and most of them survived. The panel believes they can shed light on the origin and nature of the blaze.               
	The committee is expected to submit its report to the government on June 14.

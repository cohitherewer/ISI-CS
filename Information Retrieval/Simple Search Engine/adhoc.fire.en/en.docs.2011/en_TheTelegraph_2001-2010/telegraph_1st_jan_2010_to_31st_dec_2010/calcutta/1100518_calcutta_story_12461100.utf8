The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The fine formula of math as magic 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          The fine formula of math as magic 
  - BRAINTEASERS? A PIECE OF CAKE          SEBANTI SARKAR                          Enthusiasts of science take a look at the exhibits at BITM rsquo;s new math gallery                        
	Math-haters, be warned. Colourful polyhedrons, musical notes and even Mona Lisa are here to woo you to algebraic formulae, geometric theorems, statistics and calculus at the new mathematics gallery of Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM).         
	Making the academic syllabus meaningful and exciting has always been our aim. The exhibits are designed to convey the inherent order and structural beauty of mathematics that exists in all things around us, said BITM director E. Islam.         
	A former student whom the museum had converted to a lover of science and math was back to inaugurate the exhibition on May 8. Jawhar Sircar, secretary, Union ministry of culture, recalled how BITMs exhibits had opened his eyes. A very impressed math teacher, Poonam Teckchandani, said: Children sit up whenever we use paper-cut models. They will love this gallery.         
	Kojagori Chowdhury, a Class VIII student of Bethune School, was busy with the wooden and fibreglass brainteasers. Kedar Ishan Raman of Poddar Academy, Mumbai, beamed: If math classes were like this, scoring As would be a piece of cake.         
	The history of numbers and number systems, including the use of zero in India ahead of the Christian era by Aryabhatta in 498AD occupies pride of place in the 300 sq-m gallery.         
	Math kits and an electronic smart board make the Math Demo Corner ideal for guardians, teachers and children to get together for interactions. Though the target age group is 10-15 years, everyone will find it interesting, promised curator S. Das.         
	Students inclined to science, but who dont get a chance to brew a real chemical reaction in the lab may opt for the new range of CDs from BITM or sign up for the summer hobby camps from May 21 to June 5.         
	The Virtual Lab CDs guide users step by step through zoology and chemistry experiments, complete with beakers, burners and microscopes. The programme, designed for classes XI and XII, not only points out mistakes but has questionnaires too. Areas covered include salt analysis, chemical kinetics, common gases, titration, electrochemistry, food chemistry, identification of biological specimens and slide preparation.        
	The camps, for classes VI to XII, are in morning and afternoon sessions for physics, math, chemistry, life science, geography and assembling computers. Participants can try out various experiments they only read about or star-gaze through the telescope.

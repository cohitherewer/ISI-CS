The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Zoo set to lose jumbo trio
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Zoo set to lose jumbo trio
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          GOING, GOING... Alipore Zoos elephant enclosure could soon be empty                                   
	A central circular that says zoos are not for jumbos has triggered a heavy-duty debate between animal rights activists rejoicing at and forest officials resisting the imminent departure of the citys gentlest, and most-loved, trio of giants.        
	Elephants Mumtaz, Uttara and Phulwanti  the pride of Alipore Zoo  are soon to be shifted out of their enclosure and moved to a national park or a reserve forest far from home in accordance with the Central Zoo Authoritys notice.        
	As wildlife activists chant more power to elephant freedom, officials at the city zoo have raised doubts over whether Mumtaz, Uttara and Phulwanti can be safely transported and released in an alien  and hostile  habitat. A possible impact on footfalls in a zoo without elephants is also not far from their minds.        
	The Central Zoo Authoritys circular is a major policy decision that will impact the future of elephants in the country. We are surprised that such a big decision was taken without consulting us, said a senior official of the forest department.         
	The circular states that large animals, especially elephants, should be shifted to national parks with immediate effect so that they can move about freely. A zoo environment is very restrictive for such animals, it adds.        
	Raju Das, the director of Alipore Zoo, confirmed that the forest department had received the circular but wouldnt say when Mumtaz, Uttara and Phulwanti would be shifted from their home of more than a decade. Deliberations are on among forest officials, he added.         
	While the zoo authorities are not looking for a jumbo jet yet, official sources admitted that they would have no choice but to abide by the circular once other zoos start shifting their elephants.        
	Transporting an adult elephant  the Asian species weigh 3,000-5,000kg and can grow up to 20ft  would be no easy task given the difficulty officials faced while bringing a four-month-old calf rescued from West Midnapore to Alipore for treatment last Tuesday.         
	The zoo authorities had to work through the night to construct a four-foot ramp so that the baby elephant could be brought down from the vehicle. All three elephants at the zoo are almost 20ft tall. What if one of them is seriously injured while being transported? asked an official.         
	As and when Mumtaz, Uttara and Phulwanti leave, the zookeepers are not the only ones who will be saying adieu with a heavy heart.        
	Two-year-old Dhun from VIP Road, who learnt to say eseemet for elephant after seeing the trio during his first visit to the zoo last month, would be heartbroken.        
	Most animals have been banned from the circus. If elephants are also removed from the zoo, where will children get their first glimpse of wildlife? Not every parent can take his kid to a national park to see an elephant, said Vishnu Agarwal, who takes his eight-year-old son Yash to the zoo at least once a month.        
	The zoo broke its previous footfall record during the last Christmas-New Years Eve week, and Mumtaz, Uttara and Phulwanti could take a jumbo share of the credit.        
	Wildlife activist Mrinal Chatterjee said the decision to shift elephants out of zoos had come not a day too soon. The space here is insufficient for three full-grown elephants.

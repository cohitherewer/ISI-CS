                The additional chief judicial magistrate of the Uluberia court on Monday sent Sheikh Qutubuddin, a Howrah trader, to judicial custody for a month for refusing to pay maintenance to his children. The trader and his wife remarried after separating from each other in 2006 and stopped looking after their kids Karisma Khatun, 15, and Sheikh Zayeduddin, 14. The children had moved the court, which in 2009 had asked the trader to pay them Rs 5,000 per month as maintenance and Rs 80,000 as compensation.     Sumita Oraon, in her late 30s, and her daughter Soma, 19, were arrested on Monday for allegedly levelling false molestation charges against vanrickshaw-puller Ganesh Roy, 42, who committed suicide. Police said Roy had pushed aside the women when they came in the path of his van-rickshaw on Sunday. After being accused of molestation by the two, he committed suicide on Monday morning.    Trams will not ply on busy roads during Puja to avoid the risk of accidents. This was decided at a pre-Puja meeting of police, the fire services, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and CESC at the civic headquarters on Monday.    Four persons were injured when the driver of a car lost control of the vehicle and rammed into them on Jessore Road, near the airport, on Monday. They were taken to hospital. The driver was arrested.

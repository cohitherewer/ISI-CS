The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Campus rule to rule out cane
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Campus rule to rule out cane
  - La Martinieres new rein on teachers        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Corporal punishment in all its forms will now be classified as major misconduct in the La Martiniere schools.        
	The board of governors of La Martiniere on Friday announced that they had amended the Staff Service Rules to ban corporal punishment, physical punishment and mental harassment and award major penalties for anyone found violating the code.        
	The board felt the need to change the service rules to keep up with the times, announced Lt-Gen. John Mukherjee, a member of the board.        
	The announcement came four days after principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi had admitted to The Telegraph that using the cane on the boys  including Rouvanjit Rawla, who was found hanging at his Alipore home on February 12  was a mistake and would never be repeated on campus.        
	The earlier Service Rules, of which Metro has a copy, did not differentiate between minor or major misconduct and only had minor and major penalties.        
	Corporal punishment was part of a 36-item long list of acts of omission and/or commission to be treated as misconduct but without specifying major or minor offence. The new service rules should effectively end the use of the cane at the 11, Loudon Street campus (see below).        
	From now anyone using corporal punishment will be construed to have committed a major violation of the rules and will be awarded major penalties, said Mukherjee.        
	The change comes on the heels of the circular sent out by the Church of North India to all 30 schools under it banning corporal punishment.        
	All the schools will have to work out a code of conduct now that the Diocese has sent out a circular. After all this (the controversy that La Martiniere for Boys finds itself in over the death of the Class VIII boy), we do not want a repeat of the mistake, said Terrence Ireland, the principal of St James School.        
	But will any of the major penalties now spelt out  from suspension to reduction in rank to removal from service  apply to the principal of La Martiniere for Boys?        
	No they wont, the schools board of governors made it clear on Friday.        
	The team from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights probing the circumstances leading to the death of Rouvanjit, had said that it would recommend in its report that the principal be suspended pending police investigation.        
	The principal has already apologised for his mistake and he is co-operating fully with all the ongoing investigations. There is no reason to suspend him, said Mukherjee.        
	The board, he added, had already warned Chakravarthi for using the cane. You cannot change an award (of punishment) after it is already given unless directed by the court of law, said Mukherjee.        
	A committee will be formed within 10 days to draw up a code of conduct or ethics that will be applicable to the teachers of the school. The team will comprise two board members  David Howard, the secretary of the St Thomas Schools, and professor of history Shireen Mondal  two or three teachers and two or three parents.        
	The school will also introduce a greater degree of counselling to employ alternative measures to discipline unruly students for which more counsellors will be called upon.        
	What about the case of Sanjay Smart, the teacher accused of demanding a laptop as bribe to promote Class IV student Srijan Banerjee?        
	We shall take all possible steps deemed necessary to root out any kind of corruption that may exist in the school, said Mukherjee. The school suspended Smart following his arrest and the teacher is in judicial custody.        
	Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the board, also announced the formation of redressal forums at the board and teachers levels to address the grievances of guardians.

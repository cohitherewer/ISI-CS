The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writing on Mamatas wall
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Writing on Mamatas wall
                                          
	Mamata Banerjee said on Monday we will not allow the use of walls for political graffiti. She has promised illuminated or electronic boards at designated spots across the city as an alternative. Metro reads between the lines.                
	What does Mamata mean?        
	Taken at face value, it means that the Trinamul-ruled civic board will not allow Calcuttas walls to be defaced by poll graffiti.              
	Does the law back this stand?        
	The law does not allow defacement of government buildings under any circumstances. For private buildings, a written consent of the owner has to be obtained before a party can use a wall for its campaign. If the norm is flouted and a complaint is lodged, the guilty  in this case, the hand that wielded the paintbrush  can be tried under the CMC Act of 1980 and jailed for up to six months or fined up to Rs 50,000.        
	But no political activist, leave alone a leader, has yet been hauled up for the offence.               
	Where does Trinamul stand on this?        
	Guilty as hell. Even in last years Lok Sabha elections, over 2,000 complaints had been lodged against Trinamul in Calcutta and its neighbourhood. In locality after locality, from Kankurgachhi to Kasba, Baranagar to Batanagar, the party had been accused of defacing walls without consent.         
	For the 2,000-odd complaints, there might actually have been another 2,000 violations, said an Election Commission official.              
	Where does Mamatas core group stand on this?        
	Leader of the Opposition and Trinamul Congress MLA Partha Chatterjee has said political parties have to rely on graffiti as they cant afford to spend money on posters, banners and festoons for propaganda. However, we believe that walls, if used for graffiti by political parties, should be restored to their original condition, added Chatterjee.        
	Before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Trinamul leadership had asserted at an all-party meeting convened by the Election Commission that the democratic right of the people should not be usurped as wall graffiti was part and parcel of election campaigns.                
	Where does The Telegraph stand on this?        
	The Telegraph has run a campaign for years calling for a blanket ban on political graffiti. The newspaper had even put up billboards across the city before the 2006 Assembly polls, requesting political parties to spare the walls.              
	What are the victims of poll graffiti saying?        
	Mamatas announcement has been greeted with a shrug rather than a smile. Such promises are usually not followed up. The Election Commission had promised action and redress for victims last year. Nothing happened, said Sutirtho Chowdhury, 43, a Beleghata resident whose walls have been defaced by all the major political parties over the years.        
	It is another pipe dream. The so-called graffiti culture will not die in Bengal in my lifetime. It is sad but true, said Ajoy Biswas, 67, of Sovabazar who has to repaint his walls after every election.              
	What is the state election commission saying?        
	The state election commissioner, Mira Pande, declined comment on Mamatas promise saying she had only read about it in the newspaper.              
	What are clean-Calcutta activists saying?        
	I dont think graffiti is as big a problem in any other city in the world. The graffiti gangs never carry out the promised clean-up after the polls, said Subhash Dutta.        
	The concept (of boards instead of walls) has to be implemented properly, said Bonani Kakkar, warning against billboard clutter compromising greenery.              
	Why has Mamata made this announcement now?        
	Given her poll form, she can afford to spare the walls and still win the votes. So, shes taken her first (verbal) step towards creating the promised London-like Calcutta.                
	What does she need to do now?        
	In the short run, snatch away the poll paintbrush from her partymen.        
	In the long run, move to amend the law to make it foolproof against political graffiti.                          OUR BUREAU

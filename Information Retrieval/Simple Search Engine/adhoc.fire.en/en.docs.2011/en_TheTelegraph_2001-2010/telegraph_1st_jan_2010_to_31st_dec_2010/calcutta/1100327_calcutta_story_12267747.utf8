  - Park Street of liveried servants, no spitting          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Irene Martin outside Stephen Court the morning after the blaze                                        
	Her 90-year-old voice is often a low whisper. But when interrupted with a sorry, she pauses for a moment to say gently I beg your pardon?        
	Dressed in a long cotton dress and a kerchief covering her short, white hair, she is every bit the memsahib. She is Parsee. Her sprawling apartment in Queens Mansion is filled with old furniture and almost looks like a sepia photograph from another time, a lively, charming, cosmopolitan, free and global one, if also sahib and snooty. Then Park Street swung to more than the sound of money.         
	It was people like her who filled Queens Mansion and Stephen Court, which went up in flames on Tuesday. It is through people like her that this world lives on, almost clandestine, and is occasionally glimpsed, such as when a killer fire breaks out.         
	The buildings werent ill-maintained hubs of computer offices. They were little spots of Europe. Irene Martin, the granddaughter of Arathoon Stephen, the Armenian who gave Stephen Court its name, had inherited this world too. What was she thinking of as she sat forlorn on Park Street on the morning after the fire?         
	The Parsee lady looks on the street below. Yes, life was definitely more Anglicised then. I had a little problem speaking Hindoostani with the maids, she says with a twinkle in her eye. And there was no spitting.        
	Stephen Court was a completely residential apartment block. Companies had their flats there  British companies and other companies, says Manu Lilaram, a 70-year-old resident of Stephen Court. Seated at his New Market jewellery showroom, Lilaram, dressed in a formal shirt with suspenders holding up his trousers, recalls his neighbours were from all over the world. There was a Polish family and other European families.        
	There were liveried servants and social segregation. In the late 60s and early 70s I remember uniformed bearers serving the residents, says Rajeev Butta, who stays and runs a clinic in Stephen Court. The servants and salesmen would use the back stairs that were the fire exits. There were Russians and Armenians and Anglo-Indians. I remember one lady, I think she was Belgian, who used to take piano classes. These people started moving out of Stephen Court in the 70s, says Butta.         
	Ratna Lilaram, Manus wife, remembers a Jewish woman who used to hold sewing classes. Never, even in the mornings, did I seen her with a single hair out of place, she smiles.        
	I got married in October 1968 in Bombay and when I was coming back to Calcutta in early December, I told my wife that the street would be lit up for her. Actually the Christmas lights were put up in end-November, early December then, remembers her husband.         
	Even as business began to leave Bengal, Park Street changed. The offices started to come in after the top floors were built and then the building started to change, says Lilaram. The street lost its character. The lights went dim, to be replaced by neon signs and LCD screens and sometimes, load-shedding.

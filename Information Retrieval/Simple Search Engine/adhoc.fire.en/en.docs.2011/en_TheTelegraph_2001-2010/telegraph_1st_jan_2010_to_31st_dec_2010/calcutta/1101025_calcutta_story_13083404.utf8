	US consul-general Beth A. Payne has come on board to support the Safe City movement started by a group of young girls, in partnership with Metro, to curb the menace of eve-teasing in Calcutta, starting with a pilot project in New Alipore.        
	I feel very strongly about a womans right to public places. And I feel so much at home in Calcutta that I wondered, after reading about the campaign in The Telegraph, if I could do anything to support it and spread awareness, said Payne to the Safe City team she had invited to her residence on Ho Chi Minh Sarani. Also present was Chad Cummins, the director of the American Center.        
	The Safe City team was formed last month, days after the daytime assault by a cyclist in New Alipore on Brinda Dasgupta, 22, near her home in F Block. Brinda and a few friends kickstarted the campaign with Metro. Calcutta police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation have come on board to make the streets of New Alipore safe for women and then replicate the model in other parts of the city.        
	Taking a cue from Take Back The Night, a movement in the US in 1975, with marches and rallies protesting all forms of sexual violence, Payne suggested ways in which Calcuttas girls could take more proactive steps and direct action against eve-teasing.                           
	I was in college and I remember being a part of the movement which was about non-violent protests against sexual assault or abuse. It helped change perceptions that late nights do not mean girls cant be out, said Payne.         
	The Safe City girls  Brinda, Pujarini Sen, Mirna Guha and Ahona Panda  briefed the US consul-general about the problems they faced in public spaces in the city.        
	A woman has every right to her security irrespective of how she dresses, stressed Payne, underlining the need for self-defence classes. I attended such classes as a teenager. Theyre not just meant for fighting back physically but also go a long way in building confidence and giving you the state of mind to handle such situations. It shows in your body language when youre walking down the street, she said, offering her lawns for the Safe City team to conduct such training.        
	I feel men accompanying women should be more proactive in reacting and standing up for women who raise their voice, added Cummins.        
	Payne then went on to propose the idea of the Neighbourhood Watch or Guardian Angels in the US  voluntary groups of unarmed citizens on walking patrols who prevent any sort of crime or vandalism and keep the local police informed. We introduced something like this three years ago after I got mugged in my neighbourhood in DC. It helped draw attention to the problem areas, she said.

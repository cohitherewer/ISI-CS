The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Calcuttan bags first Merc SUV
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Calcuttan bags first Merc SUV
          ANASUYA BASU                                            
	A Calcuttan has become the first person in the country to buy the top-of-the-line SUV from the Mercedes stable.        
	Anukul Maity, the chairman of the iCore Group who recently won the Most Promising Entrepreneur Award at the London Ananda Utsav, booked and bought the iridium silver Mercedes GL 350 CDI early this month for Rs 72.66 lakh (ex-showroom, Calcutta).         
	The GL class was showcased in the 10th Auto Expo in Delhi in January and was commercially launched in the country early this month. Maity booked his wheels before the vehicle arrived in Calcutta and was the first in the country to be delivered the model.        
	I wanted to buy a Mercedes SUV, said the businessman who frequently hits the highway on the way to his factories in Durgapur, Asansol and Uttar Pradesh.        
	A Toyota Land Cruiser Prado was Maitys favourite for long journeys. He also has a BMW 7 series, a Tata Safari, a Maruti Swift and a Tata Indigo in his garage.        
	He chose a Merc SUV for the comfort it offers. The GL provides a comfortable ride, besides being fuel efficient, said the first-generation businessman about his new vehicle.        
	The seven-seater off-roader comes with luxury features such as third-row folding seats that make way for a larger boot. A large tailgate that can be raised at the press of a button to ensure easy offloading of goods from the boot.        
	The SUV can splash across shallow river beds, streams or any other water body easily, said an employee of Interkrafts, the Merc dealership in the city that cut the deal with Maity.        
	For entertainment, the rear-seat passengers have individual slots for DVD players with headphones and 8-inch colour displays. The system is such that it does not disturb the driver, added the Interkrafts official.        
	Maity also looked at the Mercs safety features before making his selection.        
	Mercedes makes the safest vehicles in the world and since I travel a lot on the highway, the GL Class was an obvious choice, said the Naktala resident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plot owner runs into protest wall
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Plot owner runs into protest wall
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A group of Bikramgarh residents, led by Trinamul councillors, has been resisting attempts by the owner of a plot to erect a wall on the ground that the land was originally part of a water body.        
	Owner Raza Hossain, accompanied by police, visited the 4-cottah plot twice since Wednesday armed with a high court order upholding his right to the property, but could not start construction of the wall.        
	Adjacent to the plot is Bikramgarh jheel, behind South City, which has shrunk from 100 to 20 bighas over the past few decades following illegal landfill.        
	The high court has given its verdict in favour of the claimant and we will have to ensure that the order is implemented. Or else well be charged with contempt of court, said an officer of Jadavpur police station, who had accompanied Hossain to the plot on both occasions but had to backtrack in the face of the residents protest.        
	On Thursday, police had to lathicharge the protesters to disperse them. Tapan Dasgupta, the Trinamul councillor of ward 95, was arrested. Residents said they would try to get a stay on the construction of the wall while a relative of Hossain said the owner would visit the plot again on Friday to try and get work started.

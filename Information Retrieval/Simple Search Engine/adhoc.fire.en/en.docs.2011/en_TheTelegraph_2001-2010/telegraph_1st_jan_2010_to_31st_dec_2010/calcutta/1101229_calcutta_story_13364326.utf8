	Education should be the priority, not chores for children. It is our duty to make people aware of child rights, said Rajesh Halder, an actor of the Sunderbans Social Development Centre group. Dressed in black and red, Rajesh and his group staged a street play, Champar Kahini, outside the Academy of Fine Arts. The play revolves around childrens right to education.         
	A street theatre festival, Bol Jamoore, was organised by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Theatre Forum for Child Rights in front of the Academy of Fine Arts and Madhusudan Mancha on December 15 and 16, respectively. The event brought together schoolkids and actors to fight the exploitation of children. This was the 12th edition of the fest hosted in the city. The performances were conducted in Bengali and Hindi, so that a large section of people could relate to them.        
	Mime and magic were also used to argue for child rights. Mime artist Chanchal Shee performed Byatha, where he portrayed the travails of both rural and urban children.         
	While many children in the villages are robbed of their childhood because they are forced to earn a living, children in the city are often just as deprived. Caught in the rat race, they can neither play nor pursue their hobbies.                   Children perform during the street theatre festival in front of the Academy of Fine Arts. (Anindya Shankar Ray)       
	Mime is a very powerful medium of expression. People will remember our message better this way, Shee said. Balloon, a play by a group called Silence, focused on how fragile childhood dreams can be.         
	Swapna Das, a storyteller, used songs, words and voice modulation to depict the empty lives of Raja, a slum-dweller, and Rani, a rich girl, in Raja Ranir Kahini. Another play, Muktir Dana, by Naheli, also focused on lost childhood. In between performances, Sanat Narasimham engaged the audience with rope and fire tricks.         
	Many stopped by to watch the performances. Class X student Anurupa Sarkar was one of them. I enjoyed the plays because they were entertaining and concerned us, she said.

	Annual fete         
	Underprivileged children of Ashadeep, an NGO run by the sisters of Apostolic Carmel, had some pre-Christmas fun at their annual fete, The Shishu Mela, held at their centre in Tollygunge on December 19. There were stalls for food and games, many manned by the children. The NGO runs 20 non-formal educational centres in various parts of the city, including Tollygunge, Deshapriya Park, Gariahat Road and Hazra. The children also staged a cultural programme on the occasion.                   Children perform at the MAD carnival in Nicco Park. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta       Yuletide celebration

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Second-half super subs spur sales   Missed chance for some sellers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Second-half super subs spur sales     - Cup of surprises stretches jersey budget and reaps bounty for retailers          SUBHRO SAHA AND RITH BASU                          A showroom selling Fifa World Cup 2010 merchandise.

	World Cup 2010 has stretched the Calcutta soccer fans jersey budget and widened the market for manufacturers.        
	Software engineer Sarthak Dutta had slipped into a canary-yellow Brazil jersey even before the Cup kicked off in Johannesburg, little knowing that he would be forced to change colours after the quarters.         
	Childhood friend Anish Basu, a die-hard Lionel Messi fan who had bought a No. 10 Argentina jersey from the same mall, lost his shirt  literally  the very next day after Brazils exit.        
	The duo are not the only ones in town to have switched camps  and jerseys  since the Big Twos exit. Many have invested in new colours to keep the Cup excitement alive, creating a bigger market for merchandise than retailers and manufacturers were prepared for.        
	Our stocks of Argentina merchandise, the mainstay of the eastern market, were almost sold out before Diego Maradonas men crashed out. So when sales of Germany merchandise picked up after the second round, it was a bonus, said the head of an Adidas store in town.        
	The German sportswear major, which is the official supplier of outfits to 12 national football federations, found another second-half super sub in Spain. For every 10 German jerseys going off the racks after the early exit of Brazil and Argentina, we were selling eight Spanish shirts, said a retailer.        
	So while Spain is the new bestseller for Adidas at Rs 2,999 a piece, rival Nike is enjoying a Dutch treat. We managed to offload almost our entire stock of Brazil shirts, caps, wrist bands and socks in the first week. Now there is a demand for Holland jerseys, said I.Z. Siddiqui, the store manager of the Nike store at Forum mall.                                
	But with the all-orange jersey not readily available, Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben fans are having to make do with the blue, white and orange Dutch training shirt available at the outlets in Forum and South City Mall.        
	 We hope this craze will be sustained over the weekend so that we can offset the losses suffered by way of unsold stocks of Portugal merchandise, said Debasish Haldar, who heads Nikes sales and marketing in the eastern region.        
	Overall, Argentina has been the biggest money-spinner.         
	Deepa Thomas, the senior manager of pop culture at the online shoppers paradise eBay India, said: Even though Argentina does not feature in the final of the FIFA World Cup 2010, it definitely is the leader when it comes to online merchandise sales on eBay India. Fifty per cent of Indians shopping for FIFA merchandise on the site prefer Argentina products, with Germany (25%), England (14%) and Brazil (11%) following suit.         
	Maidan Market stalls focusing on Argentina and Brazil, however, missed the opportunity of cashing in on the second wave. Sales of jerseys and flags dropped from around 150 a day to 50 after the pre-quarterfinals. Now with Germany out, the Cup is as good as over, said Sheikh Azad, 30.        
	Till Kaka and Messi were in the reckoning, shopkeepers would begin business earlier than the usual 11am and stay beyond 8.30pm. They are now back to normal hours.         
	Demand was huge for (Bastian) Schweinsteiger and (Lukas) Podolski shirts but they didnt arrive on time. We lost an opportunity, said a salesman.

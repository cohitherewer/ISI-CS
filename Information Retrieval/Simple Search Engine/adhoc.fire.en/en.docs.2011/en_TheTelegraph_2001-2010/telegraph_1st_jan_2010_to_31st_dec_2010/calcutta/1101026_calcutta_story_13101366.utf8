                      The story of the mystic poet                    In a remote village in feudal and oppressive 19th century Bengal was born a poet-philosopher who brought religions together and united them through his songs. As time passed, his songs became part of folklore, but the man himself remained shrouded in mystery. His unconventional approach to life earned him the wrath of both orthodox Hindus and Muslims. Yet, he attracted a large following among the poorer sections of society who found in him a refuge free of social conventions and mores. In his fictionalised biography of Lalan Fakir, Sunil Gangopadhyay has recreated in simple yet touching prose, the remarkable life and times of a man whose voice continues to resonate down the ages. This evening, Starmark and HarperCollins Publishers India will host the launch of The Fakir, Monabi Mitras English version of Gangopadhyays story of Bengals mystic poet. To be followed by a conversation between the author and the translator.                    Event: Launch of The Fakir, the English translation of Sunil Gangopadhyays fictionalised biography of Lalan Fakir When: October 26; 6.30 pm Where: Starmark, Mani Square, 2nd floor

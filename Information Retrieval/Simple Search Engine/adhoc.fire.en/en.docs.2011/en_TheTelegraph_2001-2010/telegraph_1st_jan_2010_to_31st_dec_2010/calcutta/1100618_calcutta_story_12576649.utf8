The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fans play ball, take off bails   Soccer steals cricket thunder
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fans play ball, take off bails     - Soccer in South Africa stumps cricket in Sri Lanka          RITH BASU                          Spanish defender Sergio Ramos (left) challenges Switzerlands goalkeeper Diego Benaglio in the first upset of the World Cup on Wednesday with Spain losing by a solitary goal.

	Soccer has blanked out cricket in the battle for eyeballs with many in sports-crazy Calcutta apparently not even aware that the Asia Cup is underway in Sri Lanka.        
	I suppose Pakistan is hosting a cricket tournament, answered Anisha Mukherjee, a senior executive of NSHM Knowledge Campus, on being asked whether she knew about the Asia Cup coinciding with the Fifa World Cup.        
	Oh! Never mind, not even a swashbuckling Sachin (Tendulkar) innings can lure me away from soccer now, smiled the Lionel Messi fan on realising she had been caught behind.        
	Anisha is not the only one in town tuning in to South Africa rather than Sri Lanka. I knew the Asia Cup was to be held but didnt know it had started. It was only when I saw the scorecard of the India-Bangladesh match in the paper that I realised there was a match on Wednesday, said software consultant Debapriya Ghosh, who usually doesnt miss Team India matches.                                            
	The cable industry is also playing ball, relegating cricket to the back channels.         
	 The World Cup is on our primary sports band. We are not replacing it with cricket even when World Cup matches are not being beamed, said Mrinal Chatterjee of Kolkata Cable.        
	Wouldnt his company make an exception even for an India-Pakistan match like the one slated for Saturday?        
	Till soccer is in the air, I think more people would prefer to watch the Dutch rather than Dhoni play. Those wanting to watch cricket can catch the Asia Cup in our lower S band, he replied.        
	Saturdays India-Pakistan match, beginning at 2.30pm, would midway coincide with two World Cup ties  the Netherlands versus Japan starting 5pm and Ghana versus Australia from 7.30pm.                    Gautam Gambhir during the Asia Cup match against Bangladesh. (Reuters)    
	Joy Dutta, a cable operator in Salt Lake, said most last-mile operators  called so because they are the last link in the broadcast chain  were running ESPNs World Cup feed on their dedicated local channels as well as the regular slots.         
	 Its meant to be a second line of defence. We dont do this for any cricket tournament. But when the Fifa World Cup is on, you cant take chances in this soccer-crazy city, smiled Dutta.        
	For techie Debapriya, the only diversion from soccer on Saturday could be snatches of the India-Pakistan Asia Cup match, though not just for the love of cricket.         
	With Shoaib Malik back in the Pakistan squad, I wonder whether wife Sania (Mirza) would take a break from tennis to be in the stands. It will be interesting to see whom she would support, chuckled the Kankurgachhi resident.        
	Tennis is also set to take a World Cup hit with Wimbledon, beginning next week, clashing with the business end of the beautiful games biggest prize.

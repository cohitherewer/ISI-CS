                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Maoist posters   at dawn
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Posters demanding the release of five Maoists arrested in the city last week were found at four places in south Calcutta on Sunday morning.        
	Two posters issued by the CPI (Maoist) were found on the southern wall of Rabindra Sadan, a stones throw from Maidan police station and a cop kiosk supposed to be manned round the clock.        
	The other three places where the posters were found were the exit of Rabindra Sarovar and Jatin Das Park Metro stations and a roadside stand opposite Asutosh College where the CPM mouthpiece Ganashakti is displayed.        
	We have pasted the posters to demand the immediate and unconditional release of our comrades, including our organisations state secretary Kanchan, who were arrested illegally, a Maoist activist told Metro over the phone.        
	On Friday, similar posters were seen in Sealdah.        
	The posters from the Rabindra Sadan wall were removed around 6am and from the other four places an hour later.        
	A police officer said the posters had been put up by members of the outfits city committee.         
	The city committee has as many as 600 members, of whom 200 pay subscriptions on a regular basis, the officer added.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), said a probe had been ordered to find out how Maoists could put up posters on establishments on main roads.

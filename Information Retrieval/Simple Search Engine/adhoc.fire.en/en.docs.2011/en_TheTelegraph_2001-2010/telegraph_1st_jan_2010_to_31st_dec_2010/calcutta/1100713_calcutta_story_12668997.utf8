	The state is heading towards one of the most critical elections in recent years, to be held on or before June 11, 2011. Over 5.3 crore voters will decide whether winds of change will blow across Bengal. In the run-up to the polls, the central election commission is in the process of finalising the electoral rolls this month. Metro decodes the process of enrolling names              
	Electoral roll        
	Every constituency has a list of voters which is called the electoral roll. If a citizen wants to exercise his franchise, his name has to be included in the electoral list of the constituency where he lives.        
	Revision of rolls        
	The process of revision of electoral rolls includes addition and deletion of names and making other necessary changes to the list.        
	Article 326 of the Constitution and Section 19 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1950, states that a person must be at least 18 years of age on the first day of January of the year in which the list is being revised to enrol his name.        
	Reason        
	The electoral roll is usually revised once a year to ensure fair elections by including the names of all legitimate voters and deleting the names of all bogus ones.        
	Important dates        
	The revision started on July 9 and will continue till July 23. Claims and objections can be filed during the fortnight. The disposal of claims and objections will take place till August 14 and the revised rolls will be published on September 7.        
	Process        
	Election officials will be present at all polling stations in Assembly constituencies across the state. The electoral registration officer (ERO) will issue registration forms and issue receipts on submission between 11am and 4pm from Mondays to Saturdays and between 10am and 5pm on Sundays.        
	Forms        
	A person who wants to include his name in the list has to apply in Form 6 available with the ERO. For deletion of a name or to register any objection, one has to apply in Form 7.         
	Form 8 is for correction and Form 8A for change of residence within the same Assembly constituency. All forms are available free.

	The revision is undertaken to ensure that every eligible voter is on the roll and every bogus voter is removed. All voters concerned are expected to take part in the process, said election commissioner S.Y. Qureshi.

	Who has not seen Andy Warhols mass produced silkscreen prints of Marylin Monroe, Jackie Onassis, Michael Jackson and other celebrities? Robert Rauschenberg, too, used this medium.         
	Silkscreen, or to use its more formal name, serigraph, is not very popular in the country among printmakers although it is widely used commercially. It was to break this mindset that the Government College of Art amp; Culture with help from the British Council held a five-day workshop last week on serigraphy in which students, teachers, and senior artists from here, London and Dhaka participated.        
	Bill Pryde, a silkscreen artist from London, who began as a theatre director and was later trained at the Camberwell College of Art, catalysed the process. Prydes stress was on silkscreens colour, dynamism and modernism and moving away from the figurative to more creative work.        
	The college used this opportunity to set up a proper dark room and screenprint bed facilities.        
	The other participants were Jogen Chowdhury, Ganesh Haloi  who had never used this medium before  Ramen Kastha, Ajit Sil from Santiniketan, Atin Basak, Mahmudul Haque and Rokeya Sultana from Dhaka University, and Amal Ghosh and Iris Ghosh Hudson, both art teachers in London, who winter in Calcutta.        
	The team began by producing some brilliantly-coloured one-off monoprints, and then the two rooms were abuzz with activity as the participants worked individually. Soon, they discovered that the best thing about serigraphy is team work.        
	The only complaint was about the oil-based colours used, instead of the more sophisticated water-based ones, as the former are a health hazard. The screenprints are on display at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR.

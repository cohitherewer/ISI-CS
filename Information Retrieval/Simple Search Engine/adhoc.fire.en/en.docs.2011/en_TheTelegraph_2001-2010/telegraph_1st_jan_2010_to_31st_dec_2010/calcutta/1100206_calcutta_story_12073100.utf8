          A STAFF REPORTER                          Jayati Chatterjee awaits liver transplant at SSKM on Friday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	A peasant family from 250km away left a mark on the citys medical history on Friday by agreeing to donate the liver of a brain dead member to a middle-aged woman suffering from cirrhosis.        
	Birbhum farmer Joydeb Pal, 47, was declared brain dead at SSKM Hospital in the afternoon and anointed saviour by evening after counsellors convinced his family to consent to a cadaveric organ donation and save Behala homemaker Jayati Chatterjee, 46.        
	We need to extract the liver from the donors body and transplant it tonight itself. An organ has to be transplanted within 12 hours of being harvested, said Debasish Bhattacharya, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of SSKM.        
	The transplantation process, which started after 11pm, was to continue till early on Saturday.        
	A liver transplant is complex but we are extremely hopeful about the outcome, said Abhijit Chowdhury, the director of the Institute of Liver Disease at SSKM.        
	As the medical team started readying Jayati for the surgery, her family members  husband Pradip and daughter Shikha  ran out of words to convey their gratitude towards the Pal family.        
	I cant express how thankful and grateful I am to them. I just hope my wife gets well soon, said Pradip, who works in a public sector bank.        
	Jayati was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in March 2006 and has been undergoing treatment at SSKM since last November.        
	She was admitted to the hospital on December 15.        
	Pradip said he had received a call from his wife on Friday morning saying that the SSKM authorities had alerted her to the possibility of getting a cadaver donor.         
	The doctors told me earlier that transplantation was the only way to save her. Unfortunately, a tissue mismatch with all the prospective donors among close relatives became the stumbling block. I had almost lost hope when the offer of a donation came like a miracle on Friday, he added, holding the hand of Joydebs nephew Debasish.        
	Joydeb, from Labhpur in Birbhum, had suffered cerebral haemorrhage when he slipped and fell on the way back home last month, hitting his head against an electricity pole. He was admitted to Bolpur Hospital and later shifted to Burdwan District Hospital but his condition didnt improve.        
	On January 29, he was shifted to SSKMs neurology department and put on ventilator. Doctors declared him brain dead around 5pm on Friday.        
	Doctors and members of the Volunteers of the Liver Foundation of India then counselled the Pals about cadaver donation before a family member signed the consent form.        
	I spoke to my cousin Subhashis (Joydebs son) and we jointly took a decision to give our consent for liver donation. We hope the lady (Jayati) will live long after my uncles liver is transplanted, said Debasish, fighting back tears.        
	Once the donors family gave its consent, official approval for the transplant came from health secretary Samar Ghosh.        
	Medical superintendent Bhattacharya had sought special permission from the state health department to conduct cadaver organ transplant at SSKM.        
	In such cases you have to act fast, he explained.        
	For once, health minister Surya Kanta Mishra, too, moved fast. He arrived at SSKM to be briefed about the rare cadaver transplant.        
	This is unprecedented, the minister later told Metro, referring to the gesture by the donor family. I have conveyed my congratulations to them, he said, promising special medical facilities for the donor family at any government medical unit in future.        
	Mishra went on to express hope that the gesture by the Pal family would inspire others to come forward for cadaver donation, a rarity in Bengal and the rest of the country.        
	I do hope the transplant is successful, said Mishra.        
	According to doctors, a successful transplant would be a landmark achievement for SSKM, raising awareness about cadaveric organ donation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Patchwork in Slo-Mo
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Patchwork in Slo-Mo
          POTHOLE PERIL  TT FOR CITY              1.            2.            3.                                  
	Metros crater campaign had travelled to Dunlop More earlier in the month and found BT Road pockmarked with potholes (picture 1). CMDA officials had promised repairs soon.         
	On Monday, Metro saw signs of the promised patchwork on the stretch of BT Road under the railway bridge at Dunlop (picture 2).         
	However, just 25 metres ahead, towards Barrackpore, gaping craters and loose stone chips still dot the busy road (picture 3). A CMDA official said the potholes were caused by a leaking underground pipe, which the CMC had failed to repair for the past three months.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sovan show draws a snooze
          SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI                            (Top) Sovan Chatterjee on the chamber of commerce dais on Tuesday; his audience. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                 
	Initiative One: Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, mid-sentence, lifting his right leg to scratch it. Calcutta: Initiatives for a Better Tomorrow? Check.        
	Initiative Two: A member of the audience fast asleep, with the mayor in mid-sentence. Calcutta: Initiatives for a Better Tomorrow? Check.              
	A 110-year-old chamber of commerce and a 45-day-old mayor came together on Tuesday morning for an interactive session titled, (what else?), Calcutta: Initiatives for a Better Tomorrow, and ended up showcasing why the tomorrow looks so bleak.        
	The event, hosted by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce, started with president Pavan Poddar dwelling on all that ails Calcutta. Restoration of old buildings topped the lengthy list.        
	Cue for Sovan Chatterjee to embark on a dramatic monologue: If I dont get food, I will live. If I dont have a home, I will live. Even if I have no money, I will live. But if I lose my heritage, I will not survive.        
	The mayor then delved deep into his heritage, charting his political career from 1985, when he was a councillor, to 2000 when he was anointed a mayoral council member, to 2010 when he is wearing the crown of mayor.        
	A hall full of stifled yawns and bleary eyes.        
	Calcutta: Initiatives for a Better Tomorrow? Check.        
	What about solid waste management? What about the traffic mess? What about this and what about that?        
	The mayor had one word to sum up every problem the city was plagued by  paraphernia (paraphernalia, one safely presumes). Traffic paraphernalia. Police paraphernalia. Political paraphernalia. Legal paraphernalia.        
	And who was to blame for all the paraphernia? Everyone. From corrupt firms masquerading as NGOs to banks that give car loans to cops who allow trucks to ply in the city to his predecessor (an impractical man).        
	Calcutta: Initiatives for a Better Tomorrow? Check.        
	Any initiative? There was one, from Jol Sovan rather than mayor Sovan Chatterjee. Mamata Banerjee and Pranab Mukherjee had promised to pump in Rs 1,500 crore to expand the filtered water supply network.         
	If I get that money, I will sort out your water problems, he promised.         
	A better tomorrow? I will take some time to sort out the mess, to dress it up and paint it pretty. pleaded the mayor.        
	By loosening the belt, we cannot solve the problem of obesity, chamber president Poddar had warned.        
	Luckily, the mayor merely lifted a leg.

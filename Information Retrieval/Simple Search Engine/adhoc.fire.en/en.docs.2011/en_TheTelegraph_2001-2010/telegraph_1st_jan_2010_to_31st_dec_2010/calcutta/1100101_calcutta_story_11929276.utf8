The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Humidity plays spoilsport
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Humidity plays spoilsport
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A weakened western disturbance and rise in humidity have dashed hopes of the temperature dropping below the 10-degree mark in 2009.        
	The rise in the mercury, however, did not rob the New Year Eve air of the chill as the minimum temperature during the day was still one degree below normal at 13.4 degrees Celsius.        
	On Monday it seemed that the minimum would plunge to the 9-degree mark by December 31. But the developments since Tuesday queered the pitch, said an official at the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	The higher humidity level, which rose to a maximum of 99 per cent on Thursday, is likely to cause a cloud cover on Friday morning and keep the mercury from falling.         
	Officials at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore said the minimum temperature on New Year would be around 13 degrees Celsius. A fresh western disturbance is likely to influence the weather from this weekend. The minimum temperature will dip again, said a meteorologist.        
	Like all other seasons this year, the winter too has been erratic. The warmest fortnight ever in November was followed by the onset of winter, a fortnight earlier than usual on November 22. A nine-day warm spell from December 12 was followed by one of the coldest spells in December.

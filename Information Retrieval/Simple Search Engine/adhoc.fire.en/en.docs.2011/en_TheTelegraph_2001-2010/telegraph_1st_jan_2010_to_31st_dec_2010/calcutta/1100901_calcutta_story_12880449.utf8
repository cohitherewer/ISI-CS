          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The future of the institution ruled over its present as the governing body of Presidency College met on Tuesday to discuss some pending administrative issues of the institution, which has been upgraded to a unitary university.         
	The discussion on the routine administrative issues  disposal of obsolete apparatus, clearance of pending bills and some  was put on hold as the discussion took a different  and dramatic  turn.        
	Amal Mukhopadhyay, a former principal of the college, wanted to record his suggestions on how Presidency University should be run  mainly without political interference  but Amiya Bagchi, the chairman of the governing body, apparently refused to give him a hearing as this was not the appropriate forum.        
	At one point, Mukhopadhyay threatened to stage a walkout but some other members intervened.        
	Bagchi, who is also a member of the search committee formed to scout for a vice-chancellor for Presidency University, then relented and allowed the former principal to have his say, said a member of the governing body.        
	The incident was unfortunate and could have been avoided, the member added.        
	According to a source, trouble began when Mukhopadhyay wanted to record three suggestions that would enable the institution to achieve its objective of becoming a world-class institute.        
	Bagchi then stated that the governing body was only empowered to discuss about the college and not the university.         
	The logic behind stopping Mukhopadhyay was right. But there is no doubt that his suggestions were well-meaning and there was no harm in recording them, said a governing body member.        
	The former principal touched upon three issues  English as the only medium of instruction; a change in the mode of student union elections; no political interference in the running of the institute  to turn Presidency into a centre of excellence.         
	The autonomy will be of no use if the university is not allowed to run without political intervention. What I also wanted to suggest was that even students would have an important role to play in this regard. The students unions should not have any political affiliation, like in the IITs, IIMs, Ramakrishna Mission institutes and St Xaviers College, said Mukhopadhyay.        
	According to him, unless English became the only medium of instruction, the dream of becoming a world-class institute would remain distant.        
	Though the state government has allowed unitary university status to the institution, it is unlikely to give in to such demands as the CPM-led Left Front has always wanted to retain control over academic campuses through teacher and student unions. Left parties are also principally opposed to use of English as the sole medium of instruction.         
	As Bagchi, who is known for his closeness to the ruling Left, could not be contacted, his views on why he was initially reluctant in recording Mukhopadhyays suggestions were not available.         
	A mere recording of Mukhopadhyays statements means nothing for the institute as a new administration will take over in a few months and it will be run on the basis of the provisions in the Presidency University Act, 2010.         
	But what is significant is the fear among a section of the alumni and former teachers that the government will try to retain control in some form. Mukhopadhyays suggestions reflected those concerns, said a governing body member.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Maradona goal a grazing ground
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Maradona goal a grazing ground
  - Soccer stadium-cum-school kicked off by master tripped in political game          ZEESHAN JAWED                          Diego Maradona while laying the foundation stone for the Maheshtala soccer complex in December 2008; the site is now a grazing ground for cattle. (Amit Datta)                                                  
	The feet of Diego and the hand of god may not be enough to get the ball rolling at the Maradona Sports Complex and Indian Football School in Maheshtala.        
	The Argentine maestro, busy in his quest for the World Cup as coach, would probably never know that the stadium project he had kicked off two summers ago and even donated Rs 15 lakh for lies stillborn thanks to political rivalry.        
	Not a single brick has been laid and the site  meant to be a stadium for 25,000 with infrastructure to train young footballers  is now a grazing ground for cattle with the Maheshtala municipality having changed colours from CPM to Trinamul since its date with the soccer great on December 8, 2008.        
	Former CPM MP Shamik Lahiri, in whose Diamond Harbour constituency the project was earmarked, told Metro: The land department had set aside 28 acres for which the Maheshtala municipality was to pay the land department. But in June 2009, Trinamul formed the municipal board and did not pay for the land. So, work on the stadium has not started.        
	Dulal Das, chairman of the Maheshtala municipality, countered the CPM claim by insisting that the land department had not even allotted the plot and so there was no question of payment or work on the project starting. Diego school for cattle              
	Actually it was going to be a CPM show, continued Das. They wanted to claim credit for the project by getting it developed by their municipality. But they were trounced in the June 2009 municipality elections. Now, they do not want any other party to take the credit for the project.        
	If work had started in 2009, the project would have been 35 per cent complete and on track to meet the December 2012 deadline.        
	The Trinamul man is right to the extent that the Maradona Sports Complex and Indian Football School, off the Budge Budge Trunk Road, was a dream project for the late CPM leader Subhas Chakraborty.        
	It was the sports minister who had managed to get Maradona to the city for a two-day visit, during which he had laid the foundation stone for the stadium.        
	When Metro visited the venue on Monday, the only person who looked happy with the ground reality in Maradona territory was cowherd Abu Bashir.        
	The grass is lush green here. It is good lunch for my herd, smiled Bashir, who troops in from neighbouring Naskarpara every day.        
	Bashir was a face in the one-lakh crowd that had congregated on both sides of Budge Budge Trunk Road to catch a glimpse of Maradona laying the foundation stone for the sports complex.        
	The Indian Football School was to have come up over 28 acres adjacent to Eden City. The dream  bearing the mark of Maradona  was to provide Indian football with a large talent pool.        
	The school, according to the blueprint, would give budding footballers the best, in terms of modern infrastructure, sports science, coaches and training methodology.        
	Far removed from the grazing fields of the stadium and school named after him, the 49-year-old is leading his 23 wild cats  thats how he refers to Messi and Co.  towards the Cup. Maradona may yet beat the world at football, but a CPM versus Trinamul match is a different ball game altogether.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro takes speed test 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro takes speed test

	Metro Railway has shifted gears to get back on the fast track after months of regular snags and slow-mo rides.         
	The Lucknow-based Research Designs and Standards Organisation, the R amp;D wing of the railways, has been conducting speed tests for the Metro fleet using sandbags as dummy passengers following a four-month upgrade of the tracks and a revised maintenance schedule.        
	Officials said even the old trains ran at a top speed of 90kmph  the current average speed is 55kmph  during two trial runs conducted last week.        
	Now that the tracks have been upgraded, trains can definitely run faster if they are maintained well. We are trying to determine the ideal average speed and using an oscillograph, which measures alternating or varying electric current, to check whether the power supply is holding up, said an official involved in the trials.        
	For Metro Railway, an increase in the average speed is crucial to maintaining its daily schedule and coping with the increase in passenger load over the past year. Once the Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul)-New Garia extension is inaugurated, the authorities expect footfalls to soar by at least a couple of lakh.        
	If the average speed increases, it will help us introduce more trains and manage the commuter rush better, said a senior official.        
	Experts, however, warned of more breakdowns if rake maintenance didnt improve along with the proposed increase in speed. We have seen key components come loose even when the rakes were running slower than normal. Maintenance norms need to be far stricter for the rickety rakes to survive the grind. Safety is also an issue, a maintenance engineer said.        
	Metro had reported on September 3 about the citys transport lifeline sacrificing speed to keep its ageing rakes from breaking down at regular intervals. Motormen who would once need to give a written explanation if a train ran late for two minutes were apparently given the licence to slow down rather than risk snags and safety.        
	Although the trials have gone well, the last word on Metros need for speed would be the rail safety commissioners. We might have to wait months for clearance, an official said.        
	Apart from speed potential, the R amp;D team is looking at synchronisation of wheels on the tracks and passenger comfort. They are observing how the shock absorbers work when the rakes are running at high speed, the official said.         
	Signalling is set to go fully automatic soon. The work order for the auto signalling system has already been issued, a source said.

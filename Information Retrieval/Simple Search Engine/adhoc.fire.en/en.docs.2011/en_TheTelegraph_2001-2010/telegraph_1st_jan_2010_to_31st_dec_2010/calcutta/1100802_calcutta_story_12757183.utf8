The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayor backyard under water
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayor backyard under water

	Parts of the mayors backyard in Behala remained waterlogged on Sunday, long after roads in other parts of the city had dried.         
	For more than 40 hours after Friday nights showers, water rarely dipped below the knee level on KK Roy Chowdhury Road, Jagat Roy Chowdhury Road, Brajamani Debya Road in Silpara and Sabarnapara near Sakherbazar.         
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, the councillor of the adjacent ward 131, ruled out quick relief for the Silpara and Sabarnapara residents.        
	The work of laying underground sewers at Silpara and Sabarnapara will be taken up under Phase II of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP), said Chatterjee.         
	That will start only after the CEIP receives the proposed soft loan of over Rs 3,000 crore from Asian Development Bank. According to sources, Phase II of the project is unlikely to start before 2012.         
	Residents have got used to wading through water. This is nothing new. It happens after every shower, said Hira Shankar Bhowmick of Drishti eye clinic on KK Roy Chowdhury Road.         
	We had to cancel all the surgeries since Saturday. Dead insects and excreta flow into the clinic when the road gets inundated, added Bhowmick.         
	Behala is especially prone to waterlogging because there are few underground sewers in the area. In some places, there are only surface drains. The Charial canal, where water is drained out, overflows easily because of excessive silting.        
	As an emergency measure, the CMC from Saturday morning drained out water from Silpara and Sabarnapara to Biren Roy Road (West), where underground sewers had been laid recently under the CEIP.        
	On Saturday night, there was ankle-deep water in the area. But the shower on Sunday morning raised the water level again, said Bhowmick.        
	Rickshawpullers charged Rs 40 for distances that would fetch them Rs 6 on other days.        
	Residents who were expecting things to change since the mayor is from Behala had to remain content with promises.         
	Tomorrow, I will visit parts of the city where water took unusually long to recede and find out the reason, said mayoral council member (drainage) Rajib Deb on Sunday.        
	Sridhar Roy Road in Picnic Garden was another area without underground sewers that went under water.        
	Party offices, roadside temples, shops and settlements have sprung up here blocking the surface drains. As a result the sewage from the drains spills on to the road, said a resident.        
	We will start work on laying drains below the road after monsoon, said an official of the CEIP.

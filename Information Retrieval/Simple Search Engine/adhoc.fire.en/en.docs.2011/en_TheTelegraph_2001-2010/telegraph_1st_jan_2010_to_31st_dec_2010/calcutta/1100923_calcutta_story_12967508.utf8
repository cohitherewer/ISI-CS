The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | DIY monks in road repair 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      DIY monks in road repair 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Monks and students fill up craters on Vivekananda Setu on Wednesday. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Government apathy has forced Ramakrishna Mission monks to go into Do It Yourself mode and undertake repairs of the road on Vivekananda Setu, or Bally bridge, for a second time.        
	People travelling down the bridge on Wednesday morning were in for a pleasant surprise when they saw a band of saffron-clad monks and students filling up craters on the road.        
	The craters that were posing a risk to commuters had developed over the past few months, but the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), the custodian of the bridge, did precious little to repair them.        
	Commuters had witnessed a similar scene on February 24, when Swami Divyananda, a member of the board of trustees of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, and another monk filled up a large crater on the city-bound flank of the bridge.        
	On Wednesday, Swami Divyananda was accompanied by a few fellow monks and a group of students from Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira in Belur.        
	The monks, along with six students from Vidyamandira, arrived on the spot with 12 sacks full of brick and stone pieces ferried on a mini-truck. Since the traffic load was low in the morning, it took them half an hour to fill up the craters.        
	I wrote at least three letters to NHAI officials over the past few months, urging them to start repairs. But for some reasons the letters returned to me. Then I decided to fill the craters myself and draw the governments attention (to the plight of commuters), said Swami Divyananda.        
	Following the monks mission in February, government agencies undertook a six-day repair by closing the Bally-Dakshineswar flank for vehicles. But lack of maintenance resulted in cracks resurfacing soon.        
	The veteran monk said that since the bridge had been named after Swami Vivekananda, he thought it was his duty to ensure that people crossed it safely.        
	Abhijit Chakraborty, manager (technical), NHAI, said: We need to sit with railway officials before starting repairs as train tracks run through the bridge. We have sent a letter to the railway ministry asking for a meeting. Repairs are likely to start soon.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Jadavpur University will introduce a masters course in repair and retrofitting engineering this year with demand growing for experts in the field.        
	Graduates in civil engineering and construction engineering will be eligible to pursue the degree. Graduate engineers who are working will also be able to enrol for the course, as classes will be held in the evening.        
	The course proposal has been approved by the universitys faculty council in engineering and the executive council.         
	We will be the first institution in the country to offer this course, said Parthapratim Biswas, a JU executive council member and senior teacher of construction engineering.        
	The course will be financed entirely by the university. The authorities will not seek any financial assistance from the state government for running the programme or to pay remuneration to the faculty members for the course.        
	The course fee is likely to be Rs 3,000 per month.        
	The demand for engineers trained in repairing and retrofitting services is increasing in the country as most of the existing bridges, dams and other concrete structures in the country were built in the pre-Independence period.        
	The course will include modules on remodelling of ageing equipment and preservation and monitoring of bridges, embankments, highways, reservoirs, several types of concrete structures, heritage buildings and monuments.        
	The proposed course will include studies on how to monitor these structures. There are certain techniques for testing an old structure before destroying it. The students will be given an intense training on such testing techniques, an engineering teacher said.        
	Those who complete the course can get involved in disaster management services as well, said a university official.

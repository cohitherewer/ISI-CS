The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bengal to Bangkok
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bengal to Bangkok
          Jhalmuri in Singapore? Calcuttans have invaded Southeast Asia, but most are still awe-struck, say Poulomi Banerjee and Malini Banerjee                          HAPPY HOLIDAY: Swastika was in Pattaya, Thailand, shooting for Bye Bye Bangkok. Picture by Aranya Sen				                     
	Twenty-six-year-old Anita Nankani can debate on the comparative prices of products in shops at Singapore and Bangkok the way Calcuttans pit New Market against Metro Plaza. She recently went to Southeast Asia for the fourth time and can rattle off the best places to eat and visit.         
	Bangkok is dirt cheap. Pratunam market is good, so is MBK. Singapore is more expensive, she says in a knowing voice. Pratunam market and MBK are must-stops, she insists. There you get the kind of stuff that Metro Plaza is flooded with, but cheaper maybe.        
	Anita is not the only Calcuttan who is as at home in Bangkok and Singapore and the other Southeast Asian cities as in her home city.         
	Calcuttans, cutting across class, have invaded Southeast Asia, when it means Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.         
	About 65 per cent of Calcuttans going on a holiday head for Southeast Asia alone, the remaining 35 per cent travel within India and to the UK and Europe, says Anil Punjabi of Ar-Es Travels and chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.                  Thai massage      
	Calcuttans are the biggest group of Indians travelling to Southeast Asia, say travel agents. And there will be no let-up, promises Punjabi. The number of Calcuttans going to Southeast Asia is going up at 80 per cent per year.         
	The reasons are not difficult to find. They have been going on for some time: Warm tropical climate all year around, rich culture, gorgeous beaches, wonderful food and last but not the least, low prices are some of the things that draw Calcuttans to Southeast Asia, Tarakeshwar Singh of travel agency Jet Setters points out.         
	And air fares are set to go down further with an airline promising a one-way ticket from Calcutta to Bangkok at Rs 2,500. Which is a foreign country with no visa hassles.         
	Little India                  Mustafa in Singapore      
	From the late 1990s, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia started aggressive tourism marketing. The travel-happy Calcuttan, forever ready to be on the go, responded eagerly. Travel agents hard-sold three-night-four-day packages. Hence Sukhumvit and Pratunam have become as familiar as Swargadwar and Chakratirtha Road in Puri to many Calcuttans.         
	The area near Mustafa market in Singapore is a popular haunt for Indians. In fact, it is called Little India, because you also have a lot of shops there run by Indians. Walk a few steps and you will get great vegetarian Indian food and Indian chai, says 27-year-old businessman Harsh Pagaria.         
	You get awesome jhalmuri at Komalas for just three Singapore dollars. It is better than the jhalmuri in Calcutta, he insists.         
	Calcuttans  and other Indians  also land up in droves in Southeast Asian hotspots driven by business meetings and office conferences.                   Babylon snails in Malaysia      
	Wedding tourism is the latest attraction. Southeast Asia is emerging as a popular marriage destination. About 50 couples from Calcutta have tied the knot there in the last two years, and the figure is likely to increase, says Punjabi.         
	Numerous Indian films are shot there. Now, a mainstream Bengali film is at hand, paying tribute to the familiar terrain with its title: Bye Bye Bangkok. It will showcase Bangkok as the garden of earthly delights it is reputed to be.         
	The yet-to-be-released film, featuring Swastika, was shot almost entirely in Thailand.         
	Bangkok is a very important part of the script. We have shot in Pattaya, the Coral Islands, the hotel A-One Royal Cruise and other places. We have shown a speedboat chase, Thai massage, shopping, paragliding... everything that Bangkok is famous for, says Kaustav Ray, the producer of Bye Bye Bangkok.         
	We got permission for the shoot in just a couple of days and the production team is so professional, he adds.         
	Food can be a problem, though, even for the adventurous, carnivorous Bengali. I have travelled several times to Thailand and am okay with the local food, but my wife couldnt adjust to it. They use a fish sauce in everything, which my wife couldnt have. We had to rent a service apartment that comes with a modern kitchen. Indian cuisine in Thailand is very expensive, says Abhishake De Sarkar, a 31-year-old career consultant.                   Kayaking in Koh Samui      
	For vegetarians and those allergic to seafood, the local cuisine is tough to handle. They use seafood in everything. My friends who tried the street food said it was delicious, but I stuck to KFC and McDonalds as I cant eat seafood, says Anita.         
	But wait, Southeast Asia is making amends for the Indian palate. In Langkawi (Malaysia), the hotel that we stayed in had everything imaginable for breakfast. Eggs, cornflakes, idli, poha, bread, pancakes, waffles everything, says Kavita Banerjee, 34, mother to a nine-year-old and a teacher of art and crafts.         
	It would stretch from one end of the hall to the other, and if you tried a little of everything, you wouldnt even need lunch, insists a very satisfied Kavita.         
	In a 2009 research available on the Net, titled Indian tourists motivation, perception, and satisfaction of Bangkok, Thailand, author Raktida Siri repeatedly stresses the need to offer more vegetarian fare in Bangkok.         
	The exotic         
	But poha and idli in breakfast do not take away from the charm of the Southeast, especially for first-timers, many of them below a certain age.         
	An employee of a public sector bank, Dipanjan Maitra went on a nine-day trip to several cities with nine families. Maitras family of three visited Pattaya, Kuala Lumpur, Genting and Singapore City in May. They were an adventurous bunch who tried a lot of new things, age no bar  even a dance show by transsexuals.         
	It was a song and dance event performed by men converted into women, gushes their 12-year-old daughter, Trishna. They were men who converted into women through an operation. They even danced to an Indian song (Bhumro bhumro from Mission Kashmir) in patialas and kurtas, she describes.        
	Many Calcuttans discover adventure sports in Southeast Asia. On a trip (from Pattaya) we were taken to a platform in the middle of the sea where we were tied to a rope that was attached to a boat. The rope was also attached to a parachute, says an excited Trishna, the only girl from her class in a Sonarpur school to have gone abroad. There is one boy in my class who says he has been out of India. But I think hes lying, she says.         
	After some prodding she says her father went paragliding. I didnt go because I felt scared, she admits.        
	Twenty-eight-year-old Aditi Sen, who religiously avoids the gym when in Calcutta, was so happy after paragliding in Phuket that she and her husband lined up for kayaking in Koh Samui.         
	We were the only Indians in the group and everyone else was so much fitter. We never imagined the kind of fitness it requires to row in seawater. Blissfully unaware of the do and donts, I even dropped my oars and started clicking. My husband had to really struggle to keep the kayak going. Our German instructor was quite alarmed and kept shouting: India, India, dont stray away from the group, she laughs.        
	The technology dazzles some others. Soma Bose, who lives in a 16th floor south Calcutta apartment and teaches English in a school, went for a holiday to Singapore and Hong Kong. She is yet to recover from a laser show from Sentosa (Singapore). We went to Sentosa and watched a show with lights.... the lights that you see in signboards of Phillips and Sony, she says.         
	Swanky airports are the gateways to these glittering worlds. Some visitors come back to talk at length about the airports. The Singapore airport is a sight to behold. Its clean and glittering with trains running through the sky within the airport, says Soma. Buses touch the road at stops so that a wheelchair- bound person can wheel herself in. Wonder of wonders, you can only cross the road at a zebra crossing when the light turns red. Singapore particularly, is a glittering world with wonderful shopping opportunities.         
	There is a mall every half kilometre, says Kavita.        
	And on the Net, someone is spotted asking the famous question: Where do you get good Bengali food in Bangkok?

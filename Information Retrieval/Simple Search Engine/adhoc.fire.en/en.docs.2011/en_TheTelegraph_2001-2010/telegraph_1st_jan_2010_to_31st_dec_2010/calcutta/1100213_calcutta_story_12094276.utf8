The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heres looking at the hats and not the horses   Hat vs horse
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Heres looking at the hats and not the horses     - Gang of girls in race to make and flaunt headgear on the sidelines of Queens Cup          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                    THROW YOUR HAT INTO THE RING: Nikki Mitra (left) and Laura Miller at work on their headgear for the Queen rsquo;s Cup.

	One has feathers plucked straight from the feather-duster, another has red ribbons lacing its broad brim. Both are in the running to win Best Hat, with a tilt here and a tweak there, while the horses sweat it out for the Queens Cup at at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club on Saturday.        
	The ladies who will make, sport and throw their hats into the ring are a group of foreigners who have made Calcutta their home for now and who wish to bring a touch of English royalty to racing here. The hat is something that modern-day fashion doesnt seem to have room for, and the only one we get to wear in Calcutta is a sun hat. So were definitely not letting go of this chance to make a style statement, smiles 30-year-old Nikki Mitra from Chicago, married to a Bengali settled in Calcutta.        
	Nikki belongs to the Kolkata International Womens Club for foreign passport holders in the city. Eight ladies from the club  some wearing different hats of homemaker, teacher and consular official  are up to their brim with ideas for the coolest contest at the races.        
	Crowning the Best Hat is a tradition that is still followed in the Saratoga Race Course in New York on Derby Day, which is where I come from. Last year at the Queens Cup we realised that our hats were missing. So we thought this year why not get together like-minded hatters and make them ourselves, says Laura Miller, who runs the American School at the US consulate and will attend the race for the third year on the trot.        
	The link between hats and the Queens Cup was forged on February 18, 1961 when Queen Elizabeth II visited RCTC with Prince Philip. She wore an elegant headpiece with floral motifs and trimmed with net. The Queens Cup goes back to 1856 and carries tremendous tradition. In the old days, it was a race that carried more significance than the Derby, says Cyrus Madan, the chairman of RCTC. We are hoping that the hat-making contest will bring back the English glamour long associated with the Queens Cup.        
	The ladies are betting big on the bonnets. Research has been intensive and the eight have also looked up the website of celebrity hat designer Philip Treacy for inspiration.                          
	Weve used feather-dusters to pluck peacock feathers, bought lace and net, rolled ribbons into flowers and wrapped sponge with velvet to make headpieces, explains Laura who wants to keep the final look under the hat. We dont want to give it away because its a competition, she smiles.        
	Madan, meanwhile, has set his stakes on Aemilia for the Queens Cup.        
	Thats a horse, not a hatter.

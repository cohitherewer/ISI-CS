The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The answer, my friend...
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          The answer, my friend...

	From identifying a film with the help of a visual to remembering which cartoon character turned 70 in 2004, the east zone finals of the inter-DPS quiz held on May 7 at DPS Ruby Park was a roller-coaster ride.                  Prizes for the quiz-wizards       
	The participants came from across eastern India, including Guwahati, Bokaro and Jamshedpur. Six teams, whittled down from an initial 16, took part, with DPS Ruby Park and DPS New Town emerging the winners. They will represent the east zone in the national finals. Quizzing helps students acquire knowledge. This years theme, the Commonwealth Games, helped the children learn a lot about sports, said Anusree Ghose, the principal of the Ruby Park school.        
	The contest comprised five rounds, including a Commonwealth, a general, an audio-visual, a subject-related and a hot-seat round. The audio-visual round was the turning point, with the leading team, DPS Ruby Park taking on a difficult question, although a wrong answer would have meant negative marking and subsequent loss. They correctly identified the film My Fair Lady from a visual of Audrey Hepburn. It was one of my favourite moments as a quizmaster. The team had the courage to take the risk of losing, said quizmaster Pranam Roy. But the budding quiz enthusiasts did not pore over quiz books for preparation. We looked up the Internet and watched television, smiled Aniket De and Abhishek Ghose of DPS New Town, which had qualified for last years east zone finals as well.

	Ahana Das  
	The 18-year-old student of Aditya Academy Senior Secondary School, Barasat persevered with her studies even though a brain tumour she has had since she was eight, makes it difficult for her to retain information or write continuously for a long time.         
	The malignant tumour, located at the meeting point of two optic nerves, was detected when she was eight. The doctors did not risk removing it as it could have disturbed the optic nerve, causing blindness, explained her father Apurba Das.         
	Two years ago, she lost sensation completely in the left portion of her body because of a brain haemorrhage and was in hospital for 20 days. She enjoys studying, but its no cakewalk. I take anti-convulsant drugs, which affects my ability to retain what I learn, said the girl, who secured a B2 grade in English.               
	Kruthika Ramakrishnan        
	The 17-year-old from Apeejay School, Park Street, emerged with flying colours in her first board exams, despite having severe hearing impairment since birth.         
	Though the problem existed since birth, it was detected only after she turned five. Despite her disability, her parents always sent to her to a regular school, whether in Delhi or when the family moved to the city three years ago.         
	We did not want her to feel that she was different in any way, said Akila. Though she uses a hearing aid, classroom lessons are not easy for her. My friends would have to repeat the dictated portions to me, said the girl, who scored an A2 in social science. She wants to be a florist.               
	Rumela Mitra        
	The student of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School got an A1 grade in all subjects despite her mother being severely ill for most of last year. In June last year, Rumelas mother was detected with breast cancer. She was in Mumbai for treatment from June to January, said Rumela.         
	Though she had to juggle household chores with studies, she did not let difficulties get the better of her. There were times when I would worry about my moms health, but I would tell myself that worrying wouldnt take me anywhere, but studying would, she recalled.         
	Sreya Bar        
	The student of Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan suffers from Hodgkins lymphoma, a type of cancer, which was detected in June 2008. She is under treatment at the Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai and has to travel there often, said her mother. She has to make up for long stretches of absence in school by studying extra hard. She had to miss her board exams last year because of her illness, but the 17-year-old made up for it with A1 and A2 grades in most subjects.               
	Jyotsana Mundhra        
	The 16-year-old was hospitalised for most of 2009 because of severe ulcers in her stomach. The problem surfaced in February 2008 and Jyotsana has been under treatment since.         
	She suffers from terrible stomach aches. We took her to Hyderabad for treatment, because of which she missed school for long stretches and could not appear for her board exams last year, said mother Meenakshi.        
	Jyotsna remembers being in pain for 10 days at a stretch before the pain subsided. She still managed to bag B1 in Hindi and Social Science.

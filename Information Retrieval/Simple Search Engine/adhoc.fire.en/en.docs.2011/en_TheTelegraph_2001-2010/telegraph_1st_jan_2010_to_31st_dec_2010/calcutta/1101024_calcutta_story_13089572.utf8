           Baul Arjun Khyapa                           
	lApropos the report Art for the mart, September 19, the change in the fortunes of the folk artistes in the wake of the changing taste of art lovers bodes well for the future of all art genres. That the appeal of Baul music hasnt died is evident from its popularity today. Bauls are even being invited to perform abroad. Similarly, pat chitrakars are in a better position to market their works. The survival of both groups depends on their ability to adapt to the tastes of the contemporary world.           
	However, there are some folk artistes who are surviving despite not changing with the times. Lalan Fakirs songs and some exponents of Chhau dance retain their charm simply because they have not modified their art form.

	Apropos That Nineties Show, September 12, the first thing that comes to my mind is letter writing. In 1995-96, I used to watch my brother write long letters and send beautiful cards and photographs to his penfriend in America. He used to eagerly wait for her reply. We saw so many lovely photos of the American landscape, the girls house and her pets. The eagerness to write long letters is lost today. Children just post scraps on Facebook or Orkut. But these can never be as personal as writing a letter.

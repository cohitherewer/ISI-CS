	Forum Projects is all revved up to launch what its man- aging director Rahul Saraf calls the Re programme  renovation, repositioning and retrofitting of existing holdings over the next 12 months.         
	Its biggest project in the pipeline is Atmosphere on the Bypass. The set of luxury condominiums, Saraf claims, will become the face of Calcutta. The project will comprise villas stacked on top of each other, each with a private garden and lap pool.        
	The group, that on Friday launched Forum malls 42,000sq ft annexe called The Courtyard, also has 3.7 million sq ft of retail space under construction, with malls coming up in Jamshedpur, Bhubaneswar, Howrah and Rourkela. On the EM Bypass, it is planning a 1 million sq ft PC Chandra mall.         
	We discovered that people travel three to four hours to go to a mall in Bhubaneswar. We decided to build a regional mall that would be large enough (9.5 lakh sq ft) for people to comfortably spend five to six hours in, explained Saraf.         
	Forum Projects is also building homes  Forum Pravesh in Howrah  and IT infrastructure  in Bantala.         
	The group has several mixed-use development projects in Adityapur, Bantala and Howrah on its radar too. Besides a mall, these projects will include hospitals, hotels, sports clubs and residential units.

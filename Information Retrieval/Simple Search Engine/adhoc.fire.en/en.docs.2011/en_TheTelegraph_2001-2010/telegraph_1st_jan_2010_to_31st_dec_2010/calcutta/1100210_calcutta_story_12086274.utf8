The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Summer set for early entry
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Summer set for early entry

	The end of what has been one of the coldest winters in Calcutta is near and summer is only a month away, according to meteorologists.        
	The minimum temperature on Tuesday rose to 17.5 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal, and would climb steadily henceforth, predicted the weatherman.        
	From the middle of February, there is expected to be a transitional phase for a month or so before summer sets in. April is the first of the official summer months.        
	The temperatures will now be on the rise. The chill factor will be missing. With abundant moisture coming in from the Bay of Bengal and an active western disturbance inducing a cloud cover, the weather will be humid for the next few days, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore.        
	The transitional phase could loosely be termed spring. In Indian meteorology, however, there is no spring, added Debnath.        
	The India Meteorological Department (IMD) does not have a provision for long-range forecasts for summer. Independent meteorologists said summer will arrive around March and pack a punch in April.        
	Calcutta will have the initial weak phase of summer from the first week of March. But its not going to get very hot before April, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private met agency.        
	March could be cooler than normal with twice the usual number of thunderstorms and squalls on the radar.        
	Calcutta is likely to get at least six squalls instead of the usual three to four in March, added Sharma.        
	What factors determine the onset of summer in Calcutta?        
	A large number of factors are taken into account. Broadly speaking, summer starts in Calcutta after the maximum temperature reaches 35 degrees Celsius or beyond and the minimum temperature crosses 20 degrees Celsius, said a senior scientist from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida.

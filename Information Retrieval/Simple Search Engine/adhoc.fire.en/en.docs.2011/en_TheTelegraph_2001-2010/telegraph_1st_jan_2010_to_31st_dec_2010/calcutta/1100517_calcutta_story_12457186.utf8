The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | She versus he in fight for city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      She versus he in fight for city
                                          
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did on Sunday what Mamata Banerjee had done last Thursday: launch his campaign for civic poll 2010. Metro compares and contrasts the first day, first show of the chief minister and his arch rival              
	When and where        
	Mamata Banerjee: At 30B Harish Chatterjee Street, a makeshift Trinamul Congress office beside her residence.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: The third floor of Muzaffar Ahmed Bhavan on Alimuddin Street, the state CPM headquarters.        
	On the dais        
	MB: Flanked by Subrata Mukherjee, Partha Chatterjee, Mukul Roy, Subrata Bakshi, Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, Madan Mitra, Purnendu Bose, Dola Sen and Mohua Moitra.        
	BB: Alone.        
	Vision for Calcutta        
	MB: We will make Calcutta a London. We will beautify the city, make it green and clean.        
	BB: Trinamul leaders are saying they will convert Calcutta into a London. I dont find any logic in such a thought. Its absolutely irrational. Its a thoughtless assertion. The Left Front will continue with its sustained civic work.        
	Stephen Court        
	MB: Such a big fire claimed so many lives. Firefighting was pathetic. Many bodies were never found. This government had set the building on fire.        
	BB: The Trinamul is saying we had set it ablaze and also removed some bodies. This is ridiculous. People in Hitlers and Mussolinis parties used to say such things.        
	Smile moment        
	MB: When releasing the Trinamul manifesto. This is a very good moment for us, she beamed.        
	BB: When asked whether the CPM can regain lost ground. People are realising what Trinamul is. In the Lok Sabha, many people went against us. But after assessing what they (Trinamul) are doing, more and more people have begun thinking now, he smiled, almost sardonically.        
	Snarl moment        
	MB: When asked whether the Congress could cut into Trinamul votes. Please vote for Trinamul. Dont split the anti-Left vote as some agents of the CPM want, she thundered.        
	BB: When reminded of Trinamuls allegation that the government was trying to create a riot-like situation. How can she make such irresponsible statements? Never has there been a talk about riots during elections. (She) has bought the language of the crime world into politics, raged the chief minister.        
	Congress hand        
	MB: Blasted sections of the Congress as agents of CPM and appealed to the electorate not to split the anti-Left vote.        
	BB: Claimed Congress was forced to break the alliance as Trinamul is a violent party, without any programme.        
	No-holds barred        
	MB: Accused the CPM of spreading state-sponsored terror and claimed it had lost the right to rule. Next years Assembly elections should be advanced and held this October, she roared.        
	BB: Rubbished her demand saying only the state government had the prerogative to ask for early elections. Trinamul is a blind, violent and venomous party, he sneered.        
	Poll plank        
	MB: Vote for change, vote for the beautification and betterment of Calcutta.        
	BB: Opt for our sustained civic work. The middle class, working class and the youth must help disperse the dark clouds gathering over the state because of Trinamul.        
	Poll forecast        
	MB: We will win Calcutta and several municipalities.        
	BB: Our results will be better than the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Tone        
	MB: Confident.        
	BB: Aggressive.        
	Body language        
	MB: She appeared as if her party was already in power in the CMC as well as at Writers Buildings.        
	BB: He put up a brave face but seemed unsure of end results.        
	Lasting impression        
	MB: Has had enough of being the chief minister in waiting; is in a hurry to win the battle for Bengal.        
	BB: Has his back to the wall.              
	How would you rate the two on a scale of 10? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com              ANINDYA SENGUPTA

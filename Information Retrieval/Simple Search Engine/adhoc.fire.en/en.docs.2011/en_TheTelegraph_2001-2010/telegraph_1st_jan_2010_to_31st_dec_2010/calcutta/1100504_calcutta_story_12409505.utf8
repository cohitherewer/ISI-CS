                      Faith and scientific consciousness                    Resistant to symbolic interpretation, Mehreen Murtazas work in Who Are You, Defenders Of The Universe? provokes irresolvable mental collisions of the strange with the familiar. Her visual narratives intertwine a traditional background with popular culture. Absorbing both Sufi influences and the skewed logic of science fiction, her digital collages are a virtual world that harnesses intelligent fictions. Through her work, the viewer confronts the devastation and bereftness of religious iconography and symbols that hold us steady in the world. An atmosphere of subversion is borne directly out of todays socio-religious context, wherein modern day computing and technology collide with religious myth, superstition and ritual. Presented by Experimenter in collaboration with GreyNoise, Lahore.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Pakistani artist Mehreen Murtaza When: Till June 5 (except Sundays); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Experimenter, 2/1 Hindusthan Road

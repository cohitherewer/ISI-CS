The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea for more subjects   at college
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Plea for more subjects   at college
          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Calcutta University on Tuesday decided to consider whether the state-run Sanskrit College could be allowed to offer honours and pass courses in conventional subjects other than Sanskrit.        
	The college, an affiliate of Calcutta University, now offers only honours courses in Sanskrit at the undergraduate level. The students are required to attend classes in pass papers at Presidency College.        
	The practice, however, will have to be scrapped once Presidency College becomes a unitary university.        
	The state government has recently written to CU, urging the authorities to allow Sanskrit College to offer pass and honours courses in subjects such as English, Bengali, history, political science and philosophy.        
	The proposal was placed before the university syndicate on Tuesday.         
	We will examine whether Sanskrit College has the infrastructure to start undergraduate courses in other conventional subjects, said pro vice-chancellor (academic) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee.        
	A section of syndicate members, however, said the government should also consider whether Sanskrit College students could attend pass classes at any other college other than Presidency.        
	 Court ransacked: A Howrah district and sessions court judge lodged an FIR against Sukanto Bose, a 32-year-old lawyer, for ransacking his court on Tuesday afternoon while a case was being heard. Bose got into an argument with the judge and overturned a table and broke a window in the courtroom, according to the complaint.        
	 Found dead: A 26-year-old homemaker, Panja Devi, was found dead on the veranda of a primary school near her home at Alambazar, on the northern city fringes, on Tuesday morning.         
	She had moved to the locality along with her husband Badal Shaw, a truck driver, six months ago and had been staying in a rented house. Shaw is absconding.         
	 Man held: Munna Khan, 38, was arrested with a country-made revolver on Muktaram Babu Street on Monday night.         
	Police said the revolver had a bullet inside. Police are trying to ascertain Khans antecedents.         
	 Bike theft: A bike was stolen from Bishu Babu Lane in Watgunge on Monday. The owner, Indranil Roy, lodged a complaint with police.        
	 Embezzlement: Mantu Haldar 37, an employee of a finance company in Burrabazar, was arrested in his Dum Dum house on Tuesday on the charge of stealing Rs 8,80,000 from the office on Monday. Police seized Rs 8,50,000 from him.         
	The police said he had committed the theft in the afternoon and went home.         
	He was arrested following a complaint by the companys manager.

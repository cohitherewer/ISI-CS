The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Time tweak in early take-off   On board amp; airborne before time
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Time tweak in early take-off

	Airlines that were struggling to maintain on-time performance while flying out of congested Calcutta airport have suddenly nosed ahead of time.        
	Forget delays, flights have been taking off before schedule over the past two weeks, said an official at the city airport, which used to be a pilots nightmare during peak hours.        
	The tweak that did the trick for the airlines was a directive from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to close check-in counters 45 minutes before departure  the previous deadline was one hour  and complete boarding 15 minutes prior to take-off.                    
	With all flight procedures completed ahead of schedule, pilots have been routinely seeking permission from air traffic control to become airborne before the official departure time. This is not only ensuring that passengers reach their destinations on time, but also easing congestion on the runway, said Vijay Matta, the chairman of the Airlines Operators Committee.        
	But arent the early take-offs hampering other operations?         
	Airport authorities said air traffic control was co-ordinating with the Military Liaison Unit while giving clearance for take-off ahead of time to avoid a clash of schedules. Various airlines on-time performance has increased by more than 20 per cent, said a senior official.         
	The trend of early take-off has also reduced clustering of flights lined up for departure. Earlier, if an airline delayed boarding by 30 minutes, there would be congestion in the security hold as well as the runway, the official said.  
	WHAT HAS CHANGED  
	Check-in counter closes 45 minutes before departure
  Boarding 15 minutes before take-off  
	WHAT IT MEANS  
	Pilot can take-off early with ATC rsquo;s permission
  Runway is decongested
  Flier reaches destination ahead of time

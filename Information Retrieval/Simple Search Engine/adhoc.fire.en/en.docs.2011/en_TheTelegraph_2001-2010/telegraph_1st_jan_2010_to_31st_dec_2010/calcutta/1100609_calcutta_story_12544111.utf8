                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Winds of change for safe Metro

	If the state government has its way, the security of Metro Railway would soon be entirely in the hands of the Railway Police Force (RPF) or the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).        
	The home ministry has called state home secretary Samar Ghosh and additional director-general (railways) Dilip Mitra for a meeting, to be held in New Delhi on Wednesday, on Metro rail security.        
	Ghosh said on Tuesday that his government would ask the ministry to consider handing over the reins of policing Metro Railway to the RPF or the CISF.        
	Metro Railway is presently manned by Calcutta police till Tollygunge, beyond which it is manned by the state police. RPF personnel also keep guard throughout.        
	We will ask the Centre to consider the CISF or the RPF for handling Metro rails security. There is an urgent need for more personnel, said Ghosh. A total of 884 personnel (excluding the RPF) guard the stations as of now.        
	Safer Metro is the primary agenda of the meeting. Lets see what happens, said Mitra, refusing to comment on the states proposed recommendation.        
	Railway board officials said the matter had to come to the railways through the Centre for them to take a final decision.        
	If the state sends such a recommendation and the Centre refers it to the railway board, the board will take a call, said a Metro official.        
	Security for over five lakh daily Metro commuters has become a major issue in the wake of terror attacks across the country.

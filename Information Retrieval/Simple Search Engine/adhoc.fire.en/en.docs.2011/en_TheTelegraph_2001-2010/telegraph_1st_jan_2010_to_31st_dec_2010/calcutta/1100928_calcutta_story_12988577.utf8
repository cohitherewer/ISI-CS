The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | To brink and back, diary of   a trek   Trek no more
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      To brink and back, diary of   a trek
  - IT employee recounts ordeal in landslide-littered hills of Uttarakhand                              A picture taken by Samudra Bose (below) shows a tourist being helped across a makeshift bridge made of tree trunks over a gushing river in Uttarakhand                                                  
	Trekker Samudra Bose, 35, pointed to a black dot on the Uttarakhand map that had just popped up on his laptop screen and exclaimed: I still cant believe I made it back from there.        
	Metro met the IBM employee at his Kasba Rajdanga home hours after his return on Monday to compile a tour diary of his trek through the landslide-littered terrain.         
	Sept. 11: After months of planning, five of us  me, Sabyasachi Bose, Amitabha Manna, Dipamoy Saha and wife Sohini  are finally on the train to Hardwar.         
	Sept. 12: Its evening and the lights have come on in Hardwar. But we have to make it to Dehradun tonight; so we hire a taxi.        
	Sept. 13: The skies are heavy, not a good sign for us. But whats a trek without challenges? Off we go to base camp Sankri (5,800ft) via Chakrata. But it has started raining heavily, forcing us to spend the night at Tiuni.        
	Sept. 14: We need to play catch-up. We reach Sankri around 10am and bid goodbye to our driver. This was the last motorable lap of our journey; no cellphone signals either. We start trekking and reach Taluka, around 8km away, by dusk. It is drizzling and Sohini and Dipamoy, the greenhorns in our group, are in bad shape. Sohinis legs are swollen. I am afraid they wont be able to proceed.        
	Sept. 15: Sabyasachi, Amitabha and I trek towards Seema, 13km from Taluka. The weather has improved but Amitabha, who has a dodgy back, is grounded.        
	Sept. 16: Sabyasachi and I resume trekking and reach Har-Ki-Doon (11,699ft), only to be greeted by a downpour. We are told that there are landslides all over.         
	Sept. 17: Since we cant turn back because of the landslides, we might as well see the Jaundhar glacier. What a spectacle!        
	Sept. 18: Its raining sporadically but we trek to Seema, where Amitabha is waiting. We also meet a six-member group from Chinsurah, who have since been reported missing. Unfortunately, the rain is back.        
	Sept. 19: The three of us start trekking down even as the other group contemplates whether they should continue the climb to Dhumdarkandi Pass. This is the rainiest day of our trek. The bridge over the Tomsa has been washed away. We climb a rock face in near-darkness and cross a rivulet using felled trees as a bridge to reach Datmer.        
	Sept. 20: We make our way down and cross a rickety iron bridge. The 10km route to Taluka stretches to 28km but we are relieved to meet Dipamoy and Sohini. The bad news is that all roads to Sankri are blocked.        
	Sept. 21: Its raining so hard that we stay back.                      
	Sept. 22: We reach Purola through an alternative route but Sohini has taken ill. Amitabhs back problem has also flared up.         
	Sept. 23: I accompany an Asansol team to Barkote. The idea is to find help to get the others out.        
	Sept. 24: My family gets in touch with the Uttarakhand authorities through the numbers published in Metro. An official calls to say that those stranded at Barkote would be airlifted.         
	Sept. 25: I board the Doon Express from Dehradun but my thoughts are with my friends, who havent been airlifted yet.        
	Sept. 26: My friends are brought to Dehradun by road, from where Sabyasachi and Amitabha take the Kumbh Express. Dipamoy and Sohini head for Delhi.        
	Sept. 27: The first thing my wife Moumita tells me is: I wont allow you to go trekking anymore.        
	For now, I am just glad to hold on to my five-year-old son Soumit.        
	As told to Tamaghna Banerjee

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Challan waiting to be born for 16 months
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Challan waiting to be born for 16 months
  - Puff ban goes up in smoke as pre-natal complications slow down paperwork          RITH BASU                                                  
	Receipts and challans necessary to slap fines on those who flout the smoking ban in public places are suffering from severe pre-natal complications of the bureaucratic kind, raising fears of the project being stillborn in Bengal.        
	The law, that came into effect of October 2, 2008, stipulates that a fine of Rs 200 be imposed on puff offenders in public places, like offices, railway stations, eateries, hospitals and educational institutions. But not one offender has been slapped with a fine in Bengal over 16 months. The official reason for the failure? The receipts (for those who are fined Rs 200 on the spot) and challans (for those who cant pay up on the spot) are yet to be born.        
	And what explains the pregnancy of pachydermal proportions (the African elephant takes 18-22 months)?        
	Satyaban Ghosh, the nodal officer of the state tobacco control cell, traced the never-ending journey of the challan from early 2009. We had printed over 25,000 challans but there was a need to get all departments together. So, a task force-cum-monitoring committee comprising representatives of different government departments was set up.        
	Enter, red tape. The task forces first meeting was slated for July 24 but a transport strike ensured an adjournment. The next meeting was on September 15, when representatives of 15 departments debated where the proceeds from the fines would go. A month later, a proposal was sent to the finance department to create a new head of accounts under the health department to handle the puff fines (see box).        
	We are in touch with the accountant-general and hope to get the formal sanction soon. By mid-March we hope to start the process of fine collection, said an official overseeing the implementation of the tobacco ban in Bengal.        
	The education and panchayat and rural development departments have received a bunch of receipts and challans, but without the sanction they are useless pieces of paper.        
	Isnt the whole process taking just too long in Bengal? Aniruddha Kar, the director of health services, seemed to favour the slow motion. We never put too much accent on fines. Coercive tactics lead to resistance in the people and the root problem remains. We must build awareness.        
	Our lungs be damned.

	The Bengal government is planning to set up a body to regulate both private and state-aided schools in the wake of the La Martiniere controversies, school education minister Partha De said on Friday.         
	We are shocked to know the way students are being treated in some top schools in Calcutta, such as the La Martiniere for Boys. The government is examining all possible ways to prevent the victimisation of children, said De.        
	The minister clarified that there would be no government intervention in the Rouvanjit Rawla and Sanjay Smart cases as La Martiniere for Boys enjoys special minority status.        
	A high court division bench, headed by Chief Justice M.S. Shah, on Friday allowed an advocate, Tapas Bhanja, to file an affidavit stating the details of Rouvanjits death within four weeks.        
	During the hearing of a case related to corporal punishment in schools across the state, Bhanja, the petitioner, said Rouvanjit had committed suicide after being slapped and caned by principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi.        
	He requested the court to ask the government to issue a notification to schools under Church of North India and madarsas asking them to inform teachers that they would be punished if they subject students to corporal punishment.         
	The judges also asked Bhanja to find out whether students in other schools faced corporal punishment.

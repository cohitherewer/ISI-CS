                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Look amp; feel the wheel deal
  - The Telegraph Auto Carnival is back this festive weekend          ANASUYA BASU                          A birds eye view of the 2009 car carnival at 22 Camac Street                                         
	The Telegraph Auto Weekend Carnival is revving up to give the car-loving Calcuttan his first look and feel of two brand new beauties.        
	From Friday till Sunday, the carnival at 22 Camac Street will be the city launchpad for the countrys first indigenous crossover vehicle, the Tata Aria, and the new, improved Skoda Fabia.        
	Volkswagen and Honda, both first-time participants at the fair, will add to the wheel deal by showcasing some of the best from their stables.        
	While a sunny yellow, curvaceous New Beetle is set to be the showstopper on the final day of the fair, other hot wheels set to be top draws are the Honda Jazz, the Mitsubishi Outlander and the Toyota hybrid Prius.         
	We are expecting a lot of drop-ins for the Aria, which is coming to the city for the first time, said a Tata Motors spokesperson. We have been participating in the carnival right from when it started and our stall is always crowded. The carnival is both a brand building and a direct sales activity for us, and we do manage to convert quite a few of the enquiries into actual sales later, he added.        
	For Skoda, the fair is a testing ground for the Fabia following a facelift. We sold quite a few of the old Fabia during the previous carnivals. We hope the revamped product (unveiled on October 14) will also generate a lot of excitement, said a Skoda spokesperson.         
	Japanese giant Honda is banking on its headturning, premium hatchback Jazz to add zing to its stall. It is more of a branding exercise for us. But if customers show interest, we will have company representatives handling enquiries as well, said a Honda marketing executive.         
	Rival Toyota, a regular at the fair, will showcase its Corolla Altis diesel and the hybrid Prius. There will be a separate kiosk for Etios, our new small car to be launched next month. The idea is to create a buzz, said Ashok Manaktala of Topsel Toyota.        
	Volkswagen is looking to build awareness about its brand. The venue and the timing  in the run-up to Dhanteras and Diwali  are added advantages. The premium shopping address will have potential customers for the Jetta and the Passat, said a Volkswagen official.         
	American carmaker Ford will be present again, this time with its bestselling Fiesta and the new kid on the block, Figo.        
	For those contemplating a car purchase this Diwali, principal sponsor SBI will be at hand with various loan options. Last year, we had a 10 per cent conversion rate. This is the only auto fair in the city and now the market has also grown, said Madhumita Chatterjee of SBI.        
	The two-wheeler segment will see Hero Honda vroom in with its 223cc Karizma ZMR, priced at Rs 1 lakh, the Hero Honda Hunk and the Splendor NXG.

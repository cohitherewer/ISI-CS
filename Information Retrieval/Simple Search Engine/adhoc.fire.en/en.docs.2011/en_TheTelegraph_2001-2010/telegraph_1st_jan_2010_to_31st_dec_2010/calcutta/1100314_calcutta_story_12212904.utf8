                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Punish peeves
          Teachers in city schools are struggling hard to find the right way of disciplining students in these sensitive times, says Chandreyee Chatterjee                           A scene from Pather Panchali where Apu is being punished in public by the village teacher-cum-grocer                      
	Corporal punishment is out of the question. The threat of psychological trauma looms large when they are stern with students. It is a tough time for teachers now.               
	With the growing incidence of suicides by students, and the fear of triggering extreme emotion or being sued becoming widespread, teachers say that they may have to think twice even before asking a student to step out for disturbing the class.         
	We have no option but to spare not just the rod but also other kinds of disciplining methods, says a teacher of Birla High School.               
	Power shift        
	Discipline in schools was seen more as a problem of the First World. Indian students were known to be, and often parodied as, a reverential lot. The reality was always more complex than stereotypes, but schools face the problem of discipline so much more now that the myth of the subservient Indian student is no longer in currency.        
	In schools now we see a lot of defiant behaviour among students, disrespect, callous attitude, extreme carelessness, lack of sensitivity, tendency for physical abuse, assault and strong aggression, says Salony Priya, a psychologist who deals with student problems.         
	If teachers could be autocratic earlier, a different power equation is settling in now.         
	A lot has to do with change in parental attitude over the years.         
	Over the last decade or so, as the nation, its economy, its lifestyle have changed, parents have become a different breed. At one point we would have parents coming up to us and saying my son doesnt listen to me at home; maybe he will listen to you. Now if we try to discipline children, parents say you are too strict with them so they are afraid of coming to school, says a class teacher of a south Calcutta school.        
	When the parents of a child in a south Calcutta school, who did not perform well in the class test and the first term examination, were told that they needed to monitor his studies, the teachers were not prepared for the answer. The parents told me in front of the child that we had singled him out from the beginning and deliberately wanted to fail him, says a teacher.        
	Parents often feel that their children are entitled to freedoms that they were deprived of  money, gadgets, and also in school. Children are used to getting their way at home. They expect it at school too.         
	If playing truant was going to watch first-day first-show of a movie a generation or two earlier, it may be endorsed by parents now.         
	When a south Calcutta school called the parents of two students who were found roaming around the city in their school uniform for two days during school hours, the parents did not think it wrong.        
	One parent said his daughter was incapable of doing something like this and the other asked if kids wouldnt do all this at this age when would they do it, says a teacher.               
	Mobile matters        
	The age of consumption and awareness adds to the trouble. Children today have a very low threshold of frustration. Being habituated to instant gratification, they become impatient when they dont get something. They are also more aware and sensitive and have a sense of self-esteem because of their exposure and are therefore more vulnerable, says psychologist Mohormala Chatterjee, who works with students.        
	Technology creates mischief at school.         
	Earlier students would pass around chits and sometimes we could spot them doing it. Now, with mobile phones they send text messages and even if we do catch them it is not too difficult for them to remove the evidence, says a teacher of a Salt Lake school.         
	Priya feels that bringing gadgets like mobiles and iPods to school could itself be an act of defiance, stemming from the feeling I am smart, I will not be caught.        
	And contraband mens magazines in a boys school have been replaced by the MMS.         
	Somewhere along the way teachers have lost their authority, with parents as well as students. It may have to do with the way schools operate, some feel.         
	Many schools take donations of lakhs of rupees for admission and some even charge more than Rs 50,000 as admission fees. Students and their parents often feel that they have bought the service and deserve attention and mollycoddling, says the teacher of a reputed south Calcutta school.        
	Education becomes just a matter of getting on to the next level of life with the maximum advantage, of money, network, degree. What one learns in the process is relegated to the background. Similarly for the givers of knowledge.         
	If they feel they are buying a service, parents do not feel the necessity of putting a teacher on an exalted level. They are openly critical of teachers before the children.         
	Parents need to be more respectful towards the teachers. If they disagree with the teachers they should speak to them separately and not criticise them in front of their wards, says the principal of a school in South Calcutta.              
	Coping strategies         
	The problem cuts across all schools, but is more prevalent in upmarket English-medium schools than in the government-run Bengali medium schools such as Hindu School, Hare School or Ballygunge Government School.        
	It is true that aggression among students has increased. But students of these schools primarily come from middle-class and lower-middle class families and they believe in the value of education. As a result, disrespect for teachers is not that apparent, says Dipak Das, a teacher of the government-run Sanskrit Collegiate School, and the general secretary of the West Bengal Government School Teachers Association.        
	This disregard in the young is not reserved for teachers alone; it stems from the lack of respect the young now generally show to older people.        
	Earlier in joint families there was always someone who you had to treat with respect, whether it was the grandfather, the uncle or even their own father. But now with nuclear families and parents being more friendly, children may not learn to respect their elders. They therefore cant assess how far they can go with teachers, says Chatterjee.        
	The schools are trying to cope. They consciously try to avoid causing emotional harm to the students or getting flak from the parents for disciplining their children.         
	Many schools have now stopped using terms like poor.         
	Schools are bringing in counsellors to hold workshops for teachers for the purpose. Priya conducts workshops for teachers. She says she tries to explain disciplining in a positive light to schools.         
	Discipline should be positive, based on the belief that each child is good and is capable of good behaviour with help. Secondly, it should be active. It should be based on actions that are geared to steer, understand, guide, nurture and lead, she says.         
	Instead of punitive measures, schools are also trying to think of more creative solutions. Students who need disciplining are given a special set of tasks that they enjoy and learn from.         
	We try and assign duties to them where they would have a responsibility and though they know it is a remedial activity they like being responsible for something and therefore start enjoying it. We have had a good response to this, says Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.        
	Involving parents is another option.         
	When a child is giving trouble we take the parents into confidence and ask them what we should do. We take the consent of the parents before taking any step, says Bhagat.         
	Not that these are perfect solutions. Teachers feel that calling parents may also backfire, for the child may take it hard. The safest way was to call the parents. Now that also seems to be a problem. Are we then not supposed to do anything and let students do whatever they like? asks the principal of a school in south Calcutta.        
	He was echoing the feeling of heads of institutions after the death last month of Rouvanjit Rawla, a Class VIII student of La Martiniere for Boys. His parents were called to report an act of indiscipline, following which the 13-year-old was found hanging from the ceiling of his attic. His parents, however, said that it was an accident.        
	We have to understand that we as teachers have to also change with the changing times. Students today are dealing with circumstances that were not there 10 years ago. So age-old practices wont suffice any more, says Rita Chatterjee, the principal of Apeejay School.        
	Psychologists feel what is most required today is the ability of the teacher to keep his or her cool and deal with students with patience and understanding. It is still the teachers job to teach. How to do it at the moment can only be found out through trial and error.

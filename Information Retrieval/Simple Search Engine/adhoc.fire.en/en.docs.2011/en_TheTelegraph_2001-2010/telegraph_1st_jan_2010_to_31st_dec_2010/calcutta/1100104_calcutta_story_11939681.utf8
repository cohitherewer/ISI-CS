                      Glimpses of a world of imagination                    A self-taught artist with an experience in structural engineering, Arnab Basu has already established a distinct style of his own. Spacious and atmospheric, his works project an immediate effect upon the consciousness and draws the viewer into the heart and soul of his paintings. Created with earthy and neutral colours, they produce a mix of subtle feelings through their meditative ambience. His mastery of oil on canvas and the wide spectrum of his art influence, ranging from Oriental tribal motifs to European surrealism, are evident in the scope of his expression. Basus works have been exhibited all over the country and have found pride of place both in India and abroad. Emerging from the twilight borders between dreams and wakefulness, each of his works produces a world, where the real and the unreal fuse together in a liquid harmony. Inspired by contemporary myths as much as ancient history and legend, his works are magical in their own way, fantastic in a manner similar to the illustrations found in childrens fairy tales, yet realistic enough to demand serious thought and attention. The ongoing solo show presents his latest works where art lovers get a rare opportunity to savour and experience his unique world.            Event: A solo exhibition of paintings by Arnab Basu When: Till January 17; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Bodhi Tree- Monastery of Art, 48/44 Swiss Park (near Rabindra Sarobar Metro station)

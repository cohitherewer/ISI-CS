                      Glimpses of changing times                    Two photography exhibitions, one by renowned art critic Richard Bartholomew and the second by his son, legendary photojournalist Pablo Bartholomew, bear visually stunning witness to the social and cultural evolution of urban India from the 1950s to the 1980s. Richard Bartholomew was one of the first art critics to start a serious dialogue with the painters of his time. He created a community with them and engendered a sense of direction at a time when the public was not fully receptive to the bold, artistic exploration of Indias Progressive Art Movement. A Critics Eye, a collection of photographs by him, provides a rare glimpse of the beginnings of modernism in India. A Tale of Three Cities, Pablo Bartholomews body of photographs, serves as a chronicle of the shifting nature, character and function of Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta during the 1970s.                    Event: Exhibition of photographs by Richard Bartholomew and Pablo Bartholomew When: Till September 25 (except Sunday); 12 noon - 7 pm Where: The Harrington Street Arts Centre, 8 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, 2nd floor, Flat no. amp; 25 B

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                               
	The process followed by Jadavpur University in selecting sponsored candidates for the MTech course in electronics and telecommunication has come under the high court scanner following a petition by an applicant.        
	Suparna De, the petitioner, claimed the authorities had tweaked rules and denied her a chance to pursue the course to admit two students of their choice.        
	Justice Aniruddha Basu, after hearing out both sides on Thursday, directed the university to furnish all relevant documents related to the selection of sponsored candidates for the MTech course. The case will be heard again on July 27.        
	Sponsored candidates are those who are working and whose fees are borne by the employers.        
	My client had ranked third in the merit list published after the written test for selecting five sponsored candidates for the course. She was called for counselling on June 21, said Basabi Roy Chowdhury, who represented De.        
	But on June 22, the authorities declared that a fresh counselling would be held on June 24. In a second merit list published on June 28, my client ranked 10th. Which means she was fifth in the waiting list of five candidates, Roy Chowdhury added.        
	The lawyer alleged that the university had changed admission rules and called a second counselling to admit two candidates of their choice.        
	JU lawyer Debabrata Roy opposed Roy Chowdhurys submission, saying: Des name was put on the waiting list as she has only two years of work experience. The first merit list, Roy added, was published inadvertently.        
	Des lawyer, however, claimed that the admission criteria did not specify any work experience requirement.        
	Besu: The high court on Thursday dismissed a petition moved by the Besu Teachers Association challenging the appointment of Biman Bandyopadhyay as registrar of the institute. The appointment process... is valid and in accordance with law, Justice Debasish Kargupta ruled.        
	The petitioner organisation, which had claimed that Bandyopadhyay lacked academic qualifications for the post, has decided to move an appeal before a division bench.

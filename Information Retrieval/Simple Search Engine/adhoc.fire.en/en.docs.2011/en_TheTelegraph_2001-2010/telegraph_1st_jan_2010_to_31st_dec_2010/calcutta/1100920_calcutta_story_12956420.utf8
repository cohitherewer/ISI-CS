The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fence to save jheel from encroachers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fence to save jheel from encroachers

	The civic body on Sunday started fencing Bikramgarh Jheel in south Calcutta in an attempt to save it from further encroachment.        
	Rampant landfill in violation of all rules has shrunk the jheel, a prominent water body off the South City housing estate on Prince Anwar Shah Road, from 100 bighas in the 1950s to 20 bighas.        
	Several attempts over the past few years to fence the water body had come to naught allegedly following intervention by the realty lobby.        
	In March, a high-powered meeting had been held at Writers Buildings by PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and former mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya to consider ways to preserve the jheel. The meeting had decided to prevent any further landfill by fencing the water body but nothing could be done on the ground.        
	Work to erect the fence finally started today, said Sanchita Mondal, the mayoral council member in charge of environment who personally supervised the work.        
	With help from residents and local councillors, we will fence the entire water body to prevent any further encroachment.        
	Mondal added that the few disputes that had arisen while erecting the fence  poles joined by ropes  had been amicably settled.        
	The jheel area spreads across wards 93 and 95. Tapan Dasgupta, the Trinamul councillor of ward 95, said a 2km fence from the Bikramgarh Harisabha ground to the Poddarnagar II area had been erected on the first day.        
	Mala Mahalanabis, the Trinamul councillor of ward 93, said the civic body would not enter into any confrontation with the encroachers right now. First well complete the fencing and then decide on illegal settlers.                                                                                                  
	Today we have constructed bamboo fencing tied with rope for about 2 km from Bikramgarh Harisabha ground to Poddarnagar II area. We will continue the fencing and decide about the illegal encroachments after a meeting with Mayor stated councillor Dasgupta to Metro.                     
	Bikramgarh jheel was a 100-bigha sprawl even in early 1950s but now measures barely 20 bighas. Residents alleged that the landfill gathered pace over the past five years, since a large residential-cum-commercial estate started coming up in the vicinity.         
	Few hooligans protected by local political leaderships and propped up by real estate lobby have been instrumental in filling up the water body on which the drainage of both the adjacent wards depends heavily. One can find how illegal premises, shanties and even garages have come up in recent time reclaiming the water body.         
	For a change now councilor of adjacent ward Tapan Dasgupta with local people are opposing the fill and I hope the trend will continue observed a local resident.              
	Metro has been consistently highlighting the issue of filling up of Bikramgarh jheel and the recent administrative efforts got wind after a February 23 report.

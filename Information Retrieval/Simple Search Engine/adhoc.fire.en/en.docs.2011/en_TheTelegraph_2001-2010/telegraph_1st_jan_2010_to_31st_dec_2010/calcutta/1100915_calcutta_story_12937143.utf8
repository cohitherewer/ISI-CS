The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Surprise sunshine after wettest day
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Surprise sunshine after wettest day
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Schoolchildren caught in rain on their way home on Tuesday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	After two days of downpour, Ahana Sanyal had all but cancelled her plans to go Puja shopping on Tuesday. But by the time she packed off her kids to school around 10am, the skies suddenly cleared up and the sun shone through.         
	It was quite a surprise. The circulation moved westward into land and dissipated on Tuesday morning, almost as quickly as it had formed on Monday morning, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of Alipore Met office.        
	For most Calcuttans, the bright sunshine was a welcome relief from the waterlogged streets of Monday.        
	The weatherman had forecast a wet Tuesday and the early morning cloud cover flattered to deceive. But after nearly 100mm rain in 24 hours, there were only a few spells of light rain or drizzle in parts of the city and its suburbs on Tuesday.        
	Debnath attributed the surprise sunshine to the sudden dissipation of the cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal that had caused the heavy rain. The circulation was expected to influence the weather over south Bengal through Tuesday, with spells of heavy rain till the evening.         
	With the dissipation of the circulation, its influence died out soon after. Hence the clear skies and scarce rain this morning. It was unexpected, Debnath told Metro.        
	The city received 13.4mm of rain on Tuesday.         
	Without the circulation, the formation of the thunderclouds would depend on the axis of the monsoon trough  a line marking a zone of instability between the westerly and easterly flows that induces heavy rainfall in areas around it  which is passing through south Bengal now.        
	There is little chance of heavy rain over the next 24 hours under the present circumstances. There could be scattered rain in and around the city but not in substantial volume, said Debnath.        
	The dissipation of the cyclonic circulation took with it any hopes of a rejuvenation of the monsoon. The rain count for September now looks unlikely to compensate for the deficit of July and August.        
	There is little chance of September making up for the July-August deficit. However, this months rainfall should at least be on a par with the long period average, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.        
	In the 14 days of this month, the city has received around 60 per cent of the average September rainfall of 295.9mm.

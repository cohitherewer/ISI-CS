The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shower break hope in swelter spell
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shower break hope in swelter spell
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Relief from the swelter, albeit temporary, is on the radar with the weatherman predicting rain or thundershower in the city and its neighbourhood in the next two days.        
	We expect rain and thunderstorms across south Bengal in the next 48 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.         
	Conditions are conducive to Norwesters. It could, however, rain even without a Norwester, Debnath told Metro.        
	According to officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi, strong southerly and south-westerly winds are blowing moisture from the Bay of Bengal to south Bengal. An upper-air cyclonic circulation has also formed over neighbouring Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	The high humidity and the cyclonic circulation would result in rainfall. They have made the conditions conducive to Norwesters as well, said an IMD official.         
	Lets hope the conditions dont flatter to deceive, yet again, he added, referring to how Norwesters and rain have eluded the city despite favourable conditions on most days in the past fortnight.        
	Norwesters, the primary source of relief during summer, are common in March and April. However, they have dried up since last summer. With April almost over, there wont be many this year, fear scientists of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida.        
	March in Calcutta was the hottest in a decade. April too is likely to set a similar record. There arent many Norwesters in May. So the rest of the summer could be hotter and more unbearable, said a senior scientist at the centre.        
	The maximum temperature on Sunday increased from the normal level of 35.9 degrees Celsius (on Saturday) to three degrees above normal at 38.5 degrees Celsius. The minimum too was three degrees above normal at 28.2 degrees Celsius. The mercury would climb down if it rains. But if it doesnt, the temperatures would range between 29 degrees Celsius and 37 degrees Celsius, said a Met official.

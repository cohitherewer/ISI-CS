          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Senior ICSE and ISC board officials will start inspecting city schools on Thursday to identify the ones where centralised evaluation centres would be set up after the exams.        
	The new system, in which examiners and team leaders would sit together at centralised locations and correct answer scripts, is slated to be introduced this year. The ICSE and ISC exams start on March 3.        
	There has to be tight security in all schools where examiners will sit together and correct answer scripts. The inspections will be held to ensure that the arrangements for storing answer scripts in the schools are fool-proof, said Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary of the council and the officiating chief executive and secretary.        
	Schools have been asked to arrange special security for the space to be allotted by them for storing the answer scripts. The storage space will be thoroughly examined during the inspections, added Arathoon.        
	The ISC will continue till April 6 and the ICSE for two more days. The evaluation of answer scripts will start on March 15 and continue till May 15. Nearly 150 centralised evaluation centres will be identified across India, about 30 of them in Calcutta and a dozen in Howrah.         
	Till last year, examiners could take answer scripts home for correction. They had to pick up the answer scripts from temporary distribution centres and return them to team leaders after correction.        
	In the new system, once a student finishes writing a test, the answer script would be sent to the councils Delhi office. From there, the answer scripts will be distributed to the evaluation centres.        
	Teachers will only correct answer scripts from another state to ensure transparency in the marking process and expedite the publication of results.

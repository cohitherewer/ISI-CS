  - Exodus to Trinamul body triggers change in policy          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The state government is set to revoke its decision to sack surplus part-time teachers in state-aided and state-controlled colleges, allegedly to stop them from switching allegiance to the Trinamul Congress.        
	The government had issued an order last year stating that it would not pay the salaries of part-time teachers  fixed between Rs 7,000 and Rs 10,000 by the UGC  once the permanent teaching posts were filled up.        
	Accordingly, after the West Bengal College Service Commission and the West Bengal Public Service Commission, which recruit lecturers for state-aided and state-run colleges, respectively, filled up vacant posts recently, the services of part-time teachers were terminated.        
	Now the plan is to reinstate the part-time teachers who had been sacked.        
	We have been asked to issue the order by the second week of August. We need time to finalise the draft of the order since it would depend on clearance from the finance department, said a senior official of the state government.        
	The official word is that the government wants to retain the part-time teachers to ensure better teaching standard in colleges. Sources said the real reason behind the move is to regain popularity among the 5,500 part-time teachers in the state.        
	The decision to sack part-time teachers had sparked an exodus from the CPM-controlled part-time teachers association to the Trinamul-backed association.         
	More and more part-time teachers who once owed allegiance to the ruling party are now joining our organisation, said Manik Bhattacharya, an advisor to the Trinamul-backed association that claims membership of over 3,500.         
	Over the past few months, part-time teachers had been sacked in several city colleges, including Lady Brabourne College, Maulana Azad College, SA Jaipuria College, Vidyasagar College, Khidderpore College, New Alipore College, Khudiram Bose College and Barasat Government College.        
	Many colleges in the districts also terminated the services of part-time teachers.        
	The principal of a city college said he had no option but to sack part-time teachers as the order stipulated that departments with the sanctioned number of full-time teachers should not have part-timers.        
	The decision created resentment among part-time teachers. They started joining the Trinamul-backed association and threatened to create trouble in colleges All these factors forced a rethink and attempts were made to find a middle path, said an education department official.

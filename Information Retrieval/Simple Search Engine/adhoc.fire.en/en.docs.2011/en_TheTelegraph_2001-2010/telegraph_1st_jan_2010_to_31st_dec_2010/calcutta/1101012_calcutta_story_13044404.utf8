The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Special service for the soul   Message of love to open the door
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Special service for the soul     - A faithful from the pews of the cathedral										      Hilda Peacock                        The Archbishop of Canterbury delivers his message at St Pauls Cathedral on Sunday evening. (Bishwarup Dutta)   The Archbishop of Canterbury at the cathedral				                                 
	The church started filling up by four o clock on Sunday afternoon a good hour before the service was to begin. As soon as one entered and walked under the high arches, the sweet smell of jasmine filled the air. The cathedral, always quiet and serene, seemed even more beautiful as the fragrance of many flowers wafted through the quiet air.        
	From the organ, the strains of J. S. Bachs Jesu Joy of Mans Desiring filled the church. There seemed to be a hushed air of expectancy and even as I sat and waited, the words of the Psalmist came true to me. I was glad when they said to me let us go into the House of the Lord.        
	The Protestant Christian community in Calcutta had been planning this visit for a year when the representatives of the Archbishop of Canterbury came to the city. An evening service at the cathedral was very much on the cards. Preparations began three months ago with the choirs of several churches coming together for weekly practices.        
	The wonderful thing is that the date exactly coincided with the 163rd anniversary of the dedication of St Pauls Cathedral by the Rt. Revd. Daniel Wilson, the fifth bishop of Calcutta, in the year 1847.                    The Archbishop of Canterbury at the cathedral				     
	What better occasion for the visit of The Most Revd. and the Rt. Honourable Dr Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, the principal leader of the Church of England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican community, the worlds most influential Christian leader after the Pope? A man of erudition, a poet-priest (much in the tradition of Gerard Manly Hopkins) devout and yet known for his simplicity and humility.        
	The service was short and began with the unveiling of a plaque which commemorated the visit of the Archbishop. The procession comprised the choirs, visiting clergy and bishops, the Archbishops entourage, the Archbishop and the Rt. Revd. Ashoke Biswas, the bishop of Calcutta. A very striking feature was that neither the Archbishop nor any of the Bishops wore the Mitre or any of the other regalia and paraphernalia that surrounds those in authority. If there is one quality that will remain in the minds of the congregation on that balmy evening it will be this absence of fanfare.        
	In his message the Archbishop spoke of the fulfilment of the Millennium Goals through the work of the Spirit. It is the Spirit, he said, that enables us to sweep away the fantasies and the sham that we use to make ourselves comfortable.        
	We must allow the Spirit to drive us into the dark and difficult places where we have to let go of the things that make us feel safe. When we pray for justice of the poor and for the whole of our material environment also, we are really praying for the gift of the Spirit to open our eyes and help us to fast and to turn away from the unhealthy diet of falsehood.                                      
	But the Archbishop emphasised that the Nazareth manifesto cannot be reduced to just another manifesto for human improvement.        
	Because above all, it is a proclamation of Gods gift of the Spirit, clearing away all that gets in the way of truthful vision and binding us together in mutual dependence and gratitude  the gift that makes us a Eucharist people, gathered around the Table of Jesus Christ as guests together who are also called to feed each other with love and joyful appreciation.        
	Following the Archbishops call to save and bless Gods inheritance, came the intercession very different from the stereotypical antiphonal prayer. The prayers were led by four children from St Pauls who took on the voices of the poor, the deprived and the marginalised children of our own and neighbouring countries. The first voice was that of a 14-year-old girl who was duped by an agent promising her a job but who actually sold her to a brothel. The second voice was that of a child, of migrant workers in a brick kiln, illiterate and exploited. The third, probably the most horrific was the voice of the unborn child, aborted because she was a girl and the fourth the plaintive cry of a blind boy speaking on behalf of all disabled children.        
	The voices of the children even as they spoke on behalf of those who led vastly different lives from those on whose behalf they spoke struck home as the entire congregation responded let our cry come unto you.        
	As the service ended, the Archbishop pronounced the old Gaelic blessing. May the road rise to meet you, may the wind be always at your back, may the sun shine warm on your face, the rain fall softly on your fields; And until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of his hand.        
	I sat in the pews even as the huge crowd milled past. I drew comfort from the words of another Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas, who many centuries ago prophesied:        
	The Church shall protect her own, in her own way        
	Not as oak and stone, stone and oak decay        
	Give no stay, but the Church shall endure        
	The church shall be open, even to our enemies        
	Open the door.       The guest columnist is principal of La Martiniere for Girls

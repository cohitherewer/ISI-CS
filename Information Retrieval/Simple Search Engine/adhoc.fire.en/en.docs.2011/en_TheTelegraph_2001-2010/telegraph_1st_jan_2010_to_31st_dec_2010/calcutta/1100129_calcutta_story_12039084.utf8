The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rally toll on traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rally toll on traffic

	Commuters yet again bore the brunt of the politics of disruption as rallies brought central and south Calcutta to a standstill on Thursday afternoon.        
	Metro channel was the venue of a Jamiat-Ulama-e-Hind meeting, a procession by the Bandi Mukti Committee culminated at Rani Rashmoni Avenue and Trinamul Congress supporters marched to the offices of the five divisional deputy commissioners of police.        
	The Jamiat programme was the most disruptive, said traffic cops.        
	Jamiat supporters started assembling in Metro channel around 11.15am. The rally continued till 4.20pm. With over 6,000 people assembling in the area, both flanks of Metro channel and the Dorina crossing had to be closed. Traffic was diverted through Lenin Sarani, Mayo Road and Esplanade East, said a senior traffic police officer.        
	Long queues of vehicles formed on Lenin Sarani, parts of AJC Bose Road, SN Banerjee Road, JL Nehru Road and CR Avenue.        
	Rallies are organised in the heart of the city to inconvenience people. It is disgusting, said Anirban Chatterjee, a college student stuck in the snarl.        
	Groups of Trinamul supporters, ranging from 200 and 400, marched to the offices of the deputy commissioners disrupting traffic movement. Traffic on Park Street was affected as a procession marched down Rawdon Street to the deputy commissioner (south)s office.        
	Adding to the chaos, 500 people were walking from College Square to Rani Rashmoni Avenue under the banner of the Bandi Mukti Committee.         
	The rallies have become a nuisance. Calcutta High Court should come to our rescue, said a homemaker who was caught in a snarl at Esplanade on the way to pick up her daughter from school.

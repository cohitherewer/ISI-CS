The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire shadow on Salkia
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fire shadow on Salkia
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The gutted remains of the Salkia factory that caught fire on Wednesday morning. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Salkia, a north Howrah neighbourhood, was once famous for a library, two cinema halls and a vibrant Anglo-Indian community. Today, its known more for its illegal, polluting factories that are driving out the residents.        
	Over the past 25 years or so, the condition has been steadily deteriorating, said Terence Pradhan, a schoolteacher and Howrah resident.        
	Factories and workshops have come up randomly, in violation of rules, with an inert administration looking on. The Salkia residents, as a result, are being pushed to the periphery.         
	Metro took a walk around the area on Wednesday morning when the firemen were battling the blaze at Essel Polymer Private Limited. The factory is in a cluster of 20 such units that produce inflammable items such as jute bags and plastic goods.        
	Officers in the fire and emergency services department said most of these factories were operating without a fire licence.        
	Every factory or godown here is stacked with inflammable items. A disaster may strike any day, said Ram Kumar Sau, a superviser at Jaidev Printing Press, close to Essel Polymer Private Limited.        
	Running a unit without the mandatory fire licence seems to be the trend in Salkia, which has around 250 small and medium-scale factories along GT Road. We dont have any official record of almost 80 per cent of the factories in the area. They do not have a fire licence, said an officer.        
	Salkia became a preferred destination for businessmen to set up their production units because of its proximity to GT Road.        
	How are these units being issued other licences when they do not have fire-fighting arrangements. It should be made mandatory to have a fire licence to operate such units, said the fire officer.                                                                                
	The fire service department in the district is hamstrung because of narrow roads, scarcity of waterbodies, lack of fire fighting arrangements in the upcoming residential complexes and industrial units have all contributed in making the Howrah fire fighting service inefficient.               
	We faced all possible problems in todays operation. The fire engines got stuck on the way, there was no water body available near the fire spot and the factory had no fire fighting arrangements, said a fire department official in Howrah district.                                
	According to rough estimates Salkia houses almost 250 small and medium size factories along side G T Road engaged in producing plastic goods, ropes, paper pulp and printing and iron and related industries.         
	The blaze in Essel Polymer Private Limited factory in Salkia in north Howrah has shifted focus on the hazardous industries operating in the area without the required clearance.        
	According to the Howrah district unit of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services, most of these factories are operating without fire clearance. Fire department does not have any official record of almost 80 per cent of the factories in this area. They do not posses any fire clearance, said a fire department official.               
	A raging blaze had broken out in the same factory in 2007 when almost 75 per cent of the factory was completely destroyed. Within months the factory was up and running till Wednesday when another fire broke out.         
	The blaze has also brought the roles of various government agencies like the local civic body, pollution control board and industries department under the scanner.         
	The workers of these factories were working on a war footing and vacating their units of all the goods. Thousand of plastic cups, jute bags, paper cartons and barrels of thinners (a chemical used in printing industry) occupied every vacant space.

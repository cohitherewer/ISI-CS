          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth in his early 30s was arrested on Saturday on the charge of abetting the suicide of a 23-year-old air hostess.        
	Police said Sugam Gupta, a resident of Salt Lake, had an affair with Priyanka Tiwari, who was found hanging on March 6 in her Kaikhali flat.        
	Gupta had allegedly told Priyanka that he was unmarried but the woman later learnt that he was married and had a child. Sugam was arrested after he allegedly failed to explain why he hid his marital status from Priyanka, the daughter of an official of the Tripura government.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trinamul office gutted
          OUR BUREAU                              
	A Trinamul Congress office in Patuli was destroyed in a fire early on Sunday with the party pointing a finger of accusation at the CPM.        
	Trinamul leaders said CPM cadres had set the office on fire to avenge their loss in election for the borough chairmans post on August 26.        
	CPM leaders denied the allegation. This is the result of a feud within the Trinamul, said Khokon Ghosh Dastidar, a local CPM leader.         
	We are trying to find out whether it was an accident or someone had set the office on fire, said an officer.        
	 Suicide bid: A 27-year-old youth from Guwahati tried to commit suicide at a city hotel by slashing his wrist on Sunday. Police said the hotel management had confronted the youth while he was trying to leave without paying the bills on Sunday. The youth then returned to his room. The cops broke open the door when repeated knocks went unanswered and found him lying with his wrist slit.        
	 Arrested: Police arrested Raghu Roy, 32, and his two accomplices in connection with the murder of a trader in North 24-Parganas late on Saturday.        
	 Power-cut alert: Power supply to Phuleswar, Sejberia, Ludlow, Jagannathpore, Fortgloster, Rameswarnagar and Bauria in Howrah may be disrupted between 10am and 4pm on Monday because of maintenance by CESC.        
	 Murder charge: Relatives of Soumen Ghosh, 24, whose body was found in Rishra, lodged a complaint on Sunday alleging that he had been murdered.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two members of a gang suspected of stealing crores from the bank accounts of at least 21 Calcuttans by tampering with ATM keyboards were arrested in Gaya on Friday.        
	Three other members of the gang, whose reach extended from Kerala in the south to Himachal Pradesh in the north, were arrested elsewhere over the past few weeks.        
	The duo  Asad Khan and Shoaib Khan of Fatehpur, Gaya  and the men they trained targeted ATMs of nationalised banks because debit cards only need to be swiped and not inserted into their teller machines, said police.        
	One of the gang members would enter a kiosk with two ATMs and smear adhesive at the bottom of the star (*) and hash () keys on one of the machines to keep them depressed.         
	He would then pretend to carry out a transaction at the other teller machine.

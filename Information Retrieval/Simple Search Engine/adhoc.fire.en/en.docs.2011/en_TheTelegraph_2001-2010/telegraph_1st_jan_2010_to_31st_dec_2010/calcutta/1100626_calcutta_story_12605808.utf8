          A STAFF REPORTER                          The dark Metropolitan Building on Friday. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	Metropolitan Building on Chowringhee has been without power since June 20, and there is little hope of the supply being restored in 10 days.        
	Tenants alleged that the landlord, LIC, was doing little to restore power.         
	Big Bazaar, which operates from the ground and first floors of the building using a giant generator, has already got hold of a second one in case the first goes phut.        
	A. Chakrabarty, chief engineer, LIC, said on Friday that a fault had developed in the transformer for distributing power and it would take about 10 more days to replace a part whose spare has to be brought from Mysore.        
	The fault, he said, was with the vacuum circuit breaker  a protecting device  of the Kirloskar brand transformer.        
	The worst hit are the residents of the building, some of whom have been living there for half a century. Five families are living on the third floor and about three on the second floor with darkness engulfing the interiors and staircases. But thanks to Big Bazaar, which is filling up its water tank once a day, they are getting some water.        
	A spokesperson for Cauvery, the Karnataka State Arts amp; Crafts Emporium, on the ground floor said the stores generator was getting overheated. Thanks to the heat and darkness, customers are avoiding the store. The same is the case with its neighbour, the Central Cottage Industries.        
	Publisher Priyabrata Deb, the only tenant willing to be named, said it was impossible to get in touch with the LIC officers in charge of maintaining the building. He has been unable to open his office for the past five days.        
	LIC has made no effort to provide any alternate power supply either. CESC is not empowered to do so.        
	A tenant of Esplanade Mansion, another LIC property, was not surprised by the LICs apathy. The lift in block III of the heritage building serving flats 17 to 24 has been inoperative since mid-April.

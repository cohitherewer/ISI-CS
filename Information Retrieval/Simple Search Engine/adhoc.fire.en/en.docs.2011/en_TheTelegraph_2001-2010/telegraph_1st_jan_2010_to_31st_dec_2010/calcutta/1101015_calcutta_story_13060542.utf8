                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Youth falls off bus, run over
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 30-year-old man fell off the footboard of a private bus apparently while talking over his cellphone and was crushed under the wheels on Cathedral Road on Thursday morning. A cellphone was found in Sandip Saus hand when police reached the spot.        
	Witnesses said he was talking over his cellphone while standing on the footboard, said an officer of Hastings police station. Sau, a resident of Thakurpukur, worked for a cellphone service provider.        
	On September 18, a teenage girl had been run over by a train at Dum Dum Cantonment station when she was crossing the tracks while speaking over her cellphone.        
	Water supply: More than 2.5 million residents of large parts of south Calcutta got their normal supply of water on Thursday after facing a crisis for 72 hours. The situation was salvaged after civic engineers applied grease to the suction valves of the pumps at Garden Reach waterworks. Four of the five pumps at the facility, run by a state government subsidiary, broke down on Tuesday, disrupting supply to many neighbourhoods from Bhowanipore to Behala.        
	Woman dead: Kalabati Devi, 65, a resident of Behala, died after being beaten up on Wednesday night by relatives of a girl with whom her son had allegedly run away two days ago.         
	Clash arrest: Sahil Jadav, Bablu Patra and Abhay Rai, all in their early 20s, were arrested on Thursday following a clash among applicants for a job on Wednesday. One person died and another was injured in the clash that broke out near Birla Mandir on Syed Amir Ali Avenue between those who got jobs with a company and the other applicants.

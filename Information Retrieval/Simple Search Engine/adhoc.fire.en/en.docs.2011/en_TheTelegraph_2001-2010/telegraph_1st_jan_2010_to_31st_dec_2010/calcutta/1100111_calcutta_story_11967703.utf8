The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Celsius rise in humidity high
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Celsius rise in humidity high
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	The mercury has been creeping up over the past few days, reducing the chill factor and prompting the weatherman to eye a mid-January revival of cold conditions.        
	The minimum temperature on Sunday rose to a couple of degrees above normal at 14.7 degrees Celsius.        
	Meteorologists attributed the surge in minimum temperatures to higher humidity levels in the atmosphere, which rose to a maximum of 95 per cent on Sunday. The flow of the cold, dry northwesterlies has also been weak over the past week.        
	The higher humidity has been resulting in mist and fog in the morning, not allowing the mercury to drop by trapping the heat, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).        
	Though things could cool down from the middle of this week, he added, Monday would be misty and relatively warm, with the minimum temperature hovering around 16 degrees Celsius. If conditions change, they will from after Tuesday, was the word from the weatherman.        
	The maximum temperature on Sunday, though, was 24.8 degrees Celsius, still two degrees below normal.        
	Temperatures have risen slightly, but the weather isnt uncomfortable yet, as it is still quite cool for Calcutta, said the IMD official.        
	Fog conditions have been prevailing over most parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains, including Calcutta and its neighbourhood, while the cold, dry northwesterlies, that trigger a drop in temperatures, have slackened.        
	The northwesterly flow should pick up again from the middle of the week. Coupled with a fresh western disturbance, that should reach the eastern plains by Thursday and help induce a slide in minimum temperatures, said a senior scientist of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	With winter setting in a fortnight earlier than usual on November 22 and a spell of unusual chill during the latter half of December, meteorologists were eyeing the coveted sub 10-degree mark. But their calculations have been upset by the recent rise in mercury.        
	There is no reason to give up yet. There are still 40 days to go (February 20) before winter bids adieu to Calcutta, said the senior scientist from the centre in Noida.

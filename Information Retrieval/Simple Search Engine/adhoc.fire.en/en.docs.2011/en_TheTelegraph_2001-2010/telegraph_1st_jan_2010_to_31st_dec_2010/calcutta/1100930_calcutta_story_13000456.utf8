The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safe City team steps it up
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Safe City team steps it up
										      MOHUA DAS      STOP THAT! - TT FOR CITY                                          
	Two days before Sashthi in 2008, I was returning home in the evening laden with shopping bags. As I neared my house, a man appeared from nowhere and tried to molest me. I just blanked out for a few seconds. Then, I gave chase shouting for help. He ran into a lane where people were busy putting the finishing touches to a pandal. They caught him and thrashed him.        
	I cried a lot that Puja-eve, asking myself why such things happened to me. Now I know I am not the only victim. Most victims remain silent and tolerate harassment day after day. But we, the women, must raise our voice and protest.        
	 Rinki Saha, a Calcuttan inspired by the Safe City campaign launched by a group of girls and Metro.        
	Team Safe City met the city polices A-team with 14 days to go for Sashthi in 2010 to take the campaign against eve-teasing in New Alipore forward.        
	The campaign was launched by Brinda Dasgupta  a 22-year-old resident of New Alipore who was harassed by a stranger in F-Block on the morning of September 16  and some friends, in partnership with Metro.        
	Commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti  flanked by the assistant commissioner of police (anti-rowdy section), A.K. Chakraborty, the deputy commissioner (south), Supratim Sarkar, and the officer-in-charge of New Alipore police station, P.K. Sarkhel  assured the Safe City team of support.        
	In New Alipore, we are in the process of identifying the vulnerable areas for women so that we can introduce special patrolling, said Chakrabarti, on Wednesday afternoon.        
	The Safe City campaign aims to focus on one area in the city at a time to make it safer for women by raising awareness and taking the fight to the harassers through official channels.        
	The Safe City teams proposal to organise self-defence workshops for girls in New Alipore found ready support from the police brass.        
	We will send our Taekwondo specialists to conduct these workshops. They can guide the participants on physical hardening, resistance and how to react to any such act of harassment, said Chakraborty.        
	This came a day after the top cop told Metro that a special team had been formed by the anti-rowdy squad to tackle eve-teasing in the wake of the Safe City movement.        
	But it is most important to encourage more girls to raise their voices and protest, said Chakrabarti, spelling out the helpline numbers 1091/22505175 for women to lodge complaints.        
	Were glad that the police are being so co-operative. It shows that they want to make the city a safer place for women to live in, said members of Safe City.        
	With a fortnight to go for Puja, a Safe City stall is being planned at the New Alipore Association puja in Triangular Park to step up the awareness drive.        
	A lot of residents visit this pandal with their families. We want to help the Safe City team by giving them space to put up their stall, print pocket-sized cards and leaflets with emergency numbers and self-defence tips for women, said Subrata Ghose Chaudhuri, the president of the New Alipore Association.        
	When the citys women are being harassed on the road every day, what is the point in worshipping the Goddess and celebrating Durga puja? On a positive note, women can make Durga puja more relevant by fighting back like the Goddess.        
	 Amrita Mallik, a Calcuttan, saluting the Safe City campaign.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Enter, Mamata the movie reviewer   Shingara for her, popcorn from him
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Enter, Mamata the movie reviewer
  - Minister moved by message of Moner Manush and Prosenjits Lalan          MOHUA DAS                          Mamata Banerjee with Koel Mallick and Prosenjit at the special screening of Moner Manush on Tuesday evening. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	Mamata Banerjee  politician, poet and painter  is set to add movie reviewer to her rsum.        
	Khoob bhalo laaglo. Amakey review likhtey diley khub bhalo likhtam (I liked it very much. I would have written nice things had I been allowed to review the film), Mamata told Moner Manush director Goutam Ghose with a mischievous smile after a private screening at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute on Tuesday evening.        
	And should anybody doubt her ability to review a film, heres what she thinks about the film on the life and lines of Lalan Fakir  shamajik (social), serious, and shikshar (educative).        
	Busybee Mamata, on a socialising spree in the last week of 2010, had breezed into the main auditorium around 6.15pm in her trademark taant sari, accompanied by Partha Chatterjee and other Trinamul colleagues.        
	She slipped on her glasses as soon as the credits started rolling at 6.30pm but was busy texting till the second scene of the film. Call over, Mamata finally put away her cellphone  apparently in silent mode, because it didnt even beep once  and was glued to the screen till the interval.                    
	Then it was popcorn and shingara time. And who better to share her bite with than someone who she thought desperately needed food  Tolly star Koel Mallick, seated a row behind her.        
	 All artistes diet. But today I am going to feed (actor) Ranjitdas daughter. I am sure she does not eat, said Mamata, calling out to Koel and handing her a shingara. Aajke no dieting (today, no dieting), she warned Koel, as father Ranjit Mallick and veteran Sandhya Roy smiled on.        
	It was Mamatas evening out at the movies and she wanted to go the whole hog. Aami Suvada (painter Suvaprasanna, seated behind her) ke bolechhi popcorn khabo, announced Mamata, before settling down for the second half.        
	She interrupted the silence in the hall once  to comment on Prosenjits Lalan Fakir, with a flowing white beard. Ekdom Rabindranath-er moto lagchhey, remarked Mamata.        
	By the time the screening ended at 9.15pm, Moner Manush was the only thing on Mamatas mind. We should remember what Lalan says in the film  that there is no Hindu or Muslim or jaat (caste). Humanity is our real jaat, said she. I liked the thinking, vision, attitude and outlook (of the film).        
	What about the acting and the other aspects? Prosenjit, reviewer Mamata said, was oshadharon (outstanding) and the cinematography superb.        
	Mamata was very keen to watch the film. They cant always go to a theatre; so we organised a show here, said Goutam Ghose.        
	I am very happy that a busy person like her could make time to see the film, added Prosenjit.

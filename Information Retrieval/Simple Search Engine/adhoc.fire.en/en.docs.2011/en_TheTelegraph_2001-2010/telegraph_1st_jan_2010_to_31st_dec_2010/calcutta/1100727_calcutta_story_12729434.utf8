          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The railways will serve diabetic meals on long-distance trains, starting with the Howrah Rajdhani Express and the Howrah-Delhi Duronto Express.        
	Derek OBrien, the chairman of the passengers services committee of the railways, said the service would be launched by Puja.        
	The menu will include tomato shorba, methi chicken, methi matar malai, daal hariali, boiled rice, vegetable clear soup, fish and tamarind curry, soya vegetable korma, methi daal, onion chapathi and sugar-free ice cream.        
	A diabetic passenger can ask for the special meal while the catering staff take order on board, said OBrien.        
	The railways now directly handles the catering service on long-distance trains. OBrien said the railways would start a text messaging service and a link on its website for passengers to lodge complaints against the quality of food.        
	The chief commercial managers of all zonal railways will meet railway ministry officials in Delhi on Wednesday to discuss the new catering policy.

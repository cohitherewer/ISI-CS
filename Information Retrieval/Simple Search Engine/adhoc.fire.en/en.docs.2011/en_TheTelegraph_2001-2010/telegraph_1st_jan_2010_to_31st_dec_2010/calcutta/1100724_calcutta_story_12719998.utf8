                Fishes weighing several kilograms were found dead in a pond at Indian Botanic Garden in Shibpur on Thursday morning. The pond, Leram Lake, is one of the 24 water bodies in the garden compound. Morning walkers who noticed the dead fishes on Thursday have shot off a letter to the garden authorities.  imadri Sekhar Debnath, the joint director of the garden, said: I have no clue why the fish died. I dont think its a big news but Ill look into the matter.  ources said water in most of the ponds was polluted because of accumulation of dead leaves and plastic items over the years. In 2002, I had filed a public interest litigation in the high court highlighting how the ponds in the garden are becoming polluted because of lack of maintenance. The garden authorities had then promised that they would look after the ponds. They have not kept their word.    Two motorbike-borne men snatched Rs 50,300 from a trader in Sodepur on Friday morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC slap on Nandan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC slap on Nandan

	The high court on Thursday directed the Nandan authorities to stick to the original screening schedule of the Bengali film Sthaniya Sambad that will have its opening show at 4pm on Friday.        
	The film, releasing only at Nandan, was scheduled to have two daily shows  at 4pm and 6.15pm. But on Tuesday the authorities suddenly changed the timings to 1pm and 6.30pm.        
	Justice Jayanta Biswass order followed a petition by co-director Moinak Biswas, who alleged that the Nandan authorities had informed him about the change in schedule only three days before the opening show.         
	Arjun Gourisaria, the other director of Sthaniya Sambad, said: The sudden change in the screening schedule would have led to confusion and a huge loss for us.        
	Nandans lawyer Sandip Srimani submitted that the timings had to be changed to accommodate programmes to mark Rabindranath Tagores 150th birth anniversary.        
	As part of the anniversary celebrations, the authorities have decided to hold a programme at Nandan I daily at 4pm. Hence, the screening of the film had to be rescheduled, said Srimani.        
	The court, however, did not buy the logic. The state has every right to celebrate the poets birth anniversary but not at the cost of the maker of the film, the judge said.         
	Biswass lawyer Arunava Ghosh said: On August 12, Nilanjan Chatterjee, the joint director in the state information and cultural affairs department, had told my client that his film would be screened at Nandan in early November. On November 15, Chatterjee had issued a second letter saying his department had decided to allow Biswas to screen his film daily from November 26 at 4pm and 6.15pm.        
	On November 23, the lawyer added, Chatterjee had written another letter to Biswas, saying that the screening schedule had been changed.

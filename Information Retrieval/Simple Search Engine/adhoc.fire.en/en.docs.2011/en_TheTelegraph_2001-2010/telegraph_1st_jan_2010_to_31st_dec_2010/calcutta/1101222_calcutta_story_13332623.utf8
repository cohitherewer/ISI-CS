                A taxiway, the construction of which was completed a year ago, will become operational at the Calcutta airport on Thursday.  We have got the necessary clearance from the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA), said airport director R. Srinivasan.  axiway K remained unused despite being ready for opening one year ago allegedly because of a tussle between the Airports Authority of India and the DGCA. The taxiway links the primary and secondary runways and is expected to reduce taxiing time.  Itll put an end to the congestion on the runway especially during the morning and afternoon rush hours, said an airport official.

Vinod was Ashok and Pradips brother and Dass friend. Das had instigated Vinods brothers to kill him and acquire his Kalighat house, said joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen. The body was buried in the backyard of the house.   Forgery case: A case of forgery has been started against Anindya Sheel, the brother of a Tollywood actor, for allegedly duping a cellphone store of Rs 5.6 lakh. Police said Sheel had bought 16 BlackBerry sets worth Rs 35,000 each from the Muchipara shop and paid in cheque that bounced. When store owner told Sheel that his cheque had bounced, he promised to pay in cash in a few days. But Sheel did not show up and is absconding. The case has been started following a complaint by the owner, said an officer.   Man shot: Pradip Ghosh, 38, a construction material supplier, was shot dead in front of his house at Ghola, on the northern fringes, late on Monday.

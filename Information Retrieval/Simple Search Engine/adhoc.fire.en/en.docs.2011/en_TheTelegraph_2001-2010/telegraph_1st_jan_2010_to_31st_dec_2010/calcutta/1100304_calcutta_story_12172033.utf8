The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Indian art through the peephole

          ARKA DAS                          Barbara J. Scheuerman, the Berlin-based curator, at CIMA Gallery. (Rashbehari Das)                                  
	Can one really understand contemporary art from a certain region of the world applying acquired knowledge and textbook criteria? How can one understand culturally defined aspects from a culture one hasnt grown up in? How important is it to gain expertise on different cultures in order to understand its artists? In other words: how does a westerner look at and understand contemporary art from India?        
	On Tuesday evening, questions like these and more were put on the table at CIMA Gallery, during the talk titled Through the Peephole: How to Approach Contemporary Art from India as a European Curator by Berlin-based Barbara J. Scheuerman. Presented by CIMA and the Goethe Institut, her ongoing curatorial trip started in Delhi and moves to Vadodara, Bangalore and Mumbai, after Calcutta.        
	An interactive session where she admittedly presented more a series of questions that answers, Scheuerman offered a collage of interpersonal experiences in context to contemporary Indian art, a market that has decidedly expanded in the last decade. In the capacity of a curator  Gallery K21 at Dusseldorf and later at the Tate Modern, London  complex questions about understanding cultural backgrounds and the art thereof had always played on her mind; especially in the form of curating a truly global show.        
	It was at the Dusseldorf gallery that Scheuerman met Rakhi Sarkar of CIMA and was introduced to the wider range of contemporary Indian art. At the Tate, she witnessed contemporary art from India first-hand, with works by the usual suspects: Anish Kapoor, Dayanita Singh, Subodh Gupta. Later on, as she delved deeper, more recent, cutting-edge art from the likes of Thukral and Tagra, N.S. Harsha and the Bombay Art Collective caught her attention.        
	In the process, her understanding of the very nature of art from India floated in a flux and is yet to settle down, given the vastly varying cultural templates. For one, it was apparent that while discussions could serve a more academic purpose, it really was the personal that offers bridges between people and their art. So, Scheuerman curated the young Berlin-born, Lahore-based artist Sophie Ernsts exhibition Home, themed on the Partition, at her experimental art space Babusch.        
	Without endless dissecting, the process that Scheuerman finds most suitable is a look through a window, a visual experience as if through a peephole; a personal perspective. The common streak that ran through much of the art from India she witnessed was the use of everyday objects. She had been to India on a couple of occasions as a tourist, but there is enough interaction time on this trip to witness and perhaps understand contemporary art practices. Delhi introduced her to the art of the young Joydip Sengupta, Aditya Pande and Rohini Devasher, whose works she calls regionless art. Given her penchant for narratives, Scheuermans Indian sojourn should offer her enough curatorial possibilities.

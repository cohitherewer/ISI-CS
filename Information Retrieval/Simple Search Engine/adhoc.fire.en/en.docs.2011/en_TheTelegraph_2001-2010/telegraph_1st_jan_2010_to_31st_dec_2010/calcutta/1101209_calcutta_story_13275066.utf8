                                                                                                                         3                                      Letters
                                   
	Address not given           
	lMetro Channel has become the permanent hub of rival political parties to stage demonstrations and hold rallies for gaining mileage ahead of elections (Seven-day siege of city centre, November 10). But given the mayhem such gatherings cause, rally organisers have to be barred from clogging thoroughfares.           
	None should be spared the rod for riding roughshod over the public. I think banning rallies in the city centre is the only remedy. Politicians must remember that there are other methods of wooing the electorate. The public is fed up.           
	P.B. Saha,

	Change for good is not what the Bengal government has ever wanted (Taxi-ing time at terminal, November 17). Bureaucracy, apathy and red tape have been the hallmark of the state government. The worst part is they do not learn from other states on how things can be run smoothly. Each day that I read a Metro report on Calcutta airport, I feel ashamed.           
	I request passengers to boycott the pre-paid taxis at the airport. If possible, reserve a radio taxi in advance or ask someone to pick you up. These crooks with their union-driven anarchy need to be taught a lesson. If the government cannot, I believe we, the citizens, can.           
	Debasish Chakraborthy,           
	Address not given                     
	Why cant we make our city simple and liveable? Why does someone from outside have to enter or leave this city with negative thoughts and energy?           
	I have faced the taxi-related problems that Metro has reported about. Even after paying the required amount at the pre-paid counter, the rowdy taxi agents behaved as if I had committed a great mistake by choosing their service. They made me run in circles for 30 minutes outside the airport at 2am. I was hungry and tired and almost begged them for a cab. Finally a taxi driver agreed to take me, at an extra cost of Rs 50. I felt so helpless.           
	I do not belong to a rich or politically empowered family, neither am I a part of a major vote bank. But I pay my income tax regularly. As an Indian citizen and resident of West Bengal, may I not ask for the bare minimum rules and regulations to be followed and a simple life in Calcutta?           
	Abdul Mannan,           
	Address not given                     
	Regarding the Metro report Taxi-ing time at terminal, November 17, I fully support the IT professional who said that Calcutta airport needs privatisation like Delhi or Mumbai, as far as transport options to and from the airport is concerned.           
	I too became a victim of the pre-paid taxi goondaraj a few months back, while I was returning from Bangalore with my wife and niece. Some remedial steps have to be taken by the airport authorities without delay.           
	M.K. Kuri,           
	Garia                     
	Simply increasing the number of policemen at the airport will not be a foolproof solution to the airport mess (Cops wake up to terminal ills, November 19). What is needed is efficiency of the police personnel than their numbers. The cops should be able to carry out their duties sincerely and effectively for the convenience of passengers.           
	At present the police shut their eyes to the problems at hand. Often they are the source of the trouble. Passengers should be able to find the cops when needed and get the necessary help from them.           
	Amrita Mallik,           
	Salt Lake                     
	No doubt, our cops can definitely formulate plans for better traffic management in and around the airport. But what about the hell inside? Who will manage the irregularities inside the airport? What is the tentative (slow-mo) date of completion of the modernisation project? Even after the modernisation, is there any guarantee that everything will be maintained properly?           
	Increased police presence is not a total solution. The cops cracking down on touts need to be stern and clean handed, especially as the touts have political support, as claimed by the airport officials.           
	Asok Ghosh,           
	Address not given                               
	The pool car menace has been created because of the negligence of both the transport minister as well as the school authorities (Pool car crash kills, injures, November 13).             
	Why would the owner of a car spend time or money to register it if he can easily ply it without the necessary papers? Because of lax policing.           
	Schools should check the registration details of pool cars and the driving licence of drivers before allowing them to ferry students. On the other hand, the transport minister can curb this menace by cracking the whip on law keepers.           
	Sinthi Dutta,           
	Address not given                               
	In response to the question Do you think students can be disciplined like this? (Enter, discipline in class, November 10) I feel students can be disciplined by including discipline as a subject. This move will definitely be a success and should be followed in other schools too.             
	It is also essential to keep a parents representative in the committee so that students can share those problems with the representative that they cannot share with teachers.           
	Spandan Sinha,           
	Address not given                               
	It is matter of great concern that the law and order situation in the city has deteriorated considerably, so much so that one is even unsafe in ones own neighbourhood (Foreigner lives in festive fear, November 13)!             
	The situation worsens during festivals as drunken hoodlums are out on the streets. They resort to abusive language and harass residents. These para toughs are patronised by local political parties and hence victims fear to lodge complaints against them.           
	A.S. Mehta,

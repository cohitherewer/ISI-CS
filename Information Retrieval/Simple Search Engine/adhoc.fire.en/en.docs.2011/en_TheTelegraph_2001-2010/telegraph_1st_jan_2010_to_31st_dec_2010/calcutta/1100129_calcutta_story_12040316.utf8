The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bite bullet to beat goons   She braved it for colleague and cash-box
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bite bullet to beat goons     She braved it for colleague and cash-box
          SANJAY MANDAL                       Tapasi Chanda Das                                
	Tapasi Chanda Das was shocked and furious when she saw two youths on a bike she had just refuelled struggling to snatch the cash-box from her colleague and friend Sarita Mahato at a Bypass petrol pump in Patuli.        
	As I saw the men push Sarita hard, I lunged towards them to save her. One of the goons fired in the air. A second gunshot followed immediately and I felt a searing pain in my right chest, Tapasi recalled on Thursday, lying on her bed in the Trauma Intensive Therapy Unit of AMRI Hospitals, in Dhakuria.        
	The 18-year-old, whose right hand has been paralysed because of the bullet wound, slumped to the ground and turned numb but was conscious enough to realise that blood was draining out of me.        
	The teen braveheart, a resident of Patuli, does not regret having risked her life for her colleague in what has been her workplace for barely two months.        
	It was around 9pm on January 26 when the two rode in, asking for a refill. There was nothing suspicious in their behaviour. I was shocked and furious when I saw them trying to snatch the cash-box from Sarita while on their way out. At that moment I was only concerned about saving my friend and the cash-box, Sarita said, hours after she underwent surgery to remove the bullet from the right thoracic vertebra (near her throat).        
	General surgeon D.J. Bhowmik, who operated on the girl, said Tapasi was critical but stable. The bullet had pierced 10cm into her body above the collar bone. We will get a clearer picture of the extent of damage after she undergoes an MRI scan tomorrow, Bhowmik said.        
	According to neuro-surgeon R.N. Bhattacharya of AMRI, its uncertain yet whether the girl would recover from the paralysis.         
	The Republic Day shooting has scared Tapasi  and her colleagues as well  but she is confident of resuming work once out of hospital.        
	I knew the job was risky but I had to accept it because we needed the money, said the girl who had to discontinue her studies after Madhyamik.        
	The family of four survives on a monthly income of Rs 3,000. Tapasis father Nirmalya works in a private security agency while mother Anima does odd jobs. The couples younger daughter Rinki is still in school.        
	Anima, who hasnt slept for the past two days, said: I had repeatedly asked Tapasi not to take the job but she insisted on it. See what price she has had to pay to ease our burden!         
	Tapasi joined the pump, which employs only women, in December for a salary of Rs 1,800. I did not get anything in December as I was undergoing training. I am looking forward to Januarys pay, she said.        
	Pump owner S.K. Sinha Roy, who has promised to bear the girls medical expenses, said that no police posting had been arranged in the locality even 48 hours after the incident.         
	Officers of Patuli outpost, under Jadavpur police station, however, claimed that things were under control.

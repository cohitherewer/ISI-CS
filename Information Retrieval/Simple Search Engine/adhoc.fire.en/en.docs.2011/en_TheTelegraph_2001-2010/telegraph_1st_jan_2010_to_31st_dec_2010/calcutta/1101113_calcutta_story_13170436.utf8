          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The authorities of Calcutta Film Festival have mailed a request to the Art and Culture Trust of Sikkim for consent to screen Satyajit Rays Sikkim but the agency has denied having received any such plea.        
	We havent received the request, said Ugyen Chopel, the managing trustee of ACT, which claims to be the rightful owner of the documentary. Following a plea by the trust, a Sikkim court had on Thursday barred the screening of the film in the festival.        
	An ACT official said the trust would have given its consent to the festival authorities had they approached it earlier in a proper manner.        
	Earlier in the day, Manab Bandyopadhyay, the Bengal deputy director of information, said a request for consent had been mailed to the Sikkim trust.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A third-year BCom student, who supports All India Students Bloc, has lodged an FIR accusing the principal of Heramba Chandra College of assault, a week after a leader of the union was arrested in connection with students allegedly sprinkling petrol on the principal and threatening to burn him.        
	According to police, Abhishek Singh had approached the additional chief judicial magistrate of the Alipore court last week alleging that the cops were refusing to accept his FIR. The court directed the police to accept the students complaint.        
	We accepted the complaint on September 30. The court has summoned the principal on December 20, said an officer of Lake police station.        
	All the charges are baseless. I will fight the case and come clean, said principal Khagendranath Adhikari.        
	Abhishek and other students had lodged a police complaint against the college authorities after their leader Sashi Bhusan Tiwari was arrested last week.        
	The college had accused Tiwari, a former student, of instigating the duo who allegedly sprinkled petrol on Adhikari.

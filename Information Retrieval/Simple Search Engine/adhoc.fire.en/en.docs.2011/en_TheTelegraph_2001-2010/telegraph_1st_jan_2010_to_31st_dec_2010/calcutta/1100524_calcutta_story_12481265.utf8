  - United colours of graffiti wiped clean by offenders          A STAFF REPORTER               Friday            sunday            SPOT THE DIFFERENCE: The man at the tubewell is the same but the wall of the boys rsquo; hostel on Sunday wore a whitewashed look. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                       
	The great graffiti alliance was wiped off Calcutta Universitys post-graduate boys hostel wall in Waliullah Lane on Sunday as supporters of the CPM, Trinamul Congress and the Congress whitewashed what they had defaced.        
	Metro had on Saturday highlighted how Taltala police had registered cases against all three parties for defiling the government property in ward 62, a shout away from the CPMs Alimuddin Street party office.        
	It was a sight to behold as the paintbrush supporters of the three candidates  CPMs Mohammed Mahfooz Afroz Siddiqui, Trinamuls Iqbal Ahmed and Congresss Asfaque Ahmed  wiped the wall clean of their respective graffiti on Sunday morning, said an inmate of the hostel.        
	It is illegal to use any government wall for graffiti. Offenders can be jailed for up to six months and/or fined up to Rs 50,000.        
	We are happy that the offenders have erased the graffiti. People should come forward and protest against defacement of walls, said an official of the state election commission.

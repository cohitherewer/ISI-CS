The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Review nod for HS scripts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Review nod for HS scripts
  - More subjects, flexible combinations on the cards          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The state Higher Secondary council has decided to allow re-evaluation of answer scripts whenever marks are disputed, bowing to a long-standing demand of examinees.         
	The decision, taken on Tuesday, is likely to be ratified by the state government and implemented from this year.         
	Till last year, examinees could only apply for scrutiny of answer scripts. A scrutiny is limited to checking whether all answers have been evaluated and the marks correctly totalled. The councils move follows the Union human resource development ministrys directive to school education boards to make their courses and examination systems student-friendly and attractive.         
	A large number of students will benefit once the system of re-examination of answer scripts is introduced, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, the president of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education.         
	The members of the council took a unanimous decision to implement the review system as early as possible, and so we are starting it from this year, he added.        
	According to an official, examinees will be able to get their answer scripts in a maximum of two subjects reviewed. The council has set 45 days from the last application being received as the target for declaring the review results.         
	 We expect the formalities for implementing the decision to be completed by the time the HS results are declared in end-May, added the official.         
	The board has also decided to introduce new subjects and offer more flexibility in choosing subject combinations to make the courses attractive.        
	Subjects like biochemistry, microbiology and human rights are still not taught in HS. New subjects will be introduced once the infrastructure is in place in schools, said an official.        
	A plan to improve the gradation system is also being considered by the council. Students are at present awarded grades along with marks.        
	There is also a proposal to allow students who have passed the HS to re-appear in a paper of their choice the next year so that they can improve their marks.        
	A student who does so would be given a revised marksheet even if he or she scores less than in the first attempt.         
	HS 2010 starts on March 16 and will continue till April 12. Over 5 lakh students are to sit for the exams.

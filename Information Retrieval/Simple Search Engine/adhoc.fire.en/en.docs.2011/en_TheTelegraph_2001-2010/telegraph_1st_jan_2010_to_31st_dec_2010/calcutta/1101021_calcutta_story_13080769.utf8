          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three men were arrested on Tuesday night in connection with the clashes at Bidhannagar Kulipara that killed a man and injured four persons.        
	Balaram Mondal and Nattya Mondal, both supporters of the CPM, and Trinamul Congress activist Sujol Rong were picked up from the area.        
	The clashes continued on Wednesday with at least six rounds of bullets being exchanged between the two groups.        
	In the evening, the body of Dilip Mondal, a 35-year-old CPM supporter, was found floating in a canal adjacent to Kulipara.        
	CPM supporters claimed he had been killed by Trinamul men. Police denied link between Mondals death and the clashes.         
	A large police contingent has been deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incident. We had received complaints from both groups and arrested three men who were involved in the clash, said a senior police officer of Bidhannagar sub-division.        
	Local CPM councillor Ila Nandy blamed rivalry within the Trinamul for the clashes.        
	According to residents, a bijoya sammilani address by Nandi to her party workers on Sunday evening sparked the clashes.

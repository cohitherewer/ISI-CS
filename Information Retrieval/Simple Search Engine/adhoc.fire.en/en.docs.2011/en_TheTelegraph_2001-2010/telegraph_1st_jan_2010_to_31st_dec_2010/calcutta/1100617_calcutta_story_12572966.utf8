The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boost for students   More seats in CU colleges
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boost for students   
More seats in CU colleges          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta University on Wednesday allowed 30 of its affiliates to open 2,000 additional seats this year, providing relief to students who are running from one college to another for admission to undergraduate courses.        
	Of the 2,000 additional seats, 500 will be in the honours category and the rest for pass students.        
	The inspection of the colleges are over and the colleges are ready to increase their seats, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of the university.        
	Some of the institutions that have been given the go-ahead to increase their seats are Vidyasagar College, Basanti Devi College, Bangabasi College, Bijoy Krishna Girls College, Netajinagar College, Maharaja Srish Chandra College, Metiabruz College and Sanskrit College.        
	The 160-odd colleges under Calcutta University now have a little more than 80,000 seats in the honours and general courses.        
	A university official said the decision to increase the number of seats was taken following a spurt in the demand for certain courses, including those in English, Bengali, political science, geography, physics, chemistry, math and accountancy.        
	The demand for studying English honours is the highest. Subjects such as geography and chemistry, too, are much in demand, the official added.        
	The move will bring relief to students who have scored between 60 and 75 per cent in plus-II. These students stand no chance to secure a berth in top-rung colleges as there are too many students with 80 per cent or more marks.        
	They will flock to second-rung colleges where we have allowed an increase in the number of seats, said a university official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City set for heat amp; power trauma
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City set for heat amp; power trauma

	Calcutta is set to suffer its second abnormal Celsius rise in a month over the next few days with the most-wanted Norwester nowhere on the radar and the weatherman sounding a heat-wave warning for south Bengal.        
	The heat-wave conditions in five south Bengal districts from Tuesday will also push up the mercury in Calcutta and its suburbs over the next two days, warned Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Monday was hot and uncomfortable as well, though it may not have shown the week in meteorological terms. You felt the heat on Monday mainly because of the high humidity range of 66 to 88 per cent. The maximum temperature was normal at 35.6 degrees Celsius. But Tuesday onwards, temperatures might shoot up while humidity will plummet, said Debnath.        
	So brace for hot, dry winds blowing in from neighbouring Bihar, Jharkhand and parts of Orissa with almost no chance of relief pouring in from the cloudless skies for at least 48 hours. The city has not had a single Norwester this summer, turning the first two weeks of April into the hottest in a decade. Temperatures had peaked at 41 degrees Celsius (Dum Dum) on April 11.        
	Power cuts too made a comeback on Monday with CESC-served areas facing a deficit of 166MW that meant loadshedding for up to one-and-a-half hours. Areas under the state utility suffered more with a shortfall of 300MW during peak hours triggering three-hour power cuts.        
	A CESC spokesperson blamed the loadshedding on a power deficit in the grid.        
	The deficit was ostensibly caused by a 210MW unit at Kolaghat, a 110MW one at Durgapur Projects Ltd and a 250MW unit at Mejia collapsing simultaneously. Demand goes up when temperatures rise. However, the units that tripped on Monday could be up by Tuesday, promised an official of the West Bengal Power Distribution Company Ltd.

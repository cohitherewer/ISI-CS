                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girl faints after teacher slap
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A Class IX student of a Sonarpur school fainted after allegedly being slapped by her Bengali teacher for writing a shayari in her classmates exercise book on Wednesday.        
	Susmita Mandals mother took her to hospital, from where she was released after treatment. She was prescribed painkillers.        
	Susmitas father Dilip lodged a complaint against teacher Soumi Dutta of Chauhati High School with Sonarpur police station on Thursday evening.         
	I was not home when my daughter lost consciousness after she returned from school on Wednesday. She had also fainted at school after being hit by her teacher. She was traumatised and complaining of pain in her neck, said Dilip.        
	The school denied the slapping. Headmaster Prasanta Sen said: I am not aware of the complaint. But I can say the teacher did not hit her. Dutta could not be reached for comment.        
	A boy in Susmitas class had allegedly complained to the headmaster after she wrote the couplet in his exercise book. Sen had asked the Bengali teacher to look into the matter.         
	Dutta scolded Susmita and brought her to me. I confiscated her school bag and asked her to tell her parents to meet me. I can guarantee no one had slapped her, Sen said.        
	Police said they would talk to Susmita after she recovered. We will talk to the boy who had complained and also the Bengali teacher, the investigating officer said.        
	The girls father said it was no crime to write something in a classmates exercise book as long as the language was not objectionable. My daughter has told me that she had not written anything bad.        
	The allegation comes at a time the government is trying to stop corporal punishment, which was banned by the high court in 2004.

                      Soul-searching social drama                    City-based group Bandage will stage Sabse Bada Nautankibaaz, as part of the ongoing 10th Vodafone Odeon theatre festival in association with t2, this evening. Directed by Mir, the multi-lingual play explores the actor, a smart alec, who we Indians fondly address as Nautanki. This actor exists deep down inside every human being, the being who is forever planning to outsmart his rivals and win. The play attempts to search for that perfect Nautanki in us. Just about anybody  a student, a housewife or a business executive  can be a Nautanki. The chosen ones will be interrogated in front of a live audience with some funny but tricky situations to handle. This experimental stage contest is open to all and the winner will be crowned Vodafone Sabse Bada Nautanki.            Event: Sabse Bada Nautankibaaz at Vodafones Odeon 2010 in association with t2 When: Today; 5 pm Where: Kund Area, City Centre, Salt Lake

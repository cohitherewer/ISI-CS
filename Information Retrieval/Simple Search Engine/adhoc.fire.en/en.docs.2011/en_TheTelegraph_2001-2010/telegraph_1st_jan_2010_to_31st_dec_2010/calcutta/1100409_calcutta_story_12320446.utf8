The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mother lives apart, wins upkeep
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mother lives apart, wins upkeep
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                      A scene from Deewar, in which Nirupa Roy refuses to live with son Amitabh Bachchan                          
	A man has the right to deny maintenance to his wife if she does not stay with him but he must pay maintenance to his mother even if she chooses to live separately, the high court ruled on Thursday.         
	While upholding a judgment by a Burdwan court ordering a Calcutta police constable to pay Rs 1,500 a month to his widowed mother as maintenance, Justice Asim Roy of the high court said: The mother has every right to stay in a place of her choice.         
	The judge said: A husband can say that he would not pay maintenance to his wife for not staying with him (before obtaining divorce). But in case of his mother, he cannot say so. If the mother does not want to stay with her son or his family and stays in a place of her choice, the son is bound to pay her maintenance if she demands for it.        
	Ejramul Ali Mondal, a Calcutta police constable, had approached the high court to challenge the order issued by the Burdwan court four months ago directing him to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 1,500 to his mother Hazera Bibi.         
	He told the court his mother had ignored his request of staying with him. She has been living in the familys ancestral house at Kalna in Burdwan along with two minor daughters.        
	Most people have the impression where that elderly parents can only claim maintenance if their children drive them out of home. But Justice Roys judgment made it clear that even if a son wants to keep his parents with him and the parents want to stay elsewhere, they would still have the right to claim maintenance, said advocate Subroto Mukherjee.        
	Ejramul Ali, the only earning son of the widow, told the high court that he drew a salary of Rs 14,000 per month.         
	I have to maintain my wife and children who stay with me in a rented house in Calcutta. I have no problem if my mother and sisters come to Calcutta and stay with us. But it is not possible for me to pay her a maintenance of Rs 1,500 per month.        
	He added: My mother is refusing to stay with us in Calcutta and living in Kalna. Then why did the court ask me to pay her the maintenance?         
	The lawyer appearing for the widow said: My client likes to live in her ancestral home, where her husband also lived. She is happy there. Her son cannot force her come to Calcutta.

  - A touch of Kerala                              Kalaripayattu being staged during Milaap, the annual fest of Spicmacay, in the city recently                                  
	The high point of the sixth edition of Milaap, the annual fest of Spicmacay, an organisation that promotes Indian culture, was a Kalaripayattu performance by a nine-member troupe from Vallabhatta Kalari Sangam institute in Kerala.         
	Once recognised as the science of war, Kalaripayattu is a form of self-defence steeped in tradition. The performers used sharp-edged swords, daggers, long sticks and a piece of cloth to combat one another.        
	Organised along with Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA) on the school premises, Milaap saw students actively participating, as they chanted the names of the various animals depicted by the performers. Milaap is a rotating fest organised by Spicmacay at a different school each year.         
	Kalaripayattu originated in 12th Century Kerala. Our state government is trying to include it in the school curriculum now, said performer Krishnadas, who runs the institute based in Chavakkad town in Kerala.        
	The performers kept their focus on each others movements. We teach our students never to lose eye contact. We are only aware of the enemys eyes and not the sharp objects, explained Krishnadas.         
	Some of the stunts were jaw-dropping, including the one where the artist glided a knife across his chest and arms in swift hand movements. The students learnt a lot too. Their discipline and energy are striking, said Aditya Jhunjhunwala, a student of Class X.         
	The group also performed at GD Birla Sabhagar, St Xaviers College and several city schools.         
	Other popular events at the two-day fest included jute crafts, poster-making, glass-painting, embroidery and shell crafts on Day I. Day II lined up some fun events like salad-making, cartooning, hairstyling, nail art and poetry for students of classes XI and XII.         
	LSA topped in most of the events, with Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School coming first in the drama category. St Sebastians School won the photography contest, with rush hour in Calcutta as the theme.                    RS

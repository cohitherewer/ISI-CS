The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC relief for murder accused
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC relief for murder accused
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A five-judge bench of the high court on Thursday ruled that a murder accused could file anticipatory bail pleas more than once at each level of the judiciary  from the lowest criminal court to the Supreme Court.        
	The order overrules a three-decade-old verdict by a three-judge bench of the high court, which stated that a murder accused could move an anticipatory bail plea only once in each court.        
	Tuesdays ruling will have a far-reaching effect. Itll help accused get natural justice, said lawyer Gitanath Ganguli.        
	The bench that delivered the verdict comprised Chief Justice J.N. Patel, Justice B. Bhattacharya, Justice P.C. Ghosh, Justice K.J. Sengupta and Justice Asim Roy.        
	The ruling followed anticipatory bail pleas filed before the division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice Raghunath Roy last year by three murder accused  Suman Saha, Sudip Sen and Jayanta Deb.        
	After the bench rejected their pleas, the trio wanted to move a similar petition in the court for a second time.        
	Ashish Sanyal, who represented one of the accused, submitted that there was no bar on a murder accused to seek anticipatory bail more than once from the same court.        
	Justice Talukdar, the senior judge of the bench, did not reject Sanyals submission but declined to pass any order because of the earlier verdict by a higher (three-judge) bench. He referred the matter to the chief justice, said a court official.        
	The chief justice set up a three-judge bench to decide whether a five-judge bench should be set up to settle the issue. The three-judge bench comprising the chief justice, Justice Bhattacharya and Justice Roy had two months ago observed that the issue should be dealt with by a five-judge bench.        
	The five-judge bench passed its order on Thursday turning down the earlier verdict.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Website to pay traffic fines
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Website to pay traffic fines
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta police on Monday launched online payment of fines for traffic rule violations using either a debit or a credit card.         
	The service will also enable car owners to check whether cases are pending against their vehicles for breaking traffic rules.        
	A link called Case Details and Payment at www.kolkatatrafficpolice.org leads to a site where a car owner can find the details of his or her vehicle either by quoting its registration and engine numbers. If the traffic police have contacted the owner for rule violation, the case number can be quoted for accessing the vehicles details.        
	The site leads to a payment gateway where fines can be paid using a debit or a credit card, said joint commissioner (traffic) Vineet Goyel.                
	The idea is to utilise technology so that people get the maximum benefit. Next, I believe we can start a service wherein taxis can be available on call, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.

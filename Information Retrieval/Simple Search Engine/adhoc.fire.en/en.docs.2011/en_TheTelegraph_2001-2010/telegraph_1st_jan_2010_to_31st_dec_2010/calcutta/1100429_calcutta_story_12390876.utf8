	A small fire broke out on the first-floor verandah of National Gems Higher Secondary School (junior section) in Behala on Wednesday morning following a short-circuit in a switchboard.        
	The fire brigade was immediately alerted but the school authorities doused the flames before the tenders arrived. The blaze was spotted by a teacher around 10.30am while she was taking class. No one was injured, said the headmistress of the James Long Sarani school.

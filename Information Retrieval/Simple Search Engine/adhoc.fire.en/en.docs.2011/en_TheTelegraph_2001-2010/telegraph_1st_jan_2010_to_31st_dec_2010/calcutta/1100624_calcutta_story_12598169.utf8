                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Close shave for kids as bus falls into ditch
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Forty-two school students and two parents had a narrow escape when the bus in which they were travelling back home fell into a ditch filled with water apparently after the driver tried to avert a collision with a goods carrier near Barasat on Wednesday.        
	The traumatised children, studying between classes I and V at Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission Vidyabhavan in Barrackpore, escaped with cuts and bruises.         
	The students, in wet and muddied clothes, were taken to a Barasat hospital where three of them had to be administered stitches  on the forehead, hand and leg. The rest were given first-aid and released.        
	Initially, the rear half of the bus was on the road, but by the time the rescue operation ended  the trapped were all brought out in half an hour  the whole vehicle had slid into the ditch.        
	Witnesses said the bus was travelling down Nilgunge Road towards Barasat around 11.30am when a goods carrier overtook it from the left and suddenly swerved right. The bus driver, to avert a mishap, veered left but he apparently lost control of the vehicle.        
	The bus hurtled into the ditch, around 3-4 feet of which is under water, before toppling to its left. The children and two parents inside the bus were screaming. The driver and his help, too, started shouting for help after they managed to come out to safety, said Dipanjan Datta, a student of Morning Star College near the mishap site, around 7km from Barasat.        
	Dipanjan and his friends, who witnessed the mishap from a tea stall in front of the college gate, rushed to the site and started rescuing the children through the windows. They were soon joined by firemen and police.        
	The children were in shock. They were crying and pleading with us to take them home. We brought them to the tea stall and gave them milk and biscuits, said Sunny Gupta, a student of Morning Star College.        
	Ana Karmakar, who was accompanying her son Soumyadeep on the bus, was seated behind the driver.        
	The goods carrier suddenly appeared in front of us and I saw our driver vigorously trying to veer to the left. The next thing I remember was that I was being pulled out. I was relieved to see that my son who was sitting in the front row had already been rescued, Ana recalled.        
	The driver and the helper have been detained. We are trying to find out the cause of the accident and who was at fault, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Swami Girijananda, the secretary of Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission, said: We are concerned about the students and are in touch with their families. A travel agency runs the bus. We have asked the vehicle operators to meet us tomorrow.

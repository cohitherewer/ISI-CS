The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trapped on campus
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trapped on campus
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Fifteen members of the Jadavpur University executive council remained gheraoed by students till late on Thursday, over 36 hours after they had been taken hostage for their decision to install closed-circuit TV cameras on campus.        
	A number of senior EC members, including pro-vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta, complained of uneasiness because of the strain and the lack of sleep, but the JU students refused to withdraw the agitation. At least six of the officials held up are patients of hypertension.         
	The officials are allowed to move around the three-storey Aurobindo Bhavan, the varsitys main administrative block, but not step out.        
	The basis of the students agitation cannot be justified, a trapped EC member told Metro over the phone on Thursday.        
	The students are protesting the move to step up security by installing CCTV cameras and making identity cards mandatory on campus.        
	Such measures have been implemented without any fuss on leading campuses in the capital (see box).        
	But JU students feel the cameras would be an infringement of their privacy and the ID cards would violate their right to enter the campus freely.        
	The steps we want to take are accepted security measures on most major campuses in todays world, said an EC member. When these students start working in big companies, they will be surrounded by cameras and forced to carry ID cards. Will they gherao their bosses then? he asked.        
	Both JNU and Delhi University have closed-circuit cameras. None of them faced protests when they decided to install the device. We will soon increase the number of CCTV cameras, said Pradeep Sangwan, the chief security officer of JNU. The CCTV works as a crime deterrent.        
	At DU, proctor Gurmit Singh wondered why students should object to a move aimed at providing security to them. Its a positive move and should be encouraged.        
	A DU official said the cameras had been put up following a rise in the number of teasing and ragging incidents. The cameras have been helpful in bringing down such cases.        
	The vice-chancellor, pro-vice chancellor and the registrar are among those gheraoed by students from all three faculties  engineering, science and arts. The students claimed they had not faced any difficulty as they had been allowed to remain in their AC offices, have their meals and use the washrooms.        
	The authorities remained firm on implementing the security measures. I dont know exactly what their (the students) point of contention is. CCTVs are an accepted security measure in all reputable institutions across the world, said vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh. We can engage in talks if I get a written request to that effect.        
	Students rejected a suggestion to form a committee to end the impasse as the security measures were being implemented without their consent.

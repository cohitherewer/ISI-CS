          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The city police have claimed to have busted a racket engaged in preparing fake documents for stolen two-wheelers with the arrest of six persons over the past few days.        
	Several fake documents  including blue books, registration certificates and voter-ID cards  have been seized from those rounded up. The police said they were looking for a few others involved with the racket. We stumbled upon the racket while probing the theft of a motorcycle from Bowbazar, said Damayanti Sen, the joint commissioner of police, crime.        
	The first to be held was Prabir Saha, who was picked up from Banipur in North 24-Parganas. The sleuths learnt from Prabir that the kingpin of the racket was Biswajit Goldar of Barasat.        
	Biswajit, and two of his associates who helped him prepare the fake documents, were rounded up next. Their interrogation led us to Sandip Bhawal of Baguiati, Sabir Hussain of Narkeldanga and Mohammed Firoz of New Town, said an officer. A stolen motorcycle was recovered from Bhawal.

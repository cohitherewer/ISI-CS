The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seat of power turns garbage dump
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Seat of power turns garbage dump
                                          
	Students of several city schools regularly take time off on weekends to make Calcutta clean and green but the people who govern the state dont even bother to keep their office free of clutter. Metro takes a tour of Writers Buildings and discovers that it sets an example in untidiness              
	Filthy passage        
	Wastepaper baskets are hard to find at the state secretariat. The few that can be found overflow with garbage, as do the corridors.        
	The worst perhaps awaits the visitor on the first floor, in front of the finance department. Mounds of used papers and files hog the width of the passage like hawkers on city footpaths. Some of the broad parapets, visible from the corridors, are also stacked with wastepaper.        
	Women hawk food items in the corridors and the washbasins leak, adding to the filth.        
	Look at this place. It is already unclean, said an employee, defending his act of throwing a paper packet that contained luchi-tarkari he bought from a hawker to the floor.         
	Officialspeak: More than 1.5 lakh people visit Writers every day. Our department has only 171 employees though the sanctioned strength is 233. Also, we have only 50 sweepers though the sanctioned strength is 78. Then there are employees who are unwell or on leave. We do not have enough hands to ensure that the vast building is clean, said S.S. Sahu of the public works department (PWD), which maintains the state secretariat.        
	I have written to the authorities several times to fill up the posts but to no avail, he added.        
	Furniture dump        
	The furniture discarded by all the departments in the state secretariat are dumped in open spaces on the ground floor.        
	The stack in front of Block II is at least 10 feet high and at least 30 feet wide.        
	Going by the thick layer of dust on the leather seats of the chairs, it appears the furniture have been there a long time.         
	Not only is this an eyesore, there are security issues as well. The authorities should not be so complacent, said a clerk in the transport department who did not wish to be named.        
	Ministers version: We have to float tenders to auction the old furniture after their valuation. This is the only way the furniture can be disposed of. It is a time-consuming process, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami.        
	Wire mess        
	Another eyesore and potential fire hazard are the cables dangling from the walls at many places in the corridors, including the ones on the first floor which houses the offices of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and many of his cabinet colleagues, as well as outside the buildings.        
	Ministers version: The electrical lines are all covered. The cables that you are talking about are telephone lines, said Goswami.        
	Writers Buildings is much cleaner now than before. We are looking to improve things even more, he added.                          DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY AND RITH BASU

	Agnideep Ghoshs face lit up at the sight of visitors. I am Abhinav Bindra and I won a gold in the Commonwealth Games 2010, he says with a smile. Like a true sportsman, he also makes it a point to shake hands with everyone.         
	Ghosh is one of the students participating in a three-day sports exhibition organised by the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP) on its 36th anniversary from November 18 to 20.        
	The theme of the exhibition  A Sporting Chance  revolves round the rights of children with disability to be included in mainstream sports, said Reena Sen, the executive director of IICP.        
	Sports, in this case, also included fun things like visiting the zoo or an entertainment park, playing with dolls or kitchen play.        
	The exhibition was inaugurated by Sanjay Wadvani, the British deputy high commissioner in Calcutta. The guests included dancer Tanushree Shankar and industrialist Sanjay Budhia.        
	Colourful charts met the eye the minute one entered the IICP campus at Taratala. Besides, many rooms of the institute were converted into a mini gallery, displaying charts, illustrations and models on various international sporting events.         
	In one room, a group of students staged a skit on Olympic Games, tracing its growth from the early years to the present day. Dressed in white costumes, the students had fun posing as ancient Greeks. The kids also carried a cardboard torch and the winner got to wear a wreath of olive leaves.        
	The students were really excited since morning. We got two weeks to plan and put up the exhibition, said a teacher at the IICP.        
	In another room, Surojit Mondol, a Class V student explained their theme  London Olympics 2012. While Rule Britannia was being played on a computer, the charts and models displayed the sports scene in England.        
	But who was his sports idol? Sachin Tendulkar, pat came the reply.        
	The students also put up a chart on unconventional sports popular in Britain, including barrel-rolling, Aunt Sally and cheese-rolling.        
	The computer room had a sports quiz ready for the guests. Visiting every room and inspecting the models, Wadvani said it had been a huge learning experience for him. Calcutta needs to open up to all, he added.         
	A campaign, Badte kadam II, under the National Trust Disability Awareness Programme, was flagged off by Shankar Roy Chowdhury, a former army general, on the second day. The campaign seeks inclusion of special children into the mainstream and will cover eight districts in the state.         
	The visiting schools included The Heritage, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, Loreto House and Akshar.

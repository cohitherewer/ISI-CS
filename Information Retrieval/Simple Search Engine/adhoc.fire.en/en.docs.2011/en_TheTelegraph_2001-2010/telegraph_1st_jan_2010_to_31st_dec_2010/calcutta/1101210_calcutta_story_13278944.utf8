The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Term rein on principals
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Term rein on principals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The University Grants Commission (UGC) has fixed a five-year term for college principals with a maximum extension of another five years, turning a job with few takers into an even more unattractive proposition.        
	Under the new rules, someone elevated to the post of principal at the age of 45 would need to spend at least the last five years of his or her career as an ordinary teacher working under someone who is possibly a junior.        
	Officials of the West Bengal College Service Commission, which recruits principals and lecturers for state-aided colleges, fear that finding college heads would now become even more difficult.        
	More than 200 posts of college principals are already vacant, which is around 50 per cent of the total sanctioned posts. I dont think anyone would want to become a principal and then go back to being an ordinary teacher at the fag end of his or her career, Himangshu Ghosh, the chairman of the college service commission, told Metro.        
	The principals of several city colleges are set to retire in 2011, adding to the problem.        
	So why is a principals job not attractive anymore? According to a senior official, teachers with the credentials to become principals were reluctant to take up the responsibility because of various factors, including the turmoil on campuses across the state.         
	These are politically surcharged times and unrest has become common on campuses. Add to this corruption and mudslinging and a principals job couldnt get worse. Also, the financial benefits are not commensurate with the responsibility and accountability of the hot seat, the official added.        
	Lack of training for administrative responsibility, as opposed to academic proficiency, is also a hurdle for principals in Bengal.         
	Sujit Das, the general secretary of the All Bengal Principals Council, hoped that the state government would take up the matter with Delhi. We will urge the government not to accept the new UGC rule, he added.        
	After completing the first five-year term, a principal will be eligible for an extension of another five years only if he or she goes through a fresh selection procedure.         
	The existing rules stipulate that college principals can remain the heads of their institutions till their retirement at the age of 60. The eligibility criteria are a PhD and at least 15 years of teaching.         
	The new set of UGC regulations states that candidates for the posts of principals must possess experience of having worked as a research guide. Only those who get doctoral degrees in accordance with the UGCs modified rules will be exempt from NET and SET for recruitment as teachers.

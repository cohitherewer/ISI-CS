	The second financial hub in the country, after Bandra-Kurla in Mumbai, will be set up in New Town, said housing minister Gautam Deb on Friday. Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will lay the foundation stone for the project on October 13.        
	We will develop nearly 300 acres where major financial institutions will shift their backoffices and IT-enabled operations. Among the offices will be those of central government agencies like the Reserve Bank and LIC, said Deb.        
	Power-cut alert: Power supply to Madurdaha, Anandapur, Rajdanga, Narkelbagan, Laskarhat, East Calcutta Township, Kasba Dharmatala Road, Picnic Garden, Panchannagram, VIP Bazaar, Bosepukur, Avishikta Housing, Kasba Industrial Estate, Bengal Peerless Housing, Purbachal Road, Ruchira Residency, Kalikapur, Kasba Neelachal Housing Complex, Survey Park, Santoshpur Avenue, Modern Park and adjacent areas may be disrupted between 8am and noon on Saturday because of maintenance by CESC.        
	Puja security: The city police have identified 18 major pujas where a special security force each will be positioned to ensure revellers face no problem. Each force will be led by two IPS officers. Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said the city had been divided into seven complexes with one major puja as the centre of each. There will be a separate force in each complex to look after traffic movement and crowds on the road.        
	The city police will also erect 34 watch towers where cops with binoculars would be posted. Besides, there would be Quick Reaction Teams to tackle any emergency, he said.         
	Theft: Thieves broke into a house on Dover Terrace in Gariahat and decamped with Rs 10,000 in cash and gold ornament weighing around 35 grams on Thursday night. In another incident, thieves walked away with a cellphone and a laptop from a Jodhpur Garden home late on Thursday.        
	Green march: A march will be organised from Victoria Memorial Hall to Raj Bhavan and back on Sunday at 10am to voice concern about climate change on the occasion of Global Environment Action Day.         
	Bombs found: The CID bomb squad found three crude bombs in a shop in Howrahs Bankra where an explosion killed three men and injured six around 10.30pm on Thursday. Preliminary probe suggests there was a huge stockpile of explosives in the shop.        
	Doctors unrest: Junior doctors of R Ahmed Dental College and Hospital held a demonstration on the premises on Friday and locked the gates demanding promotion of seven students who had failed their final-year examination. Patients could not enter the hospital for more than an hour because of the agitation.

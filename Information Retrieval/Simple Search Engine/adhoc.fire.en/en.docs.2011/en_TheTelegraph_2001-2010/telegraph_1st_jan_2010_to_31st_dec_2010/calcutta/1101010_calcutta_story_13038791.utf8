The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Retire the word 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Retire the word

	Dewakar Goel takes exception to the term retirement. The author of the self-help book Endless Travel (picture left), for people above 50, feels that you never retire as long as your mind and body are active.         
	We dont plan our lives in advance. At 40, we dont give a thought to what we will do at 50. We expect others to understand our needs and then end up disappointed, explains Goel, a general-manager with the Airports Authority of Indias southern region. He has written another self-help book, Living a Stressful Life With Joy, on dealing with stress at the workplace. His other works include three collections of poetry and a management textbook.         
	With life expectancy going up, India has a large population of the ageing. After retiring from work and fulfilling family duties, we think there is no other purpose to our life. We expect our children to look after us, but they might have their own priorities. We must plan for a life after retirement, insists Goel.         
	He recounts his meeting with a couple in their 70s in Switzerland that led him to write Endless Travel.         
	I was amazed to learn that they had recently got married and were on their honeymoon. They were childhood sweethearts who had lost their spouses. After a chance meeting in London, they rekindled the romance of their youth. This should be the attitude of the new-age senior citizen, Goel said.

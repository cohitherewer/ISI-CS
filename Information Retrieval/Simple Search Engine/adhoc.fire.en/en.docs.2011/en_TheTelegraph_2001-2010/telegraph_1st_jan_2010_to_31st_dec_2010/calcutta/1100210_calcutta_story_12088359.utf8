	 Apropos Want to be doc? Read up on Robin Cook (November 27), the senseless advice given to medical students by health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra that they should read novels by Robin Cook to become better doctors underscores how out of touch our minister is from modern medicine.           
	Although practical experience of treating patients can certainly enhance clinical acumen, Mishras opinion that knowledge from medical books is very different from real problems doesnt makes sense. Textbooks and training at medical college form the basis of a physicians education.           
	The standard of therapy in hospitals and nursing homes in West Bengal has been plummeting during the long tenure of Mishra as the leader of healthcare. Such reckless comments further undermine the dwindling public trust in the medical system in Bengal.

  Apropos ldquo;Rear-ing to go amp; how! rdquo; (December 3, 2009), it is matter of great concern that young women and girls opt for various artificial methods to get an ldquo;hour glass rdquo; figure (pictures of role models above). They will try out anything from weight loss therapy to botox treatment and now gluteoplasty, which has proved non-conducive to good health. Such procedures invariably have harmful consequences mdash; quick-fix weight reduction could give rise to stomach ulcers, while botox could result in malignancy. The government must constitute an agency to verify the claims made by beauty treatment centres and issue warnings in the media for the benefit of young and innocent women.

	The mock drill conducted by Calcutta police to assess the security systems at malls and hotels in town revealed an alarming picture (Security shun at malls, hotels, November 21). It was shameful that plainclothes policemen could easily walk through beeping door-frame metal detectors with guns and knives tucked under their belts. Our administrators need to question whether such incidents betray inadequate training or lack of alertness on part of the security personnel. The Mumbai attacks should have sounded a warning bell and malls and hotels a year on should have been ready with foolproof security. .

	Apropos Vedika could have been saved, November 13, most schools in the city lack basic medical facilities. Clarity of the role of school staff in an emergency is essential for timely response. The parents of Vedika Goyal, who collapsed in school and died, didnt blame the authorities, but other students said that the teenager had received no medical attention. I hope this incident pushes the government and educational institutions to revamp their preparedness to handle medical emergencies.             
	Pooja Gupta,
  Howrah                     
	The answer to the question Do city schools lack basic medical facilities? (November 13) is a definite yes. I belong to the batch of 2007-08 at a premier institute in Calcutta. In school, I had once injured myself on the basketball court and an X-ray later revealed I had fractured my collarbone. But I was made to sit in the waiting area of my school for three hours for my parents to arrive and take me to hospital. The authorities of my school, like in the case of Vedika, kept giving my family inaccurate details of what medical attention was being given to me.           
	I wasnt admitted to a hospital because the school authorities did not want to take responsibility for anything that could have happened there. This is the case with most schools in Calcutta. The government should declare guidelines on the minimum medical amenities, training and risk preparedness that schools should have.           
	Raghav Nandan Poddar,
  Address not mentioned                     
	It is really sad that schools, even after charging huge fees, dont maintain medical facilities for students. Every school should designate one employee for providing medical attention to students. This persons contact details should be provided to parents so that they can intimate him/her about their childrens medical problems.           
	Manish Kejriwal,
  Address not mentioned                     
	With due respect to the affected family, I would like to say that a school is not a hospital. A medical emergency can occur in a building, movie hall, mall, bus or any such place. Who will we blame then?           
	Parents also have the duty of keeping the school updated about their childrens medical conditions. On their part, schools should have a qualified nurse present during school hours, and the phone numbers of doctors on call and the nearest hospital should be displayed properly. Teachers should also be trained on handling emergency situations.           
	Rakesh Bhatia,
  Loudon Street                     
	I am a former student of the school where Vedika studied. I agree that our schools do not have basic medical resources  neither basic equipment nor any trained staff  which should be a must in all schools. I dont think the schools even care. Leave aside first-aid, the basic sanitation in bathrooms is atrocious. A girl in my class used to have epileptic fits. Whenever she had an attack, my classmates and the teacher would just hold her  thats it. As an adult, I realise how negligent our school was.           
	Given the pressure such schools put on parents, right from compulsory buying of notebooks to exorbitant fees, medical facilities on the school premises should be a right rather than a privilege.           
	Aditi,
  New York, US                     
	Most principals and management of renowned schools are indifferent about providing medical facilities on campus. During my 16-year tenure as the principal of Hariyana Vidya Mandir in Salt Lake, my repeated requests to the management to employ a full-time doctor fell on deaf ears. The CBSE/ISCE boards, while granting affiliation to schools, insist on fire-fighting preparedness but never ask about a schools medical facilities. Even the education department, while issuing a no objection certificate to a school, dont make medical facilities mandatory. Vedikas untimely death should be an eye-opener for the authorities of schools, who charge exorbitant fees but fail to provide basic medical facilities. The education department and the CBSE/ISCE boards should also make it compulsory for all schools to have an adequately qualified full-time doctor in school.           
	Basudeb Bhattacharya,
  Salt Lake                     
	Hariyana Vidya Mandir replies: Basudeb Bhattacharya never requested or advised us to upgrade the medical facilities in the school. Besides, we have first-aid, a sick room and two nursing staff in our school. In case of a minor injury, we give first-aid to students, but beyond that, if there is a medical problem, we immediately take the students to Apollo Hospitals or AMRI Hospitals. We do not wait for the payment to be made by the parents. We also have doctors close by whom we can call, but usually we rush the students to hospital.

	Apropos Tick-tock rebels at Writers (November 19), the late coming and early going of employees at Writers Buildings is an open secret. The employees of the state secretariat are used to attending office according to their convenience. Instead of taking stern action against them, for decades our government turned a blind eye on punctuality in the biggest office of the state.             
	Atif Ayaz,
  Serampore                               
	I am thankful to P.B. Saha for going through my letter (Book retort, November 25). However, I would like to point out that winning a Nobel does not make one sacrosanct. When Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general was embroiled in the food-for-oil scam in Iraq, he managed to herd up 70 Nobel laureates praising him.             
	Amartyas Sen original statement (Calcutta low crime linked to books: Sen, The Telegraph, April 21, 2009) was so full of holes that Sen himself sent a clarification (Culture and the city, The Telegraph, April 25, 2009).           
	Also, had Sahas reiteration that all its pitfalls notwithstanding, Calcutta retains its vibrant ambience as a cultural hub been true, bookstore Odyssey, or professional theatre halls of north Calcutta would not have had to down shutters for want of patronage.           
	Second, in response to Sahas description of Sen as so great a man, the pride of Bengal, I would like to point out that West Bengal reveres its Nobel laureates but seldom listens to their advice  be it Sens suggestions on primary education, public health or Singur.           
	Third, Saha is right that I have not been to Calcutta Book Fair for a decade as to me it looks like a carnival of the semi-literate. I get news of publication of books on my field on the Internet, often with extracts, and I do not need to go to the fair to show the world that I am cultured.

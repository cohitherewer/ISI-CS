	Babar Khan, accused of shooting at two youths on Ballygunge Circular Road five months ago, has been arrested in connection with a bar brawl in Sector V similar to the one that led to the earlier incident.         
	The 24-year-old, who was on the run, and five others had an altercation with another group of youths at the Shimmers lounge bar and restaurant in Sector V early on Sunday.         
	After security personnel drove both groups out of the bar around 2am, Babar and his accomplices attacked the other youths with chains and hockey sticks near Azad Hind Dhaba, around 300 metres away, said an officer of Sector V Electronic Complex police station.        
	When the members of the other group fled in a car, Babar chased them. He fled after the car carrying his rivals hit a lamp post near Nicco Park, added the officer.        
	Soubhik Chakraborty, a resident of Purbachal in Salt Lake who was injured in the mishap, had lodged a complaint against Babar and his companions.        
	Babar was arrested at City Centre on Tuesday night when he arrived there with a group of girls. He was charged under Section 307 of Indian Penal Code (attempt to murder). The police had no idea that the youth was wanted for the March 21 incident.        
	While checking his criminal records, the cops realised that he was the man who had allegedly shot and injured leather dealer Shaqeel Khan and DJ Vishal Agarwal outside Azad Hind Dhaba on Ballygunge Circular Road.        
	According to police, Babar Khan, also known as Abu Naseer, was born in Shibpur, Howrah, and is a resident of Zakaria Street. He had been arrested earlier but was released on bail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC gets slum land
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CMC gets slum land
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic body has started building 250 temporary shelters for the residents of gutted Ultadanga slum.        
	The ownership dispute over the 172-cottah plot, however, is still unresolved, with urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya claiming that the CMDA had handed over the plot to the civic body.        
	The shelters would comprise asbestos roofs on concrete walls. Civic officials surveyed the land, adjoining Bidhan Nagar Road station, on Wednesday.        
	Funds for the Rs 1crore-project would be borne equally by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the local area development fund of CPM Rajya Sabha member Shyamal Chakraborty, officials said.        
	A day after the January 12 blaze, Mamata Banerjee had announced that she would get 650 houses built for the victims. On Sunday, minister Bhattacharya said the state government would build 750 homes with central help under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.        
	Mamata had said the plot belonged to her railway ministry which had acquired it in the 1980s, a claim countered by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya who asserted that the ownership title was with the CMDA. The CMDA has handed over the land to the civic body, said Bhattacharya.        
	A CMDA official said: The railways had paid Rs 90 lakh for 43 cottahs. The rest of the plot has been handed over to the CMC.        
	An official in the chief engineers office of Eastern Railway refused comment.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 41-year-old widow was murdered at her home in Howrahs Jagachha early on Wednesday.         
	Mina Dutta was found lying dead, face up, on the bed of her room by son Abhijit when he returned home around 5.30am on Wednesday. Jewellery and cash were missing from the almirah in the room.        
	Abhijit, 24, is a guard at the National Institute of Homeopathy in Salt Lake. He left home for work at 7.30pm on Tuesday.        
	Police suspect the woman was strangulated by the wire of a cellphone charger. A pillow was probably pressed against her face so she could not scream.        
	More than one person was present in the room when the woman was murdered. The killers were known to the victim, said Sukesh Kumar Jain, the additional superintendent of police, Howrah.        
	Four glasses partly filled with country liquor, cigarette butts and an ashtray were found in the room, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Neither cops nor the family could tell the motive of the murder. Some neighbours said the Duttas had recently acquired some wealth.

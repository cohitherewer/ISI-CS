The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nothings off-side for soccer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Nothings off-side for soccer
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Rules are being bent for soccers biggest night on Sunday with the post-midnight vigil on Villa and Robben set to turn Calcutta into a city of the bleary-eyed on the first working day of the week.         
	With the World Cup final and the presentation ceremony in Joburgs Soccer City scheduled to drag beyond 2.15am even if the match is decided in regulation time, educational institutions and offices across town are expecting late arrivals as well as no-shows on Monday.        
	So does that mean the sleep-deprived soccer fan can take it easy on Monday without the fear of being penalised on Tuesday? Metro finds out what is in store for followers of the beautiful game.                 
	SCHOOLS         
	Leniency is the name of the game in most schools with La Martiniere for Boys allowing students to come in an hour late the day after the final and Lakshmipat Singhania Academy announcing classes on Saturday so that students can take Monday off.         
	I will be staying over at a friends place. With the presentation ceremony ending well past 2.30am, it would be impossible to get up at 6.30am, said a Class XII student of Apeejay.         
	He would be happy to know that Apeejay principal Rita Chatterjee has decided to put the red card aside for absenteeism on Monday. The Cup comes once in four years and children do learn a lot watching such an event, Chatterjee said.         
	Students of Nava Nalanda School have got the chance to stay up late for the final because of a holiday on Monday to celebrate the institutions board exam results, if not soccer.                 
	GOVT OFFICES         
	If the usually strict schools are playing ball, can the habitually lax government offices be far behind?         
	Truncated office hours have been the norm rather than the exception throughout the Cup and Monday is set to be an unofficial holiday across departments, according to sources at Writers Buildings.        
	On July 1, the day after the round-of-16 match between Spain and Portugal, attendance was so low in the first half of the day that not a file moved, said a transport department official.         
	He reached office at noon after sleeping through the morning, but many of his colleagues didnt even turn up. In any case, there is not a lot happening in this state or the state secretariat for that matter. Maybe things will pick up after the (Assembly) elections, he quipped.        
	A colleague said he would take a days casual leave if he didnt feel like coming to office on Monday. But for most, taking leave to watch the Cup final means wasting a CL.         
	Why take a CL? One can come to office and take a nap, declared a member of the CPM-affiliated union.              
	24x7 COMPANIES         
	They are experts at custom-made solutions, be it for clients or employees wanting to watch late-night soccer.        
	Workers in the 24x7 sector may not have the luxury of bunking office the morning after but many are planning to work from home on Monday or swap shifts to catch up on sleep.        
	For those on night duty during the match, the office television will be their window to Soccer City.         
	Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris, said most companies would go easy on employees coming in a little late the day after the final. As far as Acclaris is concerned, we encourage our people to take a break and watch a bit of the action on the office TVs, he said.        
	An MNC bank is taking its executives to Goa for its annual meet over the weekend, coinciding with the Cup final.         
	Rajib Das, the human resource director of an IT company, said a short trip for employees costs peanuts for companies but serves the dual purpose of gross motivation and team spirit.         
	Fun spots         
	Not every Calcuttan may be lucky enough to enjoy the Cup final curled up on a sofa or perched on a bar stool in a beach resort but the city does offer a few good choices, some for free. City Centre I in Salt Lake and City Centre 2 in New Town are in the middle of three-day Cup festival, complete with theme games. The activity zones have been given the look and feel of a football field with cutouts, goalposts and flags of the finalists.        
	CC amp;FC will show the final live on a projection screen. The club has also obtained a late-bar licence for the big night, which will begin with local band Xtacy belting out music from 8 to 11pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road map for clogged city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Road map for clogged city
          RITH BASU                                    
	Calcutta was trying to chart its road to the future on a day when politicians were bringing the streets to a standstill.         
	As thousands of CPM and Trinamul Congress supporters converged on the city centre to choke traffic, a group of citizens assembled at a venue barely 500 metres from the rally raj to draw up a long wish list for the city  from a classy airport to clutter-free pavements, a punctual citizenry to a pro-development political class.         
	But the man who was supposed to be the bridge between planning and execution chose to skip the seminar.        
	True to the days political agenda of disruption over development, mayor Sovan Chatterjee was conspicuous by his absence at the event despite the Calcutta Municipal Corporation being one of the organising partners along with the Indian Chamber of Commerce and the British Deputy High Commission.        
	 The mayor was supposed to attend the seminar but didnt. What disappoints me is that he didnt even send a representative, chamber official Bimal Kumar Basu rued at the open forum.        
	The other speakers included Sanjay Wadvani, the British deputy high commissioner, Michael Charlton, the CEO of Think London, Jayanta Roy, the president of the chamber, Credai chief Pradeep Sureka, actress Rituparna Sengupta, designer Agnimitra Paul and percussionist Bickram Ghosh.        
	The morning session began with Wadvani and Charlton suggesting ways to turn Calcutta into a dream city.         
	The deputy high commissioner cited the example of Glasgow, which fought lack of infrastructure and unemployment by floating private-public-partnerships called local development companies.         
	Charlton, the CEO of the company that is in charge of bringing foreign direct investment to London, prescribed creating better infrastructure and close co-ordination between governments and the business community.        
	For designer Agnimitra, the sorry state of the airport  being highlighted in a campaign by Metro  was shameful for a city aspiring to be a 21st century metropolis. The first impression of a city is the airport, she argued.        
	 Our airport is a bit of an embarrassment when you compare it to those in the other metros and even smaller cities like Pune, added Rituparna, also recommending a facelift for heritage buildings.        
	Bickram railed against the culture of rallies. Its just not logical. Anyone with a sense of decorum would not hold the city centre to ransom, he said.        
	The percussionist also said the city had an attitude problem that was reflected in the lack of discipline in every sphere.         
	My staff amble in around two hours late almost every other day, he complained.

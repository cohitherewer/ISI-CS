  - CIMA aims to turn common man into collector with works starting at Rs 500          SOMAK GHOSHAL                           Artworks being mounted on a wall of the CIMA Gallery ahead of Fridays inauguration of the three-day Art Mela. (Amit Datta)                                        
	From the ivory tower of galleries, museums and collectors residences to your very own living room: contemporary art by some of the finest artists of the country is poised to come down to earth.         
	Organised by CIMA Gallery, the three-day Art Mela, beginning Friday, will feature drawings, sketches and paintings by eminent names in the art world and priced, incredibly, between Rs 500 and Rs 25,000.         
	If there is one thing other than aesthetic merit that draws attention to contemporary art, it is its astronomical pricing. So the common connoisseur has to remain content with watching art inside galleries or museums. Between the dream of owning a Paresh Maity or a Ganesh Pyne and the reality of putting it up on ones living-room wall falls the forbidding shadow of wealth.         
	For the past three years, CIMA Gallery has tried to address this discrepancy through the Art Mela, an annual venture to reduce the gap between great art and its true admirers: the middle-class intelligentsia for whom the ownership of art has less to do with shrewd investment strategies than with the unadulterated thrill of possessing a masterpiece.         
	Three years ago when we first started this project, we found people waiting on the steps of the gallery hours before the mela was scheduled to open on Day 1, says Rakhi Sarkar, the director of CIMA.                                                         
	The public enthusiasm was matched by the response of the artists, who submitted works of the highest standards for a section of society they have always aspired to reach: the aam aadmi.                           
	This year, too, the mela offers a catholic mix of styles, genres and names. Veterans like Jogen Chowdhury, Suhas Roy and Lalu Prasad Shaw share wall space with younger artists like Sumitro Basak, Shreyasi Chatterjee and Abir Karmakar. There are a number of promising watercolours by students and striking work by artists with physical difficulties. The mela also brings together tribal art from western and central India, including a series of exquisite pen-and-ink drawings.         
	This is a unique experience in the way it transforms the gallery into a vibrant bazaar, adds Sarkar, who is seconded by Pratiti Basu Sarkar, the chief administrator of the gallery. For three days, the gallery loses its grim, serious edge, and people are allowed to touch, feel, and explore works by their favourite artists, something that they are expressly forbidden to indulge in at a museum or an art exhibition.         
	The artists, too, let their imagination run freely, even frivolously, and try out quirkier, more playful, and eclectic styles they may not experiment with when they submit works to the more conventional mainstream market.         
	Despite the relative informality of the endeavour, there are checks and balances to ascertain that the art reaches its target consumers, rather than the usual dealers and collectors. From pricing and registering to issuing full-fledged receipts with holograms, every attempt is made to ensure transparency and authenticity.         
	The Art Mela is open from 11am to 8pm, from Friday to Sunday.

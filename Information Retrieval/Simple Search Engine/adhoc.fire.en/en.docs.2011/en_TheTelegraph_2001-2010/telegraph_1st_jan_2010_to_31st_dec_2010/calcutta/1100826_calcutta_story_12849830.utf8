The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech hitch in last rites
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tech hitch in last rites
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                  
	A diseased civic bureaucracy took three weeks to replace a dead inkjet printer in the office of a city crematorium, keeping scores of families waiting over a fortnight for death certificates meant to be issued in a day.        
	Till Wednesday, the Calcutta Municipal Corporations health records unit at south Calcuttas Siriti crematorium was issuing hand-written temporary slips instead of death certificates for every cremation there since the lone printer conked out three weeks ago.         
	Chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chatterjee confirmed to Metro that a working printer had just been reinstalled at the crematorium, but had no answer for the three-week delay in repairing or replacing a simple tech tool found in every office.        
	For trader S. Kundalia (name changed on request), who lost his mother in the first week of August, the wait for a death certificate has delayed the execution of her will and various other formalities.        
	How can a malfunctioning printer be an excuse not to issue a death certificate in this day and age? I did not argue with the person at the counter that day only because I was too drained of energy and emotions, recalled Kundalia.        
	He has since been to the crematorium twice in as many weeks to check whether the certificate was ready, only to be told that a new printer is on the way.        
	With so many applications pending, I guess my mothers death certificate wont be issued till next week. Its such a shame that the officials dont realise how much their inefficiency inconveniences other people, he rued.        
	A death certificate is required for as basic a thing as a newspaper insertion to let people know of the bereavement and for formalities ranging from inheritance of assets to insurance claims to claiming of retirement/death benefits.        
	An official on duty at the crematorium claimed that a printer had been sought from the head office immediately after the old one had malfunctioned.        
	We did receive a replacement but even that was a faulty one. Hope the second one works, said the assistant sub-inspector.        
	Siriti used to be a traditional burning ghat till two incinerators were set up in 1990. An average of 10 bodies are cremated there every day.

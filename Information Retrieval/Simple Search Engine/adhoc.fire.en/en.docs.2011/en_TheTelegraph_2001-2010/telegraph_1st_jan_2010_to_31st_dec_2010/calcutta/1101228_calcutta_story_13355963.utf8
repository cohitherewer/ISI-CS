The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tease tackle with a kick
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tease tackle with a kick
          BRINDA SARKAR                                    
	Martial art is the new make-up for many Salt Lake women battling the threat of molestation or verbal abuse at every step they take in the township.        
	Between 40 to 45 per cent of the girls I coach confess that they want to learn karate only because it makes them feel secure, karate coach Premjit Sen told Metro.        
	According to Sen, who has been holding classes in Salt Lake since 1996, Sunday nights incident was just one among many that were sending women to martial arts training centres in droves.        
	Debarati Basak, a resident of AD Block, said a bicycle-borne man who had tried to molest her recently spat gutkha on her and fled when she managed to stave off his advances.        
	Another victim who did not wish to be named said a molester on the prowl was more likely to be on a bicycle or a motorbike than on foot. He will invariably try to grope you from behind and flee. I was molested by the same man twice, the second time in daylight. On both occasions, he was on a bicycle, she recalled.        
	A third woman stumbled and fell while trying to escape the clutches of a man who had tried to grope her from a moving car in the same area.        
	All three victims had jointly lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar police in August but nobody has been arrested yet. I dont know if the police have bothered pursuing our complaint. I am not sure our lanes are being patrolled better. I havent seen any police jeeps around, said Debarati.        
	Most cases of teasing and molestation go unreported. The police blame the silence of victims for their failure to rein in the tease-and-molest brigade. How can we take action if women do not come to us with their complaints? insisted an officer at Bidhannagar East police station.        
	A woman who lives in Debaratis block saw the face of the man who molested her but did not go to the police because she thought it was pointless.        
	I have seen other women of my block lodge complaints that were possibly never investigated, leave alone followed up. Another complaint by me would have meant nothing, she said.         
	On another occasion, two teenaged girls going from City Centre to Karunamoyee on a rickshaw were groped by three men on a motorbike. The girls didnt lodge a police complaint fearing they would be targeted again. We live here as paying guests and do not want to take a chance, said one of the teenagers.        
	So where does all this leave the woman who has no choice but to live or work in Salt Lake?        
	It is not as if Salt Lake has suddenly become unsafe. It has been like this for many years, but now women have realised that they need to take on the molesters, said karate coach Sen.

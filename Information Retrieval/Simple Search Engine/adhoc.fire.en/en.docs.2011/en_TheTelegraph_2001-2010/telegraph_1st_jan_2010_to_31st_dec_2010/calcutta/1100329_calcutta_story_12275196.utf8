The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A tale of two pavements   Faint signs of life
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A tale of two pavements   Faint signs of life
  - Stillness of death on one side, bustle of life on the other          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            SHADE AND LIGHT: The pavement along Stephen Court was dark and deserted on the first Sunday evening after the killer blaze, even as the other side limped back to light and life. Pictures by Aranya Sen                                       
	We are sorry, we are sad, we could not save them, reads one of the posters pasted on the wall of Flurys, its shutters down since Tuesday. Cross the street and you will get to read more familiar words like Chicken roll and Peking Duck.         
	If a lone child ensures that a few candles keep burning on the steps of MusicWorld, the familiar footfall outside Bar-B-Q keeps the citys weekend spirit alive.        
	Park Street has become a tale of two pavements  one dark and deserted in the shadow of death and the other limping back to light and life.        
	A walk from the mouth of Russell Street to Middleton Row on the first Sunday evening after Tuesdays fire at Stephen Court makes the contrast clear. The moment you cross Magnolia on your right, the horror hits you. The closed shutters of One Step Up and Silver Grill lead you to the dead bend. The bright pinks of Flurys look incongruous, the sign announcing the temporary shifting of the legendary tea-room to The Street at The Park hotel. MusicWorld is bereft of music and the queues of Cello Kebab fans in front of Peter Cat are gone.        
	All you get are bewildered pairs of eyes transfixed on the top floors of Stephen Court, trying to playback that nightmare afternoon in their heads. I have come all the way from Garia with my wife just to see the condition of the building, says businessman Sudip Dutta.        
	Theres even a roadside guide to take you on a conducted tour. Johnny, an employee at Magma House on 24 Park Street, was present during the blaze on Tuesday and has since taken it upon himself to narrate to onlookers what happened that afternoon. No one was here when the fire started, now it has become like a memorial site, says Johnny Guide.        
	At McDonalds, the heads automatically tilt up and pan towards the left. Between bites of the burger. This is after all the citys party pavement,where the food is on the table even if the fun is still missing.                          
	Whether its a quick munch at Kusum or a steal-deal with the book vendors, Park Street, as we have known and loved it, continues to breathe on this side of the street. A sneak peek into Olympia Pub reveals that the glasses are being refilled while Sachin Tendulkar blazed away on the LCD screen inside neighbouring Oasis.        
	It definitely is sad that we lost so many citizens that day but the city has to bounce back, like Mumbai did after 26/11, says college student Neha, settling down at McDonalds for a meal with her friends.        
	But the other side of the citys fave fun zone would need more than a weekend night-out to slip out of its shroud.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four men have been arrested in the city and Burdwan over the past 24 hours for their alleged links with an inter-state car theft racket.         
	Ajay Kumar Shaw, 28, and Anil Kumar Rai, 26, from Vaishali in Bihar, were picked up from a rented house in Kasba on Thursday night. About 5.5kg ganja was found on them.         
	The two confessed during interrogation that apart from selling ganja, they used to steal four-wheelers, especially SUVs, from the city. They also identified two men in Burdwan who bought the stolen vehicles, said joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.        
	Kamal Sharma and Bhaskar Sharma were subsequently arrested at Hirapur in Burdwan. We have come to know that Ajay and Anil stole three vehicles from Kalighat, Bhowanipore and Tallah in the past month, said Sen.        
	The police believe that key members of the racket are at large.

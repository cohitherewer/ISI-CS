The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brakes on pool car norm flout 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Brakes on pool car norm flout 
  - Minister signals Monday crackdown         KINSUK BASU                                            
	Unlicensed and unsafe pool cars ferrying schoolchildren in the city are facing a do-it-now deadline to fall in line or be forced to go off the road as part of a long overdue crackdown beginning Monday.        
	The manner in which the pool car operators function is unacceptable. I have asked my officers to launch a crackdown. Those who dont abide by the law will be shunted out, state transport minister Ranjit Kundu told Metro.        
	The decision was apparently taken after a review meeting on Friday revealed that the majority of pool car operators had ignored the governments appeal to apply for commercial licences and adhere to the safety guidelines for ferrying schoolchildren.        
	A recent survey by the public vehicles department found that over 50 per cent of the pool car fleet wasnt even registered as commercial carriers. Operators have also been openly flouting the safety guidelines, including carrying more than the stipulated number of students per vehicle.         
	Many have missed the February deadline for applying for registration and there is no discernible effort on the part of the operators to legalise their business, states the report.        
	According to the rules framed for pool cars, three types of vehicles cannot be used to commercially ferry schoolchildren  Maruti Omni, Tata Winger and Tata Magic. The rest need to be registered by paying the requisite fees. Each such vehicle must sport a PVD pool-car logo.        
	So what is stopping pool car operators from following this apparently simple procedure? For most operators, being registered means coming under the scanner. If a vehicle is not registered as a pool car, the operator is not only out of the tax net but he can also take in more kids, said PVD secretary Ujjal Sengupta.         
	The transport department had asked the owners of all post-2000 vehicles being used as pool cars in the city and its suburbs to apply for conversion into commercial carriers by paying the stipulated fees and other charges.        
	The rider was that all such vehicles should adhere to the safety norms laid down by the Supreme Court for transportation of schoolchildren.        
	Accidents involving pool cars are common in the city with rash driving and overcrowding combining to put young lives in peril. In one such incident just over a week ago, seven students packed into an unlicensed pool car had a close shave when the vehicle collided with a bus on Strand Road.         
	Earlier in the month, an unlicensed Maruti Omni ferrying five children to school overturned after being hit by a private bus at the Deshapriya Park crossing. One child was seriously injured while the rest suffered cuts and bruises.        
	Most parents, however, see pool cars as a necessary evil. Kasba resident Anindita Sanyal is forced to send her son Prayas, a Class IV student, to school in a pool car despite knowing that it is not the safest option.        
	Our house is off the main road and the nearest school bus point is a 15-minute walk. A pool car comes to our doorstep. Basically, it is convenient for everyone, she explained.        
	Pool car operators blame corruption and red tape in the PVD for their reluctance to obtain a licence and a logo.         
	We have a problem with the way the PVD functions. It sometimes takes at least two days just to obtain a fitness certificate. That amounts to not only losing time but also money, complained the secretary of the Pool Car Owners Welfare Association, Abir Roy.        
	Would the operators refuse to turn street legal even after the proposed crackdown? The bitter truth is that officials of the PVD are least bothered about collecting taxes. They are busy offering other options, claimed Roy.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fire snaps high court power
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Power supply to Calcutta High Court was cut off for two-and-a-half hours following a small fire in an electrical feeder box, disrupting proceedings on Tuesday.        
	Cases could not be heard between 11.10am and 1.55pm as there was no power in the courtrooms following a fire in a feeder box at the Centenary Building. Even the judges chambers went without power, said a court source.        
	We arranged for two generators but before they could be pressed into service, CESC men brought the situation under control, said an assistant commissioner of police. Firemen rescued a court employee who was trapped in a lift for 45 minutes.        
	The court administration expressed displeasure over the incident and urged the state government departments concerned to conduct a thorough check of the premises, said a senior court official.        
	Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, the vice-president of the Calcutta High Court Bar Association, blamed both the court administration and the state authorities for the fire.        
	We have repeatedly asked the high court administration to repair the electrical connections in the building but it has not paid heed to our requests, alleged Roy.        
	Airport power cut: The city airport went without power from 10.12am to 10.51am on Tuesday. Flights were not disrupted but air-conditioners in both terminals did not work.

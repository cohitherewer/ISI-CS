          OUR BUREAU                            (Top) Shoppers at a 22 Camac Street store on Sunday and the broken windows of Bombay Shiv Sagar. Pictures by Amit Datta                                       
	Puja shoppers thronged 22 Camac Street on Sunday a day after a minor fire had kept some outlets shut and raised questions about fire-safety measures at the mall.        
	A team from the state forensic department on Sunday morning visited Bombay Shiv Sagar, the vegetarian restaurant on the first floor of B block where the fire broke out.        
	The officials collected samples from the spot. They scanned the restaurant and went to the terrace of the building. They would submit their report this month, said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.        
	We have received a complaint from fire brigade officers against the owner of the restaurant and are conducting an investigation. We will, however, have to wait for the forensic report, added the officer.        
	The serpentine queues that later formed at the billing counters of Pantaloons, Westside and Food Bazaar, which were shut on Saturday, were proof enough that the festival shoppers had put the fire behind them.        
	We have not suffered any dip in footfall because of the fire. This is how crowded it gets on other Sundays as well, said an official of Pantaloons.        
	Westside presented the same picture. The store is more crowded that usual because we were closed yesterday, said a store official on Sunday.        
	The non-functional elevators in Block D and the blocked entrance to Food Bazaar from Block B were the only visible fallouts of the fire.        
	There have been problems with electrical supply since yesterday. The lines are being repaired, said a guard.        
	Visitors had to climb four floors to eat at Ivory, the restaurant on the fifth floor of Block D.        
	Amoda  The Spa Bar, located right under Bombay Shiv Sagar, was shut in the afternoon because of water supply problems following the fire. Amodas jewellery counterpart, Zevar The Z Lounge, was operational on Sunday.        
	Most shoppers seemed unaffected by the fire. Things are back on track but I hope another fire doesnt break out. It feels good to be able to shop at my favourite stores, said 26-year-old Lata Kulkarni.         
	The likes of her increased the customer count even at outlets that were open on Saturday. Yesterday there was hardly anyone in the restaurant but fortunately its not the same today. Like other Sundays we have customers waiting for empty tables, said a spokesperson for Pizza Hut.         
	It will take time for Shiv Sagar to reopen but we are glad that the other stores could operate on Sunday, said S. Talukar, the CEO of 22 Camac Street.

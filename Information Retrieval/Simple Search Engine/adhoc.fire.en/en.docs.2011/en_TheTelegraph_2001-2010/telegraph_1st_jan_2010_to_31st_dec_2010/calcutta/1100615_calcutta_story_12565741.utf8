	Alpana Dutta Chowdhurys 15-year-old niece and her karate instructor Murari needed four hours to find a bag large enough to stuff the widows body into after killing her on Wednesday, police said. The body was found in a Sonarpur ditch on Saturday.         
	The girl, a Class X student in a city school, and Murari, in his early-20s, had allegedly throttled Alpana to death after she caught them in a compromising position at their home in Ashwini Nagar, Jadavpur.         
	It seems the two did not plan to kill Alpana. They probably tried to silence the widow when she started screaming after seeing them together in a ground-floor room, said an investigator.         
	The girl and her parents Biplab and Malabika, who were arrested on Sunday night, were produced in an Alipore court on Monday. While the child was sent to a juvenile home, her parents were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.        
	Biplab and Malabika have been charged with suppressing facts and misleading the investigators by lodging a false missing complaint. Murari was at large till late on Monday.         
	The girl has given us a blow-by-blow description of the murder. She told us how she had tried to mislead us with the help of her parents, who knew about the incident, said S.K. Chaudhury, additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas.        
	Alpana used to live on the first floor of the house with her 94-year-old mother while the girl and her parents lived on the ground floor. Alpana, who was against her nieces affair with Murari, had come to ground floor for some work on Wednesday and seen them in a compromising position, said an officer. The girls parents were not home at the time.        
	Murari went to Gariahat and bought the bag after the two could not find one in the house large enough. He then called a rickshaw and carried the body to the ditch on it, added the officer.         
	The police said the girls parents returned home late on Wednesday and asked her about Alpana. The girl allegedly confessed to them. Biplab then went to the police station and lodged a missing diary.

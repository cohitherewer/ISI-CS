                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Concrete mess at Sarobar
          JAYANTA BASU                              
	Subhas Sarobar in Beleghata is being turned into a concrete jungle in the name of beautification, local residents have alleged.        
	In a complaint to Calcutta Improvement Trust, state pollution control board, tourism department as well as the local councillor and MLA, residents have alleged: We feel common people will lose right to enter the park... The area will be turned into a costly amusement centre... the overall environment will be hampered.        
	The tourism development corporation has taken up a beautification project for the Sarobar, as part of which food courts, a centralised kitchen and an amphitheatre will come up on the premises.        
	Several trees have been felled for the construction, alleged Kasinath Biswas, joint convener of Subhas Sarobar Samanwaya Committee.        
	We feel once the project is over, common people will lose their right to enter the park, read the residents complaint to the pollution control board.        
	We will inquire into the matter, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of state pollution control board. We have not felled any tree, said T.V.N. Rao, the managing director of the tourism development corporation. When Metro visited the Sarobar, it found trees had been felled in the park.        
	Rao, however, said that once the project was on, common people would only be allowed free entry till 9am.         
	I will move appropriate authority to stop this mindless environment destruction stated green activist Subhas Datta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eye on India at German biz show
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Eye on India at German biz show
          SUBHRO SAHA                              
	Construction, building materials and mining machinery majors from across the world will turn their collective gaze towards India at the planets largest business show from Monday.        
	As partner country at Bauma 2010, to be held across 555,000sq m of indoor and outdoor exhibition space at the New Munich Trade Fair Centre (April 19 to 25), India has the opportunity to garner momentum for its 140-billion-Euro construction and infrastructure projects.        
	We selected India after a meticulous screening carried out in conjunction with VDMA (the German Engineering Association), of future sustainable markets. We were looking for a growth market on one side and a very sustainable market in the long term, and India fit the bill, Eugen Egetenmeir, managing director, Messe Mnchen GmbH, organisers of Bauma 2010, told Metro in Munich.        
	Speaking on the sidelines of a global media dialogue ahead of the mega trade show, Egetenmeir stressed that the huge investments in India lined up for infrastructure projects convinced Messe Mnchen to opt for India.        
	The forecast till about 2015 is that growth rate for construction in India, forecast to be in double-digit, will exceed the growth rate for its GDP, the Messe Mnchen MD added.        
	The organisers felt, the fact that Kamal Nath, the Union minister of road transport and highways, will be the co-opening speaker at the forum alongside the German minister of economy, is being read by the world business community as an invitation to come to India. Over a hundred captains of industry from India will join Kamal Nath at Bauma.        
	India is sending 35 participants to the Olympics of trade fairs, almost twice the size of its representation in the 2007 edition. Over 4,000 visitors from the country are expected to visit Munich during the trade show.        
	Two India-centric events, one on infrastructure and construction and the other on the coal industry, will be highlights at Bauma this year. Many German companies are scouting for Indian partners, said Rajesh Nath, the managing director of VDMAs India chapter, headquartered in Calcutta.        
	Three city-based companies feature at the extravaganza. These are IMT from the mining sector, Rotomatic Hydraulics and Speedcraft from the construction equipment domain.

	It is rare for a theatre festival to be dedicated to one still in the middle of his career. But Beadon Streets two-decade-old childrens theatre group, Subham, feels that actor, director and writer Shubhashis Gangopadhyay had deserved this honour ages ago.         
	From December 29 to 31, Subham organised its ninth annual festival of street and stage shows in honour of Gangopadhyay.         
	The festival premiered in Minerva theatre with Gangopadhyays solo show, Andho Jokkher Gaan, that upheld the plight of the marginalised and differently-abled. As in Kalidasas Meghdootam, we have here a yaksha talking to the cloud messenger. Only here, the yaksha is a blind, helpless outcast in a morally blind and heartless world.         
	Once a member of Nandikar, Gangopadhyay had shied away from mainstream group theatre to work with blind people. He has directed several commendable productions like Manasha Mangal, Raktakarabi produced by Blind Opera and Anya Desh. He has also worked with children with other disabilities as well as with kids from red-light areas. The festival also screened a documentary on Gangopadhyays career, titled Madmans Journey, on all three days of the festival.        
	Subham began 22 years ago with three friends Ashis Khan, Raghunath Dey and Ashok Das, who began teaching theatre to children from lower income groups in Beadon Street. They were branded as chheledhora (kidnappers) for drawing children away from studies and other chores.         
	The group still does not have a room of its own. Rehearsals are held at Chaitanya Library on Beadon Street. It is now trying to expand into a repertory where older students can find work.         
	On view at the festival were Raktakarabi by Anya Desh, the street drama Pora-likha that Subham plans to perform regularly on Sundays in various venues in the city. Subhams Kajalrekha, a fairy tale based on the collection of folk ballads, Maimansingh Geetika was a visual treat while Notir Puja, Subhams latest production, highlighted the plight of women in society. Jokhon Dakghar Achhe, Amal Nei takes off from where Tagores Dakghar ends, to communicate a message for conservation.        
	We want to draw the governments attention to the way programmes by children and the disabled have to make do with dates that bigger groups dont want, said Khan, adding that theatre for children should be encouraged because it teaches them to work as a team.                
	LET THE MUSIC PLAY        
	Guest band Gravy Theory perform on Day I of Xavotsav, the St Xaviers College fest held in association with The Telegraph, on January 23 and 24. Twenty-four city colleges participated in events like eastern and western dance, band performance and fashion shows. Off-stage events included freestyle football and non-fire cooking. Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College was adjudged the winner, with Asutosh College coming second.

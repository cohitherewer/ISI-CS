The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citu grounds passenger facility take-off
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Citu grounds passenger facility take-off
  - Opposition to switch in ground-handling operations denies access to comfort and safety          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	Citu has done it again. The CPM labour arms resistance to the airport authorities decision to assign the entire ground-handling operations to a single agency is denying passengers access to improved services.        
	From better baggage handling to bigger coaches to board from the terminal to the plane, Citu has grounded all take-off plans.        
	Several small companies contracted by the airlines are now in charge of baggage handling. That was set to change with the joint-venture company Bhadra International (India) Ltd being awarded the ground-handling rights at Calcutta airport along with the state-run National Aviation Company of India Ltd, formed through the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines.        
	The agency got the contract a year ago and the security clearance a few months ago. However, resistance from the contract labourers union has been creating complications, a senior Calcutta airport official said on Monday. The agency was to start installing equipment from this month.        
	There have been several complaints from passengers about poor ground handling at Calcutta airport including baggage theft and damage to registered luggage. Several cases of mobile thefts have also been reported.        
	At present there are around 2,000 ground handling staff at Calcutta airport, out of whom more than 1,900 are contract staff, hired by outsourced agencies. The agency just provides the name and photograph of a person and the security agencies issue entry permits, said an official. The new system will ensure that only direct employees of the agency, recruited after proper police verification, are allowed in as ground handling staff.         
	The cabinet committee on security had earlier decided to curb the mushrooming of outsourcing agencies providing ground handling staff to airports. These agencies have to withdraw operations from all airports by December 31, 2011. Not if Citu has its way.        
	We are concerned about the future of the contract staff who are presently working at the airport. The new agency has to ensure that none of them should lose their jobs, said Dipankar Ghosh, the secretary of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), eastern region.         
	The CPM-backed unions resistance had forced a tripartite meeting with the regional labour commission officials earlier this month. The Citu-backed NSCBI Airport Ground Workmens Union even called for a strike on September 15 but withdrew that after the meeting.        
	Bhadra International had won the competitive bidding for Calcutta and six other airports. Airport sources said the agency was supposed to introduce a slew of passenger-friendly measures (see box) ranging from German coaches for 200 people replacing the ones now carrying no more than 40 to step ladders from the US that align automatically with the aircraft height.

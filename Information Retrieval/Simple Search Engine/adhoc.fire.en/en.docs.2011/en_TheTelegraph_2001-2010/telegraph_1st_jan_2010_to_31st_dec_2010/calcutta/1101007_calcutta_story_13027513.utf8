          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Twelve students were arrested at Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) following a clash on the BT Road campus that injured several on Wednesday.        
	Eleven of the students are supporters of the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad (TCP). The other arrested student is a supporter of the Students Federation of India (SFI).        
	Cops said none of the injured students needed to be hospitalised.        
	The 11 TCP supporters were arrested after vice-chancellor Karuna Sindhu Das lodged a complaint with Sinthee police station.        
	Later, a first-year student lodged a complaint claiming that she had been molested during a scuffle. The SFI supporter was arrested on the basis of her complaint.        
	Trouble started on Tuesday after TCP supporters allegedly tore down posters put up by the SFI on the campus.        
	When TCP supporters were staging a demonstration in front of Dass office on Wednesday, SFI supporters had allegedly started abusing them, triggering the scuffle.        
	TCP supporters alleged that many outsiders entered the campus while their demonstration was on. When we asked the police to check their identity cards, they said it was the duty of the security personnel, said a TCP supporter.        
	There was tension on the campus after the scuffle but things calmed down in the evening, Tapati Mukherjee, the registrar of the university, said.

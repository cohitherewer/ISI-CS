                      Unleashing potent emotions through art                    Art in India has always been an integral part of daily life and excavations of art objects from various sites show the high degrees of sophistication Indian art has reached. Many of our contemporary artists have been inspired by these ancient styles. Similarly, there are artists who draw their inspiration from the rich folk traditions of India. Again, traditionally, the country always had close connections with neighbouring countries and we see a confluence of these various styles and cultures in our art. Even today Indian artists openly adapt to the emerging European and Oriental styles. Despite these diverse influences, Indian Art still retains its distinct Indianness. Symbols amp; Metaphors, the ongoing group exhibition, showcases some of the finest artistic output of the last 100 years. Replete with motifs, these works hold the key to unlocking the enduring enigma and mystery of life. Participants include A. Balasubramaniam, Arpita Singh, Sanjeev Sonpimpare, Ram Singh Urveti, Gopal Ghosh, M.F. Husain, Rashmi Bagchi Sarkar, Alok Bal, Jaya Ganguly, Farhad Hussain, Shreyasi Chatterjee,Jogen Chowdhury, Ganesh Pyne, Samir Aich, Atul Dodiya and others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A saint is an excellent Christian... she was one
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A saint is an excellent Christian... she was one

	Father Brian Kolodiejchuk is a priest in the Missionaries of Charity. He has researched Mother Teresas life extensively to prepare a report for her canonisation by the Vatican.              
	I had known Mother Teresa for 20 years. I first met her in Rome. My sister had joined the Missionaries of Charity in 1976 and a year later, my parents and I went to visit her in Rome. Mother Teresa was there. While leaving Mass, I went to shake her hand and she looked at me and said: Id like to pin a cross on your breast too. It was sudden and I said nothing.        
	The next morning, I went back and asked her what she had meant. She told me what she told everyone, If you want to know what you can do, come and see.        
	Mother was setting up an order of Brothers then. I joined the order and later, when she set up an order of priests, I joined the Missionaries of Charity Fathers.        
	If you saw Mother for the first time and you hadnt seen her picture, you might not have been able to pick her out. Then if you kept watching her, you would notice that there was something extraordinary in the way she did small, ordinary things.        
	I remember one sister telling me that even when she was old and needed help with things, there was so much devotion with which she pinned the sari to the headscarf. There was the same devotion in everything she did.        
	Mother was very motherly. When you spoke to her, you would get her full attention. She had a knack to be both firm and loving at the same time. She liked it when people came and talked to her. Her standards were high, but she was very understanding.         
	I did feel that she was a saint when I interacted with her. What is a saint? A saint is an excellent Christian... she was one. That is what the 5,000- page report that was submitted to the Vatican for Mother Teresas canonisation says.        
	The report has two parts. The first shows how she confirmed to the virtues of faith, hope, charity, prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance to a heroic degree. The second part is her biography. The process of canonisation starts with the people. After that the Church has a formal procedure and finally God has to confirm it. A miracle is the final confirmation from God.        
	In the last few years we have checked two-three cases of miracles a year. When someone claims that Mother healed them or they were cured after praying to Mother, we ask a doctor if there is a medical explanation for it. If not, then it could be a miracle.        
	We already have one confirmed miracle (Monica Besra), which is why Mother was beatified. We need one more confirmed miracle for the official confirmation that she is a saint.

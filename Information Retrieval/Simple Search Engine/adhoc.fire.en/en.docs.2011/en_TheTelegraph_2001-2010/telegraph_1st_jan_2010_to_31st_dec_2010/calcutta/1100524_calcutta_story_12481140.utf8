                      Fun, frolic and gossip                    A farce by comedy genius Neil Simon, Rumors is a commentary on the absurdities of urban, affluent professionals, who are neither sophisticated nor secure, though they form part of the social elite. Theatrecian has Indianised, and messed with the play to suit the mindset of the local audience. While the original is set in New York, this version is based in Calcutta. The character names and traits have been changed, and many situations have been altered to give the play a more authentic Indian feel. Whilst the characters are affluent, upper-class socialites, they display some typical behavioural patterns exclusive to our society. What has remained apart from the plot are Simons wonderful one-liners and extended jokes, the extremely complicated set design, the rapid movement on stage and, of course, the very American spelling of its title. In the play, four formally-dressed couples are invited to an anniversary party of a wealthy couple. When they arrive, they discover that there are no servants, the hostess is missing and her husband is in a state of mind most unfit for playing host at a party. Comic complications arise when each of the invitees is struck with panic and desire to out-do the others. Also, given everyones upper-class status, they decide they need to do everything possible to conceal the evenings events, of which they are very ashamed. The result is a series of hilarious goof-ups which culminates in two city cops investigating the scene of buffoonery. Produced by Priyanka Goenka Gupta and Tathagata Chowdhury. Directed by Kanak Gupta.                  Event: Play in English, Rumors, presented by Theatrecian When: Today at 7 pm Where: Gyan Manch

	Taxi operators on Monday threatened an indefinite strike from March 23 to press for a hike in fares.        
	The operators announced their decision after transport minister Ranjit Kundu turned down their demand to raise the minimum fare  Rs 22 for the first 2km  by Rs 2 because of the hike in fuel prices. I dont think a hike is necessary at this stage, Kundu later told Metro.        
	Well go on an indefinite strike from March 23, said Tarak Nath Bari, of the Calcutta Taxi Association.        
	Bimal Guha, of the Bengal Taxi Association, said the taxi owners were incurring a loss of at least Rs 50 a day because of the rise in fuel prices.

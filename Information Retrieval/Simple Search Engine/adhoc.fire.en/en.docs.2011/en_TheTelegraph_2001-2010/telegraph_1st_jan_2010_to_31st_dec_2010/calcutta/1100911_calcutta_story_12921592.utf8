          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An elderly man who had undergone a hernia surgery fell off his bed and died at SSKM Hospital on Friday.        
	Joy Narayan Mistry, a 65-year-old resident of Bishnupur in South 24-Parganas, was admitted to SSKM Hospitals Curzon Ward on Wednesday. He underwent the surgery the same day.         
	He was recovering but needed to be in hospital for a few more days before he could be discharged. His condition was apparently stable and there was no reason for worry, said a hospital official.         
	Around noon on Friday, Mistry fell off bed No. 34, which had been allotted to him. Hearing him cry in pain, other patients in the ward called the nurses on duty. Hospital sources said doctors pronounced him dead about 10 minutes later.        
	According to witnesses, Mistry fell off the bed while trying to turn over on his side. The steel guards that are supposed to protect a patient from falling off the bed were not fixed properly and there were no attendants nearby.        
	Mistrys relatives did not lodge a complaint but the hospital authorities ordered a post-mortem since it was a case of unnatural death.        
	Once the report is available, well look into the incident, said the SSKM official.         
	Student death        
	A school and college student died in separate accidents at opposite ends of the city on Friday.        
	Pinky Shaw, 14, was knocked down by a motorcycle at the Hyde Road-Taratala Road crossing around 10am. The Class VIII student was crossing the road on her way to Sanghamitra High School.        
	The girl was not at fault. The motorcycle was heading towards Brace bridge at great speed. It hit the child and fled, said a witness.         
	Pinky was taken to SSKM Hospital, where she died of a head injury. Soon after this, residents of the area broke the glass panes of a minibus that was speeding down the same road. They also blocked Hyde Road near the crossing for half an hour from 11am.        
	Around 2pm, Pritam Majumdar, a second-year student of Kanchrapara College, died after being hit by a mini-truck on Siraj Mondal Road at Jagaddal. The 21-year-old, who was returning home from college, was caught between the rear end of the truck and a wall beside the road. Witnesses said the driver lost control of the vehicle while trying to avoid a pothole.        
	The student was taken to Bhatpara state general hospital, where he was declared dead, said Ajay Das, a resident of the area.        
	About 200 students of Kanchrapara College blocked the road for about an hour demanding immediate repair of the road.

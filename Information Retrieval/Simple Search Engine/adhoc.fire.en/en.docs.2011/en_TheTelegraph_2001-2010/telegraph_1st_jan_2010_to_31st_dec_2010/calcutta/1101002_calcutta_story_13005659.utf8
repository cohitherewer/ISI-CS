The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bypass traffic baton in Lalbazar hands
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bypass traffic baton in Lalbazar hands
          A STAFF REPORTER                          City and South 24-Parganas cops during Fridays changing of the guard on the Bypass                                  
	Traffic management on the entire EM Bypass, spanning 14km, came under the control of Calcutta police on Friday.        
	Earlier, the city polices area of control on the eastern artery extended from the Ultadanga crossing till the Ruby rotary. The 5.5km stretch from Ruby to Garia was under the watch of South 24-Parganas police.        
	The special commissioner of police (II), Banibrata Basu, and joint commissioner (traffic) Vinit Goyal opened a traffic control booth at the Patuli crossing during the day to mark the extension of Lalbazars writ on the southern fringe of the Bypass.         
	A Metro guide to the change              
	 What prompted the change?        
	The switch was long in the pipeline because the South 24-Parganas police were failing to cope with the rising volume of traffic on the Bypass.         
	The rise in the number of mishaps, too, prompted the decision.        
	The area of operations of the south-east traffic guard, which earlier managed traffic from Ultadanga to Ruby, has been extended till Garia.        
	 What difference does the change make?        
	With Calcutta police manning traffic on the entire Bypass, problems over sharing of jurisdictions and responsibilities between the city and state police would not crop up.        
	However, like before, the responsibility to probe mishaps on the Ruby-Garia stretch will rest with Jadavpur and East Jadavpur police stations. The Ruby-Kalikapur stretch will be under Jadavpur police station and the rest under East Jadavpur police station.              
	 Will the traffic flow be smoother?        
	Officers at Lalbazar say traffic management on the Ruby-Garia stretch will improve following the deployment of two inspectors, 10 sub-inspectors, 10 assistant sub-inspectors, 40 constables, 20 home guards and 20 green cops.              
	 What are the visible changes on the road?        
	a) Road-marking began on Thursday night.        
	b) Guard rails have been erected at places where there were no median dividers.        
	c) Stricter enforcement of traffic rules. City cops booked 12 bikers for riding without helmets in the first 30 minutes of taking charge.        
	d) Calcutta police helpline numbers on display on electronic boards.

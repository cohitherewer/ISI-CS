          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Alison Waters at the launch on Thursday. (Anindya S. Ray)                                  
	Airdash is now a dictionary word. So is prepone.         
	Their inclusion in the eighth edition of Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, launched on Thursday in the city, will no doubt make some feel vindicated, while others squirm, depending on which side they are of the debate on the purity of the English language. But then as the English language is changing, so are English dictionaries.         
	Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, the highest-selling dictionary published by Oxford University Press, is no exception. Other words that would perhaps be considered dubious before, but are now legitimate words with new meanings derived from their frequency in Indian English usage, include encounter, ply, ramp and revert.         
	When we use revert, we mean going back to the starting point. But I have learned that in India when one says I will revert to you by mail, it means I will reply to your mail, said Alison Waters, publishing manager, ELT Dictionaries Department of Oxford University Press, UK.         
	Waters welcomes such inclusion. It enriches the language. She says that a growing vocabulary is always welcome: what preserves the integrity of the language is the syntax. For example, I like very much is food will never be considered English.         
	But these are tough times for a print dictionary. On the one hand, the English language is growing like never before, with various Englishes being spoken: Indian, Australian, South African, not to mention the different British varieties. On the other, everything is going online, including dictionaries.         
	Online everything is free. The cost of paper, the cost of production are the biggest challenges before a print dictionary, says Waters.         
	Online dictionaries are such a threat that the latest edition of the Advanced Learners, launched in India first, has features that do not traditionally come with a dictionary: an Oxford iWriter and an interactive whiteboard-friendly CD-ROM which includes a thesaurus.         
	I will give the print dictionary 10 more years, says Waters. Parents still believe in buying the book, she adds. She also reminds that sometimes the death of many things are predicted but do not happen, such as of the newspaper.         
	But the idea is to give a package that is part print and part computer-based. So another word included in the dictionary: Staycation. Prompted by the recession, it means staying somewhere near home for a vacation. Very urbandictionary.com. And of course, tweet is there too.

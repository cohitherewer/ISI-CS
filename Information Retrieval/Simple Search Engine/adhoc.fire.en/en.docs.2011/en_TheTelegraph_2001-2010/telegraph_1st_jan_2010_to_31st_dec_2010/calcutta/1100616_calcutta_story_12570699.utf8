                      Southern designs and shades                    Perhaps one of the first of its kind in the city, Hyderabad Hues, the ongoing art exhibition, displays works by artists from Hyderabad who are highly acclaimed and recognised at the national level. It features works on various themes, ranging from the impressive landscapes of Surya Prakash and the charcoal works of Thota Vaikuntam to the vibrant Telangana figures of Laxman Aelay and the large mythical figures by Ramesh Gorjala. Each of them offers sheer visual delight to the art lover, affording striking diversity and contrast in terms of colour, expanse, symbolism and imagery. Some of the other important names who figure in this show are Tailor Srinivas, Sanjay Asthaputre, Chippa Sudhakar and Jagdish Chintala (a painting by him appears here), each of whom appears to have created a distinctive style of art, besides grabbing the attention of avid art connoisseurs of the country. Being held in an attempt to create choice and awareness about the art world that is very different from the local, this show also breaks the monotony of the viewers experience.

	Some HS examinees on Wednesday complained that the Bengali paper had left them confused as question 5.3 did not carry marks. The state HS council said there was no room for confusion as instructions were clearly printed on the paper.        
	Mishap: A police jeep that had allegedly jumped signal hit two students of Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis College at Dunlop on Wednesday evening. Debraj Dutta and Mita Dutta were taken to hospital from where they were released after treatment. Later, students of the college blocked the Dunlop crossing for more than an hour.

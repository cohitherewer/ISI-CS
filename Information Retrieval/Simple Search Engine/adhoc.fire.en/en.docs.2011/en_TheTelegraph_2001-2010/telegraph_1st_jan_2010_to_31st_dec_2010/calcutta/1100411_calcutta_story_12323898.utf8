	Apropos the article Davidbabus databank, January 10, while acknowledging David McCutchions contribution in the field of terracotta photo-documentation, it is perhaps pertinent to remember the earlier and similar photo-documentation of terracotta works by artist Mukul Dey.             
	Dey had worked in some 25 rural locations in Birbhum and Burdwan between 1946 and 1951, concentrating on the terracotta ornamentation found on temple facades. Dey would travel in his personal bullock cart fitted with a modest monochrome photographic darkroom. This reminds one of Victorian photographer Roger Fenton, who documented the Crimean War in 1855 out of a mobile dark-room fitted to his stagecoach.           
	In 1959, Lalit Kala Akademi had published Deys Birbhum Terracottas with 45 out of the 5,000 frames exposed by him.

	After going through The M-Class quotient February 7, I was happy to find that I fit well into the middle-class category. The article also gave me tips on how to preserve the chilli flakes, paper napkins, oregano, sachets of oil and of course the plastic spoons when I order my next pizza. The possibilities that come with the pizza had not struck me earlier.

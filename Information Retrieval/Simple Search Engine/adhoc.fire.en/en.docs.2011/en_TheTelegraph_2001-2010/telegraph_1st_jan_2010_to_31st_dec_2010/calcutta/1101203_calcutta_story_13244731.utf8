The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU placements in jeopardy
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      JU placements in jeopardy

	The ongoing exam boycott by engineering students of Jadavpur University seems to have scared off prospective employers with the impression gaining ground that Bengals talent pool is capable but indisciplined.        
	Headhunters representing various companies have contacted the university authorities over the past few days to express reservations about recruiting from the campus this year, a senior official said.        
	The general opinion is that the current unrest reflects the devil-may-care attitude of the students. No company wants troublemakers on their rolls, said a member of the engineering faculty.        
	Not just campus placements, students are in danger of losing even the chance to undergo industrial training, which is part of the third-year curriculum.         
	I would rather hire a mediocre person who will listen to me and work sincerely than a much more intelligent young man with an attitude problem. He may not listen to me and end up jeopardising our work, Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Sector V company Acclaris, told Metro.        
	But will pressing the pause button on campus recruitment solve the problem?         
	Bikram Dasgupta, the chairman of the Globsyn Group, said the students needed to realise where such agitations could lead to. The gap between the authorities and the students also needs to be bridged, he added.        
	The Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu) has engineered the boycott to pressure the authorities into withdrawing an FIR against students who had clashed with police during chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit on November 9.        
	Campus interviews by around 50 recruiters were almost complete  the process had started in August  when the unrest began. Infotech companies were scheduled to start their interviews in mid-January.        
	Wipro, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Tata Consultancy Services and Texas Instruments have been regulars during the campus recruitment season, but the universitys placement cell isnt sure they will come this time.         
	The placement opportunities for final-year students probably wont be withdrawn as they are not participating in the exam boycott. But we need to keep our fingers crossed for the next batch of students scheduled to sit for campus interviews next year, placement officer Siddhartha Bhattacharya said.        
	The semester exams end on December 4. Those who skip semester exams are allowed to take supplementary tests for only three papers.

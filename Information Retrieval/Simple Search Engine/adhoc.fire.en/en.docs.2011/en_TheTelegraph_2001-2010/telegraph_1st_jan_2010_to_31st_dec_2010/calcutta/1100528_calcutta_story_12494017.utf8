The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Colleges to bear JEE brunt
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Colleges to bear JEE brunt
  - Late counselling for engineering berths robs students of prized seats          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Meritorious students looking to pursue a career in science may yet again be robbed of the opportunity to study in the best colleges by the late start in counselling for candidates who have cracked the state joint entrance examinations.        
	State JEE board chairman Siddhartha Dutta, who announced the results of the tests for admission to engineering and medical colleges on Thursday, said the counselling would tentatively begin on July 3.        
	All colleges under Calcutta University will start admissions on June 21 and classes are likely to begin before the JEE counselling is through. The undergraduate science courses in Jadavpur University, too, will start around the same time.        
	The authorities of most prominent colleges fear many students whose names figure on the JEE (engineering) merit list will take admission in the science courses as they are not sure which college or department they will be assigned during the counselling.        
	Say, five of the 40 students in the first-year physics honours class get berths of their choice during the counselling and shift to engineering courses. In all likelihood, they wouldnt bother to inform the college about their decision. By the time we cancel their admission, at least three months after classes begin, students ranking from 41 to 50 or 55 will have taken berths in other colleges. So, either we have to fill up the seats with less deserving students or keep them vacant, said a teacher of a south Calcutta college.        
	Last year, too, the prominent colleges had faced a similar situation. Presidency College principal Sanjib Ghosh said the problem was mostly with students assigned middle-ranking institutions during the counselling. Students allotted a reputable government institution promptly alert us about their change of plan. But those who get berths in middle-ranking private colleges are confused and take a long time to decide which course they will pursue.        
	The system of starting JEE counselling late should be stopped immediately, Ghosh said. In fact, most universities and colleges had requested the board to wrap up counselling before the admission for undergraduate science courses begin.        
	JEE board chairman Dutta, however, ruled out holding the counselling before the All India Council for Technical Education approved the number of seats in the new colleges. The approval will come on June 30, said Dutta.        
	This year, city boy Soumendu Majee, of Patha Bhavan, topped the engineering merit list, while the top slot in medical has been bagged by Pushpam Priyam Das from Cooch Behar Rambhola High School.

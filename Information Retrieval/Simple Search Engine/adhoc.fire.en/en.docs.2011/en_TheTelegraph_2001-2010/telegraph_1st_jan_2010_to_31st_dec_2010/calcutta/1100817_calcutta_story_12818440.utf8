                Around 75 major puja organisers have agreed to get their idols painted with lead-free, non-toxic colours. The organisers expressed their willingness to use green paints at a meeting called by the pollution control board on August 14.  Other than the 75-odd puja committees, we have been receiving regular queries from other organisers about lead-free paints, Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the pollution control board, said on Monday. Manicktala Chaltabagan, Ballygunge Cultural, Tridhara Sammilani, Ekdalia Evergreen, Shibmandir and Telengabagan Sarbojanin are among the major clubs that have opted for non-toxic colours. Most organisers in our association have decided to get their idols painted with lead-free colours, said Partha Ghosh, the vice-president of the Forum for Durgotsav.    The Calcutta-Kuala Lumpur flight of Air Asia was delayed by an hour on Monday. Airport sources said the flight with 46 passengers took off at 4.30pm but had to return after some fliers protested when the pilot announced that it would touch down at Dhaka to take 140 passengers. The flight took off again at 5.30pm after a passenger got off.     Parents demonstrated in front of Balia Balika Vidyalaya in Garia alleging that negligence of the authorities had led to the death of Class VIII student Bijoli Modi on August 12.

A fire broke out at a chemical factory in Khardah on Monday afternoon. Six tenders took an hour to douse the blaze.

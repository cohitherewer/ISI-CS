The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro driver saves life
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro driver saves life
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A prompt Metro Railway driver saved the life of a 27-year-old woman by slamming the brakes and alerting the control room to snap power supply within a second of spotting her jump on the tracks at Tollygunge station on Tuesday morning.        
	The woman, who police said was depressed, had landed in the drain between the tracks and was barely a metre from the front wheels when the train came to a halt.        
	It was around 9.43am when the 50-year-old driver of a Dum Dum-bound train entering the platform spotted a woman in a red sari jostling her way through the crowd towards the tracks.        
	I could sense from her behaviour that she was planning to jump on the tracks. I immediately placed one of my hands on the emergency brake lever and with the other called the control room, said the driver who did not want to be named.        
	The moment she jumped  the train was 10 metres away  he slammed the brakes and asked the control room to suspend power supply to the third rail.        
	I knew from my experience that there could be a realistic chance of saving the woman only if my response time was less than a second. When the wheels stopped, she was hardly a metre away. Part of her was already under the my cabin, recalled the driver, who claimed that his promptness had saved at least seven lives in his career spanning 24 years.        
	As soon as the train stopped, the driver jumped off his cabin and was relieved to see the woman alive.        
	She suffered minor injuries and was rushed to Metro Railway Hospital in Tollygunge from where she was released after treatment.        
	The police said she was too scared and depressed to speak. All she could say was her name and that she had a kid at home, said an officer of Regent Park police station.        
	Metro services were disrupted for around 15 minutes till 10.02am.        
	Four people have committed suicide and two were injured while trying to kill themselves on the Metro tracks so far this year.

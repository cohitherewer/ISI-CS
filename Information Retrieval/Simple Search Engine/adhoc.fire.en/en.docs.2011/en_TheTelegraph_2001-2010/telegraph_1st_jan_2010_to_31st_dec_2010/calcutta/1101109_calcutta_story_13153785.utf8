          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rafiqul Islam buried his octogenarian uncle Alaj Hasen Ali at his village near Ghazipur in Dhaka on Monday evening after spending the previous night on a minivan outside the Calcutta airport terminal with his uncles body in a coffin.        
	Ali, 80, had died after boarding a Dhaka-bound Air India Express flight in Calcutta on Saturday night.        
	He had been suffering from intestinal cancer and was taken to Vellore for treatment. Doctors said he was terminally ill.        
	I couldnt sleep the entire night as I had to keep dogs away from the coffin, Rafiqul said on Monday.        
	Throughout Saturday night, the body, draped in a white cloth with the feet sticking out, remained seated on a wheelchair at an immigration counter of the airport.        
	Rafiqul had requested for a trolley and speedy completion of the formalities. But the doctor issued the death certificate only at 3am and the police were alerted five hours later.        
	At 10.30am on Monday, Rafiqul took a private airline flight to Dhaka. I didnt get any help from the airport staff and had to bring down the coffin with the help of the driver of the minivan, Rafiqul said over the phone from Dhaka.        
	I thank my luck that I could finally bury my uncle at his village.

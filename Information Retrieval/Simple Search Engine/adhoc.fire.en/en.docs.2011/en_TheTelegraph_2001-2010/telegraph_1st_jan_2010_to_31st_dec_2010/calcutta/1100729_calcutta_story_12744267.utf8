The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shared fear of shuttle ride
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shared fear of shuttle ride
          SUBHAJOY ROY                      Illustration by Suman Choudhury                          
	Piyali De felt a spasm of fear on Wednesday morning when she read in The Telegraph how Sayantee Majumdar had jumped out of a speeding shuttle car in Salt Lake to save herself from the clutches of the driver.        
	But then the girl in her 20s shrugged it off and steeled herself for the inevitable  another shuttle car ride back home from work after dark.        
	We have no option but to hail shuttle cars. There are very few buses to accommodate the huge workforce of Sector V, said Piyali, who depends on the unauthorised shared cab service to travel between Sector V and Gariahat.        
	Just like 23-year-old Sayantee. And hundreds of other women jostling for a ride back home from the Karunamoyee crossing. We fight our way into any empty vehicle that is spotted, said Piyali. Even a small Indica car takes in six passengers and we have no option but to squeeze in.        
	The demand-supply mismatch in public transport fuels the desperation for shuttle cars. According to a rough estimate, there are around 150 government buses operating from Salt Lake every day for nearly 60,000 people working in Sector V. Add to that a section of Salt Lake residents and that explains the crowd waiting for a lift from Park Circus, Sealdah, the Ruby roundabout on the Bypass and Gariahat.        
	The shuttle cars charge between Rs 15 and Rs 25, almost double the price of ticket on a government bus. If there were enough buses we would surely have opted for buses, said Kanchan Ahuja, in her 20s, who works in Sector V and detests the uncomfortable ride from and to Park Circus.        
	Vehicles range from Sumo to Ambassador, Indica to Maruti Omni as any driver with an empty car can stop to earn a quick buck.        
	A few are part of the pool car network. We have 150 cars, mostly Maruti vans, which shuttle between Karunamoyee and Gariahat, Park Circus and the Exide crossing, said Sheikh Anwar Hussain, secretary of the Salt Lake-Nabadiganta Pool Car Operators Welfare Association.        
	Last November, Chandrima Gupta, a law student, was assaulted and robbed after she hailed a shuttle car in front of AMRI hospital in Salt Lake. Cops had then promised better monitoring but the likes of Kanchan insist they have never spotted a policeman at the hop-on points.        
	Till June this year we have registered 1,000 cases against shuttle cars, claimed Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of police, traffic.        
	But even in the Sayantee case, little headway was made 24 hours later with the registration address of the shuttle car turning out to be false. We realised that after raiding the Bansdroni residence mentioned with the Alipore public vehicles department, said an official of the Bidhannagar East police station.        
	Whats the way out? My friends who stay in Rajarhat travel in a group. I think thats the best way to ensure your own safety, shrugged Piyali.  
	SAFETY FIRST  
	Try and take a shuttle from a crowded place  
	Try not to be the only person left in the car  
	Be alert (no iPod, please)  
	Keep an SOS number of friend/family handy  
	Carry SOS items for protection: pepper spray, deodorants, safety pin      INPUTS FROM TAMAGHNA BANERJEE

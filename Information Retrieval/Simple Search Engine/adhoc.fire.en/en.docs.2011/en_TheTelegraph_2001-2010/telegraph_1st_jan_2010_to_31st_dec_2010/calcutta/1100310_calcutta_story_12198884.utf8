                      Carnal expressions                    Cultures throughout the world represent our deceptive relationships with animals as masquerades, that operate in both directions: in our rituals, humans often masquerade as animals, but in our myths we imagine that animals masquerade as humans. The most intense version of this universal theme is the tale of the bestial deception, the masquerade of an animal as a human in the most intimate of all relationships. In Beyond Desire, Sunil Das erotic sculpture in bronze wrestles with this theme of bestiality and contextualises it within contemporary notions of power, sexuality and gender. His works in bronze seek to marry vivacity and tactility with inner anguish and open, flagrant sensuality. Never one to shy away from contentious subject matter, he creates art which is immediately comprehensible yet expresses intangible human desire. He applies a robust realism to his portrayal of both beasts and humans. The medium-sized works hold an appeal for those with an appetite for the passionate and fiercely intense. Humans coupling with horses, bulls and dogs are some of the dramatic tableaux he frames. He blends the romantic taste for the exotic and the sublime power of animals with raw, throbbing sexuality, thereby lending an air of charged eroticism to every muscle, sinew and limb. This exhibition seeks to chart the imaginative thrust of his fascination for the rough physicality of his subjects and brings the viewer physically closer to the artists hidden, creative core.

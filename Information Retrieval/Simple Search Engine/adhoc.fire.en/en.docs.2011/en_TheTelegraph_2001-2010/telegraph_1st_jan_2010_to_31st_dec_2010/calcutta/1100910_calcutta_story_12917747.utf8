	Burglars escaped with cash and jewellery worth Rs 2.2 lakh from a Jagachha house on Wednesday night while the residents were out of town.        
	The owner of the house, 59-year-old trader Swapan Kundu, along with his wife and younger daughter, had left for Nabadwip in Nadia on Tuesday morning to attend the last rites of his elder daughters father-in-law.        
	Swapans brother Tapan, 63, and his family members, who live next door, had accompanied them. They returned home on Wednesday evening.        
	Around 5am on Thursday, a neighbour found the grille gate of Swapans house open and alerted Tapan. He said: The locks on the main entrance and two other rooms were broken. The thieves had managed to find the key to the wooden almirah and had rummaged through it.         
	Police suspect that someone close to the family was involved in the theft. The burglars knew that Swapan would stay back in Nabadwip on Wednesday night, said an officer of Jagachha police station.

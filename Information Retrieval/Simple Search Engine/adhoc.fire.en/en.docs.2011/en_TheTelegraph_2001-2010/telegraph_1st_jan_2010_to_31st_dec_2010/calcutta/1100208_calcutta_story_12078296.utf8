                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Witnesses to girls fatal jump
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Statements by two employees of an office in the building below which Samata Maloo was found lying on Thursday evening indicate that she jumped to her death.        
	The witnesses, a young man and a woman, saw the 18-year-old standing alone on a landing between the second and third floors of Commerce House, near the Ganesh Chandra Avenue-Bentinck Street crossing, around 6.20pm, said police. Moments later, the two saw Samata falling to the ground.        
	From the statements, it appears that Samata committed suicide. We are now trying to find out the reason, said an officer of the detective departments homicide wing.        
	We had initially thought she had fallen off the building opposite Commerce House as it has a number of abandoned rooms that are easily accessible. But she probably used the Bentinck Street entrance to reach the Commerce House staircase, added the officer.        
	The Class XII student, daughter of a trader, set out from her Howrah home for City Centre, Salt Lake, in the afternoon but changed her mind after failing to contact a friend and got off the bus near Lalbazar, cops have learnt.         
	The call records of the cellphone that was found lying near Samatas body helped investigators track her movements on Friday.         
	Officers suspect that though Samata had told her family members that she was going for tuition in the same housing complex, she had planned to skip the class.        
	She made two calls to a number. The person at the other end disconnected the calls, said an officer.         
	The phone belonged to a young man, friends with both Samata and her brother Kuldeep.

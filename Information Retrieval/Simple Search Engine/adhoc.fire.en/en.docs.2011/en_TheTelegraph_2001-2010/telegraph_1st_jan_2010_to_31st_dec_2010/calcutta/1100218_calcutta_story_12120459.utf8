The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SRK scores big on home pitch
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SRK scores big on home pitch
  - RECORD OPENING WEEKEND FOR MY NAME IS KHAN          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                                  
	Shah Rukh Khan is a Calcuttan.        
	I do feel a sense of ownership in Calcutta.Its like they own me.I can sense it, that people think of me as someone who belongs there, the boss of the Kolkata Knight Riders told Metro on Wednesday.        
	He was reacting to news that My Name Is Khan had broken all opening weekend box-office records on his new-found home ground.        
	The Karan Johar film about Rizvan Khans journey across America to meet the US President collected Rs 2.35 crore net over the first three days in the Bengal territory.        
	It is the biggest three-day opening for any film in this region, said Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films, the films regional distributors.        
	Bigger than 3 Idiots? Yes the first weekend of MNIK is better than 3 Idiots here, said Arun Mehra of Aum Moviez, the distributor of 3 Idiots in Bengal, who is handling the Shah Rukh release in three other territories.        
	Aamir Khan had enjoyed a four-day weekend thanks to the paid previews organised by multiplexes on Thursday evening, but with Shah Rukh enjoying around 30 more screens  a total of 130 across Bengal  My Name Is Khan has edged past 3 Idiots.        
	Its heartening to hear the reactions and the commercial feedback of our film, Karan Johar messaged Metro from Mumbai.        
	Its been a journey like Rizvans and am glad ours ended positively, added the director, referring to the Shiv Sena protests in Maharashtra on Friday the 12th.        
	Maharashtras loss was Bengals gain, with the region laying a greater claim to Shah Rukhs latest screen success. Bengal usually accounts for around 5 per cent of the total earnings of the country but for My Name Is Khan its done almost 10 per cent of the all-India collections for the first weekend, said Soni of Venkatesh.        
	Distributor-exhibitor Arijit Dutta added that Shah Rukh films had historically done very well in Calcutta. Right from Baazigar to Kuch Kuch Hota Hai to Swades to Don to Om Shanti Om, SRK is a favourite here. MNIK too has made a very good start and even the fall on Monday is only marginal, he said about the collections at Priya.        
	But who are flocking to see a serious film on a serious issue with Shah Rukh Khan the actor replacing SRK the superstar?        
	There was a concern whether a film like MNIK would do well commercially, as it may not appeal to the youngsters so much. But the film is definitely bringing in families, women and Muslims, said Soni.        
	So, will My Name Is Khan beat the 3 Idiots record? Unlikely, says the trade. The film may be good but it is not entertaining enough for repeat audiences, said Mehra.        
	Because its opened so wide, it may not have long legs, especially with the IPL around the corner, added Soni.        
	Shah Rukh feels  or maybe hopes  that the second week should also hold high. And with no big Bollywood release this Friday, he may well be right.        
	Now its up to the old Don, Amitabh Bachchan, or the maker of the new Don Farhan Akhtar to stop SRK with Teen Patti or Karthik Calling Karthik on February 26.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bench cuts students fine
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench on Friday directed Calcutta University to collect Rs 1,000 each from two students who could not afford to pay Rs 10,000 and apply for Part III admit cards after the deadline.        
	The two were part of a group of 32 BA and BCom students of 18 colleges who had moved the court to sit for Part III after they could not submit the application form by the last date.         
	Last week, Justice B. Sommader of the high court had asked the university to allow the students to sit for the examination against a payment of Rs 10,000 each.        
	On Friday, Kanchan Sarogi of Bangabasi Evening College and Romana Naaj of Calcutta Girls College moved the division bench of Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay and Justice I.P. Mukherjee, pleading that they had failed to collect such a huge amount and the university was not allowing them to sit for the examination.        
	The lawyer representing the university opposed the plea.         
	The bench asked the university authorities to issue admit cards to the two by April 19 against a payment of Rs 1,000 each. The examination starts on April 20. Justice Somadder had held that it was wrong on the students part not to submit the form in time.        
	The students are directed to deposit the amount by 5pm on April 7 and the university is directed to issue them admit cards by April 9, the judge had said on April 6.        
	On Friday, the two students submitted before the judge: We could not raise Rs 10,000 in one day. The court should ask the university to consider our case and allow us to sit for the examination.

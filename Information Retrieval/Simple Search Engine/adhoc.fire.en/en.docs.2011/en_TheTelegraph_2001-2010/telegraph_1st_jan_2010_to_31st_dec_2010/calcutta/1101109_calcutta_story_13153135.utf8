	Two girls died and two of their friends were critically injured when the Maruti Swift they were travelling in lost control late on Sunday and crashed into a road divider near the Kolaghat flyover, around 60km from Calcutta.        
	Police said the accident on National Highway 6 occurred around 10.15pm when the youngsters were returning after dinner at the Sher-e-Punjab dhaba in Kolaghat.        
	By the time sisters Rebecca, 27, and Aarti Das, 18, were brought out from the mangled remains of the car, the two were dead. Mohammed Danish, 25, who was driving the car, and his friend Ravi Shaw, 21, were taken to a local nursing home and then shifted to the Tamluk district hospital. Their condition is critical.        
	According to witnesses, the car was speeding when it lost control and crashed into the divider just before the Kolaghat flyover, said Tamluk SDPO Parijat Biswas.        
	Danish was driving and Rebecca was in the front seat, while Aarti and Ravi were at the back. The left side of the car bore the brunt of the crash and so the girls, who were seated on the left, suffered fatal injuries, said Biswas.        
	Rebecca and Aarti, daughters of Paul Das, the caretaker of La Martiniere for Girls, lived on the schools campus on Rawdon Street. While Aarti was a Class XII student of La Martiniere, Rebecca, an alumnus of the school, was working at St Thomas Boys School on Free School Street.        
	On Sunday evening, Rebecca said she was going for a long drive with her friends and took Aarti along. We got worried when they did not return home after 10pm and their cellphones went on ringing. Around 11.30pm, the cops informed us about the accident, said brother Pradip.        
	The family brought the bodies home on Tuesday evening after the post-mortem at Tamluk.        
	Danish, a resident of Ripon Street and an employee of a leather unit at the Bantala Leather Complex, was brought back to the city on Tuesday and admitted to the ICU in Lifeline nursing home on Wood Street.        
	The office had given the car to Danish just a few weeks ago. On Sunday evening, he left home in a hurry saying he was going for a drive with his friend, said his elder brother Mohammed Shamim.        
	Ravi, a resident of Suresh Sarkar Road in Entally, was admitted with a fractured left hand and serious head injuries at Belle Vue.        
	At the accident spot, local people blamed lack of policing for the tragedy. This stretch is poorly lit. Also, on Sunday, the cops were on duty at Haldia More  the crossing of NH 41 and NH 6 about a kilometre away  and as a result, there was no policing at this crossing, said a witness.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brand guru ready with Bengal plan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Brand guru ready with Bengal plan
          MOHUA DAS                          Wally Olins at a city hotel                                  
	Wally Olins, positioning London for the 2012 Olympics and Bengal for the global market, spent five hours at Writers Buildings on Tuesday explaining his companys recommendations for the final brand idea, visual expression and activation plans to the finance minister and senior officials.         
	We had some very good meetings. The basic outline of what the brand idea could be has been agreed upon and what is very important is that its not tied to any political agenda. It will be launched pretty much immediately, said Olins after the interactive session.        
	There is no plan to appoint a brand ambassador for Bengal and the logo and slogans will be in both English and Bengali. The visuals presented include the iconic Bankura horse to typically Bengali alpana designs and kantha stitch. Were trying to use symbols intrinsic to Bengal in creating the visual line, said Avik Chattopadhyay, the CEO of Olinss company Saffron Brand Consultants.        
	He described the session as participatory and the reactions of the minister and the officials as positive.        
	The 12 departmental secretaries who attended the session are the members of the advisory committee guiding Saffron. Also present was a team from the information and cultural affairs department, including special secretary Niloy Ghosh who is facilitating meetings of the Saffron representatives with various working groups. Saffron has met 370 people across Bengal during the course of their survey, said Ghosh.        
	Team Saffron interacted with eminent names from all walks of life Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar to footballer Surajit Sengupta and writer Sunil Gangopadhyay  before coming up with the recommendations.         
	The final plan is awaiting the nod from the chief secretary, Samar Ghosh, who was absent at Tuesdays meeting. Saffron will build on the idea before the brand Bengal campaign rolls out.        
	We will receive a soft copy of their presentation within the next few days. We will discuss the presentation among ourselves and provide feedback before meeting them next month, said Ghosh.

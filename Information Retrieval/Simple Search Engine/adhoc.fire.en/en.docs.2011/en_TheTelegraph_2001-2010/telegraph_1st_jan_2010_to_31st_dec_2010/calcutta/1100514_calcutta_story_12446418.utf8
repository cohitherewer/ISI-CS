          Todays question: Should annual exams give way to continuous evaluation through unit tests? More responses next week

	I dont think it would be right to do away with the exams  whether it is held quarterly or annually. This is because the exams have an element of fear associated with them which makes students study. My children study seriously only when the exams are approaching. The unit tests or class tests do not have such an effect and they are least bothered about them.                 Prasanta Kumar Ghosh,

	No one will appreciate the enactment of Hamlet without the ghost of Hamlets father. We must not dispense with the annual exams. They have a heritage value! Too many unit tests will create an exam phobia among students. Without annual exams the steady progress in studies is disrupted and students will concentrate on the unit syllabus. A month should be given for the annual exams. If the students have playgrounds to play and nutritious food to gorge on then academics should not take a back seat in the name of pressure.         Kanta Chandra,

	Both the exam systems are useful. Continuous evaluation through unit tests helps students to be regular in their studies. Instant success encourages the child to do better. Also if he is unable to appear in the annual exams he can be judged on the basis of unit tests. Unit tests also help teachers assess the students ability. On the other hand, annual exams help the student retain and produce the whole years work in a given time. Annual exams should complement unit tests and not be done away with all together.                Samir Cassim Ariff,

	I think the process of unit tests have made things easier for students. It has lowered the pressure, but annual exams and unit tests are important as both make the teacher and the parent aware of what the pupil has learnt through the year.                 Megha Khanna,

	Unit tests will be a boon for students at university levels. Everybody is aware of the pressures of half-yearly and annual exams. The trauma leads to serious problems. Continuous evaluation through unit tests ensures that the curriculum is completed with less amount of pressure. So whats the harm in it? But it should be implemented effectively so that it proves to be a boon.                 AHANA SEN GUPTA,

	Annual examinations should give way to continuous comprehensive evaluation. This measure can rightly be comprehended as a means to de-stress the students. The assessments are divided into segments which can correctly judge the students performance. Annual exams occur at long intervals and can leave students with too much on the plate. The continuous process of assessing students can benefit their career since this way they are engrossed in studies all through the year rather than for a month before the exams.

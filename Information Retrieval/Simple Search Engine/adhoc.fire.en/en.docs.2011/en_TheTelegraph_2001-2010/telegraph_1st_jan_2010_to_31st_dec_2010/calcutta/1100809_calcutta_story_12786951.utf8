The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport revamp flight delayed
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Airport revamp flight delayed

	Calcutta airport is paying the price for the Red army bulldozing the civil aviation ministry into choosing a public rather than private pilot for its Rs 2,400-crore flight to modernisation.        
	The project, which was part of a larger privatisation plan but remained with the public sector Airports Authority of India following full-on protests by Citu  and off-line talks between the CPM brass and the ministry, sources said  is set to overshoot its August 2011 deadline by several months, if not a year and more.        
	Officials confirmed that even the bidding process for installation of some basic infrastructure was yet to take off in Calcutta while other airports  Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai  had either finished their projects ahead of schedule or were on time.        
	The progress of work in Calcutta has been painfully slow to say the least. Tenders for installation of some basic infrastructure have not been finalised yet. It is very unlikely that the project will be completed within the deadline of August 2011, a senior AAI official said from Delhi.        
	The official said current estimates suggested at least six extra months would be required to finish the project, but sources at the city airport insisted it would be a miracle if the delay was restricted to some months.        
	With only a year left for the deadline, 60 to 70 per cent of the work should have been completed by now. However, only around 40 per cent of the project has been completed, the official added.         
	The Indo-Thai consortium, ITD-ITD Cem, was awarded the project in 2008 but some of the sites are yet to be handed over to the company. We have not been able to demolish the existing buildings because of various reasons, the official said.        
	The delay in getting government clearance for the construction of a flyover from VIP Road till the main approach to the airport is being cited as one of the reasons for the project running well beyond schedule. The state government gave the clearance only last month, said a senior official involved in the project.        
	The Citu-backed Airports Authority of India Employees Union had picketed in front of various airports in 2007 against the civil aviation ministrys move to hand over the modernisation projects to private players. The union had also resorted to flash strikes at airports, forcing the ministry to decide that the AAI would oversee the modernisation of Calcutta and Chennai airports while Mumbai, Delhi and Hyderabad would be handed over to private players.        
	We struggled hard to keep the modernisation project with the AAI and didnt allow them to privatise the airport. The project has been delayed because of a conspiracy hatched by officials in Delhi who want to prove that a government agency cant handle the project efficiently, claimed Dipankar Ghosh, the regional secretary (Calcutta) of the airports authority staff union.        
	The first phase of the billion-rupee modernisation project includes an integrated terminal building with 1,80,000sq m of space and an annual passenger-handling capacity of 20 million. Walkalators connecting the proposed Biman Bandar Metro station to the terminal have also been planned.        
	According to sources, tenders for construction of water, sewerage and effluent treatment plants, IT and electronics networking in the integrated terminal building and the proposed frameless aluminium faade of the building have not been finalised yet. Bids for contracts to operate and maintain the integrated terminal have been delayed. We are on the verge of finalising the process. Tenders will be floated soon, insisted an official.        
	In stark contrast to the laxity on display in the city of unionism and strikes, the first phase of Hyderabad airports modernisation project was completed almost six months ahead of schedule in March 2009. The swank terminal spans 1,05,259sq m with an annual handling capacity of 12 million passengers.         
	Delhi airports modernisation project with a budget of Rs 12,700 crore was also completed well before the deadline. The project was over in 37 months. We were ready to open on March 31, 2010, beating the September deadline, said an official of the Delhi Airport Corporation Ltd.        
	Mumbai airport is also poised to keep its 2012 date with modernisation. The Rs 9,800-crore project is on track, said a spokesperson.                    INPUTS FROM G.S.

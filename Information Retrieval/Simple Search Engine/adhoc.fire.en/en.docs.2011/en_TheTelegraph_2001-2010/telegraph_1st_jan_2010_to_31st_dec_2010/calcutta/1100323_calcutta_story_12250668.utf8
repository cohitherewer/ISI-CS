The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | What lies ahead?
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      What lies ahead?
                              Mohd Ali Park Durga puja draws huge crowds                            
	The civic bodys responsibility seems to have ended with renovating Mohd Ali Park, as mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has given the green signal to hold all kinds of functions, including Durga puja, which may not augur well for the parks greenery.         
	Mohd Ali Park will host all kinds of social and religious functions, but it will be the responsibility of the organisers to maintain and restore the park. After the Pujas, it will be the puja committees responsibility to restore the park to its original state, said the mayor at the parks inauguration.         
	The Mohd Ali Park puja committee is going ahead with its plans for Durga puja, and also the fair, at the venue.         
	We will make sure that the damage to the park is minimum. And whatever be it, we will restore the park to its original form... by filling up the holes caused by the bamboo structure, said Dinesh Bajaj, Trinamul Congress MLA and chairman of Youth Association which organises the Mohd Ali Park puja.

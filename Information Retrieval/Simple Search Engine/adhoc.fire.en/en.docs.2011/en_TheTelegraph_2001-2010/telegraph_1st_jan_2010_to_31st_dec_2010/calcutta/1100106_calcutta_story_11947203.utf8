The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Colder days ahead for city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Colder days ahead for city
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta could get colder over the next few days but the Celsius wont sneeze, says the weatherman.        
	The wind chill that you felt at the start of the week declined on Tuesday but it is set to get stronger over the next few days. The city could come within striking distance of a cold wave but we are unlikely to see a dip in temperatures by more than two degrees below normal, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	By definition, a cold wave is when the minimum temperature dips lower than normal by five degrees or more and stays there for more than a day.        
	Tuesdays minimum temperature was normal at 12.9 degrees Celsius, but the maximum reading was four degrees below normal at 22.6 degrees.         
	Humidity, which rose to a maximum of 95 per cent, was responsible for the slight rise in the minimum level from Mondays low of 11.4 degrees, Met officials said.        
	The day also being less windy meant Calcuttans didnt feel the cold as much as they did on Monday.         
	But as the week progresses, the cold wave in the Jharkhand-Chhattisgarh-Orissa belt is likely to gain in strength, making Calcutta shiver as well.        
	Temperatures will drop further in districts like Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum, West Midnapore and East Midnapore. Calcutta will feel the chill as well because of the wind, said a Delhi-based official of the India Meteorological Department.        
	As reported by Metro on Tuesday, the city is currently the meeting point of the north and northwest wind flows. The dry, cold wind is making Calcuttans feel as cold at 11-odd degrees Celsius as they would when the mercury reads 10 degrees.         
	Rising humidity may have offered a days respite but the weather looks set to get colder with a persistently active northwesterly flow, coupled with the cold wave in the neighbourhood, said a senior scientist of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	So are sub 10-degree temperatures in sight?        
	 Yes, very much so, the scientist said. With over six weeks to go before winters likely departure from the city, theres no reason why the mercury cant breach even the sub nine-degree mark, he added.        
	Calcutta, which craves for a cool spell for 10 months of the year, could be saying brrr to that.

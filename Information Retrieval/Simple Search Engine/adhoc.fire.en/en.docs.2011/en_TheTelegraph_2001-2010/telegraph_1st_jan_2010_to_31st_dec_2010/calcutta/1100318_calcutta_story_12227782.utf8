The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rivals rush to slow down bill
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rivals rush to slow down bill
  - Thrust amp; parry over Presidency status        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Presidency Colleges run for university status has turned into a political relay race with one team determined to cling on to the baton and the other desperate to grab finishing-line glory.        
	A prod from Mamata Banerjee had prompted Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to fast-track Presidency Colleges upgrade to a university but now the challengers to the chief ministers chair are determined to oppose the haste in passing the bill.        
	The Trinamul Congress and the Congress demanded on Wednesday that the Presidency University Bill, 2009 be referred to a select committee of the House in an attempt to prevent Bhattacharjee from scoring brownie points by formalising Presidencys upgrade in the current budget session.         
	The government shouldnt hastily push through the bill. It needs elaborate discussions and we wont let this bill pass in this form, Opposition leader Partha Chatterjee said, demanding its referral to the select committee.        
	The rule book says a bill introduced in the House is sent to relevant standing committees for examination and recommendations, following which it is discussed and then passed.        
	Bills are referred to select committees, with the minister concerned as chairperson, in matters of serious import.        
	We have told the Speaker to convene a meeting of the business advisory committee on Thursday to place our demand The Speaker has agreed, added Chatterjee.        
	Both Trinamul and Congress did not attend the scheduled meeting of the business advisory committee on Wednesday to protest the Sainbari killings on March 17, 1970, by alleged CPM men.         
	In the absence of the opposition, government chief whip Syed Mohammed Masih, higher education minister Sudarshan Roy Chowdhury and Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim decided to table the bill on March 19 at 3pm. We will discuss the Trinamuls select committee demand at Thursdays meeting. Till then, I cant say whether the bill will be referred to such a committee, the Speaker told Metro.        
	If a bill is referred to the select committee, it can take anything between six months and even three to four years for approval following which it is sent to the House.        
	Trinamul and Congress leaders admitted that their opposition to the bill in its existing form would delay the process of upgrade but blamed the government for not paying heed to their views when the bill was discussed by the higher education standing committee.        
	Chatterjee claimed that the standing committee was in a hurry to table its report in the House and so the provisions of the bill were not properly discussed.        
	We dont mind if it takes time. If our party comes to power next year, our government will give shape to the proposed Presidency university, said a Trinamul MLA making clear the primary reason for their bid to slow down the passage of the bill.        
	CPM MLA Rabin Mondal claimed that the bill would be passed in the ongoing budget session. The opposition members in the standing committee remained mum during the panel meetings. They should have raised the objections earlier, said Mondal.        
	The government will also run into resistance from the CPM-controlled West Bengal College Teachers Association. The members of the association held several rounds of meetings on Wednesday to chalk out their course of action if the bill was passed in the Assembly on Friday. We want Presidency to be converted to an affiliating university with all the 17 government colleges under its umbrella. We will oppose the bill, they said.

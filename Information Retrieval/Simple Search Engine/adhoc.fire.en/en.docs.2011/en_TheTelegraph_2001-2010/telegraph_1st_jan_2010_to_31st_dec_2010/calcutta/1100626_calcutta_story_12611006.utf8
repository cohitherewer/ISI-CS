          OUR BUREAU                          Wally Olins with Asim Dasgupta. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The man positioning London for Olympics 2012 shared his thoughts on Brand Bengal with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and finance minister Asim Dasgupta at Writers Buildings on a day when the ruling CPMs labour arm announced yet another strike.        
	Wally Olins, who has branded Poland, Spain and Rio De Janeiro in between advising giant corporations for over five decades, described the meeting  around the same time as Citu was calling a 24-hour strike  pleasant, constructive and useful.        
	Olins interacted with Dasgupta for an hour from 4.30pm, after which the minister accompanied him to a 15-minute meeting with Bhattacharjee in the first-floor conference room. The chairman of Saffron Brand Consultants left the state secretariat with a smile and a wave after presenting his ideas.        
	Dasgupta said Wally saw a large number of positives in Bengal that he felt the world should know about. The bandh, one assumes, is not one of them.        
	We had a very fruitful and pleasant discussion with him. He had expressed his interest a few days ago to meet us and present his thoughts on a few things about our state. We had readily agreed, said the finance minister.        
	Wally is supposed to send his views in writing to the state government within a week. After we get that we can take a call on how to take things forward, said Dasgupta.

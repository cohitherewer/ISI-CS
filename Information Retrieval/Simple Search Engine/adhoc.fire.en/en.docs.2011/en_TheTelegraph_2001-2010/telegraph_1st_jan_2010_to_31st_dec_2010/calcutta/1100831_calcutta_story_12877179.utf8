                      Imagined reality                    Confabulations  replacement of the gaps left by a disordered memory with imaginary happenings. Anthony Burgess              The works in Confabulations, Mahesh Baligas ongoing show, are an attraction of the unusual and the fascination exerted by the unknown and unfamiliar. He tries to be unpredictable in his creativity and does not appear to conform to any specific belief. His images are about possibilities rather than realities. Traversing the thin line between truth and untruth, his works deal with the unsaid and the invisible, leading the viewer to an unidentified terrain. The works are constructed through destruction, but the doubt that accompanies a particular work ends up with its own solutions. Sometimes, Baliga works with three dimensional objects. These processes bring forth obstructions and give the artist a chance to explore the real in his head.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by Mahesh Baliga When: Till September 11 (except Sunday); 11 am - 7 pm, Monday, 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dark despair of festival street
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dark despair of festival street
                              Deepak Kumar Bibra watches holiday traffic file past Park Street, resplendent in lights for the Christmas-New Year week, from his unlit balcony in Stephen Court on Sunday evening. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                            
	Optometrist Deepak Kumar Bibra, 62, has spent the past few evenings standing on the balcony of his residence watching his favourite street aglow with the warmth of the festive week. Its a ringside view he has enjoyed for five decades but this year has been different  he can see the celebration but can no longer feel it.         
	Bibra, one of only seven apartment owners to have returned to the tragedy-scorched Stephen Court since the March 23 blaze that claimed 43 lives, recounts to Metro his journey from joy to despair between last Christmas and this one.                
	Christmas and New Year arent the same any longer. From the heart of the celebration, we have been hurled into the heart of darkness.        
	This festive week, as I look at illuminated Park Street sitting in my flat (No. 17) at Stephen Court, my mind travels to all the good times we used to have on Christmas and New Year in this very building. March 23 changed all that  43 people lost their lives and hundreds lost the homes they had lived in for over 50 years.         
	I had met Jagdish Butta, my neighbour of four decades, at a meeting earlier this week to discuss how we could restore certain basic amenities and the irony of it all sank in. In previous years, we would meet at this time of the year not to discuss our problems but plan how to celebrate.         
	After the official part of our conversation was over, we looked at each other as if to say something more but neither of us exchanged another word. Only our silence spoke.        
	Everything was so different until last year. It feels strange that this building was reverberating with laughter at this time last year. Personally, my best Christmas at Stephen Court was in 2006, when most of us residents were invited to the home of Patience Traube for cakes and home-made wine. There were over 150 guests that day  people of different faiths bound together by the spirit of celebration. The wine flowed till late into the night; it was as if the party would never end.        
	The Sixties and the Seventies were, of course, the most glorious years for Stephen Court with Christmas being such an elaborate affair that people from other parts of the city would come to Park Street to witness our celebrations. I loved sitting on our balcony, which offers the best view of Park Street, along with friends and sipping wine while the younger revellers took over the Free School Street crossing to dance the night away.        
	The scale of the celebrations may have become smaller over the years with some Christian families moving out but the spirit remained the same. Parties would be organised in almost every apartment and almost everybody tried their hand at making Christmas cakes.        
	This year, as I stand on our balcony alone, I cannot watch the revelry for long. My eyes involuntarily shift to the still-burnt upper floors and my mind is filled with images of the horrors of March 23. It seems just like yesterday when some victims fell to their death on the balcony adjacent to ours. I feel a shudder down my spine and I walk back inside.        
	Forget the festive dazzle, our building is now a picture of dark despair. I did not celebrate Christmas this year  not that I felt like doing so. Neither did any of the other six families staying in the building. Nobody invited me to a Christmas Eve party or an Xmas dinner with the usual turkey and wine. Patience Traube, my neighbour and good friend in whose home we used to have parties every Christmas for at least three days, has gone back to London to stay with her son.         
	People passing by now take pictures of our building on their cellphones not to record a celebration but a tragedy. March 23 has snuffed the life out of Stephen Court.              
	As told to Tamaghna Banerjee

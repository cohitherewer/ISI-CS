The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rawla meets House panels
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rawla meets House panels
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The father of Rouvanjit Rawla, the La Martiniere for Boys student who had committed suicide after being subjected to corporal punishment in school, met members of two Assembly standing committees on Wednesday to brief them about the circumstances leading to his sons death.        
	The members also spoke to the school authorities to know their version of the events and home secretary Samar Ghosh to enquire about the police probe into the suicide.         
	Twenty members of the two committees  of the school education and women and child affairs departments  quizzed the three sides separately.        
	It seems the members are taking the matter seriously, said Rouvanjits father Ajay, who had come to the Assembly House around 2pm. They felt that laws might have to be changed to prevent a repeat of what of my son had faced.        
	The 13-year-old student of Class VIII was found hanging at his Alipore home four days after being caned by principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi. Ajay Rawla had lodged a police complaint on June 7.        
	Earlier, the members had talked to the La Martiniere management, represented by Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the schools board of governors, and two other board members. Dhar said the members had asked the management for some documents, which would be handed over in three days.        
	The panels later spoke to home secretary Ghosh on the progress in the police probe in the case. I was asked to speed up the inquiry, Ghosh later said at Writers Buildings.        
	Strike: The West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association announced on Wednesday that around 5 per cent of the 1,900-odd petrol pumps in the state would be exempted from the day-long petrol pump strike on Friday. The exempted pumps would sell fuel to vehicles providing emergency services like ambulances and those of police, fire services and the media. The strike is in protest against the irrational policies of oil companies.        
	Fire death: Sanaka Halder, 9, was charred to death and two others were burnt after a fire broke out in a house in Gobinda Khatik Lane in Tangra on Wednesday evening. Neighbours doused the blaze before fire tenders could arrive.

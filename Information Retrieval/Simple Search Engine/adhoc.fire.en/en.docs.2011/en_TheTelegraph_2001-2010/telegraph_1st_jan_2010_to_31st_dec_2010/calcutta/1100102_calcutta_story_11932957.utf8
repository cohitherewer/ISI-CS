The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wipro opens purse for Rajarhat plot
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wipro opens purse for Rajarhat plot
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Wipro has paid the first instalment of the price of the plot it has been offered to set up its second campus in the city, raising hopes that the project would take off soon.        
	The information technology major had on Thursday handed over to the government a cheque for around Rs18 crore as the application fee for the 50-acre plot in New Town Action Area III.        
	Wipro has given 25 percent of the quoted price for the plot as application fee, said a senior official of Hidco, the implementing agency of the Rajarhat township. The remaining amount will have to be paid within 90 days.        
	Premji had set an 18-month deadline for work to start on the second campus after finalising the land deal at a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on December 11.        
	The company had closed the deal at Rs 75 crore, at Rs 1.5 crore per acre. When Wipro first expressed interest in setting up a campus in Rajarhat, the government had quoted a price of Rs 2.16 crore an acre.        
	Wipro had promised to pay the first instalment in December and has kept its word. This suggests the company wants to start work at the earliest, said a senior official in the state IT department.        
	Sources in the department said work would start in 2010.        
	Now that the application fee has been paid, Hidco can start measuring and demarcating the plot. Once the process is through, the Bangalore-headquartered company will have to submit its construction plans to Hidco for approval.        
	At times we need to make some minor adjustments during the measurement and demarcation process. This has to be done before the final instalment is paid, the Hidco official added.        
	Wipro officials refused comment on the issue.

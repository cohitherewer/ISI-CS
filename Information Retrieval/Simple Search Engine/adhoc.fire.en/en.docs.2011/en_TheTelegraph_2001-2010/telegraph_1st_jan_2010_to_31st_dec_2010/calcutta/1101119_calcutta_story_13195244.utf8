                      Creations on clay                    Clay Stories has brought together studio potters and pottery production houses from various cities to showcase their creative clay work at the ongoing four-day Potters Market. We wanted people to look at pottery as an art rather than a craft form. It will also provide potters a platform to exchange ideas and grow as a community of artists, says Aditi Saraogi of Clay Stories. Find an array of clay pottery that could serve a dual purpose of being kept as a showpiece or used as everyday utensils. Each potter has something unique to offer in terms of design and pattern. While Calcutta-based Saraogi has tribal patterned vases and plates, Sonia Jamal from Bhopal has funky potteryware like toothpick holders, shot glasses, quaint tea pots and cannon-shaped jugs in aqua hues. Shantiniketans Lipi Biswas has drawn inspiration from nature to create earthen impressions on ash-blazed dessert bowls, oil bottles, wine and water jugs and curvy platters. Mumbai-based production house Kuprkabi has brought an interesting collection of terracotta and stoneware pieces like fridge magnets, frog ashtrays, tea lights, aroma diffusers and bells. Talks on pottery-making and live demonstrations will also be conducted.

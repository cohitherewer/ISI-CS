	Stargazers are in for a busy week with the peak activity of a meteor shower coinciding with Venus, Mars and Saturn forming a small planetary triangle in the western sky.         
	The planets, of which Venus is the brightest, are visible to the naked eye. On Thursday, a crescent moon will be seen in the same part of the sky as well.        
	The planets are crowding into a relatively small area in the sky. They have been moving, as a result of which the triangle is changing shape daily, said Debiprosad Duari, the director (research and academics) of MP Birla Planetarium.        
	The distance between the planets will start to increase after August 13, he added.        
	Mercury, which is visible through binoculars, was also much brighter than usual on Saturday, said Soumen Mukherjee, the secretary of Dhakuria-based amateur astronomers group Skywatchers Association. The formation of the planetary triangle has no astronomical significance, according to him.         
	The annual Perseid meteor shower, associated with the Swift-Tuttle comet, has been on since July 17 and will continue till August 24.        
	The maximum activity will take place early on August 13, when the number of visible meteors is predicted to peak at 100 per hour, said Mukherjee. Perseid is one of the most visible meteor showers, which can be viewed best before dawn.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday stayed a government notification to acquire a seven cottah plot on Golf Club Road for the expansion of Srutinandan, a music school run by Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty.        
	Justice Debasish Kargupta passed the order following a petition by Anjali Devi Chowdhury, who claimed to be the owner of the plot.        
	The government had mentioned in the December 2 notification that it would pay Rs 16.57 lakh to the owner. But the petitioner claimed the market rate on Golf Club Road was Rs 20 lakh per cottah.        
	Chakrabarty told Metro he had no clue from where Anjali Devi Chowdhury had appeared as the plot belonged to Hemant Chowdhury. Eight years ago I had paid Rs 16.57 lakh the government had asked for the plot.

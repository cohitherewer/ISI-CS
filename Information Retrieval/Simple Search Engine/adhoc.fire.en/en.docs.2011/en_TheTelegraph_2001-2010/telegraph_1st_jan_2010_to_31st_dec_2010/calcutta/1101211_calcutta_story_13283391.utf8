        A STAFF REPORTER                           Ornaments and coins stolen from the Todi home that have been recovered by police. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	An alleged professional thief and a woman bootlegger were arrested on Thursday night in connection with the burglary of diamond and ruby encrusted ornaments worth Rs 32 lakh from industrialist S.K. Todis home early on December 1.        
	Bapi Khan alias Chandu alias Chandan, 24, had sneaked into the 2/2B Sarat Bose Road house through an unguarded door. He was caught on security cameras with a cigarette in one hand, a screwdriver in the other and a bag slung across his shoulder.         
	Most of the ornaments he had stolen, including a diamond ring worth Rs 15 lakh, a pair of earrings studded with diamonds and rubies, a gold chain and nine gold coins weighing 8g each, have been recovered.        
	Bapi told investigators that he had initially entered the neighbouring Anandalok apartment complex block around midnight.        
	Security cameras installed on the outer walls of the Todi home had captured Bapi walking through the neighbouring compound and poking the locked doors with a long screwdriver. He occasionally paused his break-in attempts to puff on cigarettes.        
	Failing to open the doors, Bapi took the staircase to the roof where he found the bags of the estates security guards and ate their tiffin.        
	He then lit another cigarette and set his eyes on the adjoining Todi residence. After reaching the ground floor, he scaled the 10ft wall separating the two buildings and entered the Todi home, said an officer of the detective department.         
	The main entrance was unguarded, so Bapi did not have any trouble entering the house. Once inside, he headed for the first floor. Since the doors were all locked, he tried his luck on the floor above, added the sleuth.         
	S.K. Todis daughter-in-law and newborn grandchild were sleeping in one of the rooms. Bapi sneaked into the adjoining cloakroom and found the keys to open the vault of the cabinet, which contained the ornaments and Rs 22,000.        
	From the house, Bapi headed to the country liquor den run by Nazma Begum, 40, near Park Circus. He deposited the ornaments with Nazma and kept the cash, said an officer. Bapi spent a lot of money watching films the next few days. We found movie tickets on him, of halls in the Esplanade area, added the officer.        
	Bapi and Nazma were picked up from their homes in Tiljala.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rs 7 lakh theft in heart of city
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The main door of the flat that was robbed. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Cash and jewellery worth Rs 7 lakh were stolen from a ground-floor flat on Free School Street on Monday, barely three days after the murder and Rs 25 lakh robbery at a Gariahat home on Friday.         
	Police said the front door of the flat belonging to Rahul Khanna, 25, and his mother Sheila, 52, was not broken and suspect the thieves used a duplicate key.         
	Around 6pm on Monday, Rahul left home with his mother and aunt Varsha, 40, who lives nearby, the police said. They returned after two-and-a-half hours and found the main door ajar. They discovered the almirah was open and Rs 4.5 lakh and jewellery worth Rs 2.75 lakh were missing, said an officer of the detective department.        
	The cops said Rahul, who used to work with a share trading company in Mumbai, had shifted to Calcutta for his mothers treatment. They have been living in the Free School Street flat for a little over four months.         
	An officer said that the lock of the almirah was not broken either. There were three lockers but the items were stolen from only one locker, he added. The police suspect that someone known to the family might be involved in the theft.         
	When Metro visited the flat on Tuesday evening, no one from the family was available for comment.         
	A senior police officer said a domestic help who had been working in Varshas house for 15 years was recently appointed by the Khannas.        
	But we dont have any concrete reason to suspect her. She turned up for work on Tuesday morning as usual, the officer said.

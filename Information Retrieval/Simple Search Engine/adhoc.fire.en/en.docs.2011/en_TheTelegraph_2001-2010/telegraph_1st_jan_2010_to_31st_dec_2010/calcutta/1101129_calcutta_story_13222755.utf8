The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wait over for tax clearance
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wait over for tax clearance
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	Good news for Calcuttans who have got stuck in property deals for want of a no liability certificate from the civic revenue department.        
	Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy has issued an order to departments concerned to start this week the process of issuing the certificate after collecting the property tax dues.        
	More than 1.2 lakh applications for the certificate is pending at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters and the borough offices. We will start dealing with the applications from this week, said Roy.        
	To mutate or register a building, flat or a plot, the owner has to submit the no liability certificate to establish that there are no tax dues on the property.        
	But the civic revenue department has stopped issuing the crucial document as at least two revisions of property tax are pending because of lack of manpower.        
	Each revision  general revaluation in civic parlance  results in an increase in property tax by at least 10 per cent.        
	The revaluation was to be carried out once in six years but the Trinamul Congress civic board discontinued the practice in August.        
	A revision pending for two terms means the property owner is paying the tax at the rate fixed 12 years ago.        
	The authorities have now decided to issue the no liability certificate by realising the amount due from a residential property, to be calculated by raising the tax at a flat rate of 10 per cent for every pending general revaluation.        
	For a commercial building, the tax will be increased by 20 per cent for every pending revaluation.        
	If the annual tax on a residential building that hasnt been reassessed twice (12 years) is Rs 100, post-revision the amount will go up to Rs 121. If the owner wants to sell the building, he will be issued a no-liability certificate if he pays up the arrear, said an official.        
	However, a fresh assessment of the tax will be made for properties whose actual status does not match with civic records.        
	Officials have found discrepancies in 2 lakh-odd buildings and apartments, mostly in colony areas that came under the CMC after 1984. For instance, an official pointed out, a 58-cottah plot in the Santoshpur-Garia area has been shown in civic records as a seven-cottah land.                            
	A thorough reassessment of the tax, following a site verification is a must for such premises, the official said.

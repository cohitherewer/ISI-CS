The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bullet-haul cop bashed up
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bullet-haul cop bashed up
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A traffic sergeant who had earned kudos for intercepting a vehicle carrying 5,000 bullets was thrashed by a mob on Sunday after he tried to prevent a minibus that had hit a pedestrian from being set on fire.        
	The minibus on the Prince Anwar Shah-Nimtala route knocked down Shanker Singh on Rabindra Sarani, near Sovabazar, around 9.30am, injuring him in his right leg. Soon, a huge crowd gathered on the spot, protesting rash driving and lack of policing in the area.        
	I was on duty near Sovabazar police station when the Jorabagan traffic guard alerted me about the mishap and asked me to rush to the accident site. When I reached the spot, the crowd had already damaged the vehicle and was pouring diesel on it in an attempt to set it ablaze, recalled the 37-year-old sergeant, Biswajeet Baidya.        
	The mob turned its ire on the cop when he tried to prevent further damage to the bus. They abused me and asked me to leave the spot. When I refused to relent, some of them started kicking and raining blows on me, said Baidya.        
	The critically injured sergeant ran from the spot and took refuge in a shop nearby. Senior officers, alerted by a constable, rushed to the spot and rescued the sergeant after dispersing the mob. No one has been arrested. The sergeant was taken to a nursing home where a scan revealed he had not suffered any internal injury, said an officer.        
	Baidya was recommended for promotion after he stopped an SUV that had jumped signal in Sovabazar last Monday. A search revealed 5,000 bullets in the vehicle.

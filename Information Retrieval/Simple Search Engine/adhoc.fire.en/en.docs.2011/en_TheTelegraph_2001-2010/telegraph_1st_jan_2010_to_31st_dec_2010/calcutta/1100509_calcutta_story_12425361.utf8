The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fast track
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fast track
          The generation gap is nowhere more evident than in the morning walk, says Samhita Chakraborty Lahiri                                    
	Bidhan Chakraborty leaves home every day at 5am, 6am if its winter. His destination: Dhakuria Lakes in south Calcutta. The 57-year-old has been visiting the Lakes for his morning walk for the last 10 years.               
	Here he walks, sometimes jogs a bit, stretches his muscles and does yoga. The morning air clears his mind and fills his lungs with oxygen. But he has come looking for oxygen of a different kind  adda.         
	Chakraborty has made fast friends in the sylvan surroundings  Sukumar Kanta Deb, a retired professional, and Kunal Banerjee, a teacher at Chakdah college near Ranaghat. We feel sad if we miss our morning walks. Here we get fresh air, fresh adda. Our adda encompasses everything from aalpin to elephant, says Deb proudly.         
	The trio sit on a bench facing the lake as rowers cut through the water with powerful strokes. They look like they are having a really good time.         
	But there is another kind of morning walker in the Lakes, growing in number.         
	Sudhanshu Mallik cant stand the adda brigade. Just look at them, says the 28-year-old employee of a pharma major, pointing to the groups dotting the edge of the water. I will run three laps and theyll still be sitting here, talking about inane things. He feels they crowd the Lake area every morning. Why cant they take their gossip to the tea shop across the street? he wonders.         
	The pros are changing the walking track. Sudhanshu and his generation have the right gear and the right approach.         
	Before hitting the jogging track, visiting a fitness expert is a must. The latest mantra is mix-and match. Fitness consultant Anwar ul Wahhab says if one follows the same morning walk routine 14 to 16 times, it stops working for the body. To lose weight, we need to bring the body out of its comfort zone, he advises.                   
	So Sudhanshu jogs thrice a week and visits the gym for weight-training on alternate days. Sundays are for swimming, sometimes squash. But before all this comes a trip to the branded sportswear showroom. Shorts and sleeveless tee made of a material that doesnt allow sweat to cling to the body, jogging shoes, wrist band, hip flask and of course the iPod. The iPod is everywhere, or its variation, the music-enabled cellphone.        
	Journalist Tripti Das must have music during her morning workout. She prefers a brisk walk to jogging. I need the music to keep me focused. It acts like blinkers, helping me not to get distracted.         
	The Lakes become an extension of the gym.         
	The younger lot comes with a target  10 minutes of warm-up, 30 minutes of fast running, 10 minutes of walking to cool down, 30 push-ups, 10 minutes of free-hand exercises and theyre done. The routine may vary from person to person, but everything is by the clock, by the calorie meter. Maybe from the fast track they land on the rat race straight.         
	Neither Sudhanshu nor Tripti has made any friends during their morning routine. They are happy that way.         
	Its not the very young alone.         
	Keshav Jalan, in his early 30s, who drives to the Lakes from Ballygunge Circular Road, says he doesnt have time to chit-chat in the morning. I need to be in office by 9am. If I want to meet people, I can go to a pub in the evening. Anyway, I hate losing sight of what Im here for, he says before jumping into his Innova and zooming away. Hes all primed for the rat race.         
	The young babus hardly stop at my stall. Of the 80 to 90 customers I get every day, hardly 10 are below 40 years, says Shyamal Das, who sells herbal juice just outside the Lakes. He is worried, he says, that the younger lot prefers packaged health drinks to his neem or karela juice, his chiratar ras, triphala, or tulsi-ginger concoctions.         
	Not that all health-conscious end up being healthy. Amitava Bagchi loves eating out and late- night parties and often ends up on the jogging trail nursing a hangover. The result: he blacked out in office one day and landed in the nursing home.         
	This was bound to happen. My son stays up till 2am watching movies on his laptop or partying with friends. And then he goes out for jogging at 6am. How can the body take so much stress? Amitavas father was overheard telling his friends.         
	Ora kotha bolbe keno, oder toh Facebook achhe. (Why will they stop and talk to anyone here, they have Facebook?) retorts Bidhan Chakraborty. He says the youngsters dont understand the pitfalls of being unsocial, yet. He says his friends wait for him every day at the lake, share so many thoughts and get worried if he doesnt show up for more than two days on the trot.        
	He speaks about one of their fellow morning walkers, an 84-year-old man. He spent Rs 10,000 on Reebok gear for his son, so that he could join him on his morning walks. The young man came for two days and then gave up. He likes the gym instead. The father moved out of his sons house and now lives alone in their ancestral house.         
	Bidhan Chakraborty is in no hurry. He finishes his gup-shup, does some free-hand exercises on the grass, then heads to Lake Club for a spot of tea. Others head for the market to shop for the days groceries. Some succumb to the temptation of kochuri and jilipi.         
	In fact, for some, the morning walk remains the busiest part of the day. Take for example Manas Kumar Bhattacharya, 74, and wife Ajanta, 69.         
	We have been coming here since the mid-90s. Initially it was about the brisk walk, about fitness, about losing weight. Now we come for relaxation, for a change from the home surroundings, says Ajanta, before turning around and telling a fellow-walker sitting beside her about her daughters plans of going to Floatel that weekend.         
	We dont know much about our friends here, sometimes we dont even know their full names or where they live. But our groups are very important to us, we get a lot of mental peace here, says Sankar Banerjee, an elderly man who has been coming to the Lakes for two years.         
	A group of middle-aged women stroll down the path under the shadow of lush green trees. Salwar-kameez-clad with dupattas tied in a knot, they wear white PT shoes.         
	They walk, rather stroll, and talk a lot. Conspicuous by their absence are men of the late 30s to late 40s age group. Can they take no time off the rat race? Or do men not feel the need to look good after a certain time?         
	There are happy stories too. Debasis Bhattacharya, 26, works for L amp;T in Mumbai and really misses the Lakes. Every time he comes home to Calcutta, he makes it a point to join his father for morning walk. Not that the two walk together. Bhattacharya Sr walks with his friends. Bhattacharya Jr runs. Then they go back home together.

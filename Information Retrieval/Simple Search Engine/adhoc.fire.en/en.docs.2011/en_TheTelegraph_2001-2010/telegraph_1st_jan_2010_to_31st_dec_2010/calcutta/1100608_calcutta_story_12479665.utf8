  - WRITERS WORKSHOP          SEBANTI SARKAR                          Participants at British Councils summer workshop on creative writing. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	Nine-year old Prakash Singh of Birla High School (Boys), loves ghost stories and wants to build a collection. A title he likes has unfurled a tale in his mind. A few days ago, I wrote my own story, called Say Cheese and Die Screaming.        
	Maitrayee Haldar, a Class IX student of Patha Bhavan, enjoys writing short stories but has difficulties finishing them.        
	Both picked up tips at the creative writing workshop from May 20 to 28, a part of British Councils summer courses for young adults.         
	The workshop, conducted by Richa Wahi, have drawn a warm response from young writers in the nine to 17 age group.         
	The best part of it is there are no restrictions, unlike school, said Saswata Nayak, a Class VIII student of Adamas International School, who has little time to indulge in creative writing otherwise.        
	Colleges offering creative writing courses abroad can show you the technical options while writing and give you the exposure to groom yourself to be a better writer, said Wahi who has an MA in creative writing from Cardiff University, UK. Awaiting publication in two major collections, she is spreading her passion for the written word among kids at The Heritage.        
	At the workshop, children took part in vocabulary games and learnt not only to conjure up characters but create believable backgrounds for each.         
	For older students, the exercise was extended to weaving some of these characters into stories that ring true. But more than writing, I try to give the children opportunities to meet like-minded people and to share ideas. Writing is done in isolation but writers enjoy having their works read or discussed, Richa explained.         
	But though children work with enthusiasm and come up with amazing things during the workshop, few write on a regular basis, rued Richa.         
	Kids are so loaded with tuition that is no time to take part in workshops she added.         
	From June 19 to 20, British Council will host another workshop for aspiring writers, to be conducted by writer Rimi B. Chatterjee.

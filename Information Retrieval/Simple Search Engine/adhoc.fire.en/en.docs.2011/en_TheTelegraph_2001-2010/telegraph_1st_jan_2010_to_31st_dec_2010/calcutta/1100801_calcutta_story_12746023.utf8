The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A housewifes salary
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A housewifes salary
                          Illustration Uday Deb                    
	An ad for a tea brand has a goodlooking woman bumping into a college friend. What are you doing these days? asks Woman 1 to Woman 2. I am the manager at a bank, comes the contented reply. Woman 1 says, head held down: Main sirf ek housewife hoon (I am just a housewife). Woman 2 looks equally crestfallen.        
	The compilers of census 2001 could have made this ad. The document categorises housewives (though it calls them homemakers) as economically unproductive with beggars and prostitutes for company.        
	All of which can be contested, but Metro spoke to Mrs Ghosh, a veteran of more than 30 years of housewifery, on her views on her unproductiveness. She said housewives are thought to be economically unproductive because this is one set of people who have never been paid. And demanded the following monthly salary.         
	Braving the husband        
	A 2009 UK survey says that each day housewives spend 71 minutes vacuuming and dusting, an additional 30 minutes washing up, tidying and cleaning floors, 63 minutes in the kitchen and 14 minutes in making the beds. Mrs Ghosh suggests the following break-up: Presenting tea in bed. Rs 500. Ironing clothes, sometimes even those that have come in from the laundry but are slightly rumpled. Rs 200. Giving him breakfast. Rs 1,000.        
	Packing his three-tiered steel lunch box, without bypassing a single tier. Rs 1,000. Running to hand over the towel. Rs 300. Patiently listening to his workplace problems. Rs 10,000. Letting him yank the TV remote from your hand. Rs 2,000. Watching him yawn while serving him dinner. Rs 10,000.         
	And I have not even counted the number of times I had to turn the house upside down looking for his office papers, watch, cellphone, says Mrs Ghosh.         
	Managing the kids        
	The British survey shows that an average housewife dedicates 273 minutes each day to her children. Mrs Ghosh wants the following payments:        
	Waking children up every five minutes and watch them go back to sleep. Rs 1,000. Ironing uniform. Rs 500. Making and packing lunch. Rs 1,000. Making breakfast. Rs 1,000. Hunting for books, erasers, pencils. Rs 3,000. Dropping and picking them up from school. Rs 2,000. Entertaining them as they eat. Rs 2,000. Helping them with their homework. Sometimes doing the whole homework yourself. Rs 2,000. Feeding them dinner. Rs 3,000. Cleaning up after them. Rs 5,000. Tucking them into bed. Rs 2,000. If it sounds heartless to demand payment for looking after ones own children, it is not more so than calling housewives unproductive, Mrs Ghosh says.         
	Money matters        
	Managing family finances. Rs 20,000 (What percentage does the chartered accountant get for doing his investments?)         
	Total fee        
	Rs 72,500. If they utter the word unproductive once more, the payment has to be with retrospective effect, starting from Day I of marriage, declares Mrs Ghosh.

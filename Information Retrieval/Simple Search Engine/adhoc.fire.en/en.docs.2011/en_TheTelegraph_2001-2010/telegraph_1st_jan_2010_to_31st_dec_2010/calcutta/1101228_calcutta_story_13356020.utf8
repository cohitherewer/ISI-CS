           Troubled waters: That Mamata Banerjee is a great entertainer and crowd-puller is well-established. Thus the prank she played upon the mayor doesnt seem unusual at all (The names Sovan, Jal Sovan, December 14). Luckily for him, the water in the pool was not deep. But this could be a message for Sovan or, for that matter, any of Mamatas lieutenants that they must be ever-ready to be dunked, into greater depths in search of hidden treasures! Kudos to Metro for providing a very interesting Dunk Dossier.                                             
	Address not given           
	I am disappointed, though not surprised, that the 11-year-old girls appeal to Mamata Banerjee not to block Esplanade in the run-up to Christmas had no impact on the lady, who is in an uncanny hurry to unseat the ruling Left Front government (Rally blues for Xmas mood, December 24).           
	The CPMs penchant for holding rallies causing untold miseries to Calcuttans is almost proverbial. But Mamata, who glibly talks of ushering in a new era of hope, is equally guilty, if not more, of the same offence.

	In response to the report Dais shifts, but not disruption, December 9, I feel the words and actions of Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee are contradictory. On the one hand she promises clean, efficient and law abiding governance if her party is voted to power, on the other, her supporters indulge in all sorts of illegal activities.           
	Holding a massive rally next to a hospital smacks of a total lack of consideration for others. One hopes the Trinamul chief asks her partymen to stop taking such anti-people steps. Otherwise they will lose the support of law abiding citizens.

	In response to the question Should campus authorities learn from the JU model and act tough?, December 11, it is pragmatic to learn how the students of Jadavpur University withdrew their agitation following the tough stand taken by the university.             
	Given that educational institutions are solely meant for learning, any kind of political activity vitiating the atmosphere should be done away with. The steps taken by JU should serve as an example for other institutions.           
	Prahlad Agarwala,           
	Majdia, Nadia                     
	Jadavpur University is passing through troubled times. In the good old days, the atmosphere of the university was calm and peaceful. The environment was conducive to academic focus. Yes, there were students wings representing political parties and yes, there were clashes. But student demands would be penned down and submitted to the authorities peacefully.           
	Of late, the campus has turned into a political battleground. One can easily understand the plight of sincerestudents. Worse, bowing to political pressure, the authorities have to limit their disciplinary action against these troublemakers. Such hooliganism will affect campus recruitment in future.

	Given the rate at which the number of multi-storeyed buildings is increasing in the city and its suburbs, no wonder that the cat population is dwindling fast (WWF census on vanishing cats, December 14 ).             
	Cats of wild variety, especially fishing cats known as baghrol or maachhbagha in Howrah and Hooghly districts, are hard to spot these days. Most wild cats, bonberal in local parlance, are also disappearing. Lack of a proper habitat and a food chain is affecting the cats in our cities and towns.

	With the Assembly elections drawing closer, campus violence has assumed alarming proportions all over Bengal (Politics draws campus blood, December 18). In most cases ordinary students who usually shy away from politics are the hapless victims. The tragedy that befell Souvik Hazra, the Asutosh College student who lost an eye, only goes to show how insecure campus life has become. The death of SFI activist Swapan Koley in Andul was equally painful.             
	The leaders of all political hues leave no stone unturned to cash in on such tragedies. But the perpetrators are never brought to justice.           
	It is high time the administration took a tough call on the matter. Either it must enforce law and order on campuses or should ban campus politics entirely. Holding elections under apolitical banners seems a good option but given the dearth of political goodwill and spirit of co-operation in our state, such an effort seems a distant dream.

	Santoshpur                     
	Campus politics is nothing new in Bengal but in the last few years the unrest and bloodshed of mainstream politics have entered colleges. Whatever happened with Swapan Koley and Souvik Hazra is the result of that filthy politics. It is really shameful that students are losing their lives and future for petty politics. The irony is that all political parties are straining every muscle to prove their strength on campuses.

	Violation of traffic rules by auto drivers (Auto writ runs on cop assault stretch, December 13) can cause serious accidents. Both traffic police and citizens must act tough to rein in these errant drivers. The cops are not inclined to take this trouble unless pressured by their bosses. Individuals are afraid to take the lead for fear of retaliation. Auto drivers know they can stop traffic any time and will be supported by politicians and unions.

	It was public awareness that saved the Maidan from the clutches of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild.             
	The cops are doing their bit for the Park Circus Maidan  the officer-in-charge of Beniapukur police station and his team have been keeping an eye on the greens and trying to save them from rowdies. Now, if politicians extend their support, the lungs of the city can be saved.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two-year-old Avirup Ghosh and his eight-month-old sister Arjama, the children of homemaker Mausumi Ghosh who was murdered in her Oxytown home on September 27, were handed over to their father Avik Ghosh on Thursday afternoon.        
	Avik was a prime suspect in the murder of Mausumi and their help Parul.         
	Mausumis father Shankar Dutta, who had lodged a complaint accusing Avik of plotting the murder, had sought the custody of the children.        
	The father is the legal guardian in the absence of the mother. That is why we have handed over the children to Avik Ghosh. Mausumis father can approach the court for their custody, said a senior officer of South 24-Parganas police. The children were staying with a neighbour since the murder.

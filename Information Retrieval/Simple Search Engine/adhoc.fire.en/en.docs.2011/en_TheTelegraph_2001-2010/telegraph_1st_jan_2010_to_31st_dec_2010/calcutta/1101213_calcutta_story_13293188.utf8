The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Education through art for children in need
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Education through art for children in need
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Young Indians, a wing of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), has started a project to educate 2,000 underprivileged children across Calcutta through art experiments and fieldwork.        
	Our aim is nation-building and what better way to do that than by helping young people who do not have the means to become productive members of society, said Namrata Jalan, an entrepreneur and the chairperson for the YI (Young Indians) Kala initiative.        
	YI Kala has joined hands with 10 organisations  the Salvation Army girls orphanage, the Dakshin Kalikata Sevashram boys orphanage, the SMM Liluah home, the Rehabilitation Centre for Children, Ek Prayas, Apne Aap, New Light, Dakhin Prayas, Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission Suryapur and a school in Belur  for the project.        
	The plan is to reach out to orphans, rape victims, juvenile delinquents, platform children, children of sex workers and differently abled children.        
	The YI members have appointed teachers who go to these organisations and tutor kids using interactive, creative methods.         
	Geography is taught using models instead of just reading out from a book. Life science teachers use skeletons and other diagrams to teach about the human body, said Deepika Kedia, a YI member who is a consultant hepatologist and gastroenterologist.        
	Members from across the YI students network in Calcutta, covering Globsyn Business School, Praxis Business School and Calcutta University, are executing the project.        
	The students have taught the children to paint diyas and helped them make handicraft items that are being sold at the Crossword bookstore on Elgin Road for a week.        
	We are trying to find a way to utilise the skills the children are acquiring to increase their employability, said Jalan.        
	For the students, involvement in the project means more than just helping those in need. We are learning management skills, leadership qualities as well as application of marketing tricks through the project, said Priyanka Saha, a second-year student of Globsyn Business School.        
	The YIs aim is to take the week-long display and sale at Crossword, which began on Saturday, to a permanent stall at the store that will help to make the project self-sustaining.        
	The Kala project will be taken up nationally by the YI chapters in other cities.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rs 5 lakh stolen from trinkets shop
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Burglars stole Rs 5 lakh from an imitation jewellery shop on Canning Street between Saturday evening and Tuesday morning.        
	The theft was detected around 10.30am on Tuesday after owner Panjak Gupta opened the shop.         
	It seems the burglars had used duplicate keys to enter the shop and possibly a small instrument to open the locked wooden drawer at the cash counter, said a senior officer of Burrabazar police station.        
	The gang had been tipped off that Rs 5 lakh was kept in the shop, said an investigating officer.         
	Gupta, who has been running the business for over a decade, told cops that he would usually leave around Rs 1 to 2 lakh in the drawer while closing shop.        
	The shop has seven employees.

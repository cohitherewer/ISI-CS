          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday issued contempt rules against two judges of the Burdwan court and asked them to appear before it on November 29 and clarify why they had not followed the courts order and allowed a Calcutta police sergeant to meet his six-year-old son.        
	The division bench also directed Burdwan police superintendent R. Rajshekharan to explain why he had not acted on sergeant Lalalit Haldars complaint.        
	The cop had moved the bench alleging that his estranged wife Urmi Sinha, civil judge of the fourth court in Burdwan, had abducted their son and he could not trace the child.        
	On September 9, the bench had stated that Halder should be allowed to go to his wifes quarters at Burdwan twice a week and meet his son.        
	The sergeant told the bench on Tuesday that his wife was not allowing him to meet his son.

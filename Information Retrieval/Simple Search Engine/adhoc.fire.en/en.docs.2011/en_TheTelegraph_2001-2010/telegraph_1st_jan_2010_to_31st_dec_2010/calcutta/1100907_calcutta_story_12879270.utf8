The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Science amp; nature in southern park
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Science amp; nature in southern park
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          A science park in Hong Kong that has bagged awards for its green design                                  
	The National Council of Science Museums has planned an 8-acre, Rs 20-crore science park with stress on nature study in Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city.        
	The state government handed over a plot for the project to the council, an autonomous society under the ministry of culture, in the last week of August. Work will start once basic infrastructure is in place and is expected to be completed in three years.         
	Our aim is to spread science awareness among students. By building this park on the fringes, we want to reach out to the suburban people, said G.S. Rautela, the director-general of the council.         
	The exhibits will be different from the ones at Science City on the EM Bypass. The Science City exhibits mostly illustrate principles of physics and mechanics. But in the Baruipur park, the exhibits will be based on nature, added Rautela.        
	Many of the enclosures in the park will be underground. The campus will be lush green. There will be no multi-storeyed buildings, added Rautela.         
	In the climate change section, an exhibition on how snow melts because of global warming and finally affects our climate will be on display. We want to make the visitors aware of the nature around us.         
	In the biodome section, climatic conditions different from Calcuttas will be artificially created. We have plans to create a tropical rainforest, said Rautela.        
	Plants that grow without soil will be exhibited in the hydroponics section. The attempt is to showcase aspects of soil-less vegetable farming.         
	City schools have welcomed the move. The interest of students in natural science is on the wane. A visual experience will increase their interest in general science, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.         
	The council also has plans to set up a research and development unit on the campus. The research and development wing of the council works on preparing exhibits for the science museums in the country. We may even throw open parts of the R amp;D unit to the public so that students can witness the science behind the creation of the exhibits, said Rautela.         
	An amphitheatre will also be built, where demonstrations on science will be organised.

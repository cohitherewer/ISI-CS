  - Maternal grandparents get custody despite law favouring father          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini play doting grandparents in Baghban. In the 2003 film, the kids choose their grandparents over their parents                                        
	Calcutta High Court has set aside a key provision in the child custody law to fulfil an eight-year-old girls wish to stay with her maternal grandparents rather than her widower father.         
	Normally, fathers should get custody of their children after the death of their wives. But the law has empowered the court to decide where the child can lead a happy life, said the division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice M.K. Chowdhury, rejecting the custody petition filed by the girls father.        
	The girl, who lost her mother four years ago and has since been looked after by her maternal grandparents, told the judges on Friday that she was happy staying with the elderly couple at their house in North 24-Parganas.        
	In the present case, after talking to the child, the court has come to the conclusion that she would be happier with her grandparents than with her father, the bench ruled.        
	The father, who owns a jewellery store on the northern fringes of the city, had moved the custody petition on the ground that he could afford to give his daughter a good life.        
	Lawyer Puspal Satpathi, who represented the girls maternal grandfather, said his clients daughter committed suicide in 2006 following a tiff with her husband but no complaint was lodged.        
	Since that incident, the child has been under the care of her grandparents. They have admitted her to a local school, where she is now studying in Class II. We are glad she can continue staying there, Satpathi added.        
	So why did the father file the custody claim after four years? He probably didnt know that the custody law favours a father after the mothers death. He first filed a case in Barasat court, a source said.        
	The additional chief judicial magistrate of Barasat had dismissed the first petition based on a police report that said the girl was happy in her grandparents house. The father then moved a habeas corpus petition seeking a personal testimony by his daughter in the high court.

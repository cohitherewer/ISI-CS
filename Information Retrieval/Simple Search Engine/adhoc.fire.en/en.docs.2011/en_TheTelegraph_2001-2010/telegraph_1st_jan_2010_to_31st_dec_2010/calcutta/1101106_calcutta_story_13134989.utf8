	The Union culture ministry is ready to give Rabindra Sadan a facelift, but there are no takers for the job.         
	The ministry, which is inviting proposals for a large-scope, long-term Tagore project to commemorate the writers 150th birth anniversary, is keen to restore and expand halls and auditoriums named after Tagore in the country under the project.         
	Apart from Rabindra Sadan, there is Rabindra Kalakshetra in Bangalore, Rabindra Bhavan in Delhi and Ravindra Natya Mandir in Mumbai. The restoration will be dealt with directly by the ministry.         
	Most of these came up during the Tagore centenary. Different state governments, societies and private organisations built them with 50-70 per cent financial assistance from the Centre, says Union culture secretary Jawhar Sircar, who was in town on Saturday.        
	By providing affordable performance spaces the auditoriums contributed to the cultural activity of the time. Over the years most of these halls have become dated, Sircar adds.        
	The ministry is offering to assist a complete overhaul with state-of-the-art technology and to share the costs with the state or other agencies. Instead of keeping them as standalone auditoriums we will urge their development into complexes or Tagore Parisars, so that these become good places to visit with coffee shops and outdoor performance areas.         
	Six proposals are in. Mumbai wants to revamp its Tagore theatre and Tripura, though its Rabindra Bhavan is new, wants to redo it.        
	We havent had any proposals from the state for Rabindra Sadan but Visva-Bharati, which is yet to have an auditorium named after Tagore, has applied for assistance, says Sircar.         
	Before major changes are made, the ministry will conduct a design competition so that the architectural renovation for each hall is aesthetic.        
	Architectural renovation is only a part of the project, which emphasises a new look at Tagores works.         
	Tagore would be interpreted, adapted and translated in all the other 21 Indian languages, but in such a way as to make the works accessible at different levels. So even if there is no one to translate Shesher Kabita into Tulu word for word, the ministry could perhaps come up with a handy gist.         
	The project aims to explore Tagores pioneering contribution to subjects of contemporary relevance. Tagores views on gender inequalities, caste discrimination, agricultural development, co-operative movement, rural reconstruction, village and craft enterprises, far ahead of his times, will be reanalysed in the light of present day changes, he adds.         
	A proposal, for a Tagore performance or exhibition or any other interpretation of his works, can get up to Rs 5 lakh. The applicants need to come through a non-profit organisation, which can then put its proposal before a regional committee.        
	The last date for submitting the applications is May 2012, says K.K. Banerjee, the convener of the east zone regional committee on the Tagore project.         
	Another proposed scheme is the compilation of a complete Tagore bibliography.         
	Proposals on Rabindra Sadan may not have been forthcoming, but the ministry has been inundated with proposals on other subjects since the first meeting of the national committee on May 20. Some of them are rather unorthodox.         
	While one insists that a kidney transplantation clinic is a better way of remembering Tagore than a cultural do, another offers to market Tagore products on Facebook and Orkut, a third wants a grant to put Tagore on Twitter.        
	The regional committee in the east zone is headed by writer Sirshendu Mukhopadhyay.

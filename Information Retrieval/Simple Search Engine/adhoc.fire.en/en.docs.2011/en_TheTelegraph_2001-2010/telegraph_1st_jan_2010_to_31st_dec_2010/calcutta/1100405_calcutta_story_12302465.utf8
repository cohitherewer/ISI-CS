          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sajal Barui, serving a life term at Alipore Central jail for killing his father, stepmother and stepbrother in 1993, tried to commit suicide by setting himself ablaze in his cell on Saturday night.        
	He lit up some newspapers in his cell and tried to immolate himself. Noticing smoke coming out of the cell, guards raised an alarm. Officers immediately rushed to the spot and took him to the hospital on the premises, said an officer. Barui sustained burns on his arms.        
	According to jail officers, Barui is suffering from depression. Considering his mental state, we have kept him at the hospital. Two guards have been keeping a tab on him round the clock, added the officer.        
	An inquiry was ordered to ascertain how he managed to get a matchbox. It was a planned act. Over the past few months, he had been showing signs of severe depression, said the officer.         
	Sajal was a minor when he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1993. In September 2001, he fled a hospital after offering two of his guards beer spiked with sleeping pills. He was arrested in Midnapore in 2003.        
	From posing as a CBI official to blackmailing youths, Sajal Barui was involved in a series of crimes between 2001 and 2003, said another officer.        
	On November 22, 1993, Sajal, who was 16 then, and five of his friends murdered his father, stepmother and stepbrother.         
	Sajal and his accomplices first tried to murder the three by strangling them but only his stepmother succumbed. The youngsters then hacked and stabbed Sajals father and stepbrother to death. On Sajals directions, his friends then tied him to a chair to give the impression that he was a victim too, said an officer.

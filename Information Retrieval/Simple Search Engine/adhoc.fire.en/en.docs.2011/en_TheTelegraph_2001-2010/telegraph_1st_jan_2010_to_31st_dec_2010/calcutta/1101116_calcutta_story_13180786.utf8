	Regarding the report Airport agony for dead amp; living, November 8, I have only one thing to say: the people of Calcutta have stopped being surprised at any such shocking and horrifying incident  of course, if it does not affect them personally. What is the use, what else can we expect from a non-performing government, a rotten and cancerous authority, corrupt system, non-existent values?             
	The lust to cling on to their seats of power has made them mere puppets in the hands of their creation  Citu, the Frankenstein.           
	Santwana Chatterjee,           
	Lake Gardens                     
	It gives me so much pain and agony to read about Rafiquls ordeal at our city airport. India is supposed to be a country of great culture, bonding and family values. Is this what has been taught to the people at the airport? My heart cries to see the suffering and the harassment Rafiqul had to go through. The moniker City of Joy is no longer applicable to Calcutta.

	This is the system in India and it is a shame for every Indian that such nonsense is allowed to go on. The airport authorities must be blamed.           
	Syed Md Alamgir,           
	Elliot Road                     
	Your report on the plight of a Bangladeshi schoolteacher at the Calcutta airport is appalling and distressing to say the least. His ordeal at the hands of the airport officials has put to abject shame whatever little hospitality Calcutta and its residents were once noted for. The incident should be condemned in the strongest terms possible.           
	It is a terminally-ill airport that actually is a reflection of affairs in a terminally-ill state. Who is not to be blamed for this incident? Everyone  right from the administration to the lowest of the touts who run the airport  is in some way or the other responsible. Corruption is there at other airports as well but what is lacking in Calcutta is the service mentality. The sheer apathy of the people who work here is amazing. A mere expansion of the physical infrastructure at the airport is not going to achieve the desired modernisation. What it demands is a whole-hearted turnaround of the mindset of the officials and the functioning of the system under which they operate. Otherwise, such regrettable incidents will keep happening.

	This is a horrific display of inhumanity at an extreme level. This demonstrates the complete absence of accountability among the airport staff.

	Whatever happened to Rafiqul Islam at the Calcutta airport is no less than a nightmare. The airport authority is clearly responsible for his ordeal. This incident shows how rampant the corruption and callousness at the airport is. Even a Group D employee, who brought the wheelchair after Rafiqul deposited Rs 450 at the Air India counter, demanded Rs 100 extra for his services. I think these errant officials must be brought to book.... Thanks to Metro for running a campaign for the city to have a better airport.           
	Atif Ayaz,           
	Serampore, Hooghly                     
	I was shocked and aghast to read the report. Is this how cultured Bengal shows solidarity towards its guests? I dont know whom to blame  the airport authorities, the airlines officials or the police. I just cant imagine what Rafiqul Islam must have gone through.           
	Chandni Basu,           
	Freiburg, Germany                     
	I was in dismay reading about the ordeal that Rafiqul went through at the city airport. It is shocking that such an inhuman act can happen in Calcutta!           
	I blame the Air India employees for causing Rafiqul so much pain. A guest accompanying a patient should be given special attention. Instead they refused even the minimum help to the man in distress. Next I blame the airport director, R. Srinivasan. I wonder if he is aware of what goes on at the airport in the name of passenger service and management!           
	The Government of India should investigate the incident and punish those responsible for Rafiquls suffering.           
	Sunil Roy,           
	Address not given                     
	This is the ultimate shame for the employees of Calcutta airport. There should not be any kind of mercy for them. I am feeling very sorry for Rafiqul and will pray for the punishment of those people who do not know the meaning of the words responsibility and humanity. This is utterly inhuman. If I had the power, I would have laid off all the employees of Calcutta airport  for good.           
	Paramita Roy,           
	Alberta, Canada                     
	The airport authorities are to be blamed for such a shameful act and that too when the worlds eyes were on India, thanks to the US Presidents visit. Had it been a VIP instead of Rafiqul, I am sure the rules would have been different. Stern and strict action must be taken by the DGCA under which the aerodrome functions and at least an apology letter must be sent to Rafiqul and his family.           
	Rakesh Bhatia,           
	Loudon Street                     
	The trauma that Rafiqul faced at the Calcutta airport is indicative of the steady erosion of social values in Bengal. Isnt it strange that not a single airport official came forward to help him? No doctor was available to help complete the formalities for the post-mortem. Rafiqul even had to grease the palm of a Group D employee for a wheelchair! Such inhuman acts tarnish the image of the nation. Based on the Metro report, the civil aviation ministry should identify those officials responsible for the harassment suffered by Rafiqul and order disciplinary proceedings. The callousness of the airport director is responsible for the state of affairs at the airport. He is accountable for such a mess.

	 feel nobody can answer the question, why Calcutta airport is such a mess. It seems moving out of the mess takes more time than boarding the bus after ones flight touches down. The chaos and turmoil that I saw last month in and around the airport left me disappointed. Hope we get the old charm back soon.             
	Dinesh Sharma,           
	Beleghata                     
	Calcutta airport is a shame not only for West Bengal, but also for the entire country. If this is a metro city, then the people who have allowed it to become like this should not be in power anymore.           
	I have seen vomit in the wash basins, dirty toilets and Citu workers hanging around to make a fast buck. If this is called unionism, well, it is nothing better than barbarism.           
	While the rest of India is improving, Bengal is deteriorating. No wonder the airport in Calcutta cuts such a sorry figure. Here, people are only busy with Citu, Mamata, Buddha and Biman Bose politics.           
	A.B. Anand,           
	Address not given                     
	On a recent trip from the airport to my south Calcutta home, I had a bad experience. It was 5.30pm. Coming out of the terminal I negotiated with a taxi driver and settled at Rs 300. This was on the condition that he would take one more passenger.           
	However, the driver came back with two passengers. Then he turned the taxi towards Howrah station. I told him to drop me off first, but he didnt listen. He dropped off the passengers at Howrah and then took me to my destination.           
	It is a pity that Calcutta is infested with such people and the government does nothing to stop this. Its good to see Metro taking up the cause, something the ministers of the state should have done much earlier.           
	Ekta Singhvi,           
	Address not given                     
	It is the attitude of the passengers that makes all the difference between Calcutta and Mumbai or for that matter other cities, not only in terms of the airport, but also for other civic facilities. Why do we call it a City Of Joy? I doubt if it is a metro city in the true sense of the term.

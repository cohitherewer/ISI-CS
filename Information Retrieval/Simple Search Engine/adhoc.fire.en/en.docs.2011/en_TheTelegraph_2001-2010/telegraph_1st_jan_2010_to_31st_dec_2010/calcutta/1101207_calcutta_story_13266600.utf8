  - Rain effect on weather          A STAFF REPORTER                          A woman caught in the drizzle on Monday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                        
	An unusual December drizzle and an overcast sky have triggered a weather anomaly in which days are cooler than normal and the evenings warmer than they should be for this time of the year.        
	Mondays Jekyll-and-Hyde Celsius readings  a maximum temperature of 22.8 degrees, five points below normal, and a minimum of 19.8 degrees, five notches above normal  could be the trend for at least another three days, the weatherman said.        
	So while scattered rain could keep the maximum temperature down to well below normal, cloud-filled skies are set to obstruct the flow of the North Wind that makes December evenings much cooler than they are now.        
	There is definitely a change in pattern because of the sudden cloud formation. With more rain and cloudy days being forecast for the first half of this week, the city will experience the opposite of what the weather should be, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.        
	The cloud cover over the city is being attributed to low-pressure formations over the Bay of Bengal.        
	Two factors are adding to the moisture content in the atmosphere over south Bengal. A low-pressure area off the Tamil Nadu coast and a low-pressure trough originating from the region, ending in the northern part of the Bay, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Debnath said the high humidity  Monday recorded a minimum of 67 per cent, against the normal of 40 per cent or lower during early December  was also responsible for the relatively warmer evening.        
	Under the combined influence of the two formations, the cloudy days and the spells of light to moderate rainfall are here to stay for at least another two to three days. The conditions are unlikely to change before the weekend, he said.        
	Till Thursday, maximum temperatures are expected to stay about five degrees below normal, which means a cold morning and afternoon. But Calcuttans hoping to don the woollens in the evening could be disappointed because the cloud cover will keep the chill factor at bay.        
	The North Wind had been blocked out by a cloud cover for nearly the whole of November, resulting in higher than normal temperatures for 26 out of the 30 days in the month.        
	Winter is also likely to be delayed this year.

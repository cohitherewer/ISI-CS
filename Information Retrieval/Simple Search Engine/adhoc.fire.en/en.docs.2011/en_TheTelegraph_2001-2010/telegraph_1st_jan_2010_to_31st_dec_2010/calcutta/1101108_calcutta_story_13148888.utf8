          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A couple and one of their relatives fought in the open with some youths in Phoolbagan after one of them allegedly teased the woman around Saturday midnight.        
	Two youths have been arrested while police are looking for two others. All four, residents of a Narkeldanga slum, have been named in the FIR by the 25-year-old woman.        
	Smita (name changed) and her husband had gone to her maternal uncles home on Narkeldanga Main Road on Saturday evening.         
	The couple left minutes after midnight, with Smitas elder brother accompanying them to the road in front of the house to see them off.        
	The couple were about to hire an autorickshaw on their way home to Kasba when some youths sitting nearby passed lewd comments at the woman, said an officer of Phoolbagan police station.        
	A second round of abuses confronted the couple when Smitas brother protested at the youths behaviour.         
	Soon both sides came to blows, with Smita alleging that some of the youths had tugged at her dupatta during the melee.        
	When we reached the spot, both sides were throwing stones at each other. Fortunately, there was no major injury. Two persons who were injured in their ankles were treated at NRS Medical College and Hospital and released, added the officer.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division), Pallav Kanti Ghosh, said a case of teasing and another of rioting had been registered following the victims complaint. Two persons have been arrested for teasing. We are looking for some more accused.        
	The arrested duo  booked under IPC Section 354 (outrage of modesty)  have been identified as Rajesh Mandal, 25, and Bablu Pal, 22.        
	nBurglary: Burglars broke into the house of a trader at Ghola, on the northern fringes, late on Saturday and decamped with cash and jewellery worth nearly Rs 1lakh. Police said the traders family was not home.

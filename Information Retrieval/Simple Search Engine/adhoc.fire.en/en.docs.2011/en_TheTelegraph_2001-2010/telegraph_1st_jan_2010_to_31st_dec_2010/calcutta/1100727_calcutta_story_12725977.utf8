The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Finger at cops for smoke ban flop
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Finger at cops for smoke ban flop
          RITH BASU                                      
	Smoking in public places has been banned across the country since October 2008 but Calcutta police seem in no hurry to book the violators.        
	An NGO, which is part of the government task force for the implementation of the ban, last week wrote to home secretary Samar Ghosh voicing its displeasure over the cops approach.        
	In order to restrict the rampant use of tobacco, it is crucial that all the relevant provisions of this public health law are enforced in its true spirit, the letter says.         
	The officers-in-charge of the 48 police stations in the city and other senior officers had been briefed about the law and explained the process of fining violators at two workshops conducted by Calcutta police and the NGO at Lalbazar on May 8 and 15.        
	At the workshops, they had decided to start visiting public places from June 5 and fine the violators. It is frustrating that even 50 days after the deadline, the first fine is yet to be slapped, said Sutapa Biswas, the executive director of Cancer Foundation of India, the NGO.        
	Challans, to be issued against the fines, had been distributed at the workshops in the presence of health department officials, Biswas added.        
	Policemen are not the only ones who can slap the Rs 200 fine for violation of the smoking ban. Gazetted government officers, hospital superintendents and directors, managers of hotels and restaurants, administrative heads of offices and postmasters can also collect the fine but the NGO believes that police inaction would rob others of the urge to crack down on violators.        
	Smoking has been banned at railway stations, bus stops, airports, public vehicles including autorickshaws, common areas of housing complexes, eateries and offices.        
	Bengals infamous red tape has almost stalled the implementation of the ban. It took months to create an account under the finance department where the fines would be deposited. The health department then took a long time to circulate the challans to other departments like panchayat, transport, information and culture and tourism and the railway divisions.        
	The law desperately needs an enforcer, a senior health department official said, echoing the NGO. The infrastructure is ready. As soon as the police begin the crackdown, the other departments will follow suit.        
	That might not be soon because with the transfer of the former additional commissioner of police, K. Harirajan, who was heading Calcutta polices tobacco ban implementation initiative, no one seems to know who is in charge of the project.         
	Biswas was told by the police commissioners office last week that additional commissioner Banibrata Basu had been handed over the responsibility. But when Metro called up Basu, he said he was not involved in the matter.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Three in fake note net
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Topsia resident was arrested after he allegedly tried to deposit Rs 9,000 in fake notes in the Syed Amir Ali Avenue branch of Allahabad Bank on Monday. Another man and a woman were later arrested in this connection.        
	Ershad Alam, 32, who works in a leather shop at Topsia, told police that he had got the notes from Faiyaz Alam, to whom he had sold a plot of land.        
	Ershad had given the cashier 98 notes of Rs 500 denomination. While counting the money, a bank official became suspicious about some of the notes. Eighteen of the notes were found to be forged, said an investigator.        
	Based on Ershads statement, Faiyaz, 42, was picked up from his Beniapukur home.        
	Faiyaz claimed his girlfriend Yasmeen Khatoon, 20, had given him the notes.         
	After her arrest, Yasmeen gave us the name of a man named Mushtaque who lives in Entally. He is in Bangalore. We are yet to verify her statement, added an officer.

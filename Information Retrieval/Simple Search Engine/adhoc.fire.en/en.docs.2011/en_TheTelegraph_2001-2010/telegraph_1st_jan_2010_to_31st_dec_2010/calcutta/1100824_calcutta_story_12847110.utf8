  Ballygunge shock of body in balcony
  - Stockbroker found hanging      A STAFF REPORTER                          The balcony at 29/9 Ballygunge Park where Ashok Singhi was found hanging by a clothesline from the ceiling                                               
	Morning walkers in south Calcuttas posh Ballygunge neighbourhood were jolted by the sight of a man hanging by a rope on the first-floor balcony of a highrise on Monday.        
	Ashok Singhi, a 46-year-old stockbroker who had apparently fallen on bad times, is thought to have committed suicide between Sunday night and Monday morning even as his wife, children and parents were asleep in their 2,500sq ft flat at 29/9 Ballygunge Park Road.        
	Family sources said Ashoks wife Preeti was the first to spot the body after waking up to find that he was not in bed. Neighbours woken up by the commotion, however, insisted that the Singhis were unaware of the incident until morning walkers alerted the apartment blocks guard.        
	Ashok was brought down and rushed to Repose Nursing Home on Broad Street, where doctors declared him dead.        
	He had dinner with us, watched television and went to sleep around 11.30pm. He was depressed after losing money in the share market but we had no clue he was planning to do something like this, cried father J.P. Singhi, seated on a sofa with his hands clasping his face.        
	Ashok, the younger of J.P. Singhis two sons, had opened a travel agency in Dalhousie early this year but the financial losses suffered during his days as a sub-broker weighed him down, a relative said.        
	Ashok and Preeti have two sons, aged 15 and 10.        
	A resident of the apartment block said almost everyone in the building knew about the familys cash crunch. They are even having difficulty paying the monthly maintenance charges on time, he added.        
	Two years ago, Ashok had allegedly left home to escape being hounded by people from whom he had borrowed money. His elder brother, who shares the Ballygunge flat, has a separate business. Sources said the siblings lived under the same roof but didnt interfere in each others financial dealings.        
	Police said the available evidence and the statements of family members suggested that Ashok committed suicide out of frustration over financial problems.        
	We have found no hint of foul play so far. It seems he climbed a chair and used a clothesline to hang himself from a fan hook on the ceiling after midnight on Sunday. But he didnt leave a suicide note. We can confirm if it was a suicide after getting the post-mortem report, said an officer at Karaya police station.        
	Sources said Ashok had hoped his travel agency would bail him out but the business didnt take off. The Dalhousie shop was for booking airline and railway tickets online against a small service fee.        
	Earlier, he would greet me whenever we met at the lift or on the ground floor. But I dont remember him even smiling back over the past few months. He had stopped mixing with other residents, said Rina Khanna, a neighbour.

	A man pretending to be a cop with a toy gun and a wireless set was caught while trying to collect a fine from two men on Belghoria Expressway, near Rajabagan, on Friday evening.         
	Bhaskar Roy and Kaushik Ganguly, employees of a Rajarhat firm, had stopped by the side of the highway to relieve themselves while on the way to Dankuni.         
	Sandipan Banerjee allegedly accosted the two and demanded that they pay a fine for standing on the highway, claiming to be an SI.         
	He was wearing a white shirt, khaki trousers and boots and carrying a toy gun and a wireless set.        
	The duo refused to pay and offered to accompany Banerjee to a police station. While the three were talking, some officers from Belghoria police station arrived at the spot.        
	When the cops asked Banerjee to accompany them to the police station, he tried to flee. Roy chased him on his bike with an officer riding pillion. Banerjee was soon caught and arrested.

          Todays question: Which four footballers from the Fifa World Cup 2010 squads would you love to have in your favourite club team in Calcutta and why?                                        
	

SHANKHA SHUVRO, 
  Dhakuria         
	Calcutta football lost its attraction before I was born. But in deference to tradition I would take Mohun Bagan as my team. If Lionel Messi of Argentina is there along with Barreto, then it surely will be a good match! Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese captain, is an asset for every team. Brazils Kaka will control the midfield  be it against East Bengal or teams from outside India. Spains Iker Casillas will be the wall guarding the goal.              
	

Souvik Das,
  Beleghata        
	My dream Mohun Bagan squad would have Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Wayne Rooney and Kaka.               
	

SoMa Dutta gupta,
  Singapore        
	My picks would be Messi for creating chances, Mueller for conversions, Schweinsteiger for his all-round game and Robben for creating havoc.              
	

Rajarshi Ghosh, 
  Surya Nagar        
	The first player I would love to have in my East Bengal team is Gianluigi Buffon of Italy. We had conceded more than 30 goals in the recently concluded I-League. If we have Buffon at the goal then we will not concede goals after taking a lead like last year. In defence I want Philipp Lahm of Germany. Last year, our defence line was average but with the presence of Lahm, we will be strong. Next should be Lionel Messi. He is a match-winner in every sense  dribbling, finishing and creative inspiration. Finally, without Kaka, East Bengal team cannot be complete.               
	

Pratyay Banerjee, 
  Tollygunge        
	My favourite club is East Bengal, and the four players I would love to have in my club team are as follows:       
	1. Frank Lampard  If you have a midfielder scoring 20 goals a season for your team (not counting the numerous assists he gives), then your team is bound to succeed.      
	2. Joe Hart  Every good team needs a great goalie, and am confident that this youngster will rule for The Three Lions in years to come.      
	3. Thiago Silva  This AC Milan centre-back is a world-class talent.      
	4. Sergio Aguero  A true successor of Maradona and Messi. Poised for a big summer move away from Atletico Madrid. A top club will be the perfect stage for him.               
	

P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake        
	English soccer legend and 1966 World Cup winner Bobby Charlton once said: Some people tell me that we professional players are soccer slaves. Well, if this is slavery, give me a life sentence. Though he is not playing this year, Im hooked to Zidane because its impossible to be oblivious of the head butt witnessed in the last World Cup. The next player I would like to represent my club team is the magical Messi of Argentina using his footsteps with fabulous quirks to get past any defender. I would then go for Wayne Rooney because he is virtually unstoppable. Kaka is my next favourite.              
	

Biplab Bhowmick,
  Baruipur         
	I want Messi of Argentina, Xavi of Spain, Robinho of Brazil and Cannavaro of Italy in my favourite club Mohun Bagan. Their dodges, dribbles and skill will help Bagan touch the sky.              
	

ATIF AYAZ,
  Serampore        
	It will be a dream come true if I get some of my favourite footballers for Mohun Bagan club. I being an Argentina supporter, star striker Lionel Messi is a sure pick. I would also want Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, Miroslav Klose of Germany and the least charismatic Kaka of Brazil.                 aydip Bhattacharya,
  Ichhapore         
	My favourite team is Mohun Bagan and I would like to have Nigel de Jong of Holland to make the defensive screen more steady, his teammate Arjen Robben for quality, Landon Donovan of usa because of his speed and skill and Fernando Torres of Spain.        
	

Sourav sengupta,
  Address not mentioned         
	I want Lionel Messi, David Villa, Carlos Tevez and Iniesta for my East Bengal.                 Urmish Basu,
  Address not mentioned         
	Having Casillas in the goal, Cannavaro defending and Fabregas in the middle passing balls to David Villa will make a perfect team for Mohun Bagan.              
	

Pramit Maity,
  Girish Park        
	I am a die hard fan of Mohun Bagan. I would make Cristiano Ronaldo captain of our club. Then I will take Kaka and Robinho so that while plays in the midfield the other can take the responsibility of a striker. The fourth man will be Julio Cesar.               
	

B.N. BOSE,
  Dum Dum Park        
	I would like Lionel Messi in East Bengal since he is energetic and tactful. I would also like Wayne Rooney for his skill, speed and strength to boost the morale. My other choices are Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka.               
	

PARANJOY DEB,
  Ballygunge        
	I would love to have the following four players in Mohun Bagan: Gianluigi Buffon, because he is the latest in a long and distinguished line of gifted Italian goalkeepers and we lack good goalies here. Robinho has great speed and can dribble magically. Diego Milito has won the Champions League for Inter Milan. Gabriel Heinze provides rock-solid defence.

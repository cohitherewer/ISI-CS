	Three friends from Rajabazar who were holidaying in Digha drowned in the sea on Saturday afternoon. Their bodies were found near the shore in Old Digha on Sunday.        
	Md Shamim, 25, Md Ashiq, 30, and Md Amjad, 26, and two others reached Digha on Saturday morning.        
	According to witnesses, Ashiq and Amjad were swept away while trying to save Shamim from drowning. The three were thrown against the boulders near the shore.        
	Shamim was to be married later this month. His elder brother had died in a road accident two years ago, said their 72-year-old father Md Ibrahim.

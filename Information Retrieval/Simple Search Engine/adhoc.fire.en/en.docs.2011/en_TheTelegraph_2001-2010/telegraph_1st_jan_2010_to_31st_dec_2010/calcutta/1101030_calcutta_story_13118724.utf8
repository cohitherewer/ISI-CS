The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Feluda in top gear
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Feluda in top gear
                                          1) Sabyasachi Chakraborty takes a look at the brand new Tata Aria at the The Telegraph Auto Weekend Carnival, which he inaugurated at 22 Camac Street on Friday. I am a Tata Motors loyalist. I have always driven a Tata Sumo, said the actor-cum-wildlife enthusiast.                        
	2) The man who plays Feluda checks out a Skoda Laura. Impressed by the vehicles music system, he said: Next you will have a home theatre inside a car!                    
	3) The sunshine yellow Beetle brought a smile to Chakrabortys face as he gingerly slipped into the drivers seat. This is a car for the connoisseur, he said about one of the eye-catchers at the three-day fair.

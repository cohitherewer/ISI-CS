The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja traffic-stoppers rear head
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puja traffic-stoppers rear head
          RITH BASU                                      
	Is the footpath a part of the road or is it not, thats the question.        
	As the authorities ponder the answer, puja committees have started building road-hog pandals catching Calcuttans at the wheel on the wrong foot.         
	The puja organisers are taking advantage of the confusion among the Calcutta police and the civic authorities regarding the interpretation of the high court orders directing puja committees to leave stipulated road space free while erecting pandals.         
	Many puja organisers are saying that the footpath is a part of the road and it is all right to leave space on the footpath. We have written to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation asking them to clarify whether the road space that is to be left free includes the footpath or not, said the joint commissioner of police, headquarters, Jawed Shamim.         
	We expect a reply from the CMC soon, he added.         
	A senior official of the civic bodys civil department, however, said the CMC was yet to receive any correspondence from the police. Once we receive the letter, we will go through the court order before replying.         
	He said road space generally includes the footpath but could not explain how space left free on the footpath helps vehicular movement.         
	According to a 2004 high court order [W.P. No. 21481(W)] and subsequent orders in 2006 and 2009, at least 4ft has to be left free for roads up to 15ft wide, 6ft for those between 15ft and 30ft wide and 10ft for those over 30ft wide.         
	The law also stipulates that the pandals have to be built maintaining at least 4ft distance with houses or other permanent properties and cannot be taller than 40ft.         
	Metro spotted some pandals that had blocked the entire road with the puja committees interpreting the law to suit their needs.              Shib Mandir Durgotsav     
	Puja: Shib Mandir Durgotsav 
  Age: 74 years 
  Where: Lake Temple Road, near Menoka cinema 
  What we saw: The pandal, comprising three structures, hogs the entire width of the bitumen stretch and part of the footpath on one side, forcing cars to climb the other pavement to cross the stretch. 
  Violation: The road here is about 35ft     Voice: ldquo;This puja has been going on for 74 years and there has never been a problem. We have left 10ft of space on one side of the road, so what, if it rsquo;s on the pavement, rdquo; said puja committee member Laltu   Ghosh.               Badamtala Ashar Sangha      
	Puja: Badamtala Ashar Sangha 
  Age: 72 years 
  Where: Near Rashbehari Avenue 
  What we saw: The pandal cuts off a portion of Nepal Bhattacharya Street, leaving only a 4ft scrap of a passage on one side. The road is 25ft wide and over 20ft of it has been blocked. If a fire breaks out in the buildings whose approach has been blocked by the pandal, fire engines would not be able to reach them. 
  Violation: The width of the road being between 15ft and 30ft, the organisers are required to leave 6ft free on one side and 4ft on the other. 
  Voice: ldquo;The road on which the pandal stands was a ground called Badamtalar Math 25 years ago. So it rsquo;s doubtful if the rules apply here, rdquo; said Sudhir Kumar Dutta, the president of the puja organising committee.               Rupchand Mukherjee Lane Sarbojonin Durgotsav      
	Puja: Rupchand Mukherjee Lane Sarbojonin Durgotsav 
  Age: 64 years 
  Where: Off SP Mukherjee Road near Bhowanipore police station 
  Scene: The entire road is blocked in such a way that not even a motorcycle or bicycle can squeeze through. The footpaths thankfully have been left alone but bamboo sticks have been dumped there. 
  Violation: The road being more than 25ft wide, at least 6ft of it should have been left free on one side and 4ft on the other. 
  Voice: ldquo;We have left about 5ft of footpath free on both sides. That rsquo;s as good as 10ft of road space on one side, rdquo; said organising committee president Sounak Mitra, when asked why 6ft of the carriageway was not left free.

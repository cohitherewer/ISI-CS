The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 1000-strong fake note network
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      1000-strong fake note network
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	About 1,000 Calcuttans have been engaged by fake currency gangs to spread counterfeit notes in the city, according to police.        
	Three arrests on Saturday night put the cops on the trail of this network. Mohammad Sabir Ali and his wife Afsana Begum and Sheikh Faiyaz, who were held while allegedly shopping with fake notes, are all residents of the city. All those arrested earlier in this connection were outsiders visiting the city to hand over consignments of fake notes to designated people.         
	The three are the lowest-level operatives of the network. Earlier, we arrested those who brought fake currency from Bangladesh and Nepal to the city, said Rajeev Kumar, additional commissioner (III) of police, Special Task Force.        
	The couple, who were held in Burrabazar, are the owners of a leather goods shop in Entally. Faiyaz, who was held in the port area, works for an eatery whose owner is also allegedly involved in the racket. He is absconding.

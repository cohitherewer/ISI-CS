The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clash over auto route
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clash over auto route
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	Autorickshaw drivers backed by Trinamul and the CPM blocked the Jadavpur-EM Bypass connector for half an hour on Friday morning after clashing thrice since Thursday over a route dispute.        
	The blockade, which was removed by police, caused severe traffic disruption.        
	The morning after Trinamul trounced the Left in the civic polls, its loyal auto operators on the Bypass-Sanpuipara stretch unilaterally extended their route into a CPM-controlled territory.        
	Sanpuipara is midway between Avishikta housing estate and Jadavpur police station, on the Bypass connector. Citu controls the route between Jadavpur and Sanpuipara, while the rest is dominated by Inttuc. On Thursday morning, Trinamul-backed operators who were to ply between Avishikta and Sanpuipara extended their route by 2km to Jadavpur police station. Waving Trinamul flags they said they would do it regularly, said Arabinda Ghosh, a local Citu leader.        
	The groups clashed twice on Thursday and once on Friday. Two of us were assaulted with chains, said a Inttuc leader Tarun Mondal. Both sides lodged police complaints.

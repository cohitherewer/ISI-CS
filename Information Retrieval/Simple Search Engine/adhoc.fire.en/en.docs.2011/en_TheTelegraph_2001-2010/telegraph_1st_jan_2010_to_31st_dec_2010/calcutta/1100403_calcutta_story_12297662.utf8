The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: a policy for art
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wanted: a policy for art

	Indian artists may be fetching astronomical prices at auctions around the world but what does our art industry look like? Not very pretty, it seems.        
	Poor infrastructure and poorer policies have thrown the Indian art industry into a holy confusion. To address the existing jumble of half-baked rules and archaic regulations, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), in association with Deloitte and Amarchand Mangaldas, has prepared a report, Art Industry in India: Policy Recommendations.        
	Praised by the culture secretary, Jawhar Sircar, as sharp and pointed, the report makes a variety of suggestions. From the framing of a comprehensive national art policy to the proper deployment of human resources to ways of creating an enabling environment for artists, a large ground has been covered. According to Rakhi Sarkar, the chairperson of Ficci Committee on Art and Business of Art, The aim is to address the lack of a holistic urban policy framework.        
	In doing so, the report takes into account global best practices and also advises changes to the existing fiscal structure governing the art industry. Roopen Roy, the managing director of Deloitte and Touche Consulting, said that streamlining the system would benefit all concerned. Even artists would not have to suffer financially due to irregular sales; with an art fund, as with mutual funds, the blow can be softened.        
	Aditya Rao, an associate with Amarchand Mangaldas, added that the issue of obscenity should also be firmly dealt with. Advocacy manuals should be issued through the judiciary so that artists do not fall prey to political vendetta.        
	The focus on the welfare of the artists was also a key concern in Jawhar Sircars address, which touched on the need for visionary changes in art education. Galleries have grown up in garages but Indian art colleges are yet to offer courses in museum and gallery management. With better-informed administrators, the issue of fakes and authentication could also be tackled deftly.         
	The effect of this mismatch is palpable even at the national level. As Ashok Vajpeyi, the chairman of Lalit Kala Akademi, said: National art policy cannot be separated from a national culture policy. The role of the latter, Vajpeyi believes, is to see how public spending in the realm of culture can be directed, not decide what the culture of a country ought to be.        
	Speaking of the trials faced by educators, artist Jogen Chowdhury mentioned how, as principal of Kala Bhavan, Visva-Bharati University, he failed to persuade the UGC to fund the post of a restorer. He described practical problems of storing and transporting art, a theme that was taken up by another artist-administrator, Rajeev Lochan, the director of the National Gallery of Modern Art. Gautam Sengupta, the director of the Archaeological Survey of India, also agreed on the need to upgrade art institutions.

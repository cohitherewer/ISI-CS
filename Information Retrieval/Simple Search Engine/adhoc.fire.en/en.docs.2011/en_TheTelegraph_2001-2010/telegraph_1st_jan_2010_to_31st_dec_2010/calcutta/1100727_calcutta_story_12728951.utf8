                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Teacher sorry for slapping kid
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Mamata Ghosh, the teacher of Kamala Chatterjee School who was arrested on Saturday for beating up a Class I student, on Monday apologised to the girls parents, who withdrew the complaint.        
	Ghosh had allegedly slapped Srija Das for being inattentive in class. Srija fell ill and had to be treated for left-ear pain.        
	We had lodged a complaint against Ghosh. However, when she apologised, we decided to withdraw it, said Payal Das, Srijas mother.        
	On Monday, the school management, including the principal, met teachers and Srijas parents in the presence of a sub-inspector of schools, who criticised Ghosh for her act.        
	The teacher slapped Srija because the girl had forgotten to bring drawing materials to school, her parents had alleged.        
	Srijas father Sabyasachi Das said the girl had been traumatised by the incident and was unwilling to go to school. The blood clot over her left jaw has not dissolved. Doctors have advised her to rest for a couple of days, Das added.

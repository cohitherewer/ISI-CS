                      Nature portraits                    Tasveer and The Seagull Foundation for the Arts in association with Ganjam present Escape, an exhibition of photographs by London-based photographer Tim Hall. An international fine art photographer, Hall gained renown for his stylised, monochromatic portraits of Asian people. His most recent collections feature the people and architecture of India and the untamed landscapes of Morocco and the Sahara Desert. With this show, Hall hopes to encourage the viewer to go beyond the literal image, to reflect upon their place in the universe and to be aware of the creative force of the earth. He feels that we are so engrossed in our lives that there is little or no time for this  these pictures aim to act as a sort of meditation. Now more than ever, nature is increasingly reminding us of its presence and power, says the photographer, (and) I am interested in interpreting this through my photographs.

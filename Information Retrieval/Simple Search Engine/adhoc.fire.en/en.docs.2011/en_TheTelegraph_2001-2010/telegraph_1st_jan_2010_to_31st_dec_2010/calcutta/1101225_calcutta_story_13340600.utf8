The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Foiled by snow? Fall back on sun and sand
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Foiled by snow? Fall back on sun and sand
  - Bangkok fills London gap but tickets scarce          SANJAY MANDAL                          An enchanting beach in Phuket in Bangkok                                        
	Europes pain is Bangkoks gain.        
	The disruption caused by snow in airports across Europe, especially at Londons Heathrow, has forced tourists who were planning a white Christmas to make last-minute holiday diversions to Bangkok and other Southeast Asian destinations.        
	According to airlines operating from Calcutta to Bangkok and other Southeast Asian cities, all flights to the Thai capital are chock-a-block with hardly a seat available till at least the first week of January.         
	I had planned to spend Christmas and New Years Eve in London and had booked tickets accordingly. However, my flight got cancelled and I decided to go to Bangkok instead, said businessman Satyajit Burman.        
	On an average, more than 150 tourists from the city fly to Europe during the Christmas-New Year week but there has been a steep fall in numbers this year.        
	With snow-struck London out of bounds this festive season, what makes Bangkok the most popular alternative?         
	Bangkok is an evergreen tourist destination as far as Calcutta is concerned. At this time of the year, 500 passengers fly to Bangkok every day from here on an average. This year, the number has soared to around 800, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	With Thailand offering Indian visitors visa-on-arrival, it has become easier to fly to Bangkok at short notice. But where do you get a ticket and a confirmed hotel booking at the last minute?        
	Over the past three to four days, we have received more requests for tickets and hotel accommodation in Bangkok, Phuket and other Thai destinations than we can provide, Punjabi said.        
	With demand exceeding supply, fares have shot up too  from an average of Rs 12,000 for a round trip to Rs 20,000-plus.        
	Our flights to Bangkok are going full. No seats are available till the second week of January, said an official of Jet Airways.         
	Air India, which had withdrawn its Calcutta-Bangkok flight around a month ago, is planning to reintroduce it in January. There is a sudden surge in traffic in the Bangkok sector. Passengers who have failed to get tickets from Calcutta are going through Delhi, said an Air India spokesperson.         
	Air Asia, which started its daily Calcutta-Bangkok operations on December 1, has also put up a flight-full board. Traffic to Southeast Asia is usually high at this time of the year, but this season has been unusually busy because of the disruptions in Europe, said an airline official.        
	Where are you going this winter vacation and why?

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench on Monday stayed an order by a trial bench of the court stating that the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) had not followed the law while appointing 52 people three years ago.        
	Trial bench judge Justice D. Kargupta had made the 52 employees parties to the original case. After the division benchs interim order, the appointees would not have to come to court and fight the legal battle to save their jobs.        
	In 2006, the Besu authorities had appointed the employees to non-teaching posts  from sub-assistant engineer to clerk. A physically challenged candidate, Sourav Bhanja, had moved Justice Karguptas court early that year claiming that provisions of the Persons with Disability Act, 1995, were not followed during recruitment.        
	On Monday, the division bench headed by Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay decided to hear Besus appeal against the order and stated that the trial judge would not hear the case till the appeal was disposed of.        
	The order has come as a relief to the university, said the Besu lawyer.        
	On February 26 last year, Justice Kargupta had appointed a special officer to verify the recruitment process.        
	On the basis of the report filed by the special officer, Justice Kargupta in February this year passed the interim order stating that the process adopted by the university while recruiting for the 52 posts was not transparent.

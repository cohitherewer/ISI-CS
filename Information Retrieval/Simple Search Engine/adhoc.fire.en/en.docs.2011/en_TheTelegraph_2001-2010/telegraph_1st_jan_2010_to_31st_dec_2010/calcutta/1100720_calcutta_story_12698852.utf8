The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayor scraps borough scheme
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayor scraps borough scheme
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                     
	The Trinamul Congress civic board has decided to scrap former mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharayyas scheme to empower the boroughs by allotting Rs 25 crore to each. This is the first project of the previous board that the new one has dumped.         
	We are scrapping the scheme because it doesnt make sense. Without delegation of administrative powers to the boroughs, decentralisation of funds is meaningless. If the CPM was so interested in decentralisation, why didnt it do so in the past 20 years, asked mayor Sovan Chatterjee.        
	There are 15 boroughs in the city, each headed by an elected chairman. The number of wards in each borough varies between eight and 10.         
	Bhattacharyya had decided to prepare 15 separate budgets for the boroughs and a central civic budget for 2010-11. The former mayor had earmarked Rs 25 crore for each borough to carry out development work.         
	Under the CMC Act, a borough executive engineer is empowered to clear expenditure of up to Rs 1 lakh. For any expenditure above that, he needs a sanction from the civic headquarters, said an officer in the accounts section of the civic body.         
	There is a provision in the Borough Committee Regulation, 1987, to empower the boroughs by allowing them more administrative and financial freedom, but it has never been done.         
	According to the accounts department officer, the practice is to draw up a central budget for the Calcutta proper area (boroughs I to X) and three separate budgets for the added areas of Behala (boroughs XI and XII), Jadavpur (boroughs XIII and XIV) and Garden Reach (borough XV).         
	The last board deviated from the practice only to inconvenience the next board. The entire administrative process would have come to a deadlock and thats why we are forced to scrap it, said Chatterjee.

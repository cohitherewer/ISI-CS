The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HIV tag was a mistake
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HIV tag was a mistake
  - Woman accuses hospital of goof-up during pregnancy          OUR BUREAU                                    
	The School of Tropical Medicine wrongly diagnosed a pregnant woman as an HIV carrier and took 10 months to realise the mistake, the patient all the while suffering ostracism and exposure to drugs that can cause lethal complications.        
	Serampore resident Batasi Biswas, 24, who was shattered to know that she was carrying the AIDS virus, alleged that the STM authorities had forcibly taken away all her medical records when she went to file a complaint.        
	An NGO on Thursday helped her lodge a complaint.        
	STM director Krishnangshu Roy said: A three-member team is probing the complaint and will submit a report within seven days.        
	Doctors at Walsh Hospital in Serampore referred Batasi to STM for some routine tests during her pregnancy in December 2008.        
	Along with several blood tests, the hospital also conducted Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay or Elisa, a biochemical procedure that detects an antibody or antigen in a sample. The first two tests in early 2009 were negative. But after the third test in April 2009, the doctors at STM called me and said I was suffering from HIV infection. I was shattered, Batasi recalled.        
	The homemaker was almost shunned as the news spread. Even my husband and other family members kept a distance though I was in an advanced stage of pregnancy, Batasi said.        
	She was admitted to the Eden ward of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital on May 1, 2009. Based on the STM reports, doctors there administered Nevirapine drugs to keep her infection under check.        
	Nevirapine, if given to someone not suffering from HIV infection, can cause serious complications. It can damage the liver and cause skin rashes and infections that at times can be life-threatening, pointed out Nalin Nag, a consultant physician at Apollo Hospital, Delhi.        
	I was given the medicine from May 1 to 19. My son was born on May 17, Batasi said. She returned home and in December 2009, underwent another Elisa test at STM.        
	Doctors told me my condition was better but I was still suffering from the infection. After the last test in February 2010, they revealed that I had never suffered from HIV infection. We were stunned. When we wanted to lodge a complaint, the doctors forcibly took away all my medical reports, she said.

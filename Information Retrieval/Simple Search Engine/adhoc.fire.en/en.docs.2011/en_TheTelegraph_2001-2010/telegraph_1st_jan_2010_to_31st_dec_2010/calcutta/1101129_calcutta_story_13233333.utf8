  - Lack of inspiration blamed for old faithful switching to rival camp          MOHUA DAS                           Actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty addresses Sundays rally from an almost empty dais. (Aranya Sen)                                        
	The Left Fronts long relationship with the culture club has gone cold with empty chairs turning Sundays reach-out rally for artistes and authors into a damp squib.        
	Ten years ago, such rallies used to be a celebration because people werent getting killed and there were fewer incidents of terrorism and scams. Today people are scared, they have either run away or are sitting on the fence, said actor Sabyasachi Feluda Chakraborty, one of the few famous faces to have turned up on the fifth day of the Left Fronts serial rallies.        
	Poet and author Jiad Ali said the sparse attendance was in stark contrast to the era when even stalwarts like Sambhu Mitra, Salil Chowdhury, Hemanta Mukhopadhyay and Mrinal Sen would rarely miss a CPM-organised culture congregation.         
	 Now theres a feeling of alienation. I have seen a lot of these rallies in the past two or three decades, but the gathering today is small because nobody wants to be exposed as an active supporter of Left-wing culture. Theres no inspiration. The charm of the Left cultural movement is dead, he rued.         
	As Chakraborty and Ali tried to explain the empty chairs, their disappointment at a Left fief being eroded found an echo in the eloquent silence of the rest of Bengals disgruntled culture clan.         
	Programmes organised by Mamata Banerjee, be it a rally or a festive get-together, now draw the A-list of Tollywood as well as poets, singers and other artistes, many of whom were previously regulars at Left-organised events.                          
	Although the organisers of Sundays rally stuck to the tradition of gana sangeet, folk art and dance, the 2,000-strong audience was nowhere near what used to be the turnout at such events.         
	The list of absentees included Tarun Majumdar, Raja Sen, Goutam Ghose, Sova Sen, Arindam Sil, Badshah Moitra, Abul Basar, Debesh Roy, Meghnad Bhattacharya and Ashoke Mukhopadhyay. Those spotted on the dais included actors Paran Bandopadhyay and Chandan Sen, and academician Pabitra Sarkar.         
	A lack of ideals or a problem in execution has led to this, said comedian Paran.         
	But why such disillusionment with the Left Front that gave it freedom from the dark days of the 70s? Favouritism pushed a large section away and when they found an option in Mamata, they embraced it, said a theatre actor.

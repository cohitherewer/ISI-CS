                      Sketches that speak        Writing is a symbolic expression through words that make up language while drawing is a structural expression of perception appearing in the form of motifs used almost like visual alphabets. When these two are creatively put together, they create a sense of language, more essentially, a visual language. The whole idea of Writing Visuals, the ongoing group show, is to present the act of drawing as a form of language. The show attempts to present a sensibility that quintessentially centres around drawing. Many of the visuals in this show are translations of drawings into material. The works indicate scripts, texts, narration and much more, and an emergence of the images from the extensive practice of writing. The exhibition also attempts to establish the relationship between writing and drawing. In some works, the journey has been from visuals to alphabet while in others it has been the other way round. Its showcases painting, relief (sculptural) works that retain the elements of drawing to a great extent. The drawing here resembles a painting or a sculpture, but essentially remains a drawing. Participants: Vivan Sundaram, Jogen Chowdhury, Partha Pratim Deb, Kishore Chatterjee, Jayashree Chakraborty (a drawing by her appears here), Samir Roy, N.N. Rimzon, Dilip Ranade, Alex Matthew, Sudhir Patwardhan, Mithu Sen, Adip Dutta, Debnath Basu, Paula Sengupta and Manisha Parekh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bill for corporation drainage tax
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bill for corporation drainage tax
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government wants to empower the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to impose a drainage development fee on new buildings.         
	The government will introduce a bill to that effect in the Assembly this week.        
	The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (amendment) Bill says every person who intends to erect a building shall apply for sanction together with such fees, including drainage development fee.         
	The bill also seeks to empower the CMC to assess and recover suo motu property tax of the premises whose owners have not submitted returns within the deadline. Mandatory disclosure of the financial transactions of the civic body is another highlight of the bill.        
	The government will also table the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (amendment) Bill, which seeks to levy tax on commercial advertisements in the upcoming Rajarhat township. The proceeds will be spent on infrastructure development.        
	The bill, however, exempts political parties and their mass organisations from paying the tax for their non-commercial advertisements. They will also not have to seek the civic bodys permission for putting up such advertisements. Written consent letters from the owners will do.        
	Though the Rajarhat township is yet to be covered by any formal municipal body, the bill empowers the New Town Kolkata Development Authority to collect the tax.        
	JU election: The students union election at Jadavpur Universitys arts faculty was held on Tuesday. The turnout was good. Last year, our winning margin fell because many people did not vote, said a supporter of the Faculty of Arts Student. The association had won the past three polls in the faculty.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta will soon have a number of clinics that will bail out business houses in crisis.        
	The Indian Chamber of Commerce, which has already opened two such clinics, will set up some more to help business houses tide over their problems without hiring consultants.        
	The idea is to create a platform where people from industry can interact with each other and learn best practices, said ICC president Jayanta Roy.        
	Just as a clinic has specialist doctors, the ones being set up by the ICC will have experts in various fields. A leading company will act as knowledge partner for each clinic.        
	ICCs first clinic, on International Financial Reporting Standards, was launched in July. It was partnered by KPMG.        
	The second clinic was on human resource, which was launched on Wednesday by Subesh Das, the principal secretary to the chief minister. Ernst amp; Young representatives are the specialists at the human resource clinic.        
	The Indian economy is growing and it needs proper HR strategies. The small and medium enterprises that comprise a large chunk of our economy can hardly afford to hire Ernst amp; Young for consultation. The clinic will be a boon for them, said Roy.        
	Sessions at the clinics will be held on designated days. Companies can write to the ICC explaining their problems, which will be discussed in the following session. The company representatives will also be able to interact with the experts after each session.        
	We plan to hold the HR clinic once every alternate month, said Bhaswar Sarkar, partner-assurance, Ernst amp; Young.        
	The ICC is in the process of launching two more clinics, on information technology in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers and on tax in association with Deloitte as the knowledge partner.        
	We as a chamber need to facilitate the growth of the economy and we can only do that by providing companies opportunities like this, said Roy.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Water fell on chemicals kept outside the Asutosh College chemistry lecture theatre, generating smoke and sparking a fire scare, on Monday, the last day of Puja vacation.        
	The lecture theatre is being renovated. Hence, the chemicals that are stored in a cupboard inside the lecture theatre had been kept in the open outside it, said Dipak Kar, the principal.        
	Kalyan Bakshi, the chemistry department head, was present when water fell on the chemicals. He alerted the fire brigade.        
	A fireman fell ill after inhaling the smoke emanating from the chemicals.        
	Firemen alleged firefighting measures were not in place. But Kar said there were enough fire extinguishers.        
	Two chemistry laboratories in Presidency University were recently gutted in a blaze.

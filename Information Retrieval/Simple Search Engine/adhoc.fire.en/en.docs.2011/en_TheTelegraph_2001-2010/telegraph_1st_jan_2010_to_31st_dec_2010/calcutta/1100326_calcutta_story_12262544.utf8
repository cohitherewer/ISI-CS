The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Politics of a building blaze   United over rule-flout market
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Politics of a building blaze     United over rule-flout market

	Politicians love to protect the citys unsafe structures and the 11-storeyed Nandram market in Burrabazar, where a blaze had raged for 100 hours two years ago, is a classic example.         
	Twenty-three years have passed since the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the structure above the sixth floor, but it was business as usual when Metro visited the market on Thursday.         
	After the apex court order, the building, which used to tower 23 floors in mid-1980s, was pruned to 13 floors.        
	The top two floors of the market, one of the main trading centres in readymade garments and accessories in eastern India, were gutted in the January 2008 fire.         
	The civic body cleared the debris from the 12th and 13th floors and demolished the unsafe parts. Now, the building is structurally stable and we have resumed normal business activities, said a readymade garment trader at Nandram who refused to be identified.         
	The man in his 30s is aware of the Supreme Court order and of the civic bodys threat to implement it over the past two years. But he was confident that the top five floors of the building would remain intact.        
	The five floors are out of bounds since the fire. Over 2,000 occupy the floors below.        
	We have the support of all the political parties. The threat of demolishing the top part is not real. In fact, we are planning to rebuild the top floors, said the trader before getting busy with customers.         
	He is not bluffing. Mamata Banerjee has opposed the demolition of the top floors and promised help in the markets reconstruction.         
	Though the CPMs official line is that the five floors should be demolished, party sources told Metro that local leaders covertly tried to sabotage demolition attempts.        
	Sudhanshu Sil, former CPM parliamentarian from the area, had even tried to arbitrate between the civic body and the traders over the issue.         
	According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) records, demolition squads visited the building at least eight times in the past two years.         
	Each time, we had to come back following resistance from traders and local political leaders. At times, we did not even get proper police protection and so it was not possible for us to demolish the top floors, said a senior CMC official, explaining how politicians of all hues colluded with the traders to prevent demolition of the building.         
	As the civic body has declared Nandram market unsafe, it does not have power or water supply. For 26 months, the traders have been dependent on soundless generators to light up their stores.                     
	We source water from neighbouring buildings. We are trying our best to get the nod for reconstruction of the entire building. Once we get the clearances, all problems would be solved, said a trader.         
	Experts from Jadavpur University do not agree. They had said after a survey that not more than three floors can be added to the legal part of the structure.         
	The political class would love to allow reconstruction of all the floors but are restrained by the fear of incurring the wrath of the Supreme Court by violating the 1987 order.         
	The wish list of the traders does not end with the reconstruction demand.         
	Those who died or were injured in the Readymade Centre fire in Sodepur were compensated. But the traders of Nandram market did not get anything other than highhandedness from the authorities. We want compensation, said Pawan Bansal, a tarpaulin trader on the fourth floor of Nandram market.

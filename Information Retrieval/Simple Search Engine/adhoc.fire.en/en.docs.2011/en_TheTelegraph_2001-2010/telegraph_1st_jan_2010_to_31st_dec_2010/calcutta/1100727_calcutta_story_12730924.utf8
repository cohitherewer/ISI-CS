          VISHNU VARMA                          Winners of the LN Birla debate held at Vidya Mandir on July 10                        
	It was a war of words at the Vidya Mandir auditorium on July 10 as top city schools battled it out in a heated debate at the eastern region finals of the 11th inter-school LN Birla national debate competition, organised by Birla High School (Boys).         
	The topic for the debate, moderated by Sharmila Bose, principal, Birla High School (Girls), was the media is the prime cause of violence in todays society.         
	Two-member teams of eight prominent schools, including St Xaviers Collegiate School, La Martiniere for Boys (LMB), Don Bosco, Park Circus, and Ashok Hall Girls Higher Secondary School made it to the finals. One member of each team spoke for, while the other spoke against the motion.         
	Students who spoke for the motion stressed how morbid photographs in newspapers, television footage and video games tamper with young minds by exposing them to excessive violence.         
	Students speaking against the motion held on to the fact that the media may be a contributory factor to violence, but could not be labelled a prime cause.                  Children of NGO Smile Foundation at Cotton Councils T-shirt designing contest, held at Sabuj Sangha club in Kasba on July 15. They drew pictures of rural landscapes, animals, alpana motifs and even football matches. The contest was judged by fashion designer Pali Sachdev. Picture by Rashbehari Das      
	Siddhant Agarwal of Birla High School (Boys) referred to Vietnamese-American children fathered by US soldiers during the Vietnam war as a reminder of the violence of war.         
	Speaking against the motion, Neha Jain of Birla High School (Girls) said that there is a tendency to blame the media for everything but its positive aspects are not taken into account. The media holds up a mirror to society. It makes us aware of the violence around us, rather than fostering it.        
	Summing up, Bose explained: Child violence existed before the media came into the picture. But remembering the impressionable nature of young minds, the media should not sensationalise news.         
	The debate was interesting right from the preliminary stage. The Birla High girls deserved to win, said Yash Saraf, a Class XI student of LMB.         
	The Birla High (Girls) team, comprising Urmika Sarda and Neha Jain, bagged the winning trophy. Neha was judged the best speaker, winning a cash award of Rs 10,000, books and a gift hamper. Im thrilled. Although we spoke well, we did not expect to win, said Neha.        
	The winning team was also given a cash award of Rs 5,000 and a gift hamper.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Five injured in clash
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Five persons were injured when security guards allegedly fired pellets at labourers at Calcutta West International City in Howrah on Saturday night.         
	According to a police complaint lodged by Abdul Mannan, the labourer in-charge of the site, two drunk security guards molested the wife of a labourer while they were watching television in the quarters of Sheikh Rafiqul, a mason, on Saturday night.        
	The labourers caught the two and beat them up before letting them go. The duo returned with four other guards and allegedly started firing pellets at labourers, injuring five.         
	They spotted me and fired. I slumped to the ground as something hit my legs and blood started oozing out of the wound, said Rafiqul.        
	He and the other four injured labourers were treated at a local healthcare unit.        
	After the news of the firing spread, labourers ransacked the guards office near the entrance to the project.        
	About 250 labourers have been living and working at the 390-acre project site off NH6, which is protected by 150 guards. The guards fled after the incident, said police.

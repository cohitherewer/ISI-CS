										      BRIEF  LIVES                            Catherine and Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P eacute;rigord                           
	Following her separation from George Grand, Catherine moved to Hooghly in 1779, living in a house rented by Francis But soon Francis fell out with Warren Hastings over the conduct of the Maratha campaign, and a legendary duel took place between the two on August 17, 1780, in the Belvedere grounds. Francis was badly injured and left India in December that year. Catherine departed exactly one week later, possibly in the company of Thomas Lewin, a writer with the military department at Fort St George.         
	The couple spent some time travelling in Europe. In Paris she appeared to have hung around with the smart set which included Josephine de Beauharnais, later to become empress. Catherine became the mistress of Lessart, the minister for foreign affairs before the Revolution. But Lessart was killed in the September massacres of 1791 and Catherine fled to England in August 1792.         
	We now move forward in time, to 1797. Napoleons star was on the ascendant and the ideals of the revolution a distant memory. One of the few survivors of the Terror had been Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Prigord, formerly Bishop of Autun and an indefatigable womaniser. After biding out the revolution in America, he set sail from Manhattan in June 1796. Exactly one year later, he was the Republics minister for foreign affairs, replacing the previous incumbent, Charles Delacroix. Talleyrand also replaced him in the bed of Madame Delacroix and the resultant progeny was the painter Eugene.         
	The accounts of the first meeting between Talleyrand and Catherine are conflicting. One school of thought holds that Catherine met Talleyrand in London, returned to Paris under a fictitious name and continued to live incognito with Talleyrand till 1797.         
	But writes Busteed, Madame Grand naively presented herself to the Minister of External Relations, in alarm at the report she had heard from the best authority, that Bonaparte was about to invade England, and had promised to give the Bank of England up to pillage; her visit was with the object of begging Talleyrand to get a guarantee that her property, which was all locked up there, should be saved for her.... The story goes that the Foreign Minister saw the joke that had been played upon her, but being too polite to tell her so, quieted her with a document guaranteeing the safe delivery of her plate, jewels, etc.         
	Within a few weeks, Catherine had moved in with Talleyrand, becoming the de facto second lady of Napoleons court. But the person most enraged at the liaison between Talleyrand and Catherine was none other Napoleon himself. Talleyrands infatuation with Catherine irritated him beyond all bounds of reason. He told Talleyrand that Catherine must leave. Catherine, however, went to her old friend Josephine and entreated her to arrange an interview with Napoleon.         
	I must again quote Busteed: At the interview with the First Consul she fell on her knees  the softened Bonaparte dismissed her saying, I see only one way of managing this, let Talleyrand marry you, and all will be arranged. You must bear his name or you cannot appear in this house.         
	Napoleon gave Talleyrand 24 hours to think about his ultimatum. The master diplomat had been painted into a corner, thanks to Catherines initiative and Josephines special pleading on her behalf. The marriage took place on September 10, 1802, before the Mayor of the 10th arrondissement of Paris. Talleyrand never forgave Catherine as long as she lived.

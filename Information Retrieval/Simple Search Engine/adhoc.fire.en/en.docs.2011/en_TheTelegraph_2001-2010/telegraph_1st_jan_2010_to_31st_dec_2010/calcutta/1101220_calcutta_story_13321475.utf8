  - First final of polo season draws young amp; old          SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI                          CHEERS: Polo enthusiasts enjoy the action at the Rising Sun Polo Tournament on Sunday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	Q: What can bring together a middle-aged professor of English, two brothers aspiring to become chartered accountants, a Calcutta girl now settled in Chicago and a India-trotting couple from New Zealand on a sunny Sunday afternoon?        
	A: A heady mix of horse and man, brawn and brain, in the worlds second-fastest sport (after ice hockey) played out on the oldest ground still in use.        
	Sunday saw the finals of the Rising Sun Polo Tournament as part of Calcutta Polo Season 2010, organised by the Fort William Riding and Polo Club, in association with The Telegraph.        
	As the gallery at the Pat Williamson polo grounds started filling up, some waited impatiently for the action to begin, some settled their babies before settling down themselves, while three pretty young ladies in cool shades and stylish outfits amused themselves by clicking each other.        
	I have seen polo on TV and am curious to see the action first-hand, said CA student Ayush Agarwal, brother Anant by his side.        
	With the USPA Cavalry (green jersey) and Navy-ASC (blue) teams lining up on the ground, those off it geared up for some serious cheering, spurred on by the impassioned commentary of Lt Col. Shakti Rathore of the Headquarters Eastern Command, who even went orey baba when the ball struck the goal post, not once but twice.        
	At the start of the first chukker, the scoreboard read  USPA Cavalry: 0, Navy-ASC: 1.5, prompting little Rohan to ask, Papa, why does the blue team already have goals? The patient father explained how a weaker team in polo gets a headstart with the score (called advantage) and the boy with pink cheeks and a red cap seemed sufficiently polo-schooled to sit back quietly. Only to let out a roar  along with the rest of the gallery  within 50 seconds of the game starting, thanks to a goal from Prashant Thakur of team blue.  
	A few minutes on, team green rsquo;s Ravi Rathore mdash; one of the Team India stars mdash; lifted the ball high with a double forward stroke on the off side, causing some spectators to jump almost as high off their seats. As the ball brought the horses near the gallery, the sound of gallop, gallop, gallop drowned out even the commentator rsquo;s excited boom.              
	 This need for speed had brought Dipti Sur and her husband Probir to the grounds. ldquo;I really admire polo players because not only do they need to be superb riders, they have to master the stickwork too, rdquo; said the English professor, looking fetching in orange, a light straw hat with colourful flowers on her head.  
	 Sunday belonged to Vishal Chauhan and his green team. He wowed the polo expert and the polo ignorant alike with his backhands and under-the-belly shots, scoring five goals. The final scoreline: 12 (green)- 6.5 (blue).  
	 With the finals of the first tourney of the season a galloping success, the fun seems to have returned to the Calcutta polo ground. ldquo;We are hoping the polo season will rekindle a passion for the sport among the residents of the city where modern polo originated, rdquo; said Lt-Col Rathore, one of the main organisers of the sporting extravaganza.

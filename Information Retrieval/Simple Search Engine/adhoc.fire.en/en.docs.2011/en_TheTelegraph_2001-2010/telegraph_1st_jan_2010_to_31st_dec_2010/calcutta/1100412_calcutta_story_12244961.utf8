The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City waits for AC rakes 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City waits for AC rakes 
          SANJAY MANDAL                                        
	Metro Railways promise to ease the woes of the Calcutta commuter by rolling out air-conditioned coaches this summer is turning out to be hot air.        
	The first two air-conditioned rakes of a proposed 13-strong fleet were originally scheduled to arrive in September 2009, but have missed the revised March 31 deadline as well.        
	The official third deadline for the delivery of the delayed rakes is June, though indications are that they wont roll out of the Perambur-based Integral Coach Factory anytime soon.        
	We had to carry out some design modifications, which added to the delay. Some components of the air-conditioning system are being procured from Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, and that is also taking time, a senior official of the coach factory told Metro from Perambur, in Chennai.         
	Commuters on the extended Tollygunge-Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul) overhead stretch will miss air-conditioned coaches the most this summer.        
	On a hot day, the coach turns into a mobile sauna during the nine minutes it takes to cover this stretch. Its much worse than a crowded local train because there is hardly any ventilation. While returning home, I just wait for the train to enter the tunnel after Tollygunge station, said Sovabazar resident Raktim Sanyal, who travels to and from his engineering institute in Garia by Metro every day.        
	So why did it take so long for the engineers to decide on changing the design of the air-conditioned coaches?        
	There was initially some confusion on whether the rakes would be air-conditioned or not. The original design had to be modified once it was finalised that the rakes would have air-conditioning. Passengers wont have enough headroom to stand if a standard coach is fitted with a cooling system, explained an official.        
	Air-conditioners meant for Metro rakes are attached to the ceiling, which reduces the vertical space inside the coach. An air-conditioned three-tier coach of a train is usually around 4.21 metres in height, while a Metro coach is 3.7 metres tall from floor to ceiling.        
	Metro coaches are unique in many ways. Although the trains run on broad-gauge tracks, the rakes are meter gauge. So the air-conditioning system that we manufacture for standard train coaches are not fit for Metro rakes, said the coach factory official.        
	Technical limitations alone are, however, not responsible for Calcutta having to wait longer for its first air-conditioned Metro coach.        
	Initially, procurement of components for the coaches was very slow. It was only after we wrote to the Railway Board that the process was speeded up, said a Metro Railway official.        
	The decision to build air-conditioned rakes was taken in 2008. Most of the components required for the customised coaches are imported, including from Germany and Austria. Each of these air-conditioned rakes costs Rs 37 crore to build at current rates, a source said.        
	Once the new rakes arrive, Metro Railway intends phasing out 11 of the old ones. The remaining seven would be overhauled at the midlife rehabilitation factory being set up in Noapara.        
	A senior official said the old rakes had far outlived their utility. Almost every day we deal with glitches that sometimes trigger major snags, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deadline for RTI appeals
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Deadline for RTI appeals
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Appeals lodged with the state information commission should be disposed of within 45 days, the high court has observed.        
	The Right to Information Act does not impose any deadline on the disposal of second appeals by state information commissioners. It is an error on the part of lawmakers. The commissioners should dispose of appeals within 45 days, Justice Jayanta Biswas observed on Tuesday.        
	Appeals heard by the state information commission are commonly known as second appeals.        
	Justice Biswas made the comment while hearing a petition by Akhil Kumar Roy, an IPS officer who now heads the civil defence department. Roy had stated in his petition that he had sought some information about his department from the state vigilance commission.        
	When the vigilance commission failed to provide him the information, he moved a second appeal before the state information commission on May 15 last year. But till date the commission has not disposed of his appeal, said lawyer Jaydeep Kar, who appeared for Roy in the high court.        
	Justice Biswas directed the state information commission to dispose of Roys appeal within 45 days of the order.        
	The RTI Act states that an application for information has to be filed before the public information officer (PIO) of the department concerned. The PIO should provide the information within 30 days.         
	If the applicant is dissatisfied with the information provided by the PIO, he will have to move an appeal  called first appeal  before the superior officer. According to the RTI Act, the first appeal has to be disposed of within 45 days.        
	If the applicant is dissatisfied even with the superior officers order, he can file a second appeal before the state information commission. In the RTI Act, there is no deadline for information commissioners to dispose of second appeals, lawyer Billwadal Bhattacharya said.        
	Lawyers feel Justice Biswass observation may prompt lawmakers to modify the act.

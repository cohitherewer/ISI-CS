The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Link partly restored
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Link partly restored
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The BSNL landline and Internet links of several Salt Lake and New Town homes that got snapped four days ago are yet to be restored.        
	We have been working on a war footing but this kind of work takes time. If we rush, the repair may be patchy, a BSNL official said.         
	The connections got snapped following damage to BSNLs underground cables because of the East-West Metro work. More than 5,000 landlines in Salt Lake and New Town were affected.        
	Sources in the utility said they were first trying to restore the leased lines of Sector V companies, banks and shopping malls.

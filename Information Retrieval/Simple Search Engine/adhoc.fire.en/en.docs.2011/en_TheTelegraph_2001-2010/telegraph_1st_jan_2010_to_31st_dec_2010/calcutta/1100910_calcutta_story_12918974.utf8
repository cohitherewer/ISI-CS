          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Jadavpur University is planning to introduce a two-year, full-time postgraduate diploma course in business management for which students would be admitted through CAT.         
	A comprehensive proposal for the course was placed at a meeting of the universitys executive council on Wednesday.        
	The executive council will decide on the matter after a series of discussions. We will have to create a faculty council to run the course, said vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh.        
	He hinted that the authorities would try to launch the course in a year.         
	As of now, the plan is to admit 50 students per batch. We want to make the institute world-class, on a par with the IIMs, added Ghosh.        
	The IIM model will be followed while designing the course. We are trying to include certain specialities that will make our course different from the ones taught at the IIMs, said a member of the council.        
	The 52-year-old university plans to set up a centre called Jadavpur Institute of Management Science on the main campus for offering the management course.        
	According to the council member, the stress will be on technology management in the second year.         
	The authorities want to offer programmes in power management, transport management and food and nutrition management.         
	Some council members have urged the authorities to draw up a list of prospective faculty members before acting on the proposal.

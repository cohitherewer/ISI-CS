The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hospital official held
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hospital official held
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A social welfare officer of MR Bangur Hospital has been arrested on the charge of siphoning off at least Rs 10 lakh the hospital had earned by selling out-patient department (OPD) tickets.        
	Police said Anup Kumar Deys duty was to collect the money from the OPD and hand it over to the cashier after entering the amount in the ledger. The authorities became suspicious and set up a probe committee after noticing that the amount the 58-year-old was depositing was less than the estimated figure.        
	Dey admitted before the panel that he had siphoned off Rs 2,60,000 and returned the amount, said an official. A detailed inquiry, however, revealed that Rs 10 lakh of OPD proceeds had not been deposited with the cashier. The authorities then alerted the police.        
	Dey is part of a racket, said an officer.

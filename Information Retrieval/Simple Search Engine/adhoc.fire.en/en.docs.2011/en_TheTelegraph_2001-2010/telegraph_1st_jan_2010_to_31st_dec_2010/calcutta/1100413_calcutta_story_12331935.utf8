The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 3 bodies near tracks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      3 bodies near tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The blood-soaked bodies of three youths, working for an NGO, were found along the railway tracks between Dum Dum and Belghoria on Monday morning, spreading panic in the Bediapara area of Dum Dum. Police said residents found two of the bodies at one spot, while the third lay half a kilometre away, towards Belghoria. The bodies bore injuries and the heads were smashed.        
	The youths, all in their early 20s, were identified as Ankush Sengupta, a resident of Rajabagan in Cossipore, Tridip Das, a resident of Jikia Math in Dum Dum, and Ratan Saha, a resident of Duttabagan in Dum Dum.         
	Prima facie it appears that the men were hit by a train while crossing the tracks. We are probing whether there was any foul play. The bodies have been sent for post- mortem, said Dilip Mitra, the additional director-general of railway police.        
	An officer said the trio worked in an NGO in Dum Dum and were last seen together at a local market at 7.30pm on Sunday.         
	Ankushs sister Sayantani claimed the three had been murdered. I have learnt that the three had got into a scuffle with some strangers at the market. They must have murdered the three and dumped the bodies beside the tracks, she said.

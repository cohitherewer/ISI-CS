The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Paralysed: four hospitals   Doctors deaf to CM threat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Paralysed: four hospitals   
 - Doctors deaf to CM threat          OUR BUREAU                           Junior doctors with protest posters. (Amit Datta)                                        
	The chief minister threatened stern action against irresponsible and indisciplined behaviour to end the junior doctors strike at two hospitals but that did not stop the ceasework from spreading to two more hospitals on Monday, leaving thousands of patients in the lurch.        
	With over 1,500 junior doctors on strike demanding safety on campus, emergency healthcare services at four state-run hospitals were paralysed  RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and Calcutta Medical College and Hospital joining SSKM and Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.        
	What is happening at SSKM is not acceptable. If this irresponsible and indisciplined behaviour continues the state will intervene, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had warned on Monday morning.        
	Two hours later, junior doctors from four hospitals started a relay hunger strike, expanding their original wish list  more security and better infrastructure  to demand the unconditional release of five junior doctors of SSKM arrested for assaulting policemen, patients and mediapersons and ransacking the assistant superintendents office.        
	Diptangshu Ganguly, Mustafa Al Masum, Prasun Kumar Mondal, Priyam Mukherjee and Riddhi Dasgupta, arrested on charges of rioting, were produced at the Alipore court on Monday and granted conditional bail.        
	Chief judicial magistrate Dulal Kar directed them to meet the investigating officer thrice a week. The bail is applicable till October 8.        
	We are not withdrawing our ceasework. We want an assurance that no charges will be framed against them, said Dilip Dutta of the Resident Doctors Association at SSKM.        
	Drowned in this dispute were the cries of patients desperate for medical care. Like Sanjoy Sinha, 8, an accident victim waiting for a femur bone operation. His silent tears in Alex Ward of SSKM could not draw a single doctor.        
	Sachidananda Jana, 55, a music teacher from Chandrakona in West Midnapore, was lying on a slab outside the Calcutta Medical emergency ward, gangrene setting into his right foot. A doctor said there was a strike today but they may see my father tomorrow. We will spend the night here in the open, said son Tulsi.        
	M.N. Roy, the principal secretary of health, admitted that the ceasework was affecting patients but could not break the deadlock despite several meetings at Swasthya Bhawan and Writers Buildings.        
	Late on Monday, Siddhartha Chakraborty, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of Calcutta Medical said the striking junior doctors must rejoin work within noon on Tuesday or face strict action. For house staff, their house job would be terminated. For interns and PGTs, this would be considered unauthorised absence. Both interns and PGTs run the risk of losing a year, he warned.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Land for Xaviers in New Town
          OUR BUREAU                          Rector Fr. George Ponodath at the Rajarhat programme. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	St Xaviers College got 2.5 acres in New Town from the state government on Thursday for its new campus but the Park Street institution wants more.        
	We humbly accept this great gift of land from the government. However, we do have a condition. We need a lot more. We want St Xaviers to be a world-class institution. Wed need more land, which, I believe, the government will consider, Rector Fr. George Ponodath said in his acceptance speech.        
	The principal, Father Felix Raj, later said housing minister Gautam Deb had assured him that the government would consider the colleges request for more land.        
	The 2.5-acre plot in Action Area I, worth around Rs 1 crore, is around 7km from Salt Lake and situated near the main arterial road.        
	We want to use technology to reach out beyond classrooms. We want to be the No. 1 institution in the country. For that, we need more land, Father Ponodath added.        
	When he spoke, an array of CPM ministers  housing minister and Hidco chairman Gautam Deb, higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and finance minister Asim Dasgupta  and local CPM MLA Rabin Mandal were on the dais. Most of them would have had an absent adversary on their mind more than St Xaviers plea.        
	Leader after CPM leader slammed Mamata Banerjee  at times by naming her  for allegedly trying to stall the development of New Town.        
	Almost every speaker referred to Mamatas planned march in Rajarhat  with around 25,000 farmers who have allegedly been victims of forcible land acquisition  on November 13.        
	Trinamul sources said the railway ministers march would be followed by an agitation to save land on the lines of Singur and Nandigram.        
	Those who are trying to stall progress for petty politics will not succeed. The people of Rajarhat will not let anybody halt progress, said Mandal.        
	The progress made here is for all to see. Those trying to play spoilsport with a political motive will fail, said health minister Mishra.        
	Hidco officials have expressed the fear that Mamatas agitation might hit several projects  including a 500-acre central business district, a mass housing scheme spread across 150 acres and a proposed 300-acre financial hub.        
	Challenging Mamata to prove her point, Deb invited a Trinamul delegation to find out if there were any cases of forcible acquisition or denial of compensation.        
	He added that he would print full-page advertisements in all major newspapers on November 14 with the names and photographs of people from Trinamul who have cooperated with Hidco over the years.        
	Other events: Finance minister Ashim Dasgupta laid the foundation stone for a new campus of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research, an undergraduate government college and a high school in Rajarhat on Thursday.

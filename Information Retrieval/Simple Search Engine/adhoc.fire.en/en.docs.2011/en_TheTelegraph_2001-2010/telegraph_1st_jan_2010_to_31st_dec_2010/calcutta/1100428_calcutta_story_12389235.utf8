The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HAPPY HOLIDAY!
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HAPPY HOLIDAY!
  - B-Day is a jolly good thing        CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA AND POULOMI BANERJEE                                                  
	All we want is a mid-week holiday. Or even if we want a BlackBerry or an LBD in addition, a well-timed bandh is a wonderful thing.        
	When the IPLs lost and won, when the week has just begun, when theres no end to the April sun, then a bandh is not a groan. It is an unexpected joy.        
	On Tuesday, when the Left called a nation-wide bandh to protest the rising prices, not many Calcuttans were complaining.        
	In fact, many wished each other Happy bandh. Or Happy B-Day. In person, when they met up in the evening, or even through SMS.        
	It was a happy addition to the new text series that also includes the message Happy Good Friday.        
	For a well-timed bandh serves many purposes, and well-timed this bandh was. Calcutta is drained by the heat and power cuts, IPL  never mind KKR or Lalit Modi  has robbed many homes of family life for weeks, and this bandh comes after three months.        
	It was well-timed for another reason. A long weekend lies ahead thanks to May Day. Tuesdays bandh sets the tone for the nice time ahead. Besides theres always so much to catch up on Facebook.        
	The timing is just great. You work for a day, then get a day off, then work for three more days and then get two days off, said 28-year-old Arnab Datt, a content writer. He added, I just plan to laze about all day and play online games on Facebook. Its a great way to spend the day and I dont have to keep looking over my shoulder to check whether my boss can see me playing.        
	For whatever Facebook may have to say about the man hours lost, many Calcuttans like to take the day off. And love it when a bandh comes after a long time, for it takes the guilt off the idea of not having to work.        
	Some are openly guilt-free.         
	We are shameless. We even start missing bandhs if there is too long a gap between two. It is as much a part of our needs as Calcuttans as mishti doi and adda, said Sushil Agarwal, a 40-year-old businessman, who played cricket with friends on a thoroughfare after years.        
	A whole lot of people did a whole lot of new things.        
	A 36-year-old orthopaedic surgeon was going on about the loss of a vital days work till his four-year-old daughter put things in perspective after a rare morning they spent together, first with her books and then with her computer games. Papa, whom can I ask to call another bandh soon? she asked in all seriousness.        
	Elderly parents got to spend time with their busy children. Fifty-five year old Shyamali Bhattacharyya and her 63-year-old husband, a retired WBSEB employee, were happy to have spent a relaxed day at home with son Arindam.        
	There was even relief from exams. I am doing my masters from JU and this is my last week of classes. Exams that would have been held today had to be postponed and we got an extra day to study, said 23-year-old Athena Mondal.        
	Working moms were happy to give their little ones time. Sundays go in cleaning and shopping for the week and putting the house in order. I dont get to spend so much time with him even during the weekend, said Paromita Ghosh, an entrepreneur and mother of 10-month-old Vir. Today I took my baby to the swimming pool for his first taste of the water, she said. And in the evening well go shopping for him and then to Pizza Hut.        
	Also in the evening, City Centre came alive within minutes of the bandh getting over. By 6.15, the KFC outlet, next to Pizza Hut, was almost full. There was a queue at the INOX counter. By 7pm, the car park was full. People were waiting to exhale.        
	Only there was not enough bread and much worry for the PGs in Salt Lake, for the neighbourhood shack hotels or home-delivery eateries that supply their food were closed.         
	There were cancelled flights and stranded passengers.        
	And there were those who struggled to get to the hospital.        
	But all that doesnt matter. A well-timed bandh is a jolly good thing.        
	Calcutta was happy to be home on Tuesday.        
	Who said we dont get what we want? Or deserve?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dawn breaks on drug abuse
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dawn breaks on drug abuse
          SEBANTI SARKAR                              
	Bhor is a play about drug addiction among contemporary youth. The play was staged on January 23 at Academy of Fine Arts.                     NCC cadets practise handling guns as part of their first-year practical examinations on the Maidan on Sunday. Almost 1,000 students between the age of 18 to 20 years took the exam that includes handling a self-loading rifle and a light machine gun and a map-reading session. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta      
	Unlike poster dramas on drug abuse that come with a message on its dangers, Bhor talks about the changes in the attitudes of addicts, their parents, friends and the people who work at rehabilitation centres, said writer/director Usha Ganguli, who wrote the play after visiting such centres in and around the city over two years.         
	People dont like to talk about it in West Bengal, but addiction among young people is a reality. Drugs are bought and sold openly at Sealdah and Howrah. Yet, when people are sent for rehab, parents and relatives always cover up. I met people like Somu, Bunty, Rana and GK (the four central characters of Bhor) at rehabilitation homes. The causes for their addiction vary between failed love, poverty, loneliness, and broken homes. They come from different social and educational backgrounds but their suffering is alike. At the rehab, they deal with the pain of detoxing, mood swings and depression, but many gain a positive attitude to life and bond with others.        
	Bhor narrates the tales of many lives within the framework of the autobiography of Somu, a rehab inmate. Sagnik, who plays Somu, is a former drug user. As are some of the cast members, whom Ganguli met while researching for the play. Ganguli is proud of being able to handle her cast of 55 actors in an on-stage basketball match, a drug awareness rally and scenes of hallucination.        
	Before premiering in Calcutta, the play did the rounds of Bharat Rang Mahotsav, hosted by the National School of Drama in Delhi and Bhopal.

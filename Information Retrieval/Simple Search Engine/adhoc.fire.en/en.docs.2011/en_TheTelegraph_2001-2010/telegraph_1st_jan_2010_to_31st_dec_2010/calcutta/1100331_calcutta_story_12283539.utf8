                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rs 400cr rise in airport upgrade bill 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The estimated cost of modernising the city airport has shot up by almost Rs 400 crores, officials of the Airports Authority of India said on Tuesday.         
	Speaking at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industries, the officials said the estimated cost of Rs 1,942 crore had gone up to Rs 2,325 crore as some facilities were being added.         
	A baggage sorting system would be set up at the integrated terminal building to speed up the check-in process, said airport director R. Srinivasan.         
	Once the project is completed, likely by August 2011, a passenger would not have go to the check-in counter for baggage registration. A flier can put his luggage on a conveyer belt and it would be carried to the luggage loading area, said an official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Size doesnt matter, spirit does   Desire to improve wins day for puja
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Size doesnt matter, spirit does     Desire to improve wins day for puja
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                      Swastika Mukherjee at the Barisha Youth Club puja on Ashtami. Pictures by Pabitra Das                  FRAME BY FRAME: The visit by the judges of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2010 was an affair to remember on Ashtami. And not just the hosts were going click, click at Barisha Youth Club as Jogen Chowdhury zoomed in on Swastika (Below).                                
	On Ashtami evening, a placard bearing the words CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Model Puja wended its way down Diamond Harbour Road into an alley leading to Shilpara.         
	Barisha Youth Club may not be on most pandal-hoppers roadmap, but organisers of any other puja in the area would happily give out directions. The reason for its popularity is the pond in front of the puja. After all the pujas of the locality have immersed their idols, it is this club that cleans up the pond.         
	Jogen Chowdhury, who judged the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2010 along with actress Swastika Mukherjee, music composer Debajyoti Mishra, cardiologist and critical care expert Dr Debal Sen, American Center director Chad P. Cummins and Dilip Samajpati, senior manager of customer relations, CESC, had stopped by the crystal clear waters while visiting the venue earlier on Ashtami.                  
	It is not enough to do up the puja premises. One must keep the surroundings clean as well, the veteran artist had said, pleasantly surprised by the sight.        
	Barisha Youth Club was the second pandal the judges were visiting on that route and the warmth of the reception, the crowd management and the ambience bowled them over. So it came as no surprise when the puja emerged as the favourite at the end.        
	Perhaps it is the desire to improve every year that earned the club top honours and the cheque for Rs 50,000 after seven years of participation. We would always visit the Model Pujas to see how we could improve, said organiser Sourabh Dey, overwhelmed at how our small puja with a modest budget could beat so many big pujas.        
	Judge Cummins gave them the thumbs-up for using bio-degradable products for the dcor.        
	Neighbouring Barisha Tarun Tirtha ran them close on the scoresheet and was declared a Five Star puja, with a Rs 25,000 prize. Arrangements for the elderly and the challenged  a wheelchair along with a ramp  boosted the pujas cause.        
	Another Five Star award went across the Hooghly to Howrahs Olabibitala Sarbojanin. As the judges were going around the pandal, little Debajyoti Banerjees sprained ankle was being treated by a nurse at the medical unit. Pointing to an ECG machine kept next to an oxygen cylinder, nurse Mou Kolay said: We can even get an ECG done if needed.        
	It is a great gesture to have such medical units at pandals. The treatment may be preliminary, but what matters is that there is someone to identify a problem and transport a patient to the closest hospital, observed Dr Sen.        
	Technology was being used as a tool for security at most of the seven finalist pandals, which would surely have pleased police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, who flagged off the True Spirit journey on Ashtami morning from Bengal Club.        
	Closed-circuit television sets have been installed at the Santoshpur Lake Pally, Mudiali Club and Kashi Bose Lane pujas. Mudiali Club even has a heat sensor. They all earned Four Star status, as did Beliaghata 33 No. Palli Bashi Brinda. In its 10th year, the Beleghata puja has a modest budget of Rs 3 lakh but is rich in community spirit. We somehow manage because people contribute in kind, sponsoring the bhog or the idol in their individual capacity. Till a decade ago, the nearest puja of the area was so far away that we got together to start this, said Manoj Gupta, a founder-member of the puja saluting Rabindranath Tagore on his 150th birth anniversary.        
	At the Kashi Bose Lane puja, lemon juice is served to all visitors. And if ever there is a queue, a projector has been set up on the ground outside the pandal to give them a live feed of the puja inside.        
	It isnt only the seven pujas that the judges visited on Friday morning that deserve plaudits. If Barisha Young Star has become the Model Puja this year, it is because Tridhara Sammilani, off Rashbehari Avenue, Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatti and 41 Palli of Haridevpur have led the True Spirit movement by example. They have been inducted into the Hall of Fame this year.         
	Also being saluted are Shibmandir, for staying true to the Puja ethos through the years, and Ramesh Dutta Street Sarbojanin for organising an inclusive puja that children from the neighbouring red-light area of Rambagan can call their own. They are being hailed as True to Tradition and a Puja that Cares, respectively, in association with The Bengal.        
	Who smiled the broadest when the placard reached Barisha Youth Club? Nilu Peari, an orphaned girl whose marriage this December is being sponsored by the club.

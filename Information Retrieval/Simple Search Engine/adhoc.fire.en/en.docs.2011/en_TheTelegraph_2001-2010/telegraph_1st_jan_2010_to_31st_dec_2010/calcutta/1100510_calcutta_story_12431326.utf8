                      Inspired by Tagores ideals                    Tagores works unfold an unending panorama of joy, sorrow, life, death, light, darkness, void and fullness in serene symphony with nature and contemporary society. Essentially a Renaissance man, Tagore was also socially conscious. An early advocate of Indias independence, his various works raised silent protest against socio-political repression and suppression. In Rabi O Chhobi, the ongoing group show, five artists of the new generation have come together to portray works inspired and shaped by his philosophy and ideals. The illustrations of Sougata Chattopadhyay seek to find God in the lives of common men. The presentations of Nivedita Sen (a painting by her appears here) bear depictions of contemporary life and society through figures of eternal womanhood. Her portrayals of Tagores timeless heroine Shyama in different contrasting persona articulate womens empowerment, also etching out women as the centre and source of power as opposed to the traditions of a patriarchal social order. Rajib Deyashi has depicted the nine different moods of monsoon as expressed in Tagores poetry. His images of overpowering beauty evoke feelings of admiration, love and hope. The works of Shib Sankar Kundu demonstrate a blend of Tagores verse and lyrics. These compositions of Tagore serve as a reflection of mans spiritual and sensual lives. Topical and contemporary in expression, Anup Bandyopadyays art is based on Tagores songs and shows his response to political violence and its repercussion in the lives of innocent citizens.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Probe team at school loses right to probe
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Probe team at school loses right to probe
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	La Martiniere for Boys played host to a probe drama on Wednesday, with the protagonist a team bearing the insignia of the ministry of human resource development by afternoon but hastily stripped off it by evening.        
	A team headed by Ramesh Bhattacharjee, ostensibly a city-based adviser to the ministry, descended on the school around 4pm to probe the caning of Class VIII student Rouvanjit Rawla by the principal four days before the boys death.        
	We have asked the school to submit a report. We will forward the report to the ministry with our observations. Based on that the ministry may send another team for inquiry from Delhi, Bhattacharjee told Metro.        
	But within hours, Delhi was distancing itself from Team Bhattacharjee and making it clear that it had not authorised anyone to probe the incident in La Martiniere.        
	Sources in the department said HRD ministry Kapil Sibal was quick to render the probe team that had got the gates of the Loudon Street campus opened playing the MHRD card unauthorised once he realised that the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations, to which La Martiniere is affiliated, was conducting its own inquiry backed by the ministry. So, the validity of the new team could be called into question.        
	When contacted late on Wednesday, Bhattacharjee refused to accept that their visit to the school had been unauthorised but did claim that they were not conducting a probe but were merely collecting information.        
	We were told by the department (education) in Delhi to gather information about the Rouvanjit Rawla case. A team from the ministry will come later, he claimed.        
	The so-called probe team  also comprising Anthony Arun Biswas, the president of the All India Minorities and Weaker Sections Council, and Dilip Datta, a retired deputy secretary of the West Bengal school education department  had spent over an hour on the Loudon Street campus talking to principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi and Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the schools board of governors.        
	The school, unaware about the visit till Wednesday afternoon, was alerted by a call from Shakespeare Sarani police station informing them that a probe team from the MHRD would come visiting.        
	The team asked us for a report on the incident, our inquiry and the action taken. We said we will submit it by the end of this week. But in the wake of the developments later in the day, we have decided to first check with the ministry on Thursday, said Dhar.         
	Ajay Rawla, Rouvanjits father, had written to the ministry in April asking for a probe into the role of the school in his sons death. The ministry had then asked the council to conduct a probe, which is underway.        
	We are yet to receive the complete set of Service Rules, a copy of the internal inquiry report and the resolution or decision taken by the governing body. We will send a second reminder to the school on Thursday and keep the ministry informed, said Neil OBrien, the chairman of the council.

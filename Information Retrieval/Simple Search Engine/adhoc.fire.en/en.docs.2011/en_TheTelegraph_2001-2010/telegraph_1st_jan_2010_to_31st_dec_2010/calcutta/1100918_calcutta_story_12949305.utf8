The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girl on cell killed by train
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girl on cell killed by train
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	A train mowed down a schoolgirl glued to her cellphone as she walked past a closed rail gate and onto the track on Friday morning, highlighting a hazardous urban habit that has already claimed several lives.        
	Class XI student Madhurima Das, 16, was walking back home from a tuition class holding the cellphone to her ear with her left hand and an umbrella above her head with the other when pedestrians spotted her stooping to go under the horizontal bar of the closed gate near Dum Dum Cantonment station.        
	The girl was apparently so engrossed in the cellphone conversation that she didnt even notice that the train speeding down the track was barely 100 feet away. We shouted for her to step back but it was too late, Kesab Mondal, a member of a club located just beside rail gate number three, told Metro.        
	Police said the cowcatcher of the Up Sealdah-Barasat local struck Madhurima the moment she stepped on the track, flinging her in the air as witnesses screamed in horror.        
	She landed around 10 feet away and her head hit an iron railing. She was rushed to a local municipal healthcare centre, where she died 15 minutes later, said an officer of Dum Dum railway police.        
	According to the case diary, the incident occurred at 9.35am. Madhurimas father Manik Das, a superviser in a private security agency, was then getting ready to leave home for work, little knowing that the cellphone he had gifted his daughter after she passed Madhyamik had just played a role in her death.        
	Manik is inconsolable. His wife (Krishna) has fainted several times since hearing the news. They cant believe their only child is no more, said Purnendu Mukherjee, a neighbour of the family.        
	Madhurima, who had joined Dum Dum Baidyanath High School for Girls barely three months ago, is not the first one to be knocked down by a train while walking across a rail track with a cellphone to the ear. Make-up artist Prabir De was mowed down by a train when he unmindfully walked down a track while engaged in a cellphone conversation during a photo shoot at Patuli, on the southern fringes, on June 15, 2005.        
	People talking over the cellphone while driving or walking down busy roads or even rail tracks has become very common. We routinely spot pedestrians using cellphones while crossing key intersections like Chowringhee, Dorina Crossing, Shyambazar, Sealdah, Tollygunge and Hazra, complained an officer at the Lalbazar control room.         
	So isnt lax vigilance and enforcement of rules to be blamed for this? We have proposed higher penalties for using cellphones while driving or jaywalking, the officer claimed.        
	Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 stipulates a pittance of a fine  Rs 100  for using a cellphone while driving. The rule book states that if such use of cellphones causes further inconvenience or is deemed hazardous to pedestrians, then the errant driver may be fined Rs 1,000 for negligent driving.        
	Till date, there has been no instance of someone being fined Rs 1,000 for using a cellphone while driving, admitted a traffic sergeant.        
	At Nalta, under Dum Dum Municipalitys ward number 7, Madhurimas relatives and friends hoped her tragic death would be a wake-up call for others.        
	She had stepped out for her tuition class as usual around 7am. One of her friends informed us around 10am that she had met with an accident. By the time we reached the hospital, she was dead. How can a young life be lost in this manner? If only we could turn the clock back, cried aunt Mousumi Das, who lives next door.        
	Father Manik, lying on a bed, clutched Madhurimas damaged cellphone and wept.        
	How can the practice of driving/walking with cellphone to the ear be curbed?

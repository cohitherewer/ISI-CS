                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC picks holes in case
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER              From attack to appeal to acquittal for some                                        (From top) Blood being washed off the American Center entrance on January 22, 2002; Aftab Ansari in June 2002;   Aftab in April 2003; Public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami and Aftab Ansari rsquo;s lawyer Shahid Imam at Calcutta High Court   on Friday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)      January 22, 2002: At 6.36am, two men on a motorcycle fire from AK-47s at cops guarding American Center, killing six.

  June 2005: Ansari and his associates move the high court against the sentence
  February 5, 2010: High court rejects Ansari rsquo;s plea for life, along with that of Jamiluddin Nasser, but acquits Adil Hasan and Rehan Alam, and reduces the sentences of Hasrat Alam, Musharat Hossain and Shakil Ahmed                                
	The loopholes in the investigation and trial in the American Center attack case stood exposed on Friday when two of the convicts facing the gallows went from being enemies of the state to free men.        
	Lawyers tracking the case said police never had a watertight case against Adil Hasan and Rehan Alam but painted them as equal partners in the crime masterminded by Aftab Ansari.        
	The dismissed murder charge against three of the other convicts whose death sentence Calcutta High Court reduced to a five-year term was also based on flimsy evidence, they added.        
	With the trial being conducted by one judge, Pyarimohan Das, and the verdict being given by another, Basudeb Majumdar, the 2005 judgment came under scrutiny as well, sources said.        
	Adil and Rehan, arrested on January 29, 2002, from Hazaribagh  in Jharkhand  were charged with harbouring the gang that had sprayed bullets on policemen guarding the American Center a week before that.        
	The police claimed that the duo received the gang at Kodarma railway station and took them to a Hazaribagh safehouse by car after the incident. The investigation team also claimed to have seized the guns used in the attack from them but the AK-47 bullets recovered from the American Center were not of those weapons.        
	How could they come to the conclusion that the duo were directly involved in the attack without evidence? asked lawyer Uday Chatterjee.        
	A senior advocate who did not wish to be named said the investigation team and the prosecution made a basic mistake by pressing identical charges on Ansari and the rest of the group.        
	Even if all of them were part of the gang, the level of involvement in the crime may have been different. So how could they club all seven and press for the same sentence? he asked.        
	A senior police officer admitted that the investigation team may have been in a hurry to wrap up the case, though the trial did drag for more than three years till trial court judge Das retired.         
	Sessions judge Majumdar later pronounced the judgment based on the casebook, and without questioning any of those standing trial or the witnesses.        
	A member of the investigating team claimed that all escape routes would have been sealed for the convicts had some witnesses not turned hostile.        
	Some of the witnesses against Adil and Rehan, including the driver of the vehicle that was used to ferry the gang, made things difficult for us. If witnesses turn hostile in a case of waging war against the state, no investigation team can hold its ground, he added.        
	Advocate Subroto Mukherjee said the murder charge against Hasrat Alam, Musharat Hossain and Shakil Ahmed didnt stand scrutiny because the police had no evidence to support it.         
	The main charge is that the forged tax token, licence and bluebook of the vehicle used in the operation were printed in Hasrats press, while Shakil and Musharat were charged with introducing him to Aftabs gang. But was the evidence enough to declare them enemies of the state and award capital punishment? he asked.         
	The law states that capital punishment is to be awarded in the rarest of rare cases.

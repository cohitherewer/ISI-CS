                      For the children, by the children                    Nandikar hosts a two-day theatre festival for children, beginning today with Hariye Jete Nei Mana (direction: Rimi Majumder) and Jai Ektibaar (direction: Jhulan Mukhopadhyay). Hariye Jete Nei Mana (a scene from the play appears here) takes the audience on a trip to a land of dreams along with little girl Tia. She lives in a glittering world of gadgets and skyscrapers and leads a life filled up by her school, studies, parents and friends. Yet, she yearns for a life where she can play in the green fields and swim in the blue sea. One day, she is magically led into such a land by a group of imaginary friends. A collage of poetry, music, song, dance and movements inspired by childrens literature, mostly poems of Tagore, Jai Ektibaar is a beautifully choreographed, vocally orchestrated, musically rich performance presented by 20 youngsters. It depicts a child who is restless, adventurous and can hear the call of the unknown. To be staged tomorrow are Indian Idol (direction: Debshankar Haldar) and Pakhi (direction: Swatilekha Sengupta).                  Event: Nandikars childrens theatre festival When: Today and tomorrow; 6.30pm onwards Where: Minerva Theatre

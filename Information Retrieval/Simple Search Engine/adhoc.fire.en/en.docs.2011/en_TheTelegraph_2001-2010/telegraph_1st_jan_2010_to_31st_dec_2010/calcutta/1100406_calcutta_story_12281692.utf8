The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land lockhorn in Rajarhat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Land lockhorn in Rajarhat
          ZEESHAN JAWED                      Gautam Deb                          
	Housing minister Gautam Debs SOS to Mamata Banerjee in a desperate bid to end the Rajarhat impasse has backfired, with the Trinamul Congress deciding to step up protests against land acquisition in New Town.        
	Trinamul sources said the party had decided against helping Hidco, the implementing agency of New Town, acquire land in Rajarhats Chhapna mouza for installation of electric poles after gauging the villagers reaction to Debs call to Mamata.        
	Hidco officials have visited Chhapna 15 times to erect the poles, only to retreat in the face of resistance from villagers who are demanding more compensation to part with their land.        
	The housing minister had on March 25 said he had dialled Mamata and sought her help in resolving the issue that is holding up electrification of Action Areas II and III of the township. The railway minister, Deb added, had promised cooperation.        
	But Mamata later denied having spoken to Deb, which prompted the state minister to label the Trinamul leaders politics unhealthy and uncivilised at a media conference.        
	There is no way we can help Hidco anymore, said Ashok Naskar, the Trinamul pradhan of Patharghata panchayat, which includes Chhapna. Earlier, we had tried to mediate between the villagers and Hidco. But given the mood of the landowners, we have decided to side with them.        
	Another Trinamul panchayat member who did not wish to be named said: The news of Didi assuring Deb of cooperation did not go down well with Chhapna residents. Many said they would continue with their protest despite her intervention. The local mood has been conveyed to the high command, which does not want to be seen campaigning against the residents over land acquisition.        
	The hardening of the stand of the local Trinamul spells more trouble for Deb, who has often claimed that his negotiation skills resulted in the smooth land acquisition in Rajarhat.        
	Chhapna, once a CPM bastion, switched sides in the 2008 panchayat polls. We built our base in the area by exploiting the landowners resentment over the compensation package. We dont want our influence to wane by siding with the government, said a Trinamul leader in Patharghata.         
	The local leadership of Trinamul did not initially oppose Hidcos plans to install electricity polls at Chhapna. The party was later forced to change its stand at the instance of the landowners, who gheraoed panchayat pradhan Naskar last year following murmurs of collusion between Trinamul and Deb.        
	The landowners also wrote to Mamata complaining against the local leaders of her party. Why should we oppose the installation of something as essential as electric poles? We just want the landowners to get proper compensation. Till that is assured, we will continue our protests, said Prabir Kar, the Trinamul president of Rajarhat block.

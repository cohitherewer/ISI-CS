The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Delhi boost for New Town 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Delhi boost for New Town 
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI IN NEW DELHI                              
	Delhi has accorded satellite township status to New Town and agreed to share the cost of development in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees disputed acres despite UPA ally Trinamul being a stumbling block in land acquisition for infrastructure.        
	We have agreed to pay nearly 50 per cent of the cost for three infrastructure projects. The agreement between the Centre and the state was to be signed today but got postponed It will be signed at the earliest, Ashutosh Joshi, the director of the Union urban development ministry, told Metro on Friday.         
	The ministry has also set a two-year deadline to put proper infrastructure in place in New Town, which should be music to the ears of those who invested in the Rajarhat dream, only to see it turn into a nightmare over the past year.         
	Trinamul leaders in Rajarhat have been opposing land acquisition for action areas II and III of New Town. The party is also backing the protests by landowners who claim their plots were acquired by the government for a pittance.         
	According to Joshi, the ministry agreed to the proposal to bring New Town under central schemes for satellite townships after going through a detailed project report. The ministry is also helping Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu develop satellite townships. The only condition is that Bengal must meet the deadline.        
	We want a commitment from the Bengal government that the three projects to be partially financed by Delhi would be completed by 2012, Joshi added.         
	Sticking to the ministrys deadline could be easier said than done as land acquisition has come to a halt in New Town following Trinamuls victory in the panchayat poll.        
	Housing minister Goutam Deb admitted that resistance to land acquisition was a hurdle and blamed the Opposition  without naming Trinamul  for the problem. Although Hidco, the agency responsible for the development of New Town, has dumped water and sewer pipes at several locations in action areas II and III, resistance from villagers has stalled work.         
	We are doing everything to sort out the issue, said minister Deb, whose efforts to involve Mamata Banerjee in New Towns development havent cut ice.         
	Trinamuls Saugata Roy may be the junior urban development minister, but local Trinamul leaders seem determined to continue opposing land acquisition.        
	The state government will have to return land to the people who were forced to part with it, said Prabir Kar, Trinamul Congress president of Rajarhat block.

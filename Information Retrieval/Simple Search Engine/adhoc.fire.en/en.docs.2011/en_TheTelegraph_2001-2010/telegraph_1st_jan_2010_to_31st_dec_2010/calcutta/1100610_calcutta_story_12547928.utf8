          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 70-year-old widow was found murdered on Wednesday in the two-room flat in Belghoria where she lived alone.         
	A maid found Ranu Podder lying in a pool of blood with her throat slit when she reported for duty in the morning.         
	Neighbours last saw Ranu, who had been living alone in the flat since her husband died 11 years ago, around 8pm on Tuesday.        
	It does not seem that the murderers took anything but we are checking whether any valuables are missing. We are interrogating the maid too, said an officer of Belghoria police station.        
	One of Ranus two daughters lives in Sodepur, the other lives in the locality.

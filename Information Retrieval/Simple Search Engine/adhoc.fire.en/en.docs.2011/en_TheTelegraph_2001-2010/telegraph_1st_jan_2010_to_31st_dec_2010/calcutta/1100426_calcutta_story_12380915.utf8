The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll effect on exam results
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Poll effect on exam results
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The municipal poll scheduled for May 30 is speeding up the declaration of results for one major examination but slowing down the other.        
	The poll deadline will work to the advantage of the nine lakh-plus examinees of Madhyamik 2010 as the results are set to be declared about 10 days before last years date of publication.        
	But theres bad news for the five lakh-plus students who appeared for Higher Secondary (HS) 2010, staring at a delay in the results because of the poll date.        
	The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has set a target to complete the process of publication of Madhyamik results within May 20, a source in the examination department of the board said.        
	In 2009, the Madhyamik results were declared on May 28.        
	The authorities of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, however, are planning to announce the results in the first week of June, a source in the council said.        
	In 2009 the HS results were declared on May 29.        
	To speed up the publication of Madhyamik results, the board of secondary education had started distributing the answer scripts to examiners early. Till last year the Madhyamik scripts were distributed between 15 and 30 days of completion of the written tests. But this time the scripts started reaching the examiners within a day or two of an exam being held, said a senior official of the board.        
	This was done to prevent a delay caused by teachers attending the training routine for poll duties and then being commissioned for elections.        
	We are trying to complete the checking of answer scripts as soon as possible. At the same time we wanted to ensure that the teachers got sufficient time to correct the scripts so that there are no errors, an official said.         
	The HS results on the other hand will be slightly delayed with the municipal poll falling bang in the middle of the evaluation process and the council deciding to allow more time to examiners.        
	Complaints of mistakes in evaluation are rising among HS examinees. To ensure accuracy we have almost doubled the time for correcting the answer scripts, said a council official.        
	There is a Supreme Court ruling that the results of all Class XII board exams in India must be declared within June 10 every year. The council official said the HS results would be declared in the first week of June as soon as the municipal elections are over.

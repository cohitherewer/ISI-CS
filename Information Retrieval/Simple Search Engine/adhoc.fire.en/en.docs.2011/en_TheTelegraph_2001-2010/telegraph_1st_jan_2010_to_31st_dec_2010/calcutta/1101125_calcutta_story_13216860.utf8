                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Student protest greets Buddha
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Madrasah students wave a black flag at chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.   A Telegraph picture                                        
	A strident student protest greeted the chief minister for the second time in two weeks on Wednesday when a group of madrasah students waved a black flag and shouted slogans at him before being driven out by police.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, along with cabinet colleagues Abdus Sattar and Anisur Rahman, was attending a programme to lay the foundation stone of the womens campus of Aliah University in Park Circus.        
	Around two dozen members of the Madrasah Students Union, sitting in the front row, suddenly stood up and started waving a giant black flag at Bhattacharjee. A few of them kept shouting Go back chief minister.        
	The students were protesting the governments alleged apathy in upgrading madrasah education and appointing teachers for the theology department of Aliah University, which operates out of its two campuses at Haji Mohammed Mohsin Square in central Calcutta and in Salt Lake.        
	The agitating students were also seen throwing leaflets while the police were desperately trying to rein them in. As the cops caught some of the students by the collar, the others picked up chairs and hurled them at the men in uniform.        
	The chaos continued for around 10 minutes till the police pushed the protesters out. A senior police officer later said 13 students had been arrested.        
	While addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone, Bhattacharjee said: I dont know who those students were and where they came from.... They (the agitating students) probably do not know what we have done to promote education among Muslims, especially Muslim women.        
	Siamat Ali, the general secretary of the Madrasah Students Union, alleged that the government had done precious little to improve madrasah education. The Calcutta Madrasah was upgraded to Aliah University two years ago. But there has been no change in the infrastructure and other facilities of the institution.        
	The womens campus of Aliah University will be set up in an 11-storey building on a 148-cottah plot behind Lady Brabourne College.        
	On November 9, members of the United Democratic Students Forum had attempted to show black flags to the chief minister at Jadavpur University. The police lathicharged some of the students when they tried to block Bhattacharjees convoy while he was leaving the campus.        
	An FIR was lodged against some students, which prompted engineering students to boycott the ongoing semester exams.

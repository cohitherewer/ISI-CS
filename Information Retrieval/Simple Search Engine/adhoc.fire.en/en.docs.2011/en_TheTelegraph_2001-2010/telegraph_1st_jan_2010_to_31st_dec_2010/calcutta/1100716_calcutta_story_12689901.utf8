                      Trance mania                    Talamasca is a solo project from Cedric Dassulle, a French DJ who began to play in Paris in psytrance parties around 1992. As the psytrance scene is not as powerful in France as it is in other parts of the world such as Brazil, Japan or Israel, in 1994 Talamasca started to play in other countries around the world instead of in his own. In 1996, he decided to create his own project, with the name of Talamasca. When his music became a great success, Talamasca began playing more live acts than in DJ sets. Soon, he came to be considered as one of the leaders of the international trance scene. In 1998, he decided to develop his own label, 3D Vision, which quickly became one of the leading labels of this style of music. Presently, Talamasca is one of the most requested live acts at all important electronic music festivals including the Full-moon Festival, Samothraki or the Boom Festival in Europe, Eclipse, the biggest electronic festival of Canada, the Chemical Sound Festival in Rio, the Goa Sound Festival in Mexico, the Summer Arcade Fuji Festival in Japan, and many more. The master of melodies is here in the city for what promises to be a truly unique performance. With his synthetic rhythms and complex layered melodies to be performed in characteristic Talamascan mood, tempo, and style, Talamasca Live will provide those with a taste for alternative music an experience to remember for a long time to come.                  Event: Live performance by French artiste Talamasca When: Today at 8 pm Where: Tantra, The Park

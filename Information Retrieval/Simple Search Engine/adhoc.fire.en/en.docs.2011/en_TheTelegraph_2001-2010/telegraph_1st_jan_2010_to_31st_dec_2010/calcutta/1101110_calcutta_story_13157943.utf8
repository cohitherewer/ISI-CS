The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Enter, discipline in class

  - School to introduce new subject to reward amp; punish          A STAFF REPORTER                                                St James rsquo; School   Subject: Discipline
  Debut: January 2011
  Class: V to XII
  Marks lost: Using abusive language with teachers/classmates, assaulting fellow students, disturbing class, breaking furniture
  Marks gained: Cleaning classrooms, teaching underprivileged children in the evening school    
	St James School is poised to introduce discipline as a subject from the next academic session in a bid to replace the cane with a code.        
	We had been studying this model for a couple of years since corporal punishment was banned. Disciplining students has become a real problem for teachers, said principal T.H. Ireland.        
	Once discipline is introduced as a subject  the proposal needs to be passed in the schools board meeting later this month  students of Classes V to XII will be assessed and awarded grades for their conduct.        
	The subject will carry 100 marks and it will be treated on a par with mathematics or English, stressed Ireland.        
	Students will be awarded both plus and minus marks on the conduct scale. Marks will be deducted depending on the seriousness of the offence.        
	So, for example, if a student is disturbing a class in progress, the penalty could be five marks. The use of abusive language in class could lead to the loss of 10 to 20 marks.        
	Students will have the chance to make up marks lost to acts of indiscipline. If they do any socially useful work like cleaning up the classrooms or teaching underprivileged students in the evening school, they will score marks, said Ireland.         
	Discipline aims to enter Classes V to XII from January 2011. It could later be extended to Classes III and IV.        
	Discipline makes its debut as a subject in the wake of the arrest of the principal and three teachers of La Martiniere for Boys, following the death of Class VIII student Rouvanjit Rawla, who allegedly committed suicide in his Alipore home four days after being caned by the principal.        
	Ireland said the proposal was an offshoot of an earlier system under which a team would lose marks for individual acts of indiscipline ranging from talking in class to sloppy uniform. The acts of indiscipline have become far more severe now.        
	Will such a system work? Noel Nyss, working for youth development in education, is hopeful. I am a firm believer in the system of reward and punishment. It is good for the school to introduce it as a subject but I think a further step should be taken and it should be introduced in homes. Discipline starts at home, he said.        
	St James has been organising workshops on discipline  Discipline by Design by Salony Priya, for example  and teachers welcome the move to introduce it as a subject.        
	To maintain transparency and fairplay, the school will set up a committee comprising the principal, vice-principal, a teacher in charge of discipline and maybe a parents representative. Students should not feel that the teachers are being vindictive. This is for their benefit, said Ireland.

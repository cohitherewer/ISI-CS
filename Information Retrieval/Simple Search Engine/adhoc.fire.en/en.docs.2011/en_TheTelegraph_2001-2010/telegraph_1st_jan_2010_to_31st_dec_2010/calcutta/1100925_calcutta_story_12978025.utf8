                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Drunk driver of kids car
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The drunk driver of an Ambassador let go of the steering and collapsed while ferrying four Class VI students of Shri Shikshayatan School, who were seated in the rear and screaming in fear.        
	The car, owned by the father of one of the girls, hurtled a few yards, hit the kerb and came to a halt near Everest Building on JL Nehru Road around 4.30pm.        
	Alarmed passersby rushed to the girls aid.        
	Rana Das, a resident of Chitpore, led the group that pulled the girls out and guided them to a nearby bank. A traffic sergeant called up Shakespeare Sarani police station.        
	When officers turned up, driver Gautam Halder was unable to stand. He was taken to the police station, where he threw up twice and collapsed again. He was admitted to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital.        
	We have slapped Gautam with the charges of rash and negligent driving and drink driving, said an officer.        
	Three of my friends  Ayushka Bhattacharya, Nupur Gupta and Saheli Sinha  and I boarded the car around 3.30pm. After a while, I saw kaku (Gautam) dozing off, recalled Pratyusha Karmakar, whose father Jayanta owns the Ambassador. We kept alerting him but he seemed unable to hear anything.        
	The other girls could not be contacted.        
	Gautam, in his 20s, has been driving Karmakars car for the past seven years. I have never seen him behave abnormally, said Karmakar, a resident of Baranagar.        
	Shri Shikshayatan vice-principal Madhumita Seal said: We have not heard of any such incident.        
	Pool car peril        
	Seven school students travelling in a pool car, apparently unregistered, had a close shave when a Calcutta Tramways Company bus rammed into the vehicle on Strand Road on Friday afternoon.        
	Till late on Friday, police could not track down the driver of the bus that was coming from Howrah. Mohammed Rais, who was ferrying the students of a Park Lane school, suffered injuries to his right hand and leg.        
	The front of the Howrah-bound car was mangled under the impact of the crash, which occurred in front of the state headquarters of State Bank of India.        
	Witnesses rescued the students through the rear door of the car.        
	The car (WB02N6570) did not have the sticker that a registered pool car must have. There were seven students inside though a pool car cannot carry more than six. Nor was there any attendant, another must.        
	We are trying to find out whether the car has been registered as a pool car, said Dilip Banerjee, deputy commissioner, traffic.

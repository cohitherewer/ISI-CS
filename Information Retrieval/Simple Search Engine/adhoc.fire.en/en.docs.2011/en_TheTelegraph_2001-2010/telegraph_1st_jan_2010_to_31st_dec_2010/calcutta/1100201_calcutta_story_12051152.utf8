  - Tell me about Tolly troubles          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mamata Banerjee appears to be directing Prosenjit with a flourish at SRFTI. Pictures by Sanat Kr Sinha                                                  
	I am going to SRFTI (Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute) now for an adda with the filmstars, beamed Mamata Banerjee before zipping out of Suvaprasannas Raichak retreat on Sunday evening.        
	On the EM Bypass campus, a Tollywood team had already set the stage to acquaint the railway minister with problems plaguing the film industry. Once inside the auditorium, Mamata chose to sit in the audience with Prosenjit, Chiranjit and Haranath Chakraborty for company, while the Union minister of state for information and broadcasting, C.M. Jatua, took the dais along with Sandip Ray, Goutam Ghose, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Ranjit Mullick and Dipankar De.         
	I dont know anything about the film industry but that it has been neglected for a long time. So, I needed to know about your problems, said Mamata, after giving the industry representatives a patient, hour-long hearing.        
	The Tolly team touched upon issues concerning censorship, NFDC loans, the lack of a film city, and poor post-production facilities in town.         
	One of the various suggestions that Mamata came up with was developing the SRFTI campus into a film city. She asked Jatua to submit a list of the issues raised at the SRFTI session to the central ministry and follow it up after three months.                   Mamata makes a point   from the front row       
	Explaining the context of the meeting, Prosenjit said: The information and broadcasting ministry had initiated todays meeting as they wanted to know about the problem areas in Tollywood.        
	Besides, Mamata Banerjee being a cabinet minister, the state-central relation is very important, added Goutam Ghose.        
	Among the other Tollywood faces spotted at the interaction were Rachana Banerjee, Prabhat Roy, Shrikant Mohta, Mahendra Soni, Arijit Dutta, Saswata Chatterjee and Rajatava Datta.

                      Music of the wandering minstrels                    A community traditionally associated with Birbhum in Bengal, Bauls are best known for their songs and poems invoking a god who dwells within the human spirit. Fakirs are mendicants who travel from one place to another, often singing songs bearing their spiritual message. Bauls and Fakirs are believed to share two key aspects: a protestant subaltern socio-religious ethos and a physico-yogic practice; both being reflected in the songs that form the textual corpus of these communities and expressions of their life. Baul and Fakir genres of music have rich historical, cultural and social significance. Their songs are all about transcendence, nostalgia, mysticism and the exotic. With the winter chill in the air, the annual Baul Fakir Utsav is back in the city, with its medley of songs of the soil, presented in a warm, affable and homely ambience. In its fifth edition this year, the festival features a star cast of folk music practitioners, including Radheshyam Das, Kanai Das, Gaur Khyapa, Satyananda Das and Kartick Das who will render baul songs. Fakiri music will be performed by Nur Muhammad, Heera Shah, Khaibur Fakir, Akkas Fakir, Amirul Fakir and Golam Fakir. This year, bichhedi, Baul and Fakiri songs will also be presented by Chandrabati Ray Burman, Ronesh Thakur, Abdur Rahaman and six other performers from Sylhet, Bangladesh.

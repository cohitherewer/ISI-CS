          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	More than 300 residents of South City staged a demonstration against its promoters inside the residential complex and in front of South City Mall on Sunday evening. They also joined a silent rally wearing T-shirts with Betrayed by South City promoters printed on them.        
	The protesters grievances range from lack of civic amenities and security to violation of the terms and conditions mentioned in the deed of conveyance.        
	Pradeep Sureka, one of the six promoters of South City Projects Limited, said while most residents were happy with the facilities provided, some were trying to grab power by forming an association.        
	A section of residents served a legal notice to the authorities on May 21 and approached the court to stop the construction of a tower and a water body on the premises.        
	Residents started living in the four 35-storeyed towers (each comprising 404 flats) in October 2008.

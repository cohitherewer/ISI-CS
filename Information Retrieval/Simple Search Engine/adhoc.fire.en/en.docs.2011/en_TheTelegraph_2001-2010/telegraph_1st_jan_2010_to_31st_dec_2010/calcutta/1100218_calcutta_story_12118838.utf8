                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Protest over boy death
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Nearly 200 students and their guardians demonstrated at Kendriya Vidyalaya Ordnance Factory on Wednesday to protest the authorities alleged negligence in taking a sick Class XI student to hospital, where he was declared dead.        
	Police persuaded the protesters to disperse after three hours.        
	They alleged that the authorities had dilly-dallied for more than an hour and a half before taking Arpan Mukherjee of Class XI science to hospital after he lost consciousness in school on Tuesday.        
	A guardian said: The boy was initially taken to the Ordnance Factory health centre, which did not have the facilities to deal with an emergency. He was taken back to school before being taken to a hospital on the EM Bypass.        
	The principal denied the allegation. The boys father, a BSF sub-inspector, has not lodged a complaint.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Students submit Presi wish list
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Students submit Presi wish list
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	About 100 Presidency College students owing allegiance to the Independents Consolidation (IC) submitted a memorandum to principal Amitava Chatterjee on Thursday demanding that first-year students be automatically transferred to Presidency University once it starts functioning next month.         
	Admissions for the 2010-11 session were held in July, and the students were enrolled under Calcutta University. First-year students joined the institution with the dream of being a part of Presidency University. The authorities of the new university should respect that, said Joy Saha, an IC member.        
	Later in the day, senior officials and teachers of the college met the students to discuss the wish list. We will forward the students views to the state government. But we cannot assure them that their demands will be met, said a teacher.         
	The students have also asked the authorities to allow them to participate in the functioning of the new university. The IC supporters said the students of Presidency University should have the right to evaluate the performance of their teachers. If the government is really concerned about making Presidency University an institution of international repute they must take feedback from the students, said Saha.         
	The students also made it clear that they would oppose any move by the authorities to install CCTVs on campus.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Council reminder for papers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Council reminder for papers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) on Monday sent a reminder to La Martiniere for Boys for three documents related to the alleged corporal punishment inflicted on Rouvanjit Rawla days before he was found hanging at his Alipore home on February 12.        
	Supriya Dhar, the secretary to the schools board of governors, however, said the management had nothing more to send. We have already sent the necessary papers.        
	The council had on May 31 written to the school and Ashok Biswas, the bishop of Calcutta and chairman of the schools board, asking for a copy of the staff service rules, a copy of the report of the probe into the complaint lodged by Rouvanjits father Ajay and a copy of the boards resolution based on the report.        
	The CISCE asked for the documents after the human resource development ministry forwarded to it Ajay Rawlas complaint against the school, said council chairman Neil O Brien.        
	Gerry Arathoon, the councils officiating chief executive, said the school had sent only copies of two sections of the staff service rules  15(II) and 16.2. We also did not get the full probe report.        
	The council had on April 28 asked the school to submit a report on Rouvanjits suicide and the action taken against the principal and other teachers accused of inflicting corporal punishment on the boy.        
	The schools report on May 25 stated that the principal had been warned for caning Rouvanjit. The council was not satisfied with the report and sought the three documents.        
	Smart denied bail        
	The bail plea of Sanjay Smart, the La Martiniere for Boys teacher accused of demanding a laptop to promote a Class IV student, was rejected in Bankshall court on Monday. The teacher, now under suspension, has been remanded in judicial custody till June 28.

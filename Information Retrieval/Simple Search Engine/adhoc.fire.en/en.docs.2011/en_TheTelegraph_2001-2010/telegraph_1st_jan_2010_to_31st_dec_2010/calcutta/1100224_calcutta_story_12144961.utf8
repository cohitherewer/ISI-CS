                      Expressions of the conscience                    Social consciousness stands as the definitive and unyielding cornerstone of the recent works of Ashoke Mullick. Modernistic approaches and traditional cultures are intertwined in his works. Featuring 30 paintings (oil and acrylic) and 10 paper drawings, Lightness of Being Anxious, the ongoing solo show of his works, captures the various stages of development of a city. His conscience has been deeply influenced by Picassos kind, in which the latters visual linguistics were influenced by the awareness about the social situation of human beings. Apart from the change in the composition of his paintings, the artist has also experimented with colours in his latest works. They bear more darker hues, unlike his previously dominant yellows, whites, oranges and blues. The characters portrayed by him in this show are lonely creatures with distinguished social positions. These creatures dream or hallucinate with open or closed eyes; their hopes, aspirations, desperations and unfulfilled wishes find exhausted expression through their physical existence.

                      Paintings from Persia                    Following the Revolution of 1979, Iran eschewed all Western influence and turned to its Islamic heritage in its attempt to forge a new national identity. However, as years passed, some of the old fervour waned. Iranian artists ventured into new media and experimented with contemporary art forms like photography and film. Long considered a bastion of creativity in the region, Iran is currently experiencing a remarkable artistic revival in the middle of the most challenging of circumstances. Iranian artists  whether based within or outside the country  are creating outstanding art works that reflect their countrys social and political environment, while incorporating their own world views. Seen together, the works on show in Drops are part of a new and exciting movement that can only gain in importance in the coming years and promise to be a visual treat for Indian viewers. Participating artists include Saeid Aranpur, Javad Nobahar, Hamid Namdar (a painting by him appears here), Mohmmad Fasunaki and Safa Zargari.

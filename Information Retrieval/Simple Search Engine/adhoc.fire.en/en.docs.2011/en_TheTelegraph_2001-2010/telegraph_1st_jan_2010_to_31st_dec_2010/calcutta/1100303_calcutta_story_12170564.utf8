  Home is where the hostage is           A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	A failed attempt to mobilise funds for the Indian Mujahideen in two Indian cities prompted extortion kingpin Aamir Reza Khan to shift focus to a soft target he knew well: hometown Calcutta.        
	Investigators probing the pay up-or-be-abducted complaints lodged with the detective department of the city police have learnt that Aamirs men failed to intimidate businessmen in Delhi and Surat.        
	The targets brushed aside the ransom calls considering the Asif Reza Commando Force (ARCF) run by Aamir is a spent force. Aamir then decided to target businessmen in Calcutta, said an officer of the Special Task Force (STF) of Calcutta police.        
	According to the police, Aamir  who grew up in Beniapukur and floated the terror outfit after the death of his brother Asif  zeroed in on Calcutta to capitalise on the home advantage.        
	Intelligence reports have confirmed that Aamir, one of the co-founders of the Indian Mujahideen (suspected to be a joint front of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Simi), has a strong network in the city and its fringes.         
	Aamir and his group knew that although the name ARCF failed to terrorise businessmen in other cities, a mere mention of the Khadims abduction and the American Center attack would yield the desired results in Calcutta, an officer said.         
	The fledgling ARCF  formed after Asifs death in an encounter with the police in Gujarat in 2001  was behind the Khadims abduction in 2001 and the American Center attack in 2002.         
	The preliminary investigation into the cash-or-kidnap plot has revealed that Aamirs local contacts were asked to scan business volumes and identify targets who would give in easily.        
	Till Tuesday evening, the detective department had received complaints from two prominent business houses about extortion calls laced with abduction threats.         
	Police sources have confirmed that such calls have been made to two other companies, though neither has yet lodged a complaint.         
	We are taking these calls seriously as the caller identified himself as Aamir. After all, Aamir Reza Khan had provided Aftab Ansari (on death row for masterminding the American Center attack and facing a life sentence for the Khadims kidnapping) logistical support for both, said an STF officer.         
	According to the police files, Aamir had arranged for the four persons  Jamaluddin Nasir, Niyaz, Faiyaz and Abdullah  who had kidnapped Partha Pratim Roy Burman of Khadims.        
	Nasir, from Tiljala and the only one to be arrested, had also provided refuge to the American Center assailants.        
	The underworld has never been organised in Calcutta unlike in some other cities. But people like Aamir are capable of forming their own extortion and kidnapping network in a very short time, said an officer.         
	The city police have received information about Aamir being in touch with terror operatives from Pakistan in the city and also playing a role in the counterfeit currency racket.        
	Lower-tier Simi members in the city form the backbone of Aamirs network, police sources said.        
	These Simi activists went underground after the organisation was banned in 2003 and most of its senior leaders were arrested.        
	We have intelligence inputs about a large number of Simi activists working for the Indian Mujahideen in the eastern part of the city and its fringes, an officer said.

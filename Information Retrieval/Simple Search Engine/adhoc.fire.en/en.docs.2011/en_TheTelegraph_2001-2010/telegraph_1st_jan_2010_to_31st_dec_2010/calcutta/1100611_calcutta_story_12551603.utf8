The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayoral tug-of-war across rooms   Thrust and parry
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayoral tug-of-war across rooms
  - Bikashs arrival queers pitch for Sovan follow-up on monsoon mission          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              Sovan Chatterjee and Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya at the CMC headquarters on Thursday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)				                                       
	Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya bristled in his room, Sovan Chatterjee sulked in the conference hall and officials caught in the cold war sought sanctuary in their immediate bosss chamber as Act II of the Battle of Mayors descended into farce on Thursday.        
	2.30pm: Chatterjee has just walked into the conference hall with his entourage to hold a follow-up meeting on his monsoon mission, which he had kickstarted on Tuesday. But unlike the buzz that day, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation looks unusually quiet on Thursday.        
	The lull before the storm.        
	 Why should he ask me to go and meet him instead of coming here? I wont go, thunders Jol Sovan, raining down on municipal commissioner Arnab Roys messenger, who has just come in with a plea from his boss.        
	Roy has apparently requested Chatterjee and his entourage to come to his room to avert a repeat of Tuesdays protocol breach when the mayor-select had convened a de facto mayoral meeting in the conference hall.        
	As luck would have it, mayor-in-exit Bhattacharyya has just landed up, perhaps eager to prove that he is still the boss. Their paths dont cross, but Chatterjee and Bhattacharyya look to be in the mood for a tug-of-war even from separate rooms.        
	The heads of various departments have already gone into a huddle in the municipal commissioners chamber wondering what to do when in walks Trinamul councillors Firhad Bobby Hakim, Rajib Deb and Atin Ghosh. Chatterjee and colleague Sachchidananda Banerjee have stayed back in the conference hall.        
	The meeting barely begins when Roys phone rings. Its the mayor. Silence in the packed room.I have to go. The mayor wants to see me, the commissioner announces. Roy returns after 10 minutes, by which time the heat of the debate in his air-conditioned chamber is more than the Celsius outside.                    
	Why do you claim in a booklet (Which way is Calcutta progressing?) that pumping stations have been set up everywhere when borough 14 (including Chatterjees ward 131) doesnt have even one? questions Hakim.        
	Some of the stations mentioned there are proposed ones, replies an official. So its an eyewash? charges Deb.        
	Meeting over. Chatterjee promptly issues a release detailing why he wanted to take stock before taking charge.        
	Mayor Bhattacharyya has left by then, having made his point by summoning the municipal commissioner midway through the meeting.         
	His parting shot? The officials could have refused to hold a meeting but they didnt because they are decent.        
	didnt because they are decent.

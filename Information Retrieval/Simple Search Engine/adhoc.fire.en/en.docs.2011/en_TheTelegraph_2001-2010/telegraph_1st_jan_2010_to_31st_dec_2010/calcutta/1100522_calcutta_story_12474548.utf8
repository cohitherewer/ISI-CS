The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court stays CBI probe
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court stays CBI probe
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A division bench of the high court on Friday stayed the order of a trial judge of the court for a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the recruitment process of the college service commission.        
	The interim ruling of the bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice K.J. Sengupta followed a submission by advocate-general Balai Ray, who cited an apex court ruling to stress that high courts could order a CBI probe only in matters of national importance.        
	The college service commission has been accused of committing irregularities during the appointment of a lecturer in anthropology for a college. This is not a matter of national importance, Ray said.        
	The bench stayed the probe and fixed the matter for hearing on June 17.        
	Justice Debasish Kargupta had on May 5 ordered the CBI probe following a petition by Suman Kalyan Samanta, a resident of Tamluk, who had applied for the post of a lecturer in anthropology in Vidyasagar University in response to an advertisement.        
	Samanta had submitted before the trial judge that the commission had called him for an interview in March 2006 but did not inform him about the outcome. On March 20, 2007, the panel published another advertisement seeking applications for the post of an anthropology lecturer at Vidyasagar University.        
	Samanta wrote to the commission asking whether anyone had been selected from the earlier interview. In his reply, commission secretary Kalipada Das said the second advertisement had been published in anticipation of a vacancy.        
	Samanta then moved a petition in the high court, following which Justice Kargupta asked the commission chairman to state details of the recruitment process.        
	The papers submitted by the panel revealed that the selection committee had found none of the candidates who had appeared in the interview fit for the post but the documents bore the signature of only one of the four selectors. Justice Kargupta then ordered the CBI to probe the matter.

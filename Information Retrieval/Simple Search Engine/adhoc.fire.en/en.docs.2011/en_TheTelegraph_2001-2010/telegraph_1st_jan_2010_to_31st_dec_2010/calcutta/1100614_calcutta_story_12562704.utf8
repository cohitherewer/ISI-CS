                      Celebrating with theatre                    Theatre lovers in the city have cause to celebrate this week with Katha Collage Utsav, a five-day theatre festival hosted by Little Thespian. Dedicated to Rabindranath Tagore, it is being held in association with the ministry of culture, Government of India and National School of Drama, New Delhi. Featuring a total of 16 plays by celebrated playwrights, it discusses a variety of issues relevant to the present. The last day of the festival will host a seminar on Story Theatre, participated by renowned theatre personalities, scholars, poets and critics. To be inaugurated today at 6 pm, the first play to be staged this evening is Tagores Duraasha (design and direction: Uma Jhunjhunwala; a scene from the play appears here). It is a tragic tale of love that depicts how true devotion led a Muslim princess to change her entire identity and existence, only to be forsaken due to her Hindu lovers false bigotry. Shailendars Sapne Ki Baat (design and direction: Uma Jhunjhunwala) protests the non-inclusion of women in funeral processions. Set against the background of Hindu-Muslim riots, Saadat Hassan Mantos Sahay (design and direction: S.M. Azhar Alam) shows how religion affects the relationship between two friends of different religions. The play attempts to highlight the superiority of human feelings and values above religious fundamentalism. Prof. Muzaffar Hanfis Ishq Par Zor (design and direction: Uma Jhunjhunwala) is about a love-sick blind servant, who reveals the various relationship problems in his masters family.

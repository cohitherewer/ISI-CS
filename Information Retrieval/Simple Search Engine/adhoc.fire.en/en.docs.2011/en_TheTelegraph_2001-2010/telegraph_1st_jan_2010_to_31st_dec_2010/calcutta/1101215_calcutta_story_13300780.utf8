 - Chamber escape route for book fair          OUR BUREAU                                    People throng the 33rd Calcutta Book Fair at the Milan Mela fairground on the EM Bypass last year and (above) one of the pavilions during the 2009 edition of the Industrial India Trade Fair at the same venue                                        
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Tuesday allowed itself to be arm-twisted by an industry chamber into climbing down on the new Milan Mela rent, paving the way for the Calcutta Book Fair organisers to claim the same benefit.        
	The Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI), which organises the Industrial India Trade Fair (IITF), told finance minister Asim Dasgupta that the government, a co-organiser, must scale down the rent if it wanted the fair to be held.         
	Hours later, Dasgupta announced: The problem is solved. I have told the BNCCI they can go ahead with the fair.        
	Asked if he would similarly consider the Publishers and Booksellers Guilds plea for a discount, Dasgupta told Metro: I have not received anything in writing yet. When approached formally, I would consider the plea.        
	Neither the government nor the chamber would reveal what the deal was, but sources said only a significant discount could have broken the deadlock as the trade bodys demand was to scale down the rent to 2009 levels or be prepared for a cancellation.        
	The 10-day fair is scheduled to begin on December 24.        
	Four days ago, the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation had informed the chamber that it would have to pay Rs 2 crore more than last year for its 20-day occupation of the complex, starting December 17. The chamber had paid Rs 50 lakh for the entire period last year.        
	We had told the government that the fair was being held in association with the state government and a pullout would be an embarrassment not only for us but also for the government. We had sought an immediate meeting with Asim Dasgupta in the absence of (industries minister) Nirupam Sen, said a chamber official.        
	Asimbabus go-ahead can only mean the government has accepted our demand. Increasing the rent by five times only a fortnight before the fair was unfair. We had booked the ground months in advance, he added.        
	Asked if the rent had been reduced five-fold in keeping with the chambers request, Dasgupta said: I have told them everything. Please ask them. I shouldnt comment further as the concerned minister (Sen) is out of town.        
	Sen, a wing under whose ministry controls Milan Mela, had on Saturday strongly advocated the need to charge users according to facilities provided.        
	He had even said that the Calcutta Book Fair, which enjoys the chief ministers personal patronage, was a commercial venture and did not necessarily deserve a tariff subsidy, appearing to take a stand contrary to that of Bhattacharjee.        
	They only do business there, Sen had said, indicating his reluctance to cut the rent for the 12-day fair  to be held at Milan Mela from January 26  as the Publishers and Booksellers Guild had requested.        
	The guild has been given a Rs 3.14-crore rent estimate for the 12-day fair.        
	Sen was attending a party programme in Hyderabad on Tuesday when Dasgupta announced the problem is solved. He could not be reached for comment.        
	Chief minister Bhattacharjee, with whom Sen has not been on the same page on several issues related to the party, had once famously said that the book fair could not be seen purely as a business because it helps develop readers intellect.        
	It was not clear on Tuesday whether his government was reluctant to see even business as business.         
	Asked about the expected rent slash for the industry chamber, a senior official of the industries department said: It is a sensitive issue and, ideally, the minister should comment.        
	Writers sources said the government would set a precedent by agreeing to give the chamber the fairground for an amount close to last years rent.

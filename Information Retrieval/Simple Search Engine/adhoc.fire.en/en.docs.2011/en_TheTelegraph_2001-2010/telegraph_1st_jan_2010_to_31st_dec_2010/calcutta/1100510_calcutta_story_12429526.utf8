The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traditional forms amp; avant-garde idioms
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Traditional forms amp; avant-garde idioms
          SOMAK GHOSHAL                          The artists whose works are on display at Studio 21. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	If you expect to see specimens of traditional printmaking at the tersely named exhibition, Prints 21, which opened at Studio 21 on Friday, then you are in for a surprise.        
	As you walk into the Dover Terrace gallery, which is steadily making a name for itself as a platform for aspiring artists, you are startled by a shrill voice crying, Bachao, bachao.        
	On a TV screen in the outer room, a 20-second-long video plays in loop. A young man, seated at a table, toys with a tiny but scantily dressed blonde girl, who looks like a genie out of a bottle.        
	After poking her around for a few moments, the man, ignoring her urgent cries for help, grasps her and pretends to gobble her up.        
	Goofily called Gullivers Travels, this is Sujay Mukherjees contribution to this show, where traditional forms of expression jostle for space with avant-garde idioms.        
	Judging by the quirky photographs and bizarre installations displayed all around, it seems as if established modes of printmaking have been pushed to the margins by new media.        
	In each of the rooms, you hear new voices, confident and tech-savvy, speaking of the trials and terrors of the modern world.        
	Dhrupadi Ghose, for instance, creates a montage of eerie photographs, of gagged or half-buried women, called Pardon Silence. The glazed eyes and deadpan faces are disturbing, as if they have seen too much of the world and been through too many ordeals for their tender age.        
	A similar angst, resonant of the violence and destruction of our times, comes through in Santanu Chakrabortys lithographs. The diabolical claws and vivid splashes of red, like freshly drawn blood, shake you up.        
	Jaysree Basak and Riddhi Narayan Nandy use conventional processes of printmaking, but their work is no less adventurous for that reason. In fact, their technical sophistication and expertise are as impressive as the technological experiments that have been carried out by their contemporaries.        
	Basaks gigantic fly set against a backdrop of flora and fauna and her image of a winged female torso, sans head and hands, are soothing to look at. The elegance and exquisite finish of these works exude a certain old-world charm. The vortex of colours and puzzling shapes, spiralling and melting into one another, in Nandys work, are vintage Op Art.        
	Annabel Schenck, educated in Paris, Strasbourg and currently enrolled at Kala Bhavan, Visva-Bharati University, treads the line between the familiar and the unusual. Her work, Endoscopy, is part-sculpture, part-print. It is framed by a block of wood with a gaping hole in it. Move back a few steps, and it seems as if you are looking at a battered skeleton in profile. Now come closer and peer through the gap, which looks like an empty eye-socket, to see the image hanging behind. Given the title of the work, you feel as if you are prying inside a body. Not a pleasant activity at all, but then, Schenck seems to be inspired by the dark and the uncanny.        
	Srikanta Pauls woodcuts, hanging in one of the outer rooms, are amusing to look at. Jai Bajrang Bali, which has been touched up with acrylic, depicts the monkey god in khaki and is prettily tongue in cheek. So is the masked family in a boat in another woodcut. But wait till you come to his hydra-headed installation, with wooden tentacles that seem to be wriggling and a cluster of eyes that stares out blankly. As the backlit vinyl lights up from time to time, you see harrowing images come to life before quietly fading away. Creepy is the word that comes to mind.

	It was their way of knowing the Nobel laureate a little better. About 650 students of Loreto Day School, Elliot Road, presented a cultural extravaganza, Salutation, last month to pay tribute to Rabindranath Tagore.         
	Students from classes VI to XII performed for more than an hour at Kala Mandir.         
	Since its Tagores 150th birth anniversary, we wanted to organise a cultural do on a grand scale. A lot of effort went behind the musical. It also turned out to be a huge learning experience for the students. They got to know Tagore better. Many participants got so interested in Tagore that they started reading parts of Geetanjali, said Sister Shalini Rozario, the principal.         
	The performance was the fruit of two months of rigorous rehearsals and five months of research by choreographer Neelay Sengupta and the teachers of the school. We have tried to capture the life of Tagore through the audio-visual medium and even used paintings and clippings from Santiniketan, said Neelay Sengupta, the creative head of Odissi Vision and Movement Centre, Calcutta.         
	We not only practised hard, we also spent hours on research. I went to Santiniketan to take pictures and collect paintings that could be used in the performance, said Sengupta.        
	The result of their effort was a huge hit with the audience. The programme was packed with songs like Aaguner parashmani chhoao prane, Megher koley rod eshechhe and Hare re re re amay chhere dere re re, apart from excerpts from Valmiki Pratibha and Chandalika. Chitrangada, a dance drama based on the story of Manipurs princess who falls in love with Arjuna, the third Pandava  drew an ovation.         
	The curtains were drawn with Aaji dakshin dooar khola. Narration by Gauri Basu, the senior school coordinator of Loreto House, brought alive the act.         
	Reading about Tagore is not that interesting as performing his plays and then learning from them. I will never forget the significance of Chandalika because I have performed in the dance drama, smiled a Class X student.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rally ruckus takes the cake
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rally ruckus takes the cake
          KINSUK BASU                          An almost deserted New Market on Thursday afternoon. (Anindya Ray)                                  
	The daily disruption caused by political rallies at the city centre this year-end has taken a toll on New Market confectioners. With customers not being able to make it to the heritage shop stop, footfall has dipped in stores, forcing employees to throw away unsold cakes and pastries at night.         
	While the overall customer count has dropped around 40 per cent, confectioners are feeling the pinch more because their sales usually peak during Christmas-New Year.         
	This year has been worst in terms of sales because of a rally a day in the Xmas week, according to owners of savouries shops.         
	When you have to throw away cakes and pastries at this time of the year, it hurts. We register our highest sales during the year-end but not if there are rallies in Metro Channel. Our customers cannot visit our shops and as a result confectionery items are being wasted daily, said Asif Rehman, the 35-year-old co-owner of Imperial Bakers and Confectioners in New Market.        
	Thousands who otherwise shop at malls, visit New Market around this time of the year. The unending chain of rallies has kept them away. The footfall has come down by nearly 40 per cent, said Amar Gupta, president, SS Hogg Market Traders Association.        
	Lack of parking space is one of the reasons customers are staying away. Apart from the Simplex plaza, visitors to New Market park on JL Nehru Road, opposite The Oberoi Grand. All the parking slots at the plaza are not open every day. When rallies are held, even the alternative is not available, said a shop-owner.

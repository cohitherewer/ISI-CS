          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The HS council plans to empower schools to hold the Class XI final examinations on their own from the next academic session.        
	The council has been setting question papers of the Class XI exams since the HS course was bifurcated in 2007. According to the proposal to overhaul the HS, the schools will continue to evaluate the answer scripts as they had done this year.        
	The long-term plans include replacement of terminal exams with unit tests to ensure continuous assessment of students.        
	We are ready with the draft plan. But before finalising its implementation we will have to hold a series of discussions with teachers and heads of HS schools across the state, said a senior official of the council.        
	The council on Friday discussed the proposal with representatives of teachers bodies. We will hold another round of meeting with teachers after the puja holidays and take a call on whether we can implement the plan from next year, said the official.        
	After the bifurcation, the responsibility of holding the Class XI final exams rested with the council. When it found it difficult to conduct two centralised exams  the Class XI annual exams and the HS  the schools were given the responsibility of evaluating the answer scripts and preparing the results.        
	The All Bengal Teachers Association (ABTA), a CPM-controlled body of secondary and higher secondary school teachers, is opposed to the plan to allow the schools full freedom in conducting the Class XI exams, said a source.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Darwin and the arts
                                              Gillian Beer at Marble Palace. (Sudeshna Banerjee)        
	A conference in Colombia. Three changes of flights to reach Heathrow. Taking a plane within hours to the other end of the globe  via Delhi to Calcutta. All at the ripe age of 75, travelling alone. A perfect example of survival of the fittest.         
	Professor Gillian Beer, a Darwin specialist, was in town recently. The King Edward VII Professor Emeritus at the University of Cambridge delivered a series of lectures, including at the Book Fair, on the naturalist whose bicentenary was celebrated in 2009.         
	I developed an interest in Darwin while reading Charles Kingsleys The Water Babies. It was permeated with evolutionary ideas. I was struck by a scene where Mother Carey sits on her throne and creatures pour away from it. She lets things make themselves, she said.         
	Beer delivered two papers at the Centre for Studies in Romantic Literature conference. She was in town on invitation from Malabika Sarkar of the centre. In Darwin and Romanticism, Beer sought to establish that the creator of an evolutionary worldview that led to the growth of realism was influenced, especially with regard to language, not so much by contemporary Victorian writers as by the Romantics.         
	At a conference organised by Jadavpur Universitys department of English, Beer spoke on Darwin and the Arts, recalling the young Darwins intense response to the concerts at Kings College Chapel. His response to music was visceral, Beer said, and he used musical analogies to describe key moments like his encounter with the Fuegian man. At the Book Fair, she spoke on Darwins Curiosity.         
	Beer, a Dame Commander of the British Empire for services to English literature, was instrumental in introducing the world to Arundhati Roy.         
	I read God of Small Things while it was still in proof. She has a good ear for dialogue and did fresh things with the form of the novel, recalled the chairperson of the 1997 Booker Prize panel.         
	On a tour of the city, Beer explored Marble Palace with pianist Sourendro Mullick, a member of the family, as guide, and Jorasanko Thakurbari.

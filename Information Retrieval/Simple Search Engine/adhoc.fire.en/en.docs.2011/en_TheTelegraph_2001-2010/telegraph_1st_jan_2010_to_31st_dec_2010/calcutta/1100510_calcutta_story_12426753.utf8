The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | English sections in state-run schools
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      English sections in state-run schools
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Left Front government has come full circle, clearing the decks to open English-medium units in state-run schools around 30 years after banishing the language from the primary curricula.        
	A school education department official said four state-run schools in the city  Ballygunge Government, Bethune Collegiate, Sakhawat Memorial and Alipore Multipurpose  and six in the districts would introduce English-medium units at the plus-II level from the academic session starting July.        
	Bengali has traditionally been the language of instruction in all 42 state-run schools across Bengal.        
	We have received a circular from the government allowing us to start our English-medium unit at the plus-II level. We are ready to admit students in the new unit from the next session, said Rupak Hom Roy, the headmaster of the state-run Ballygunge Government School.        
	The government has started the process to recruit teachers for the new units but for now the extra workload will have to be shared by the existing teachers. The government has sanctioned five teaching posts for our English-medium units, said Hom Roy.         
	Of the 42 state-run schools, 18 have sought consent to open English-medium wings.        
	After inspecting the 18 schools, we have shortlisted 10 that have the infrastructure to run Bengali and English-medium wings simultaneously. These include Ballygunge Government, Bethune Collegiate, Sakhawat Memorial and Alipore Multipurpose, said an official in the school education department.        
	The government has sanctioned funds to upgrade the infrastructure of the remaining eight applicants so that they can open the wings next year. Among these eight are Hindu School, Hare School, BD Government School (Salt Lake) and Sanskrit Collegiate School.        
	Most of the 42 state-run schools are by and large fit to run English-medium units along with the Bengal-medium ones. But we want to ensure that each school opening the new section has the required facilities and adequate teachers. So we are now being very selective, the official said.        
	The Left Fronts allergy to English was first manifested in the early 1980s when it banished the language till Class V. But an increasing urge among middle-class parents to educate their children in English forced the government to review its stand and reintroduce the subject in the primary level in phases.        
	A similar demand had in 2008 prompted the government to announce plans to make the language it was once opposed to the medium of instruction in its schools.        
	But the plan had to be shelved when it came up for discussion in the state cabinet following objections from RSP minister Kshiti Goswami, who demanded that the matter be referred to the Left Fronts education cell.        
	The issue was revived last year when school education minister Partha De asserted in the Assembly that the government would start English-medium units in state-run schools, signalling a determination to ignore opposition from the anti-English lobby in the ruling coalition.

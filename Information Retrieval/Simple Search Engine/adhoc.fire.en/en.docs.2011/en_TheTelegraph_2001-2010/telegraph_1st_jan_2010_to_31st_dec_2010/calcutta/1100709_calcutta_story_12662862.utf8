                A 45-year-old woman was beaten up by her tenants on Thursday afternoon after she asked them to vacate the premises for the second time in six days. Henna Ghosh had obtained a court order allowing her to evict the tenants from her two-storeyed house on SK Deb Road in Lake Town on July 2. Armed with the order she evicted the tenants on the same day with the help of police and the court bailiff. The tenants, however, broke into and reclaimed the ground floor on July 3.																																																								  Ghosh, who does not live in her Lake Town house, came there on Thursday and found it occupied by the tenants. On asking them to leave, she was beaten up and drenched in kerosene by the women of the family. She managed to flee and call the police. But the tenants also attacked cops when they reached the spot. The police later returned with women constables and arrested the five women of the tenant family who had attacked Ghosh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stephen Court, a life gone by
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen Court, a life gone by
                                        Moon Moon Sen at SSKM Hospital on Tuesday, where she had rushed to search for a friend rsquo;s mother who lives in Stephen Court. She later learnt that the old lady was safe. (Anindya Shankar Ray)    
	For Moon Moon Sen, Park Street has always been much more than a street. On Tuesday, traumatised by the fear of losing loved ones in the Stephen Court blaze, she could not bear to talk about her relationship with Park Street. On Wednesday, she managed to send Metro an SMS              
	Like Calcutta, now Stephen Court is burning up our wonderful past and in a way our future. How can we preserve our heritage when we have never bothered to maintain it?        
	My youth, my loves and joys were so much a part of Park Street.        
	Waldorf, lunch with Tinku; American chop suey at Flurys, where Habi proposed; Pam Crain, my heroine at Blue Fox; Mocambo jam sessions; Trincas music, Biddu ever sexy Peter Yetti.        
	My friends Khem Rana, Mo Shivdasani Anju/Arun, Anju Malhotra, Mika Johnnie Pitts, Raj Lal; the kathi rolls at Karnani Mansion; lunches with Ma (Suchitra Sen) at Moulin Rouge. Delilah.        
	Nothing to cling to but to enjoy. Like Stephen Court, a life gone by.

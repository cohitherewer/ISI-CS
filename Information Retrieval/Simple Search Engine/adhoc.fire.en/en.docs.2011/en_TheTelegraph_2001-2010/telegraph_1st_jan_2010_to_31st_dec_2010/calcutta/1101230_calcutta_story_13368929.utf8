                      Game of death                    Critically acclaimed Indian novelist Aasif Wadia is working on his new story. Its about an architect who designs the most perfect crime. Its about a pawn and a king and their tilting equations within the realms of 64 squares, and its about an act of betrayal in love, born out of love. Its Wadias most calculated, most conniving and most well-conceived story ever. But this time, his story is not meant to be written into a novel! This evening, Nine Point Blank presents its maiden Hindi production, Ahliyat. Based on a Tony Award winning play, it is a dark, edgy, comic thriller about lies, deceit, murder, mayhem and a game of chess. Devious, ingenious and full of twists and turns, this play has all the ingredients to make it an evening to die for! Cast: Anshuman Bagri, Aamil Keeyan Khan and others.                    Event: Play in Hindi, Ahliyat, produced by Nine Point Blank When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

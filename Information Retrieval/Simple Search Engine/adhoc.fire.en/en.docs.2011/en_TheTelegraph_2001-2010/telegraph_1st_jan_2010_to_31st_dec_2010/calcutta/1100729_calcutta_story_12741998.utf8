The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More teeth for medical council
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      More teeth for medical council
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The health department has given more teeth to the state medical council by making it mandatory for doctors facing negligence charges to appear before it when summoned.        
	The West Bengal Medical Council Bill, 2009, passed by the Assembly on Wednesday, says the council can set up penal ethical cases committees that can summon doctors and witnesses for alleged medical negligence.        
	Earlier, it was not mandatory for a doctor to appear before the council during a hearing. Now, if a doctor or witness fails to appear, he/she will face legal action, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said. The existing Bengal Medical Act, 1914, stands repealed.        
	Health department officials said that on several occasions doctors and witnesses had not turned up before the council, delaying decisions.        
	As part of the other changes, the council members have been given the right to elect their president and vice-president. In the earlier system, the incumbents used to be government nominees. The government will nominate the president and vice-president only if the council fails to elect them, Mishra said.        
	The registration of doctors who are no longer citizens of India will be cancelled. If a doctor living abroad wants to practice here, he or she has to temporarily register with the Medical Council of India, said a state council official.        
	The council will have a permanent address at Salt Lakes IB Block

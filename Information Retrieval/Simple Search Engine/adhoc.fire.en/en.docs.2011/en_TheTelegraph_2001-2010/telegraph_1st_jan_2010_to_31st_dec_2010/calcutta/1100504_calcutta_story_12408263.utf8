	A division bench of the high court on Monday denied bail to Tarun Bagaria, the caretaker of Stephen Court who was arrested after the March 23 blaze that killed 43 people.         
	The bench comprising Justice S.P. Talukdar and Justice P.K. Dey declined bail after public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami held Bagaria responsible for the death of 43 persons at the Park Street building.        
	The caretaker could have helped firemen, life-saving commandos, police and others to save people trapped in the building. He possessed a key to the lock on the collapsible gate of the roof. At least 17 people, who died on a Block II staircase leading to the roof, could have been saved had the caretaker given them the key, Goswami told the court.        
	He said the cops had booked Bagaria under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 308 (attempt to culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code.         
	The two main charges are serious in nature, so the court should not grant the accused bail at this stage, argued Goswami.         
	Bagarias advocate Sekhar Basu claimed his client had been made a scapegoat by the police. He was a mere maintenance employee in the building. But the investigators dubbed him the caretaker of the building and thrust all responsibilities on him. How could my client have acted without instructions from his superiors? Basu argued while moving the bail petition.        
	After hearing both sides, the bench declined to grant bail to Bagaria. Ram Shankar Singh, 62, a relative of Tarun Bagaria, who was also arrested in connection with the case, is behind bars too.         
	On Monday, an inspection team visited Stephen Court to probe the cause of the fire. This was the second visit of the team led by former chief secretary Sourindranath Roy.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Three men died and three were seriously injured in four accidents in the city on Monday.        
	Around Sunday midnight, Raghiv Ali, a 21-year-old resident of Sir Syed Ahmed Road off Park Circus, lost control of his motorbike and rammed into a roadside wall while riding with his friend Sheikh Rahaman. The accident took place on Sundari Mohan Avenue, off Linton Street.        
	Ali was declared dead on arrival at National Medical College and Hospital. Rahamans condition is critical, said a doctor.        
	None of them was wearing a helmet. Ali was probably riding at a very high speed and could not control his bike at a curve and crashed into the wall, said an officer of Beniapukur police station.        
	Around 12.15am, Mahavir Yadav, an autorickshaw driver, died after an unidentified goods vehicle hit his auto near the crossing of Aurobindo Sarani and Raja Dinendra Street.        
	Police said Yadav was going from Hatibagan towards Ultadanga when the goods vehicle hit the auto, flinging him on the road. The three-wheeler fell on Yadav, crushing him.        
	Police took Yadav to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	Autos on the Ultadanga-Sovabazar route did not ply on Monday to mourn Yadavs death.        
	Around 5.30am, Pijush Das, a 40-year-old resident of Barisha, was hit by a vehicle while crossing SP Mukherjee Road near Mudiali. He was taken to MR Bangur Hospital with severe leg and spine injuries.        
	Das, who worked for a builder, was returning home after work when he was hit.        
	Debasish Talukder, a 45-year-old resident of Agarpara, was hit by a Mahindra Bolero at the Kamarhati crossing on BT Road around 12.30pm on Monday. Talukder was initially taken to Sagar Dutta Memorial Hospital, from where he was shifted to RG Kar Hospital, where he died.        
	Lenin Sheikh, a 35-year-old Murshidabad resident, was injured after he was hit by a taxi on Kingsway, near Eden Gardens, on Monday. He was admitted to SSKM Hospital.        
	Police said Sheikh was hit by the taxi while he was crossing the road and was admitted to SSKM Hospital with a fractured leg. Police arrested the driver.

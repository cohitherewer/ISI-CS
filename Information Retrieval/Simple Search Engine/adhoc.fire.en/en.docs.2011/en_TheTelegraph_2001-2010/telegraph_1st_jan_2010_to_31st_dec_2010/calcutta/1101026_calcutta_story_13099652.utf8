          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two men were arrested and jewellery worth Rs 20 lakh was seized from them on Monday, a day after five armed youths cleaned out a jewellery store in Howrah.        
	The arrested includes Dinabandhu Debnath, the storeowners driver. He had been missing after the Sunday morning heist at RK Jewellers in which ornaments worth Rs 30 lakh were stolen.         
	Debnath, who had worked in Mumbai for 30 years, was an assistant at the shop before joining as the driver six months ago. Four men were arrested at Domjur, 15km from the store, for allegedly buying the stolen jewellery.        
	Howrah police superintendent H.K. Kusumakar said: Debnath masterminded the heist. We checked the stores CCTV and found him constantly talking on his cellphone.

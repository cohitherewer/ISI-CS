          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An eight-year-old girl returning home from school was crushed under the wheels of a taxi near Kazipara, under Shibpur police station, in Howrah on Tuesday morning.        
	Sahana Parvin, a Class II student of Madrasa Korania Primary School, was crossing the road alone when the taxi rammed into her, killing her on the spot. The driver fled with the vehicle.        
	Residents blocked GT Road for nearly two hours to protest the mishap and damaged some vehicles. The driver of another taxi was dragged out of his vehicle and beaten up, said witnesses.        
	Senior district police officers persuaded the demonstrators to lift the blockade.         
	Hyder Ali, 40, Sahanas father, said: My daughter used to return from school around 10.30am. Today the school gave over early.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Down a pavement that isnt
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Down a pavement that isnt
  - As the government woos hawkers with ID cards, Metro takes a walk on the wild side        CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA                                                  
	An impressive amount of pavement survives under the Indian Museum. It must be the influence of history. At other places hawkers have just trampled it under their feet.        
	The hawker-zone on Chowringhee, if one is walking towards Esplanade, springs up near Park Street Metro station. Under food stalls that come up in the afternoons sending up conflicting aromas of thick sliced bread wrapped in fried egg, chilli chicken and momos, the pavement disappears.        
	So its a relief when you approach the Indian Museum. Were you overreacting because other people were eating delectable, crisp vadas?        
	For under the grand, serene shadow of the museum, hawkers have organised themselves on two sides of the pavement, leaving a broad expanse  almost 10 feet at places  between the two rows, one bordering on the museum, the other on Chowringhee.        
	There is a sense of leisure and well-being as you pick up ladies T-shirts at Rs 35 each, stuff that the stall-owner says is export surplus. There are memsahibs in loose white shirts and striped cotton pants. Two stalls sell womens underwear, of exquisitely small sizes. One stall sells old books. Others sell wooden knick-knacks, carved, apparently from Kashmir.        
	You dont mind. You feel like a tourist.         
	But the feeling is shortlived, for the real pavement business takes off from here. From now on, the same stalls reappear again and again, with no space in between them. The shouting, the sellers, the shoppers and the passing crowd give it a sense of a sustained daily carnival, but your sense is bombarded by seeing the same things again and again. You see nothing else. You just see mens T-shirts, as you bump into someone in front of you or he bumps into you.        
	As you cross Zaranj, the stalls also sell readymade garments, belts, bags, watches, FM radios. The electronic gadgets are sold from small glass cabinets stuck to the building wall. Everything is shiny, glittery, shimmering. As you cross the building that was formerly Tiger cinema but now is a huge cheap garments shop, two hawkers wave T-shirts at you from both sides. You can get hurt. You have had a narrow escape.        
	Now you have stepped into the Grand Hotel arcade. What was once so. For now the drama on the pavement can claim all the attention. There are too many people, office-goers from Esplanade, shoppers from New Market.        
	The sellers of mens T-shirts seem to be singing a well-practised chorus, poishotti taka, poishotti taka, poishotti taka, and sometimes they tend to throw themselves, along with their ware, at you.        
	Theres a wide range of mens briefs here  imitation Jockeys; potential women customers are invited to them too.        
	Its impossible to talk on the cellphone, the noise-level is so high.        
	By this time, you must have been molested once.         
	Then you realise why as you progress towards Dharamtala the hawkers get more vocal. They are competing with the party people screaming at the meeting ground in the Metro channel. A party leader seems to have gone crazy, possibly about the impending bandh, and his words are hitting the passers-by hard, but not a syllable can be understood because two vendors are chanting ek sho taka, ek sho taka, ek sho taka.        
	They are selling cosmetics: shampoos, lotions, hair creams of all renowned brands, almost all for Rs 100. We get them from the customs department, one claims.         
	But as one crosses the next street and lurches towards the Esplanade Metro station, the stalls sprout even closer; there is an extended mens-boys section of T-shirts, jeans, shirts. Stores have joined in. Big Bazaar in Metropolitan Building is probably playing a well-known tune on guitar, but one cant really make out what it is.        
	Here the hawkers songs have been replaced by war cries, for the voice of the party leader here is even louder. In the light of a CD shop, a man suddenly leaps across from one end of the pavement  can we call it so any more?  to the other, crying He he he he he. He is a vendor too, but this is not to sell anything.         
	At this point, between the structure of the Esplanade Metro station and closed Ashok Restaurant, the pavement stops. There is nothing of it left.        
	Its the end of the road for the pedestrian.

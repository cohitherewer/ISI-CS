                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Neglect cry in aged Metro passengers death
          SANJAY MANDAL                          Prasun Ghosh, who was in the team that took Mukherjee to hospital. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	A 65-year-old man fell ill at Netaji Bhavan Metro Railway station and died after being left unattended by the staff for half an hour on Tuesday.        
	A few fellow passengers said they carried Jiban Krishna Mukherjee on a stretcher brought by Metro employees to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him dead. The Metro authorities, however, claimed that some of their employees had accompanied the team that took Mukherjee to hospital.        
	The Taltala resident, who ran an electrical equipment repairing store on Lenin Sarani, had boarded the south-bound train at Esplanade on his way to a diagnostic centre in Bhowanipore to get some blood tests done.        
	Family sources said he was a diabetic and had once suffered cardiac arrest.        
	The train entered Netaji Bhavan station at 1.40pm. Witnesses said he had been breathing heavily and collapsed while getting off the train. We made him lie on the platform and alerted Metro officials, said Prasun Ghosh, a passenger on the same coach as Mukherjee.        
	A group of Metro officials came to the spot. Those who had gathered around the man said it was a medical team but there was no doctor. By then the man had apparently stopped breathing, recalled Ghosh.        
	He said the Metro team had brought a stretcher but made no attempt to take the elderly man to hospital.        
	We requested the officials to arrange for his treatment but they paid no heed to our pleas, alleged Biswajit Saha, another passenger.        
	The passengers were trying to revive him by giving him a cardiac massage. The Metro employees had left by then. We waited till 2.10pm but there was no hint of the authorities making any attempt to get the man treated. Finally, we (Saha, Ghosh and a few other passengers) carried him on the stretcher to Ramrik Das Haralalka Hospital, said Saha.        
	He had apparently suffered a stroke and died before being brought to the hospital, said P. Naskar, the medical officer on duty.        
	One of the passengers called Mukherjees wife Sheela from his cellphone.        
	The couple had been living alone for the past five years. Both their daughters are married, one living in Delhi and the other in Surat.        
	A Metro Railway official said: We had provided a stretcher and our men were in the team that carried Mukherjee to hospital. When Metro visited the hospital, a few minutes after Mukherjee had been brought in, no railway employee could be seen.        
	The official said there were no medical units at the stations. Our doctors, stationed in our hospital in Tollygunge, only attend to our staff. If a passenger falls ill, our duty ends with getting him admitted to hospital. The rest is the states responsibility.

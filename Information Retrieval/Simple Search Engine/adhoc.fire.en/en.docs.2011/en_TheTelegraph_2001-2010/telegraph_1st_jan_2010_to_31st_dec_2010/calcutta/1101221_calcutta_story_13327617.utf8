                      Celebration of crafts heritage                    Winter may have set in a little late, but now that its here, it has brought with it the spirit of Christmas. As in previous years, Artisana (Crafts Council of West Bengal) in association with the Office of the Development Commissioner (Handicrafts), and Ministry of Textiles, Govt of India, is hosting Burra Din, an exhibition of traditional handloom and handicraft. The purpose of the show is to reinvent crafts and to adapt them to todays scenario. The main attraction of the exhibition is balaposh, which was earlier used by the aristocracy (nawabs of Murshidabad) as shawls. Made in Murshidabad using a closely-guarded method, the weaver makes a soft quilt with a thin layer of attar-scented cotton between two silk layers using no quilting stitches at all. Apart from shawls, there will be taalpatar sepoy, bags made of dried and woven grass, jewellery boxes, shola lampshades, patachitra upon glass bottles, silver and thread jewellery and many more.

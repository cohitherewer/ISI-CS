The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tutors, coffers feel JU pinch

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Nearly 150 teachers were waiting in Jadavpur University examination halls when the bell rang at 11.30am on Monday to signal the start of the third day of the semester tests of the engineering faculty.         
	The teachers on invigilation duty  at least four in each hall  stayed put an hour but not a single student turned up on the third day of the examination boycott by the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu).        
	An hour has just been wasted, commented a teacher while leaving an examination hall at 12.30pm.         
	He and the other invigilators have no option but to show up for the exams, which will continue till December 4. They have to remain in the examination halls for at least an hour and then prepare a report and submit it to the examination department.        
	Only a handful of students support the boycott to pressure the university into withdrawing an FIR against 35 students who had clashed with police while trying to prevent the chief minister from leaving the campus on November 9. Many more have been forced by the union into skipping the exam, according to guardians who have lodged a complaint with the vice-chancellor.         
	Since JU is a state-funded university, the boycott is costing the Bengal exchequer dear.         
	The average monthly salary of university teachers is Rs 60,000. The 150 teachers on invigilation duty will basically be paid to sit patiently in the classrooms on the 13 days the exams are scheduled. This would result in a loss of several lakh rupees for the university and we have not even considered the non-teaching and technical staff on exam duty, explained a senior official of the universitys finance department.        
	The figure could cross Rs 20 lakh if the cost of organising the examination is considered.        
	Teachers are paid Rs 300 for setting a question paper on a subject. If the examination is held again, the bill for setting papers alone would be around Rs 3 lakh, added the official.        
	Satyaki Bhattacharya, the universitys controller of examinations, confirmed that no engineering student wrote the tests on Monday.        
	He repeated that there would be no change in the exam schedule.        
	Students of the science and arts faculties are not taking part in the boycott.

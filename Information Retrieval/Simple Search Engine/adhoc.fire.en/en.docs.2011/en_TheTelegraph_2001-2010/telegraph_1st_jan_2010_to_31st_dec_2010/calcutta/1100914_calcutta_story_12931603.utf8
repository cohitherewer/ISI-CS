	Remember Mother by helping someone in need                   
	Mother Teresa was a true Christian  she worshipped Christ with her body, mind and soul. She was a living saint, whose work could be linked to Peter, Paul or Matthews deeds in Biblical times. Her sincerity and dedication to serving God deserves every form of praise.           
	We celebrated yet another birth anniversary of Mother on August 26. She had given the city so much throughout her life. What have we given her in return? Can the official celebration, formalities, news reports and a reminder of the day be enough for this great person?           
	We do not spare a thought for street children or do something charitable. It is said that charity begins at home but is the city not our home? We blame our inaction on our busy schedule, the inefficient government and so on. However, loving people do not need an official start or publicity. An initiative can be started anytime and anywhere.           
	However, when we see a bleeding man on the road, we dont extend a helping hand as no one wants to be harassed by the police.

	Kudos to Metro for Night cops harass couple in a car, August 28. However, police harassment is nothing new in the city. In January 2007, I was returning late from Sector V after work. I was stopped near Nicco Park by a patrol van. Finding my car papers in order they challenged the authenticity of my cars pollution certificate.             
	They said they would have to seize my car papers till I produced a pollution certificate from a testing centre of their choice. I immediately understood what they wanted. They started the bargain at Rs 1,000 and settled at Rs 200.           
	Cops are just goons in uniforms.           
	Priyankar Mukherjee,           
	Purbachal Road North                     
	People face police harassment regularly. The report exposed how they are goons in uniform. I would like to know what action the home ministry takes against these bribe-hungry cops.           
	Subhash Sethi,

	Once I was riding my motorcycle down MG Road. At the crossing of MG Road and CR Avenue, a constable stopped me and demanded a fine of Rs 800. He said the stretch was not meant for bikes. But how was I supposed to know that unless the police put up signboards?           
	I am a student. I didnt have so much money on me. I tried to convince the cop that I was a law-abiding citizen and that I was wearing a helmet, too. But he was not ready to let me go. He allowed me to leave only after I paid him Rs 50. Are the top cops listening?           
	Mohammad Aman,           
	Address not given                     
	I have been extremely saddened by the report on police harrasment. After six decades of Independence we still have these problems. One cant even exercise ones basic rights.           
	Gautam Chattopadhyay,           
	Australia                     
	With the pujas approaching, incidents of cops making easy money by harassing citizens will become even more frequent.           
	A few years back, I had a similar experience during the day. My car was parked at the end of Landsdowne Road and I was inside a restaurant. The road seemed rather empty and of course the no-parking sign was not visible.           
	When I came out, a traffic cop demanded Rs 100 claiming that it was a no-parking zone. We had no option but to satisfy his demand.           
	Preet Lamba,           
	Address not given                     
	I congratulate Metro for exposing the terror unleashed by cops on city roads at night. People living in and around Salt Lake and in the vicinity of the EM Bypass try to get back home within 10pm, often because of security reasons coupled with the harassment and extortion at the hands of the police.           
	Calcutta cops are the weakest among all cities. They are so incompetent that the home ministry has to call in the army for handling a small protest by Muslims against Taslima Nasreen.           
	Policemen here are only capable of harassing couples in parks or on the road at night. Had there been a dedicated police station to lodge complaint against cops it would have been flooded.           
	Raja Ray,           
	Address not given                     
	I boarded a shuttle cab at the College More bus stop in Sector V around 8pm on August 27 to reach Bally. Generally the fare is Rs 30 per head.           
	When the cab (WB23 B6082) was about to leave with 10 passengers, the driver said we would have to pay Rs 35 each. When we protested and noted down his car number, the driver boasted that they pay the police and hence feared no one.           
	The Bengal government should stop taking pride in the IT sector as they cannot even provide proper transport there.

	The state governments act of playing hide and seek with part-time college teachers is most unfortunate (Govt U-turn on teacher axe, July 12).             
	It is ridiculous to see how the government is hell-bent on launching a gimmick to secure the votes of teachers before the 2011 Assembly polls.           
	The government had once declared that it would dismiss part-time teachers when the permanent posts were filled. But the fear of these teachers migrating to Trinamul-run associations made the education department play a new card aiming to keep them within the Left fold.

	I think Citu general secretary Kali Ghosh lacks common sense (Strike? Just another bad day, September 7).             
	Ahead of the latest Citu enforced bandh last Tuesday, he commented that people had been suffering for 364 days a year and as such one more day was no big deal.           
	Ghosh has, in a way, conceded the bitter truth that under Left rule, the people of Bengal have suffered every day of the last three decades. The damage done to the state by the Red brigade will continue to haunt future generations before a saner administration can put things in order.

	The fact that death certificates could not be issued by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for a few days because of a fault in the printer did not come as a surprise (Tech hitch in last rites, August 26). We face such problems at the CMC payment counters quite frequently.             
	A printer can be easily replaced. But for that one needs to have a spare in stock for emergencies. Political interference and the lack of planning are the reasons behind such serious faults.           
	In April, I found that the lone computer at the reservation counter at Karvi railway station was out of order. Electronic booking was the only option.

	The initiative of Calcutta police to launch a 24-hour helpline for elders, Pronam , is highly commendable (Helpline for elders rings louder, August 31).             
	At the same time, it is unfortunate that such a helpline will remain restricted only to those senior citizens who live within the jurisdiction of Calcutta police. But why should their fellow senior citizens living next door in Salt Lake, Lake Town, Behala, Kasba, Jadavpur, Garia or Howrah be deprived of this facility? Can the new director-general of West Bengal police help set up similar helplines in other parts of Calcutta and Howrah?

	Senior citizens in Salt Lake can dial Saanjhbaati (9748898933), a 24/7 helpline recently launched by the initiative of North 24-Parganas police and Scope, an NGO. The helplines office is on the ground floor of Bidhannagar (north) police station. The helpline strives to interact with elderly people in the township, providing emotional support and free phone counselling. The helpline also offers medical help, for which it has tie-ups with nursing homes, hospitals, diagnostic centres, chemists and medicine shops. Callers can also avail themselves of discounted rates for medical help.

	This is in reference to the report Metro twin snags stall city, August 10. I am a regular Metro commuter, travelling from Bansdroni (Masterda Surya Sen station) to Girish Park station to reach Scottish Church College six days a week. The Metro snags left me disgusted with the Metro Railway authorities.             
	On August 9, I left college around 4pm. As usual, the staff at the Girish Park ticket counter could not provide any clue as to when the services would resume. They assured me that services were on between Maidan and Kavi Nazrul. I boarded a bus to reach Maidan.           
	The journey took me two hours because of rallies and counter-rallies organised by political parties starting from Victoria House. At Maidan station, I was told that services had been disrupted throughout the Metro route.           
	I walked up to Lee Road, from where I hailed a taxi (I consider myself immensely fortunate that I got one) at 7pm. I reached home at 8pm.

	The joint venture of Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), Indian Railways and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to bedeck the river ghats and its surroundings is commendable (Joint blueprint to beautify riverfront, July 10).             
	The authorities concerned should have taken up the project much earlier. The state government, CMDA and the CPT have failed miserably to nurture the river. However, such an initiative would attract travellers and the riverfront would become a tourist spot.           
	It is unfortunate that the river itself is under threat of acute pollution. Dumping of garbage by riverside eateries and chemicals emitted from vessels and industries harm the river. Crores of rupees were spent under the Ganga Action Plan with disappointing results.           
	The authorities should next try and clean up the river.

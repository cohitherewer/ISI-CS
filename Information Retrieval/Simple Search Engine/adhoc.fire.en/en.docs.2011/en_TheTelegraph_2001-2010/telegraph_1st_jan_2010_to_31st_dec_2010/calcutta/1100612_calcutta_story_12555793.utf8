	The Tatas are bringing back Nano to Bengal  not the car but the home.         
	Tata Housing on Friday announced plans to build an estate of homes priced below Rs 10 lakh each, popularly known as Nano homes after the peoples car.         
	Brotin Banerjee, the managing director and CEO of the company, said he was looking for a land parcel of 60 to 100 acres within 20km of the city core for the project.         
	Tata Group is committed to the state for new projects and investments. We will launch many more projects, including affordable housing called Subh Griha, he said.        
	Banerjee was in the city to launch Eden Court Primo, a premium residential estate in Rajarhat with a price tag of Rs 70 lakh-plus.        
	The company has a 26-acre plot in the area, of which it is using only eight acres. It had acquired the plot from Hidco on a nomination basis for an undisclosed price.        
	He said there was goodwill between the government and the group but denied that the Rajarhat land was given at lower than the market rate after the Tatas had agreed to set up the Nano factory in Singur.        
	Tata Housing was to get another 24 acres in the area but the deal did not materialise. Tata Motors pulled out of Singur in October 2008.        
	For the Subh Griha project, Tata Housing wants to steer clear of controversy and acquire land on its own or join hands with a local partner who has land.        
	We are looking at the Baruipur-Sonarpur, Kona Expressway and Dankuni areas, said Banerjee.        
	Tata had introduced Nano housing project in Boisar, on the outskirts of Mumbai. The prices for 1 BHK flats measuring between 283sq ft and 465sq ft ranged from Rs 3.9 lakh to Rs 6.7 lakh. Banerjee said it would be difficult to maintain such prices as steel and cement had become expensive.        
	A similar project would be launched in Mumbai soon. The company intends to build four to five such townships in the next four years, including the one in Calcutta.        
	Tata Housing also plans to bring its New Haven housing project, where flats are priced between Rs 13 lakh and Rs 32 lakh, to Bengal.        
	Flats in Eden Court Primo, the premium G+23 twin towers launched on Friday, range between 1,732sq ft to 2,180sq ft. The complex would have clubhouse, swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi and sky gardens. There would also be retail space of 60,000sq ft.

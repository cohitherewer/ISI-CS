                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boy dies after rickshaw fall
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The dug-up site of Thursdays mishap. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	A 10-year-old boy going to a doctor with his mother died on Thursday night after he fell off a rickshaw on a Howrah road that had been dug up four months ago to lay pipes and not repaired since.        
	Malina Patra was holding her son Baruns arm when the rickshaw hit a bump on the uneven stretch at Sukanta Pally in Dasnagar. The mothers grip was not strong enough to stop the boy from flying off the vehicle. He landed about 6ft away and banged his head against a brick lying on the road. Barun was rushed to a nursing home about 1.5km away, where he was declared dead.        
	My son had been running a temperature for the past few days and was feeling very weak, so I was holding him. Suddenly, the rickshaw hit a heap of mud and brick and my grip loosened. Maybe I should have held him tighter, said Malina.        
	Residents alleged a contractor engaged by the Howrah Municipal Corporation had dug up the road to lay water pipes but abandoned the work midway.        
	Howrah mayor Mamata Jaiswal said: The road was dug up to lay water pipes but I do not know why the job was not completed and the road not repaired. I shall look into the matter and take appropriate steps.        
	Residents of Sukanta Pally blocked Alamohan Das Road for an hour from 11.30am on Friday to protest the death and demand immediate renovation of the stretch. The boy had to die because of the indifference of the authorities. We have been urging the local councillor to repair the road for the past four months. But she did nothing, said Mahendra Sharma, who lives in the area.        
	Local CPM councillor Manisha Chowdhury said: The boy must have died because he was sick. The road was set to be repaired after monsoon.        
	Howrah SDO Swati Bandopadhyay said: The death is most unfortunate. I have spoken to the civic authorities. The craters will be filled up within a few days and the road will be levelled.

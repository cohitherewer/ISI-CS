The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | All tracks lead to airport
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      All tracks lead to airport
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The state government has proposed a second Metro rail connection for Calcutta airport within a month of the first one receiving Delhis nod.        
	If the project report drafted by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is approved, a new set of tracks will take off from where the under-construction East-West Metro corridor ends in Salt Lake and meet the northern extension of the citys transport lifeline at Biman Bandar station.        
	The state governments decision to extend the East-West link  meant to connect Sector V to Howrah  comes close on the heels of the Railway Board approving the proposal to convert the ill-conceived airport-Dum Dum Cantonment suburban rail route into a Metro extension.        
	A detailed project report has been prepared with a financial estimate of Rs 700 crore. The final decision on the project will be taken soon, Sumantra Chowdhury, the principal secretary of the transport department, said on Thursday.         
	The proposed Salt Lake-airport Metro route will be 6km long, most of it elevated. The tracks will go over the Kestopur canal and reach the Kaikhali crossing, from where they will run along VIP Road.        
	The project already sanctioned by the Railway Board will cost less  Rs 300 crore  because some of the existing infrastructure has been integrated into the plan. The suburban rail-turned-Metro link will extend till Noapara, where a new station is to be built.        
	A walkalator  similar to the escalator except that it covers horizontal instead of vertical distance  will be installed from Biman Bandar station to the new integrated airport terminal to spare passengers the trouble of walking some distance with luggage.        
	We hope the extension of the East-West corridor will be a welcome addition to what has been already approved. The idea is to make the commute to the airport as smooth and fast as possible, said Chowdhury.        
	The annual passenger handling capacity of the two airport terminals is six million. Once the integrated building becomes operational sometime in 2011, it will jump to 20 million. As of now, 6,000 private cars and taxis visit the airport daily. The number could go up to 24,000 after the modernisation project is complete. The pressure on roads will increase rapidly, which is why the state government, the airport authorities and the railway ministry are planning new train links and flyovers, an official said.        
	According to airport sources, the secondary runway extension project will be completed by March.        
	The 2,869-metre secondary runway is being extended by another 400 metres on the Kaikhali side.

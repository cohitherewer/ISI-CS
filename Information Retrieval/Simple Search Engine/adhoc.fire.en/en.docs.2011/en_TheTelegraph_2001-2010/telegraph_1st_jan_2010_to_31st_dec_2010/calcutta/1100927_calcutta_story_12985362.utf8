The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Choppers scour snow traps for trekkers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Choppers scour snow traps for trekkers
  - Tourists head back home even as minister-led hunt for the missing draws a blank          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rescue work after a landslide on the Delhi-Dehradun road. (PTI)                                         
	The nine trekkers from Bengal who have been missing in flood-ravaged Uttarakhand for more than a week are yet to be traced, even as many stranded tourists finally set off for home with roads being cleared on Sunday.        
	Army helicopters made several sorties in search of the missing trekkers but failed to locate them.        
	The search is being carried out on a war-footing. Sixteen army helicopters are flying over Vasukital and Har-Ki-Dhoon. The area near Vasukital, where three of the missing tourists were last spotted, is under 4-5 feet of snow, said sports minister Kanti Ganguly, who was on a rescue chopper along with civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee.        
	The conditions are really adverse. Only bright sunshine for two consecutive days can melt the snow and allow proper rescue work to begin, Ganguly added.        
	The two ministers, who have been camping in Uttarakhand to co-ordinate rescue efforts, met senior army officers at a camp near Vasukital. Some Bengal officials stayed back at the camp even after the ministers left to ensure that the duo were kept posted about the latest developments. A team of mountaineers, too, has joined the rescue mission.        
	After being stuck for days at Sangla Valley in Himachal Pradesh and Biroli, Barkot and Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand, scores of tourists headed for Shimla and Hardwar on Sunday on their way back home.        
	Things have at last taken a better for the better. We moved out of Sangla in a hired car in the morning but were stopped again 7km downhill where the debris was being removed. After that stretch was cleared, the road was smooth and we headed for Hardwar. This is the first time I am so happy to head home after a vacation, said Baghajatin resident Mihir Kumar Mukherjee, in his 60s.        
	Asansol resident Ranjit Halder and seven others who were airlifted from Barkot boarded the Doon Express at Dehradun during the day. Picnic Garden resident Dipomoy Saha and three of his trekking mates boarded a specially-arranged government vehicle at a village near Barkot on their way to Hardwar, about 200km away.        
	As news of returning tourists trickled in, the families of the missing trekkers grew even more anxious. The administration is complaining of bad weather but are not understanding our situation, said N.S. Rao, the younger brother of N.P. Rao, one of the three missing trekkers from Howrah.        
	Minister Ganguly, who will return to Calcutta on Monday, will meet relatives of the missing. If they want to visit the area, we will make arrangements, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Driver held for student molest
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Driver held for student molest
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The driver of a private bus that used to ferry children to and from school was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly molesting two girls studying in kindergarten for over two months.         
	The parents of one of the girls, who study in a south Calcutta school, lodged a complaint against Palash Mondal, the 20-year-old driver.         
	Palash used to make the girls sit beside him and touch them inappropriately. One of the girls confided in her parents on Tuesday, who got hold of the driver on Wednesday and brought him to us, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.         
	The principal of the school said he had no control over the bus since the parents had independently reached an agreement with the private operator.        
	The owner of the bus has assured me that his wife would be present in the vehicle when the children will be ferried, added the principal.        
	The incident underscores the need for parents to exercise caution while selecting pool cars and buses for their school-going children.        
	Children are the most vulnerable targets of molesters because initially they do not realise what is happening. And once they realise, they are too afraid to confide in their parents and teachers, said a teacher of a south Calcutta school.         
	It is a scary situation. Accidents because of rash driving of pool cars have become common. Now, students are being molested on private school buses. Why cant the administration take stern steps? asked Swarnali Chatterjee, the mother of an eight-year-old who takes a pool car to her school in central Calcutta.         
	The state government has always dragged its feet on disciplining pool cars and private buses that ferry children.         
	Had the vehicle been registered, we could have taken action against the owner and the driver. Maybe we could have cancelled the permit of the owner of the vehicle to set a precedent. But since we have failed even to regularise the pool car business, it is impossible now, said an official of the public vehicles department at Beltola.         
	Owners of pool cars maintained that it was difficult to check the background of all the drivers because of high attrition. Drivers keep changing vehicles. Many drivers end up buying their own vehicles and use them as pool cars, said a member of a pool car association in the city.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tale of two revolts linked by a cry for liberty
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tale of two revolts linked by a cry for liberty
          UDDALAK MUKHERJEE                           Rajmohan Gandhi. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	Rajmohan Gandhis latest book is much more than a tale of two revolts. It is, in fact, a chronicle of two revolts (the 1857 uprising and the American civil war), three nations (India, Britain and the United States of America) and one century.         
	Aware that much of contemporary historical and archival interest in the sepoy mutiny and the American civil war tends to perceive these two tumultuous events as separate entities, Gandhi set about discovering their not-too-tenuous links: both events occurred in a world dominated by imperial Britain, and were, in effect, fervent calls for liberty. I started working on A Tale of Two Revolts to satisfy a curiosity. I certainly did not embark on it as some path-breaking exercise, says the author, who was in the city last week to attend a function.         
	The linkages are manifest through a clutch of diverse and interesting personalities: William Howard Russell, perhaps the worlds first war correspondent (he worked for The Times), who had witnessed both insurrections, Abraham Lincoln, Leo Tolstoy and Karl Marx. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, Jotiba Phule, Bankimchandra Chatterjee, Sayyid Ahmed Khan and Allan Octavian Hume represent the Indian connections.        
	The legacies of Gandhis protagonists have endured. But the author, who, as the Mahatmas grandson, is the bearer of an equally rich legacy, is humble about his scholarly achievement. He also admits that his personal lineage, sensibilities and training may have unconsciously informed his literary work.        
	Russell is the central key that binds the plot and the other characters together, says Gandhi, who has shown remarkable dexterity to weave together a narrative that overcomes the challenges posed by continual shifts in time and place. The well preserved archival records of the University of Illinois, where Gandhi teaches at present, must have proved to be as valuable an ally as Russell. Gandhi also considers himself to be distinctly lucky. For he knows that it would have been much more difficult for a researcher working in India to get access to this kind of data, given the complicated procedure and the precarious state of archives in this country.         
	In his case, Gandhi admits that the challenges posed by the research were compensated by the richness of his discoveries. For instance, it is now known that some people in Bombay had collected money and sent it to Lincoln to build a field hospital. Or, that most Americans, and expectedly the British, blamed the Indian revolt on the savage Oriental.        
	Gandhi hopes that his book will induce people (and historians) to broaden their perspectives regarding historical episodes that seem to be exhaustively researched. But he is also aware that a book like this, dealing with an event in India that still carries immense, emotional import, will evoke sharp responses. There has been some noise made about Gandhi being selective in his choice of the Indian characters. The South, critics allege, has gone un-represented. I dont feel particularly guilty about leaving out a particular region. The plot dictated my choice. But I do respect these reactions because they are capable of facilitating further dialogue which is of critical importance, says Gandhi.        
	And what about that contentious claim made by a section of Indian historians that 1857 is Indias first war of independence? Gandhi has his own views on the matter, but declines to comment, as it is not particularly relevant to his present work. His years in Parliament, it is evident, have honed his skills to tackle a mischievous query masked as an innocent question.

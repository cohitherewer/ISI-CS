The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Five point something: Todays block, tomorrows boost
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Five point something: Todays block, tomorrows boost
          
	A flurry of construction activity along the EM Bypass-Salt Lake-New Town route to the airport has turned the fast-track corridor into a snarl-at-every-site stretch. The bouquet of infrastructure projects behind these bottlenecks, however, promises long-term gain to Calcuttans in return for subjecting them to commuting pain in the short term. Metro takes the dusty road to decode the work in progress                  
	What: Four-lane flyover         
	Where: EM Bypass-VIP Road.        
	Why: Vehicles headed for Lake Town, Bangur, Kestopur, Baguiati or the airport via the Bypass can avoid the congested Ultadanga crossing once the Rs 68crore flyover is ready. According to a CMDA official, the number of vehicles passing through Ultadanga will drop by 200 per cent once the flyover is thrown open.        
	Work status: Work is underway at both ends of the flyover, near VIP Towers on VIP Road and off Bidhan Sishu Udyan on the Bypass. Vehicles headed for the Bypass are now allowed to take the slip bridge and pass through a narrow road under the incomplete flyover.        
	Deadline: June 2010.        
	Commuterspeak: Three traffic signals to hit the EM Bypass is one too many. That stretch takes nearly 15 minutes to cover because of the logjam at Ultadanga and the Hudco crossing. Once the flyover is ready it could take us hardly four minutes to hit the Bypass from VIP Road, said Ananta Sen, a resident of Baguiati.                  
	What: Four-lane flyover        
	Where: Wipro crossing, where Sector II ends and Sector V begins.         
	Why: The Rs 41.5crore        
	flyover promises to ease the chaotic crossings burden. Once it is opened, vehicles headed for Rajarhat or the airport neednt halt at the crossing for the traffic signal to turn green. Those coming from New Town or the airport can also take the flyover and hit the Bypass.         
	Work status: Final touches are being given to the 629-metre-long flyover, scheduled to be inaugurated on Tuesday. The intersection is presently closed to traffic entering Sector V or coming towards Karunamoyee from there.         
	Deadline: January 5, 2010.        
	Commuterspeak: The flyover will definitely end snarls on this stretch, which is such a big relief for us, said Akash Dutta, who lives near Karunamoyee.                  
	What: East-West Metro        
	Where: EM Bypass and parts of Salt Lake.        
	Why: The new Metro rail line, costing Rs 4,874 crore, will connect Sector V to Howrah, intersecting with the existing Dum Dum-Garia Bazar route in central Calcutta.        
	Work status: The pillars and the viaduct, on which the tracks are to be laid, are being constructed first. In Salt Lake, the stretches between Duttabad and City Centre, and Unnayan Bhavan and JK Saha bridge, have been dug up for the first phase of construction. Work is also underway on the EM Bypass between Mani Square and Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, and in front of Salt Lake stadium. Commuters going through the busy Karunamoyee crossing are inconvenienced the most with almost half the road barricaded. The train will run on elevated tracks from Sector V till Subhas Sarobar, the part which is being built first, said A.K. Chattopadhyay, the chief electrical engineer of Calcutta Metro Rail Corporation.        
	Deadline: October 2014.        
	Commuterspeak: We should not be grumbling about the traffic snarls. If parts of the road are not blocked, how will such a project come up? demanded Prodyut Deb, a government official in Salt Lake.                  
	What: Sewer and water lines in Salt Lake        
	Where: Sector V, between College More and the IBM office in DN block.         
	Why: Sector V doesnt have underground water and sewer lines. Once water supply starts, deep-bore wells will be banned.        
	Work status: A 2km stretch is all that remains to be covered under the Rs 70crore scheme. The western flank of this stretch is currently closed to traffic, causing a traffic crawl, but engineers say work will be over soon.        
	Deadline: March 2010.        
	Commuterspeak: With so many reputable companies having their offices here, basic amenities should have been in place long ago. We are glad that finally Sector V will have its sewer and water supply network, said Anwesha Dutta, a techie.                  
	What: Six-lane flyover        
	Where: Rajarhat Expressway.         
	Why: Many vehicles bound for the airport from south or central Calcutta take the expressway to avoid snarls at Ultadanga and along VIP Road. With the number of vehicles increasing every day, the Rs 22.35crore flyover is meant to ensure that the expressway remains a high-speed corridor.        
	Work status: The 430-metre-long flyover that takes off near the bus stand in Action Area I and ends adjacent to the Peerless commercial complex is currently at the piling stage. A portion of the expressway has been blocked but traffic hasnt been hit hard yet.        
	Deadline: April 2011.        
	Commuterspeak: Pedestrians will benefit from this flyover as much as fast-moving traffic. Those wanting to cross the road to and from the Reliance outlet can do so without the fear of being run over, said a resident.

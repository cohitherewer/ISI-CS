          A STAFF REPORTER                           Students outside Rabindra Bharati University on Friday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	A Trinamul Chhatra Parishad agitation against the general-secretary of the SFI-controlled students union of Rabindra Bharati University, accused of molestation, forced the authorities to keep the campus shut on Friday.         
	This led to the cancellation of examinations and distribution and submission of MA forms.         
	Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporters staged a sit-in near the gate and vandalised university property to protest the alleged molestation on Thursday. SFI supporters dismissed the charge.        
	We had to suspend student-related activities on the BT Road campus today because of unwarranted incidents on the campus yesterday. The exams and distribution and submission of forms have been rescheduled. If there is a transport strike on Tuesday, we will extend the dates further so that students are not inconvenienced, said university registrar Tapati Mukherjee on Friday.        
	Friday was the last date of form distribution and submission. Forms will be distributed and accepted on Monday and Tuesday (August 9 and 10). The MA Part II vocal music practical has been rescheduled on August 13, MA Part I dance practical on August 16, the master of fine arts viva-voce on August 9 and MA Part I geography practical on August 16.        
	We will probe the complaints of the students on Monday though the modalities are yet to be decided, Mukherjee added.        
	The SFI has been running the university union for 23 years. Over the past few days, the two groups of supporters have clashed during distribution and submission of forms.         
	Trinamul Chhatra Parishad members have planned a sit-in outside the vice-chancellors office demanding the arrest of the general secretary.        
	Undergraduate students of the visual arts department also demonstrated outside the university main gate on Friday demanding that they be allowed in. They also protested poor results in a recent exam.        
	The crowd outside the university caused snarls on BT Road in the afternoon.         
	A police complaint has been lodged against Santu Pramanik, the SFI general secretary.        
	We have received a complaint against a university student that he had tried to molest another student. We are looking into the matter, said deputy commissioner (north) Biswarup Ghosh.

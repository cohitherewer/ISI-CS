The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Four dead in slum   blaze
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Four dead in slum   blaze
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                The day after: A child watches the ravages of fire at the Jinjira Bazar slum. (Bishwarup Dutta)    
	Four children were burnt to death and a godown stacked with inflammable articles was reduced to ashes in the city on Thursday.        
	Four children died after a slum at Jinjira Bazar in Maheshtala, on the southern city fringes, caught fire around 1am.        
	The bodies of siblings Suraj Sheikh, 2, Ale Khatun, 12, and Sale Khatun, in her teens, were recovered after the blaze was doused around 4am. The body of 13-year-old Sahini Khatun, who was related to the three, was found under the debris a couple of hours later.        
	Everything went up in flames. Before we could do anything, the kids were burnt to death, cried Minara Bibi, a relative of the four victims.        
	The slum, spread across 16 bighas, was home to around 500 people. The affected people have been put up in a local school and given blankets and food, said an official of Maheshtala Municipality.        
	A Belgachhia Road godown stacked with drums of glue caught fire at 4.15pm. A fire department officer said the 400sq ft godown did not have any fire extinguisher.        
	The blaze could have spread to neighbouring slums where thousands live, the officer said. The godown is surrounded by densely populated areas, which leave hardly any room for fire engines to move.        
	Five smaller fires broke out across the city throughout the day. At 5pm, flames were spotted at a godown at 36 Zakaria Street. Three engines put out the fire in 20 minutes.        
	Around 5.15pm, smoke was seen coming out of the third-floor kitchen at Hotel Hindusthan International.        
	Three fire tenders were sent to the spot but the hotel staff doused the blaze before they arrived. It was a minor fire. Guests were not inconvenienced, said a hotel manager. Guests on the third floor were asked to come down and wait at the poolside.        
	A fire broke out in a transformer on Bidhan Sarani at 2.50am. Three fire engines took 35 minutes to control the blaze. The transformer was near the balcony of a nursing home. Bedding materials kept on the clinics balcony caught fire. No one was injured, said a fire department official.        
	Sparks were seen in an electrical goods shop on Madan Street around 12.30pm. Two tenders controlled the situation.

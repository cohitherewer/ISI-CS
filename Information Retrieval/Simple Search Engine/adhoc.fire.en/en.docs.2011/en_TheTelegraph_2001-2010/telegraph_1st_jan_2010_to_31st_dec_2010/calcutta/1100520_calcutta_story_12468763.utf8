The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | BRAVEHEARTS WHO BEAT THE ODDS
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      BRAVEHEARTS WHO BEAT THE ODDS
          WE SALUTE SOME STUDENTS WHO REDEFINE SUCCESS                          
	Divya Kataria                 
	This ISC commerce student of Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society School wrote three papers from a hospital bed, the first one with oxygen support barely a day after being shifted out of the ICU. I started running a temperature midway through ISC and also had breathing trouble. I was admitted to the ICU two days before the accounts paper, said Divya.        
	I was also diagnosed with jaundice and couldnt even sit upright, but I was determined not to waste a year, said the braveheart.        
	The 79 per cent she scored is worth much more in the book of life.                
	Ruchika Shah      
	This ICSE examinee from Jewish Girls High School was studying for her economics paper in her fifth-floor residence at Stephen Court on March 23 when she heard the words Fire...fire.        
	Ruchika and her family escaped to safety but the image of a trapped girl jumping to her death from a ledge haunted her right through her exams. She wrote three papers after the fire. I am glad she has scored enough for a decent aggregate, said mother Lata.              
	Arunava Biswas              
	Arunava, a student of The Heritage School, was in Class IX when he was diagnosed with photophobia, or hypersensitivity to light, after an injury to the occipital region (back of the head) of the brain. From mid-2008 to 2009, he would spend most of his time in complete darkness. He couldnt attend classes for months, said mother Bulbul Biswas, a gynaecologist.         
	So how did Arunava study to score 76.4 per cent in ICSE? He wore dark glasses to school and the classroom curtains would be drawn for him, said the proud mother.                
	Anupriya Datta               
	For commerce student Anupriya, it was exam time long before ISC 2010 started. My father has been jobless for over a year, leaving me to not only fend for myself but also support my family. I gave private tuitions to pay my fees, said the student of Mansur Habibullah Memorial School, recalling the struggle behind her score of 89.75 per cent.        
	Anupriya aspires to be an economics honours graduate from Jadavpur University.                 
	Tanmoy Sen              
	This ISC student of St Augustines Day School lost his father to cancer barely two months before the exams but put the loss behind him to score 89.75 per cent. It was my fathers dream that I become an engineer, and that is my goal, said Tanmoy.

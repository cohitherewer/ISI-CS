The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Belle Vue draws up growth plan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Belle Vue draws up growth plan
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Belle Vue Clinic will increase its number of beds and open a centre in Behala.        
	The hospital has a 30-acre plot in Behala where a 200-bed unit and a nurses training institute will come up.        
	The existing facility on Loudon Street will introduce a mother and child care centre with 70 beds and an invasive cardiology wing with 22 beds. The new units will take the nursing homes bed count to 304.        
	The Loudon Street hospital will reach its saturation point after some more expansions. So we have decided to open another hospital, said H.V. Lodha, a trustee and managing committee member of Belle Vue.        
	The deadline for the Behala project will be decided later.        
	The new mother and child care unit will have neonatal, paediatric and special care sections. The cardiac unit will have cath labs and two operating theatres. The hospitals blood bank, which now stores only whole blood, will also stock platelets, fresh frozen plasma and concentrated red blood cells. On Saturday, the hospital installed an open big-bore MRI machine.

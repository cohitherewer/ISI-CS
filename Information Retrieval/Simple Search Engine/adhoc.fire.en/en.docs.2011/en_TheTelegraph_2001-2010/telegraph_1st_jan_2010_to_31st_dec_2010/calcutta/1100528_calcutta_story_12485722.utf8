The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chinatown: food fave yet forgotten 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chinatown: food fave yet forgotten

	You may fight with your wife but never with the van rickshawpuller who supplies drinking water to your home  goes a common joke in Chinatown. But Tangras condition is no laughing matter.         
	If we ever scold the van rickshawpullers for their tantrums, they will stop supplying drinking water to us, says Chinese businessman Chen Khoi Kui, who lives on Matheswartala Road, in the heart of Tangra.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation does not supply drinking water to most of Tangra and the residents say they have been buying drinking water for decades.         
	Drinking water is one of the many civic amenities missing in Tangra, an area once well known as the hub of the Chinese community in the city. Today, Tangra is merely a place where you go for lip- smacking Chinese food, hurriedly entering the eateries through dark, narrow alleys, holding your breath to avoid the stench from open drains clogged with effluents from tanneries.         
	Tangra is a mess. We are staying as second-class citizens, says Kui, whose forefathers had migrated to Calcutta from Guangdong in China.         
	Kui drives a sedan, lives in a two-storeyed house and his business of PVC window fittings is spread across West Bengal, Sikkim and Bhutan. He says he pays his taxes on time. But thats not enough in these times of vote-bank politics, he says. With less than 2,500 voters spread over two wards, his community hardly has any electoral power.         
	Chinatown is made up of parts of two wards: 58 and 66. The area with a 2km radius extends from Chingrihata in the north to the Park Circus connector in the south and from Hatgachhia in the east to Christopher Road in the west.        
	We have been facing so many civic problems for so many years that we have learnt to expect nothing from the CMC, says Tong Achi, who owns a shoe shop in Tangra.         
	Achi says that the abysmal living conditions are driving members of the Chinese community out of Calcutta. The Chinese community was once vibrant and thriving in Tangra. Today, it is difficult to find a young Chinese in the locality. Most have migrated to the UK, Canada or Taiwan. Only those who could not afford to go stayed back, he points out.         
	Kui says his two sons have moved to Taiwan and London. Why not? Living conditions are so good there, coupled with better job prospects, he says. Achi too plans to send his eight-year-old daughter to a western country once she grows up.         
	Elections dont mean much in Chinatown. People vote in the hope that things will look up. But politicians have failed us election after election, says Wun Chin Mian, a 60-year-old Chinese woman who has spent a lifetime in Tangra making Chinese sauces.         
	Ask her about the state governments plan to turn Chinatown into a tourist attraction and Mian gives a wry smile. And what will they showcase? Our state of neglect and decay?        
	The tourism department has decided to turn Chinatown into a tourist destination. The estimated bill of Rs 1 crore is to be partly footed by the Centre. But the news doesnt excite the local Chinese population. By the time the project is completed, there might not be a single Chinese left in Tangra, says Kui.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Agonising vigil for bodies of loved ones
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Agonising vigil for bodies of loved ones
          SUBHAJOY ROY                           Stephen Court on Thursday, a day short of a month since the fire tragedy killed 43. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Bharati Chandra, 82, knows that her son will never return home but she has spent the past four weeks praying that at least his body will.        
	Three families, two in the city and another in Jharkhand, will complete an agonising, month-long vigil on Friday for a loved one killed in the Stephen Court fire.         
	I cant face my mother and my grandmother anymore. They keep asking me about my fathers body, and I have no answer, said 22-year-old Dipanjan Chandra, whose father Bidyut was one of the 43 victims of the tragedy at Stephen Court on March 23.         
	Chandernagore resident Bidyut, 50, used to work for Guru Ispat Ltd on the fourth floor of Stephen Court.         
	Sabita Roy Chowdhury from Sodepur, whose daughter Jayatree was trapped in the towering inferno, is hoping against hope that her body not being identified is a sign she is alive.         
	After her father died eight years ago, Jayatrees mother worked very hard to bring her up, said Kamal Nath, an uncle of Jayatree.         
	According to family members, Jayatree had taken up a job with Guru Ispat to finance a course she wanted to pursue.         
	Far from the city, at Jamtara in Jharkhand, Pradip Kumar Das and his wife are also waiting for their son Vinit Kumar Karan, 27. Das was in Calcutta to find his sons body but went back on being told that the identification process would take long.         
	My uncle calls me every day to know whether there has been any progress. I dread taking those calls, said Saurav Anuj, a cousin of Vinit. Nobody seems to know how much more time the identification process will take.         
	Senior police officials said a possible solution was to try and identify the three bodies by digitally superimposing the pictures of the victims on each of the nine unidentified skulls.         
	So why isnt this being done? Bengal is short on digital-matching expertise, said an officer.        
	Six of the nine bodies of Stephen Court victims lying in the morgue have not been claimed.

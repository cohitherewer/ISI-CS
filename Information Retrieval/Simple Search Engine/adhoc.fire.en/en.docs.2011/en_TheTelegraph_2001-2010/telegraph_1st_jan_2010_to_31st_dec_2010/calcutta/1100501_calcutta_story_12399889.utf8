	A solitary 70-year-old widow who had allowed a locksmith into her flat for repairs on Friday morning was found murdered a couple of hours later, highlighting the vulnerability of senior citizens living alone in the city.         
	Basanti Biswass neighbours in the three-storeyed building at Santoshpur, on the southern fringes, called police and broke open the door to the flat around 11.30am after one of them rang the bell and there was no response.        
	The former employee of the Howrah district collectorate was found dead on the kitchen floor with head injuries and a hammer lying next to her.        
	The locksmith, a man in his thirties whose identity hadnt been confirmed till late on Friday, was sprawled on the floor of the adjacent room with allegedly self-inflicted injuries.        
	The police suspect that the locksmith fatally assaulted Basanti when she spotted him trying to steal something. When the doorbell rang moments later, he must have panicked and inflicted injuries on himself to prove that someone else had entered the flat and attacked both him and the victim, an investigator said.        
	The locksmith was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital.        
	According to the police, the owner of a shop on the ground floor had locked the door from outside with a duplicate key that was with the buildings caretaker after being informed by a neighbour that Basanti wasnt answering the doorbell. I saw a pair of slippers outside and knew that someone other than the elderly lady was inside, recounted Dipen Saha, the shop owner.        
	A team from East Jadavpur police station reached 36 Baikuntha Saha Road around 11.40am. By then, residents of the building had allegedly beaten up the locksmith.        
	Basanti used to stay in Howrah with her late husband, who also worked in the district collectorate, but moved to Santoshpur about five years ago so that she could be close to her married daughter Arpita Mitra, who stays in Dhakuria.        
	Basantis death brings into sharp focus the perils of women and the elderly living alone in a city where crime now comes calling at your doorstep.        
	In March last year, a 54-year-old woman was found murdered in her Mandeville Gardens apartment with a pair of scissors. An investigation revealed that her domestic help was the culprit.

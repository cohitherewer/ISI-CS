The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Noise bar on construction
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Noise bar on construction
          OUR BUREAU                          Noisy work at construction sites at night could attract a fine and a jail term                                  
	The state environment department on Monday banned with immediate effect construction activities that generate noise in residential areas between 10pm and 6am. Violators can be both fined and jailed, if police act on complaints.        
	The order is in consonance with a central notification on noise norms issued on January 11. Sound-emitting construction equipment shall not be used or operated during night time in residential areas and silence zones, read the state directive.        
	It also barred honking in residential areas at night.        
	We have received a number of complaints regarding noise pollution because of construction activities at night. The Centre also recently issued a notification on the matter. Violators will attract penal action under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, which can be a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh or jail for up to five years, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the department.         
	The order will come into force immediately, said M.L. Meena, the principal secretary of the department and chairman of the state noise monitoring committee.        
	According to Mukherjee, the order will apply to the ongoing East-West Metro construction work in Salt Lake, a source of regular complaints of noise norm violation by residents.        
	He said there were other rules to control noise pollution but those were not being strictly followed. However, following a fresh order by the central government, the rules would be rigorously implemented throughout the country, Mukherjee said.        
	The police would be responsible for implementing the rule, he added.        
	This is a practical decision. I dont think it will have much of an impact as the rule is already more or less followed in the city areas, said Rahul Todi, a realtor.

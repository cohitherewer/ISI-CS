The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fuel peeve at minister door
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fuel peeve at minister door
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Transport operators met transport minister Ranjit Kundu on Wednesday afternoon to press for a fare hike or a reduction in diesel prices.         
	Representatives of bus and minibus owners associations met me to discuss their problems after the hike in fuel prices, said Kundu.        
	He added that under no circumstances would fares be raised. I will meet all the parties concerned, including passengers associations and the trade unions, to drum out a solution, Kundu said.        
	Trinamul MLA and transport operators leader Swarnakamal Saha said he had urged Kundu to reduce the cess and sales tax on diesel to lessen the burden on transporters.         
	But he said it would be impossible for his government to do so. The minister asked us to submit a list of items, like tyres, whose prices have also shot up. He might eventually consider increasing fares, Saha said.        
	Bus and minibus operators said they were not keen on a fare hike. Higher fares would reduce the passenger load. But theres a limit to the kind of burden we can shoulder, said a minibus operator.        
	Taxi operators, on the other hand, are rooting for an increase in fares. On Wednesday, they met the minister with their demand for higher fares, for which they have been threatening to go on an indefinite strike since the Union budget was presented. Taxi operators want the minimum fare (for 2km) to be raised from Rs 22 to Rs 24.         
	If the government refuses to lower the cess or sales tax on diesel, they must agree to a revised fare structure for taxis... the government cant be so adamant, said a taxi operator.         
	Every time the Centre increases the price of fuel, the state cant shoulder the burden on behalf of the transporters, said Kundu.

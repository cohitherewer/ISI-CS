          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta Medical Research Institute on Friday paid Rs 1 lakh as pollution cost for violating waste disposal norms.        
	The state pollution control board had in an order on April 23 imposed the cost on the Diamond Harbour Road hospital and asked the management to stop admitting patients.        
	CMRI deposited the pollution cost today and also requested us to train its staff in handling biomedical waste, Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the board.         
	 Verdict: Lakshmi Chakrabarty, Raju Ghosh and Chandan Bose were sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for killing 40-year-old Rakesh Gupta two years ago. Gupta, an employee of a private company, was found dead near the Kalyani-Barrackpore Expressway in Sodepur. The kingpin, Shibu Sharma, is absconding, said special public prosecutor Pritwish Dasgupta.        
	Police said the gang used to supply pornographic films and pictures to Gupta. On February 10, 2008, the trio had called him to New Barrackpore where they demanded money from him. They killed Gupta when he refused to pay and threatened to expose them.

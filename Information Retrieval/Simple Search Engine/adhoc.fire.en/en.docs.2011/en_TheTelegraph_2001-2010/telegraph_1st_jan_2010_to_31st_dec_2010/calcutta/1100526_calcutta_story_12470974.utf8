The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Streets of apathy shut out poll buzz
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Streets of apathy shut out poll buzz
  - One ward steers clear of civic election, another struggles to save its votes from ballot snatchers          ZEESHAN JAWED                          Park Street all but bereft of the trappings of the impending civic polls on Tuesday.   Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                              
	Bobby Pasricha would rather talk about the party he is planning on May 30 than about the party that he thinks deserves his vote in the municipal polls that day.        
	I have never voted and, frankly speaking, I dont see any reason to do so after being forced to buy services that the civic body is supposed to provide, declares Pasricha, the owner of a two-wheeler showroom.        
	This 38-year-old resident of Ambassador Apartment, on Park Street, is not the only resident of ward 63 to steer clear of the civic polls.         
	Stretching from Minto Park to Lindsay Street, Race Course Road to the Exide crossing, the entire ward is an island of indifference amidst the buzz about the polls. There are no flags, few festoons; hardly a poster except in a few bylanes.        
	I have not seen a single election meeting here. In my para (Nabapally on Canal East Road), you cant even see the expanse of the sky because of the flags, festoons and lifesize cut-outs of the candidates, says 44-year-old Biplob Das, manning one of the book stalls outside Music World on Park Street.         
	A walk down Park Street, Camac Street and Loudon Street confirms the sense of disinterest. There are billboards all over the place advertising everything from lifestyle products to mutual fund schemes but no banners or huge cut-outs of Mamata Banerjee or Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, as in other localities across town.         
	Ask the candidates about the lack of fizz in their campaign and they sigh.        
	Residents of this ward face problems like garbage disposal and shortage of drinking water. But they wont come out to vote so that things change. Its puzzling, says Shilpa Thakker, the 42-year-old teacher nominated by the CPM.        
	Thakkers opponent is sitting Trinamul councillor Susmita Bhattacharya. The former principal of Pratt Memorial and St Thomass School has been going from door to door requesting people with folded hands to step out and vote on May 30.        
	If people dont vote, whats the point in holding an election? wonders Bhattacharya, who became the ward councillor after winning the by-election necessitated by Ajit Panjas death.        
	Ward 63 has always had a poor poll record. Barring 1995, when almost 50 per cent of the electorate had exercised their franchise, the voting percentage has consistently been in the range of 35 to 40 per cent.         
	So what makes voters in this ward different from the rest? Almost 70 per cent of the voters live or work in multi-storeyed buildings that provide all basic amenities against a fixed service fee that they dont mind paying. So they consider the civic polls redundant, explains a Camac Street resident.        
	Hotel executive Pranesh Agarwal, who stays in a Park Street building, insists that paying private parties for the services he needs is better than having to bribe someone in the civic body.        
	The only ones apparently keen on voting are the small 30 per cent of the 23,700-strong electorate that makes up the not-so-privileged population living in parts of Kyd Street, Collin Lane and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road.        
	They vote because they depend on the civic body for solutions to their problems like waterlogging, conservancy and drinking water, says a civic body official.        
	Over the past few days, CPM supporter Mohammed Zahid has been spending time in Collin Lane marshalling Thakkers muted campaign. This is the area that counts. Whoever gets votes here will win, he says.

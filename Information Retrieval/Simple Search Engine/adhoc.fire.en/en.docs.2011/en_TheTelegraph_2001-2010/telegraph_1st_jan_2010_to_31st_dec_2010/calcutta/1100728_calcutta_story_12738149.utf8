	Two alleged members of the gang that had robbed Rs 20 lakh from the Barrackpore branch of Bank of Baroda were arrested in Khardah and Titagarh early on Tuesday.        
	Asgar Ali and Md Rashik, in their late-20s, were produced in the Barrackpore sub-divisional magistrates court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody for seven days.        
	According to preliminary investigation, they had conducted a recce of the place and were among the six who robbed it.        
	Investigators said a cap and a pair of glasses left behind by the robbers had helped them zero in on the duo. The fingerprints of some of the gang members were also found on the cellphones of customers who were in the branch while it was robbed.         
	Asgar and Rashik had been arrested earlier in connection with criminal cases, said an officer.

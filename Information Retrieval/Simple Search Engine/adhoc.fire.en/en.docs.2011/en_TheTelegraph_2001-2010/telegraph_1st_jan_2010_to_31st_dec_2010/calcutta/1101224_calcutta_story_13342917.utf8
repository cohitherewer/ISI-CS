	Tips to combat corruption
  SUBHRO SAHA        
	How to get your job done without giving bribes? How to be a success without sacrificing business ethics?        
	Students of B-school ILEAD got tips on such life skills when Samani Charitra Prajna  a visiting faculty of religious studies at Florida International University, Miami  dropped in on their Topsia campus recently.        
	The corporate world in the West doesnt suffer from endemic corruption in the lower strata. But it is common in India and students must be equipped to handle it, said the spiritual teacher who is back in the country after stints in American and European universities since 1993.         
	Complete education combines physical, mental, spiritual and intellectual inputs with a correlated approach. This alone can help a business management graduate face the harsh corporate world. My American students, who have been weaned on a steady diet of consumerism, had trouble grasping this concept initially, she told the audience.         
	The latter added that there was a growing curiosity among the western students about Indian culture and traditional values. Prajna is currently the vice-chancellor of the Jain Vishva Bharati University in Ladnun, Rajasthan.         
	I liked the part where we were told not to compromise on our business ethics. Thats how we can combat corruption in the long run, said postgraduate student Meenakshi Choradia, who was impressed with the lecture like most of her classmates.        
	Prajna is a part of the new group of Jain teachers who are allowed to use computers, mobile phones and can fly across continents. This relaxation, effected around 15 years back, is facilitating the spread of Jainism, the spiritual teacher claimed.        
	Prajna has been the coordinator and organiser of many seminars, workshops and non-violence training programmes in India and abroad. She was also an adviser in establishing the Jain Vishva Bharati, Orlando in 1995.

	It was a dream come true for 650-odd children. Not everyday do they get to roam around the lush green expanse of Raj Bhavan and chat with the governor! But for the host too it was as enjoyable an experience. Not everyday does youthful chatter turn the silent walls of his official residence into a home.         
	From my office I could see the children running around and having fun. It was so lovely I thank you for making this place a home rather than a building, said Governor M.K. Narayanan.         
	The event was a pre-Christmas party organised by an NGO, Calcutta Foundation, on December 18.         
	Children from 15 NGOs and schools were invited.         
	These children will perhaps remember this day and their interaction with the governor with pleasure, 20 years hence, said Shamlu Dudeja, the chairperson of Calcutta Foundation.         
	It was not just the governor that these children met. Singer Usha Uthup was also there to enliven the party with some eternal favourites like Pyaar karne wale karte hai shaan se and Ramba ho ho ho. The peppy numbers made the children dance.         
	There were young performers too. Children of Cathedral Relief Society danced to Poush toder daak diyechhe, while those from Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy matched steps to Hare re re amai chhere de re de re. Some of the participants were wheelchair bound, but their cheerfulness was infectious. Children from CINI Asha, Children in Pain, Future Hope, National Association for the Blind and Udayan also performed.         
	This annual event started about a decade ago. It has, however, made a comeback after a gap of two years. The theme this year was Rabindranath Tagore.         
	The afternoon provided the children opportunity to learn too. For most kids, this was their first visit to Raj Bhavan. Many were curious about the governor and his role in politics, Dudeja added. Some knowledge on wildlife was also thrown in with children of Kangaroo Kids presenting a dance drama on saving the tiger.         
	Mintu Paswan, a Class V student of Disha Foundation, said she was having the time of her life. The performances were so nice. Wish I could enjoy more such outings with my friends, she gushed while watching the performances.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power spanner in NRS surgery
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Power spanner in NRS surgery
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Power supply was disrupted in parts of Nil Ratan Sarkar Medical College and Hospital on Monday afternoon following a spark in a meter box, delaying a number of surgeries.        
	Fraser Building, which houses the orthopaedic department, plunged into darkness around 12.45pm. Hospital officials said there was a spark in the meter box of the building after which power went out.        
	Three surgeries were on and all were delayed by around half an hour. A fourth had to be deferred till Wednesday, said an official.        
	Power was restored around 1.30pm after the public works department engineers repaired the fault.        
	We went on with the surgeries with the UPS back-up. Had the disruption continued for some more time, the operations would have to be stopped midway, said a doctor.        
	The patient wards in the building were also affected. A rumour that a fire had broken out triggered panic in the wards. Employees later assured us that it was just a spark, said a patient admitted in the male ward of the building.        
	There was no major disruption. We have asked public works department officials to step up maintenance of the wiring in all buildings on the campus, said L. N. Ghosh, the medical superintendent of the hospital.

	A tussle over who would refuel his autorickshaw first led to a fight among drivers and two LPG stations in Garia being vandalised on Tuesday morning.        
	Rush-hour traffic on the busy Garia Main Road was disrupted for close to two hours as rival groups of auto drivers pelted one another with stones.        
	The rampage and violence came a day after 200-odd auto drivers blocked several crossings in south Calcutta, resulting in traffic snarls, to protest the shortage of the green fuel.        
	On Tuesday, trouble started around 10am when each group of auto drivers waiting for a refill at Rajrani Service Station in Mahamayatala demanded that its members be given the gas first.        
	The drivers were divided mostly on the basis of their routes, all on the southern fringes.        
	The drivers were not ready to wait for their turn and each group started demanding that its members be given the gas before the others. The argument soon turned into a scuffle, said Ravi Thakker, the manager of the filling station.        
	The auto drivers pelted stones at each other and also at the service station, breaking its glass panes. The management of the station was forced to suspend operations for more than three hours.        
	The fight spread to Ravi Service Station on Garia Main Road, less than a kilometre from Rajrani Service Station.        
	We were nowhere in the picture but the auto drivers still damaged our establishment. We had to keep the pump closed for close to three hours, said R.K. Mehra, the manager of Ravi Service Station.        
	The situation came under control around 2pm, after police intervened.        
	Auto unions later reached an understanding that from now, LPG would be given strictly on a first-come-first-served basis. No one will be allowed to jump the queue at the two service stations in Garia, said Bibhuti Barik, a member of the Citu-affiliated auto union.

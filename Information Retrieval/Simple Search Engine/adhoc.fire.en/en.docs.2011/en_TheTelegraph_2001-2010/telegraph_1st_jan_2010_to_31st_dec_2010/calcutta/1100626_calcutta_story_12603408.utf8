The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cough in the time of viral wave
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cough in the time of viral wave
  - Infection rides Celsius fluctuation, humidity rise into home and office          SANJAY MANDAL                                        HOW TO COPE      Gurgle with lukewarm water
        Take paracetamol tablets      Drink boiled water      Have plenty of fruits and vegetables      Be patient and avoid antibiotics unless absolutely necessary      Avoid rapid and repeated change of temperature, from AC to non-AC      
	What the vuvuzela is to South Africa now, the cough is to Calcutta.        
	With the advent of monsoon, and the stop-start showers in town, the sound of the cough is dominating boardrooms and bedrooms as viral infections have a field day.        
	Patients with fever, cold, cough, respiratory distress and diarrhoea are flooding clinics and the outpatient departments of government and private hospitals as the Celsius fluctuates and humidity levels rise.        
	The viral infection is because of the fluctuation in temperature and extreme humidity. We are also detecting cases of malaria and dengue, said critical care expert Subrata Maitra. Those suffering from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are more susceptible to viral infection than others, he warned.        
	In addition to fever, sore throat and headache, nausea and vomiting are the common symptoms of viral infection, said doctors. More than five per cent of such patients are suffering from chest infection and respiratory distress.        
	I have had mild fever, a sore throat and a bad cough for the past five days. I am on antibiotics but there is no relief. I can barely sleep at night, complained Sushil Agarwal, a businessman in his early 30s.        
	A city with a persistent cough is giving pulmonologists sleepless nights too. The current weather condition with extreme humidity is ideal for the spread of virus and bacteria, said Asok Sengupta, pulmonologist with Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. Even young people without any pre-existing lung diseases are suffering from flu, pneumonia and other bronchial infection. In some cases, the condition of lung infection is aggravated, requiring hospitalisation.        
	Children are in the high-risk zone. Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health, said they were suffering from a throat infection caused by the Herpangina virus. The symptoms are fever along with pain in the throat caused by ulcer. Those below the age of six are most vulnerable to this, said Ghosh.        
	Children are also suffering from common influenza and typhoid. At least 20 per cent of kids in the outpatient departments are suffering from viral infection and diarrhoea.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trustee cries breach of trust
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trustee cries breach of trust
          SAMBIT SAHA                          LESSEE VS LESSOR: The Park Street entrance to Stephen Court a week after the fire. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	The de jure owner of Stephen Court is making angry noises about terminating the lease right of Stephen Court Ltd a week after the fire, while also distancing itself from the property.        
	Prima facie, there seems to be a breach of contract by the lessee (Stephen Court Ltd). As far as I have seen, they built two additional floors without bringing it to our notice, the administrator-general of the Official Trustee of West Bengal, Nirmal Kumar Ghoshal, said on Tuesday.        
	The Official Trustee of West Bengal is the owner of 18A Park Street through the 1919 will of Peter Charles Earnest Paul, the original owner of the property. It has leased out the building to Stephen Court Ltd till 2078.        
	When the property is given for such a long lease, the lessee becomes the de facto owner and the lessor is limited to being a rent-receiving body, argued Ghoshal.        
	When asked to react to the threat by the administrator- general to terminate the lease right, the initial reaction from a representative of Stephen Court Ltd was: So be it.        
	But the representative, who did not wish to be named, later said: It must be examined whether their move to terminate the lease would be good in law. We may contest the move.        
	Ghoshal said he would go through piles of documents regarding Stephen Court before taking a call.        
	The lease termination, if it does happen, will not hit Stephen Court Ltd hard in money terms as the company does not earn much from the property.        
	According to Stephen Court Ltd, there are 83 owners in 18A Park Street now. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation records show 45 assesses at the address.        
	If the lease is terminated, the occupant-owner becomes original lessee to the lessor, the Official Trustee of West Bengal.        
	Stephen Court Ltd pays Rs 8,000 a year as rent to the Trustee. This will go up to Rs 19,000 from 2018.        
	Documents available with The Telegraph have established that the lessee had requisite sanctions from the then Corporation of Calcutta to build the additional floors.        
	I dont know if the lease agreement had prevented them from building additional floors. I am not sure, said Ghoshal.        
	The Official Trustee of Bengal was set up in the colonial era and post-Independence it became the office of the Official Trustee of West Bengal.        
	It manages nearly 300 properties under various heads  as debuttar estate, as trustee of estates and as high court-appointed receiver.        
	One of its prominent properties is the Armenian Church on Middleton Row.

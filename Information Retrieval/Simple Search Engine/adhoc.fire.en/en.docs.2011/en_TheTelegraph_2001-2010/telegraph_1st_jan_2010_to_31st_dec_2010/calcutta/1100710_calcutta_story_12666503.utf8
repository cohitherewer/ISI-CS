                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Joint blueprint to beautify riverfront
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Cosmetic change: All the 48 ghats in the CMC area as well as portions of the riverfront on the Calcutta side are set to be beautified                                   
	Calcutta Port Trust, Indian Railways and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation signed a memorandum of understanding on Friday to beautify the riverfront.         
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, railway minister Mamata Banerjee and the minister of state for shipping, Mukul Roy, attended the programme organised on the occasion.        
	Rites, a railway undertaking, will conduct a survey and prepare a master plan for the project. All the 48 ghats in the CMC area as well as portions of the riverfront on the Calcutta side would be beautified under the project, said a senior port trust official.        
	A 10km stretch from Cossipore to Taktaghat in Kidderpore, at the confluence of Tollys Nullah and the Hooghly, would be covered under the project.        
	The project will help in the financial development of the area, tourism promotion and also commercial utilisation of the space, said railway minister Mamata Banerjee.        
	She alleged that the state government was not utilising the funds provided by the Centre for tourism.        
	Beautification of the riverbanks till Farakka, which would involve 40 other municipal bodies, would be taken up later. There are many railway plots on the river banks in Howrah, Hooghly and North 24-Parganas that can be used commercially, Mamata added.        
	Beautification of the ghats were taken up earlier but in bits and pieces. This is the first time, there is a definite plan involving the CMC, said finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	According to him, getting land for riverfront beautification was a problem earlier but that would no longer be an issue with the port trust and the railways, which own most of the land on the riverfront, co-operating.        
	The CMC owns 45 of the 48 ghats in the city. Two ghats are owned by the CMDA and one by the state government.

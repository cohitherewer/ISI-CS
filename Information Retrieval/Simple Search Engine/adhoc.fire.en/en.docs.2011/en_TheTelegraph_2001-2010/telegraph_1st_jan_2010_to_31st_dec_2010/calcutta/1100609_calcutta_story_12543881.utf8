                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wife suspect in murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The parents of Mahesh Chorarria suspect his wife Sweta and her alleged boyfriend Raj Agarwal were behind his murder. The 35-year-old trader was shot in his Howrah flat on Monday.         
	Maheshs father Lov Charan lodged a complaint with Howrah police station accusing Sweta and Raj of the murder.         
	According to police, the two had an affair while they were in college. The youth had left for his native village in Haryana after Sweta, a Salkia resident, married Mahesh about four years ago.        
	A couple of years ago, Raj returned to Salkia and allegedly started meeting Sweta regularly. Maheshs family members said his relationship with Sweta soured and she moved out soon after. We will speak with Sweta, Raj and other people close to them. We have to establish the motive of the murder, said a cop.        
	The police are not ruling out the business rivalry angle either. Mahesh knew the man who shot him. Otherwise, he would not have allowed him into his house, said the cop.

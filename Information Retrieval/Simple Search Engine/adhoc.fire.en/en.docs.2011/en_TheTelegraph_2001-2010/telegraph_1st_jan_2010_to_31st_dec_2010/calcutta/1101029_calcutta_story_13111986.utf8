The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pipe leak keeps taps dry 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pipe leak keeps taps dry 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Large parts of south Calcutta and the fringes continued to face severe water shortage on Thursday as civic staff struggled to plug a leak in a supply pipe that had burst on Wednesday afternoon.        
	We have not received a single drop throughout Thursday. Our reserve has been exhausted. If the supply does not resume by tomorrow, we cannot send our children to school, said Diptosh Roy, a resident of Oxytown in Behala.        
	After a day-long effort, the repair staff could temporarily seal the seven-and-a-half-inch crack on the pipe running under Taratala Road at 7pm. Civic engineers then decided to resume supply in small quantity on a trial basis till 9pm.        
	Normal supply would be restored only after we are satisfied with the trial, said a civic engineer supervising the repair work.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, who visited the spot on Wednesday evening and again on Thursday morning, said the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the state government lacked the infrastructure for complete repair of the pipe.        
	This is a special variety of pipe, called glass enforcement pipe. A permanent solution would call for overhauling of the conduit, for which we will have to suspend supply for a week, Chatterjee said.        
	The mayors ward in Behala is among the affected areas.        
	The 60-inch diameter pipe supplies water to Behala, Thakurpukur, Garden Reach, Kidderpore and the areas under Mahestala, Pujali and Budge Budge municipalities on the southern fringes.        
	On September 1, more than a million households in south Calcutta had received less than half their quota of filtered water after three pumps at Garden Reach waterworks broke down. Water supply was also affected in these areas during Puja.

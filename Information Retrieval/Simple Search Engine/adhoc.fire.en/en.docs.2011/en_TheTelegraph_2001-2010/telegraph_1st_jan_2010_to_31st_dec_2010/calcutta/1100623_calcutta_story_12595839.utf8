                      Forms, shapes and colours                    Nimble Fingers, the global platform for Bengals artists, is committed to showcasing unknown and exciting talent. Monsoon Melodies, the ongoing show, embodies one such effort. The highlight of the exhibition is 15 terracotta relief works by Nabendu Sengupta and five paintings on mixed media by Akashdip. Senguptas relief is an artwork where a modelled form projects out of a flat background. Tensed musculature is the hallmark of many of his reliefs. Nevertheless he shows a lesser interest in naturalism and a greater interest in formal stylisation. Greater emphasis is given to the rhythms of volumes and spaces as well as to the contrasting qualities of the surface, while story-telling and convincing details of anatomy or costume are underplayed. Thus the focus is on psychological effect rather than on physical realism. Akashdips subjects are more detailed in nature, with emphasis on human forms. His works are characterised by the new trend of internalisation of tradition. They reverberate the distant echo of our mythical past and unfold contemporary fervour through his technique of presentation.                  Event: An exhibition of art works by Nabendu Sengupta and Akashdip When: Till June 24; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Gallery 79, 79 Raja Basanta Roy Road, 1st floor

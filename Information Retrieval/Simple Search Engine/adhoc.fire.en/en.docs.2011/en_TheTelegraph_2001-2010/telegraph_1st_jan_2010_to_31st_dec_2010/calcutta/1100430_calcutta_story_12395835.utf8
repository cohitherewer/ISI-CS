	The final semester exams of the West Bengal University of Technology will coincide with postgraduate entrance tests of several reputable institutes across the country, forcing students to choose between the two.         
	Those who skip semester exams would be allowed to take supplementary tests a month later. According to an estimate, about 100 students would have to make the choice.        
	If they clear the supplementary tests, their marksheets would mention that they passed the final semester exams.         
	The universitys semester examination is scheduled between May 14 and May 24, when most IITs are supposed to conduct interviews for entry into MTech programmes.         
	I got a call from National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, but I dont think Ill be able to attend, said Anwesha Ghosh, a fourth-year student the Heritage Institute of Technology who secured an all-India rank of 33 in GATE.        
	She also wants to attend an interview at the biomedical engineering department of IIT Mumbai on May 12. But I will have to take my final exam right after I return to the city, she added. Students and teachers said a 15-day delay in holding the final-semester exams had caused the problem. The university had announced its exam schedule last Saturday, while most other institutes (including the IITs) declared theirs in early March.        
	It is impossible for us to reschedule the exams, said Sabyasachi Sengupta, the university vice-chancellor.

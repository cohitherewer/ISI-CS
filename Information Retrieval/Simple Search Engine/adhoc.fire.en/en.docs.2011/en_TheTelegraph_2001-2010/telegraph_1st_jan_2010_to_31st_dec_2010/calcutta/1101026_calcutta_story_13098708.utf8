                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Not 18? No papers? No problem!
  - Tout at Beltola promises licence for a fee										      TT for City - Licence to Kill      ZEESHAN JAWED                                    
	Hundreds of lives are lost on our streets every year because of callous or incompetent drivers at the wheel but Beltola couldnt be bothered. The public vehicles department (PVD) just keeps on arming underage and untested drivers with the licence to kill.        
	On Monday, Metro reported how an ossification test on the driver of a truck that killed five persons on Vidyasagar Setu on August 24 had revealed that he was issued a driving licence when he was underage.        
	Metro visited the factory of death on Monday morning. Dada renew achhe? Tax deben? Notun licence hobey? were the flood of questions from youths flocking the lane leading to the PVD building from Sarat Bose Road. A 20-something man in jeans and red T-shirt stepped forward.        
	Metro: We want a new driving licence.        
	Tout: Sure. Lets go to our shop.         
	(The shop is 10m away, in a lane adjacent to the PVD building. It has two chairs, occupied by two middle-aged men, a table covered with a plastic sheet and a bunch of forms.)        
	A few men in their late 20s surround the shop. One of them takes charge.        
	Tout: Have you got all the documents?        
	Metro: It is not for me. It is for a boy who works for me.        
	Tout: Okay. Get his birth and address proof. I will get the licence made.        
	Metro: There is a problem, he is underage.        
	Tout: How old?        
	Metro: He turned 17 last month.        
	Tout: That should not be a problem. I will charge you Rs 1,600 for everything.        
	Metro: But I want a genuine licence.        
	Tout: (Looks shocked and hurt) We only give genuine licences. It is as genuine as any licence issued from this building (pointing a finger at the PVD address).         
	(The building had issued a driving licence to this correspondent in December 2007 without even a basic driving test, for Rs 3,500 and a pack of cigarettes.)        
	Metro: But if I give his birth certificate, he will not get a licence. Then?        
	Tout: Arrey, no need. I will get an affidavit made from the court stating that he is 18. That will take care of the age part. (Pause) It is for two-wheeler or four-wheeler?        
	Metro: Four-wheeler. Taxi.        
	Tout: Then he will need a commercial licence. For that you will have to pay Rs 2,500 (around Rs 1,000 more than the usual).        
	Metro: Money is not a problem. But since I have called him from UP, I will not be able to produce any documents.        
	Tout: No problem. As long as you are paying, your work will be done. Every day so many people come here with such problems but all of them get a licence.        
	Metro: When will he be called for the test?        
	Tout: Forty-five days after submitting the application for the licence.        
	Metro: At the time of the driving test, wont the motor vehicles inspector catch him and cancel his application?        
	Tout: (Agitated) Are you submitting any genuine documents? Then how will the motor vehicles inspector know what the exact age of the applicant is? Where is the question of getting caught? Trust me.        
	Metro: Okay. Your contact number?.        
	Tout: (Scribbles it on a piece of paper) Call me if you need any more information. Just pay Rs 2,500 and the licence is yours.        
	(What steps can you suggest to end the licence-for-a-bribe raj in Beltola? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com)    
	As long as you are paying, your work ill be done. Every day so many people come here with such problems (underage, no documents, avoid driving test) but all of them get a licence

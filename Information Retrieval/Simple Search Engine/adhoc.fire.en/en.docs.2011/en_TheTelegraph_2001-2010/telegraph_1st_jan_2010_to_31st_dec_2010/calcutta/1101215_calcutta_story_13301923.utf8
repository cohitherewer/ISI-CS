                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Flier held with fake passport
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A passenger on his way to Los Angeles was arrested at Calcutta airport early on Tuesday for possessing a fake passport with which he had travelled to Bangladesh and returned to the city.        
	Jagrup Singh, 20, a resident of Amritsar, had met a tout who promised to help him to travel to the US and get a job there.        
	Singh paid the tout Rs 10 lakh for arranging for him a fake passport with which he planned to fly to Los Angeles.        
	The tout brought Singh to Calcutta on November 19. He gave Singh a passport bearing his photograph but issued in the name of Surinder Singh.        
	The same day Singh was sent to Dhaka by road. He returned to Calcutta by air on November 22. Immigration sources said it was done to make Singh familiar with the airport.        
	Singh then returned to Amritsar. Soon after, the tout got Singhs forged passport bearing a fake stamp of the immigration department of Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi.         
	He also got for Singh a false payroll certificate of November 2009 so he could prove that he had worked in the US.        
	Singh came to Calcutta on Monday night, hoping to catch a flight to Singapore the following morning. From Singapore, he had planned to fly to to Los Angeles.        
	The false payroll document led to his arrest, said Shakeel Ahmed, the deputy commissioner of police, security control. The paper triggered the suspicion of immigration officials, who detained Singh. During interrogation, he confessed that he had paid a tout for getting a job in the US, said Ahmed. Singh was later handed over to the airport police station.

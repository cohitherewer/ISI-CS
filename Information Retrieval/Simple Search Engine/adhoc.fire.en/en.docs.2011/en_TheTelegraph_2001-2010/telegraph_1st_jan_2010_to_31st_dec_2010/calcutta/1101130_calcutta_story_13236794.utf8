	An 11-cottah ancestral property in Alipore worth crores has become the bane of a Southern Park family that has sought police protection after being threatened by armed henchmen of a promoter on Sunday night.         
	The promoter had first approached the Pramaniks six months ago. We had refused to sell our property because the offer was not good enough. Since then, his men have made our life miserable, visiting us repeatedly and pressuring us to sell the plot. On Sunday night, they crossed all limits, said Siddhartha Pramanik, 37, who runs an interior designing firm.         
	According to him, his parents Shibu Kumar, 63, and Ranu, 58, his sister Soma Chakraborty and her eight-month-old daughter Samridhhi were home when the promoters men started banging on their door around 10.10pm on Sunday.         
	When we opened the door, the men outside started shouting my sons name, asking him to come out. There were around 10 of them, all of them reeking of alcohol. I was scared stiff, recounted Ranu.         
	Siddhartha later lodged a complaint with Lake police station, stating that a group of armed men forced their way into the 1/1 Southern Park address and abused the family members.        
	Before the men left, they threatened to kidnap Samridhhi if the family did not sell the property to the promoter within 48 hours.        
	The complaint mentions Saheb and Rana Sahu, alias Bhondu, as acting at the behest of the promoter.        
	Saheb and Bhondu approached us showing an interest to buy the plot at 8B Ashoka Road in Alipore. The plots at 8B and 8C Ashoka Road are our ancestral property and are currently leased out. The goons have been terrorising the lessees and us, said Siddhartha.        
	Lake police station has registered a case against the duo and six other unnamed men.        
	An investigator told Metro all eight were residents of Chetla.         
	A complaint has been lodged and we have started an investigation. Those found guilty will not be spared, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.

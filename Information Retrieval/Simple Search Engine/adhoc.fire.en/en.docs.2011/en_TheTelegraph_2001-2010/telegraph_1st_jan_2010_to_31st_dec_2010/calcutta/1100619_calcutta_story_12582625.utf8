	City schools have awarded their students a few free kicks this World Cup  from extended sports hour and soccer discussions in the morning assembly to freedom to flaunt their favourite team jersey or even sport a Messi hairdo.         
	The world is in the grip of Cup fever and we thought our students should also be granted the liberty of doing certain things connected to the sport that they otherwise wouldnt be allowed in school. We might allow students to come in jerseys of their favourite teams in keeping with the mood, said Meena Kak, the principal of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy.         
	The morning assembly at the Alipore school is already reserved for updates from South Africa and a Cup quiz is slated for Fridays. One of the later matches could be screened on campus so that the students can enjoy the game together.        
	At Delhi Public School Megacity, no class test will be held the day before and after the Cup finals on July 11.         
	South City International School, which has students from some of the countries that are competing for the Cup, has organised an inter-house Mini World Cup from Monday. The final is slated for July 10, a day before the title clash in South Africa.        
	Ours is a multinational school with students from South Korea, US, France and England. The kids are all very excited about the Mini World Cup concept, said principal John Bagul.        
	Eight teams in the primary section and four from middle school would compete for the mini cup in the colours of various countries. The children are busy trying to predict whether their results will match that of the Fifa World Cup.         
	Class VIII student Rachel Jones from the UK, who captains the girls soccer squad at CC amp;FC, said the event would make her feel she was a part of the real Cup. Class VII student Bruce Dingman, of the US, hoped he would be playing in his countrys colours.         
	The Heritage School has also timed its inter-house soccer tournament with the Cup. Team selection for the tourney slated for next week is a colourful affair with students coming in their favourite players jerseys and hairstyles, said principal Seema Sapru.        
	At Apeejay School, students have been circulating emails with World Cup details. A click of the mouse and you will find everything you want to know about the Cup and the teams, said Ayan Das Sharma, who has played in the under-17 Bengal team.         
	Class XII student Rohit Mukherjee of DPS Megacity has started a community called Game of Life: Football on Facebook. We keep uploading the match details, scores and schedules. A prediction game is also going on. Do try it, he insisted.

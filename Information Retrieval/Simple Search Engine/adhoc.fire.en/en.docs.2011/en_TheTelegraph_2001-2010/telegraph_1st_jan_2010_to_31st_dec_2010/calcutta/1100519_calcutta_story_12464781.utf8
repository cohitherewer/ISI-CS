The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court rewinds Riz probe
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court rewinds Riz probe
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Calcutta High Court has asked the CBI to probe the Rizwanur Rahman case afresh based on his brothers original police complaint, rendering null and void every investigation conducted and each scrap of evidence gathered over nearly three years.        
	The division bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice Prosenjit Mondal cited technical lacunae in the CBIs interpretation of the role assigned to it by the trial court of Justice Saumitra Pal on October 16, 2007, as the reason for dragging the probe into Rizwanurs unnatural death back from the finish line to the starting block.        
	The judges have given the CBI four months to complete the new probe and press charges.        
	The scope of the CBI (in the case) was limitedit was merely asked (by Justice Pal) to find out the cause of (Rizwanurs) death. It did not have the authority to file chargesheets against the accused, the division bench said on Tuesday, without explaining why a second trial court order by Justice Dipankar Dutta allowing the CBI to frame charges wasnt being considered.        
	A trial, if any, would have to be conducted on the basis of the findings of a fresh investigation by the CBI, the bench added.        
	Justice Dutta, who took over the case from Justice Pal following a routine change in intra-court jurisdiction, had asked the CBI to initiate criminal proceedings against the accused based on evidence of abetting suicide during a hearing on August 14, 2008.        
	Legal eagles termed Tuesdays judgment as unusual. Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: I am yet to receive a copy of the judgment but it is a fact that higher courts never pass such an order. When the CBI has already said it is a case of suicide and the trial has started on the basis of the findings, how can the high court say that fresh investigation should be conducted?        
	The seven accused  Rizwanurs father-in-law Ashok Todi, the businessmans brother Pradip Todi, their relative Anil Saraogi, police officers Ajay Kumar, Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das, and Syed Mohiuddin alias Pappu, a family friend of the Rahmans  had moved the division bench against Justice Duttas order.        
	Tuesdays judgment sent the Todis legal team scurrying on the path to Supreme Court, but Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur, a Trinamul Congress candidate in the municipal election, hailed it as the first step towards justice.        
	We have been saying from the beginning that Rizwanur was murdered, he didnt commit suicide. I had lodged a complaint on the day his body was found. I mentioned in my complaint that Ashok Todi was responsible for his unnatural death, Rukbanur said.        
	Team Todis senior counsel, D.N. Mitra, said his clients were expecting relief rather than a fresh probe. How can an agency be directed to conduct inquiries into the same incident twice? We have advised our clients to move the Supreme Court, he said.        
	The CBI top brass went into a huddle in Delhi with director Ashwani Kumar convening a meeting almost immediately after the division benchs verdict. Partha Tapaswi, the CBI counsel in Calcutta, declined comment but sources said the agency would seek legal opinion before deciding on its next step.        
	The ruling CPM welcomed the high courts order but also feared that its arch rival, the Trinamul, might use it as a poll weapon. The division benchs order has made it clear that the earlier order was not right. The directive to reopen the investigation also proves that the CBI probe was hasty and incorrect, said state secretariat member Rabin Deb.        
	But several CPM leaders said in private that they feared the Trinamul might exploit the case in its civic poll campaign by focusing on the alleged role of police officers in Rizwanurs mysterious death.         
	Rizwanur was found dead on a rail track on September 21, 2007, barely a month after marrying hosiery magnate Ashok Todis daughter Priyanka against her familys wishes.        
	Elder brother Rukbanur filed a complaint with Karaya police station in south Calcutta the same day, accusing Ashok Todi of having a hand in his siblings death. He and mother Kishwar later moved the high court seeking a CBI inquiry, saying they did not have faith in the CID because of the alleged involvement of senior police officers in the case.

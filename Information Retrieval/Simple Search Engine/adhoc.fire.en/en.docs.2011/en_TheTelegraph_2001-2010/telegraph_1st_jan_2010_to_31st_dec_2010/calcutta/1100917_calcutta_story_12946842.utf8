          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Skywatchers are in for twin treats next week, when Jupiter and Uranus will come closest to the Earth in 47 years. This means Jupiter, usually visible to the naked eye, can be seen in great detail through a telescope, while Uranus, usually too faint to be seen unaided, will be seen as a light bluish disc via a telescope.         
	On September 20 and 21, Jupiter will be clearly visible for 12 hours from sundown to sunrise, said Debiprosad Duari, the director (research and academic) of MP Birla Planetarium.         
	On September 21, the sun, Earth and Jupiter will be aligned in a straight line, forming an opposition, Duari explained. An opposition occurs when a superior planet (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune), the Earth and the sun align in a straight line with the Earth in the middle. All superior planets revolve around the sun in an orbit far larger than the Earths. On September 21, Uranus will also be in opposition.         
	The Earth and Jupiter cross each others paths once every 13 months, but are usually never this close. On September 21, the distance between the Earth and Jupiter will be 590 million km, 75 million km closer than the usual distance between the two planets in opposition.         
	Through a telescope,we will be able to see many of the Jupiters features such as its four largest moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) and the Great Red Spot, a cyclone twice as wide as the Earth, hitting another storm called Red Spot Junior, said Duari.

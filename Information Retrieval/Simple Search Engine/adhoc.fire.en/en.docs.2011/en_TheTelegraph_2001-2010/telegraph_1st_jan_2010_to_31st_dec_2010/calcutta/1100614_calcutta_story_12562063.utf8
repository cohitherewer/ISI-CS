	The Allahabad Bank branch on the ground floor of Stephen House in BBD Bag caught fire around 1pm on Sunday. The flames that were doused in an hour and a half caused minimal damage but prompted mayor select Sovan Chatterjee to voice plans of a civic fire services department.        
	Some workers employed by the building owner were removing the dysfunctional central airconditioning system of the bank when sparks from a gas cutter probably set the false ceiling alight. Cables and documents stored above the false ceiling fuelled the fire. Workers rushed out of the bank and alerted us, said the assistant manager of the branch, Aniruddha Naha.        
	Six tenders reached the spot promptly and firemen rushed in wearing gas masks. Carrying the masks were made mandatory after the Stephen Court blaze.        
	Chatterjee arrived at Stephen House soon after the firemen left. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is blamed after every fire. Hence, we are planning to start our own fire department with the latest equipment and young officers. The civic fire team will help the state governments fire services department as and when needed, he said.

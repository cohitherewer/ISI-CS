	Around 700 junior doctors are on strike in two state-run hospitals, paralysing medical services in several departments.         
	The doctors of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital and SSKM Hospital are protesting the alleged assault on their colleagues by relatives of two patients who died.        
	More than 350 interns and postgraduate trainees of the College Street hospital went on strike late on Sunday to protest the alleged assault on six of their colleagues.        
	A patient who had fallen from the third floor in an inebriated state was brought in on Sunday night. The junior doctor at the emergency told relatives to get a CT scan done. But the family refused. The man died shortly, following which the relatives beat up six doctors, said Shayon Manna, a junior doctor.        
	The protesters have demanded adequate security and ample stock of medicines and beds. They also want the authorities to bar the entry of more than two escorts for every patient.        
	On Monday afternoon, the emergency ward was brimming with patients but there was not a single doctor to attend to them.        
	Shonali Hazra had come from Shibpur with her husband, who had been suffering from diarrhoea. I havent come across any doctor for the past two hours. My husbands condition is worsening by the minute.        
	Around 300 junior doctors at SSKM went on strike on Monday afternoon after two of their colleagues were assaulted by a 20-strong mob following the death of a child suffering from neurological problems. We want all cops who were on duty at that time and the ward master be suspended, said a protesting doctor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayor chamber in tinderbox building
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayor chamber in tinderbox building

	Preach first and practise later seems to be the mantra of mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.         
	Since the Stephen Court blaze, he has been urging citizens to be vigilant against fires. However, on Wednesday, civic experts, along with those from police, fire services and CESC, found that the building where the lawyer mayor has a chamber lacks basic firefighting measures.         
	There is only one staircase and that too a wooden one. Also there are unauthorised structures on the roof, including a canteen where food is cooked, a fireman told a colleague after inspecting the five-storeyed 6 Old Post Office Street.        
	I generally go to the chamber in the evening. But I have never received any complaint from other lawyers who have offices in the building, said Bhattacharyya.         
	If the authorities suggest changes, we will ensure the owner takes corrective measures, added the mayor.         
	In the same corridor where Bhattacharyya has a chamber, a plate bearing state law minister Rabilal Moitras name hangs from a door. He has not been coming to the office as he cannot practice as a lawyer as long as he remains a minister, said a junior lawyer.        
	The team inspected three other buildings in central Calcutta  37A Bentinck Street, 10 Old Post Office Street and 12 Old Post Office Street  on Wednesday. The visit is part of a recently initiated drive to identify buildings vulnerable to fire.        
	In most of the buildings, the basic firefighting arrangements were lacking. Even the narrow corridors were not free as materials were stacked there, said Dipak Sarkar, the deputy director (fire prevention) of the fire services department, after the visit.         
	Banibrata Basu, the special commissioner of police (II), said a letter would be sent to the owners and if they did not take remedial measures within a week, legal action would be initiated against them.

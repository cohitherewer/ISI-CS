	The Bantala tanneries are posing a risk to the environment because of the failure of the state and the Centre to complete the construction of the common effluent treatment plant in the 12 years since work on the leather hub started, the CAG has said in a report.        
	Delay of more than 12 years in the completion of the project adversely impacted the objective of ensuring safe disposal of toxic industrial effluents and solid waste from tanneries, causing immense environmental damage and health risks, states the audit watchdog.        
	Even the part of the plant that has been set up is not being used by the 260-odd tanneries at Calcutta Leather Complex, which are disposing of waste in a hazardous manner, the report says.        
	The CAG has called for speedy completion of the project and asked the Union environment and forest ministry to monitor the project closely and impose penalties, including issuing closure order, on errant tanneries.        
	The apex court had in 1995 ordered 538 tanneries in the city, which were generating 30 million litres of effluent daily, to shift to a safe location outside where there would be a common effluent treatment plant.        
	The National River Conservation Directorate has sanctioned an interest-free loan for the state government to set up the plant at the Bantala complex, where all the tanneries were to be relocated.         
	The project was to be ready by November 1997 but is yet to be so.        
	Abhisek Dalmia, a director of ML Dalmia amp; Co that built the complex, said four of the six modules of the plant were ready.         
	The government had decided long back that the tanners association would build the other two.

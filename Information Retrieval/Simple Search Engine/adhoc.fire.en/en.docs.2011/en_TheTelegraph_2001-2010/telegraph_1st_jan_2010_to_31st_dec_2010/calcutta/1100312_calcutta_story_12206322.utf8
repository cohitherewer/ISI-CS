          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	City youths Ankit Shaw and Manish Agarwal carried fake driving licences as ID proof while using cloned credit cards as part of the racket involving Nigerians, sleuths said. They made the transactions at lightning speed, cops added.        
	The police suspect that the duo had connections with touts dealing in fake driving licences. Manish had bought a gold chain worth Rs 48,000 from a shop in Shyambazar on November 13, 2008. Hours later, he made a similar purchase at another store. The purchase slips were signed in the name of M.P. Gupta, said an officer.         
	Manish spotted a heavy gold chain, flashed a credit card and left in four minutes with the item. He did not even bargain, Sanjoy Pyne of Manik Chandra Pyne Jewellers, reportedly told the cops.         
	All the items were sold off within hours and the booty distributed, the sleuths said.

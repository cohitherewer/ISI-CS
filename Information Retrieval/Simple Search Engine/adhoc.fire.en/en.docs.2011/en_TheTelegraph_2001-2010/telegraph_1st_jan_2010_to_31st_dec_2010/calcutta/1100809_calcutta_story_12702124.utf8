                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Career trek off the beaten track
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                  Be what   you want
      Bartending            Deejaying            Tattooing            
	Niloy Das, a 21-year-old commerce graduate from St Xaviers College, refused to follow in the footsteps of his batchmates, most of whom were either applying to business schools or preparing to be a chartered accountant. He, instead, wants to be a tattoo artist.        
	Anjali Kanakia, 25, did her masters in the UK, but unlike most of her friends, she did not opt for an MBA. Anjali decided to be a photographer.        
	Niloy and Anjali are among the growing number of youths heeding the call of passion and daring to step off the beaten track  with or without their parents blessings.        
	It would have been natural for me to do an MBA. But I had photography as a subject and I really had a knack for it. So I went for a photography course, said Anjali. It was not easy though  her parents did not approve her decision to take up photography as a career though they didnt mind her pursuing it as a hobby.        
	Once the initial hurdle was overcome, the Lee Road resident again chose the not-so-easy path  going solo. I want to be a fashion photographer. I am doing projects for companies such as Benetton to add to my portfolio, she said.        
	Niloy has been hooked to tattooing since he took it up as a hobby in his third year in college.        
	His clientele  his friends in the initial years  has been swelling steadily, giving him the confidence to turn tattooing into a full-time profession. It was a hobby. I taught myself. Now Ill take it up as my full-time profession, said Das.        
	Several youngsters are trying their hands at bartending and deejaying, encouraged by the rise in the number of training centres in town.        
	Rinki Das, 23, a resident DJ at the lounge bar Heka in Stadel, started learning deejaying after completing her Class XII. Five years later, she is holding fort at the Salt Lake bar.        
	I started learning deejaying as I was always curious about it. Now, its my only profession, said the graduate in English literature.        
	The money may not be great to start with but given the options for professional DJs  private parties, radio, shopping malls, restaurants and even films  the remuneration can be anything between Rs 10,000 and a lakh.        
	There has been a steady rise in enquiries about deejaying as a profession. Earlier, only students were interested. Now even those who have steady jobs are coming forward, said DJ Akash, who runs a deejaying institute in the city.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civic hammer on illegal mart

	The civic body on Wednesday started pulling down illegal parts of Five Star Market in Kidderpore following a high court order issued more than a month ago.        
	Accompanied by a large posse of policemen, the civic workers during the day demolished two rooms on the terrace of the three-storeyed structure that had been constructed illegally as part of the market 30 years ago.        
	In civic records, the address of Five Star Market is shown as 26 Karl Marx Sarani while the plot on which the illegal structure stands has been identified as 8E Dent Mission Road. There are around 25 shops on the ground floor of the illegal part while the first and second floors are used as godowns.        
	A police officer present at the spot during the demolition said: We did not face any resistance today but we are expecting some when the ground floor will be demolished.        
	The high court order had stated that 8E Dent Mission Road had to be converted into an open space within 10 days. We received a certified copy of the order a few days ago, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	A Calcutta Municipal Corporation official said the first order for pulling down the building was issued by the civic building department in 1986.        
	The traders moved court against the diktat and the case dragged on for more than two decades with the high court finally putting its seal of approval on the civic bodys order.        
	Traders who operate from the illegal building said they would resist the demolition drive. They all have valid documents for their shops. Where will they go if the building is pulled down? said Md Ayub, the general secretary of the Kidderpore Merchants Welfare Association.

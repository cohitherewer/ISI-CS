										      stage                        A scene from Madhabi				                           
	Her stage debut was as five-year-old Kirtiman in D.L. Roys Karagar. All these years I have thought of nothing but theatre. Though I got to direct Khunje Nao for another group and a couple of one-act plays, somehow the directorial role for a major Nandikar production eluded me, smiles Swatilekha Sengupta, whose directorial debut Madhabi comes when shes touching 60.        
	The play was staged at the Academy of Fine Arts on Tuesday.         
	Written by Bhisham Sahni as Madhavi in Hindi, the play recounts the Mahabharata tale of Gallav, son of a hermit, and Madhavi, daughter of Yayati, the scholar-king. It was first produced in 1984 by Prayog Theatre group in Delhi, and directed by M.K. Raina. Deepa Sahi played Madhavi. It has since been produced in various languages. This is the first Bengali production.        
	Every woman would identify with Madhabi, says Sengupta. Its the tale of a woman bartered repeatedly for 800 ashwamedhi horses. Blessed as she is with eternal youth, virginity and the ability to bear great kings, Madhabi is just an asset to her father Yayati, who gives her away in an act of generosity to Gallav. Gallav, professing love, uses her to fulfil his duty to Viswamitra. Madhabi doesnt even get to see the sons she bears for the kings as part of the bargain.         
	It goes to show that the world was hardly any easier for women then and has only got worse over the years. I dont believe in feminism or see my colleagues in terms of gender but this is obvious, isnt it? asks Satyajit Rays heroine of Ghare Baire.         
	Sengupta has translated the play into Bengali keeping in mind Sahnis modern language, set the background score with the band Mayukh-Mainak and written the songs.

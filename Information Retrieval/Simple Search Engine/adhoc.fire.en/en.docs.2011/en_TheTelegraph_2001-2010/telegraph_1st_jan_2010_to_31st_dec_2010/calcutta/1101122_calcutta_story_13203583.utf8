The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fatal faults in mishap zone 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fatal faults in mishap zone 
                          Illegal parking and dumping of building materials            A bus overtakes another crossing the centre line in the dark            An empty traffic police stand      Pictures by Anindya Shankar Ray                    
	A 10m stretch of Jessore Road has seen two fatal accidents in the past 10 days.        
	On November 12, a private bus had rammed into a pool car near BT College, killing its driver and injuring Class IV student Abhijit Santra.        
	The boy returned home in a wheelchair on Saturday with his left leg in a cast and injuries on other parts of his body. He cannot attend school for at least three months.        
	Six days after the accident, a minibus crashed into an ambulance at the same spot, injuring five persons. One of them later died.         
	Metro lists the many problems that have made the stretch deadly.        
	Illegal parking         
	Goods vehicles are illegally parked along Jessore Road, from Birati to Madhyamgram and beyond. Even major crossings like Birati, Michaelnagar, BT College and New Barrackpore are clogged because of illegal parking.        
	According to residents, a monthly payment of Rs 500 is all it takes to make cops look the other way. Those who park illegally for a few hours, only pay Rs 20 to police.         
	The dangers of illegal parking is apparent from what truck driver Ranjit Saha had said after the first accident. If I had a little more space on the side of the road, I could have allowed the speeding bus to pass and it would not have smashed into the pool car, he had said.        
	Residents and commuters also blamed illegal parking for accidents on the stretch.        
	Encroachment hurdle         
	The sides of the 36ft-wide road are encroached by shanties, numerous vehicle repair shops, dumped building materials and bus and taxi terminuses.        
	At least three bus routes  223, 30B/1 and 45  have terminuses at the BT College and Birati crossings on Jessore Road. Taxi and truck stands have also cropped up near BT College.        
	Every other day, a roadside garage starts operating here. As a result, two buses can barely move side by side on Jessore Road, said Niladri Bhowmik, a Madhyamgram resident.        
	Dark danger         
	The stretches between Michaelnagar and BT College and Doltala and New Barrackpore remain dark at night. This, coupled with the absence of road dividers, is to blame for many accidents on Jessore Road. The BT College stretch is the most dangerous with the road bending sharply.         
	Vehicles often cross the centre line while overtaking, which leads to accidents, said Subhasis Saha, a bank employee who lives in the area.        
	Missing cops        
	Cops are hard to spot between Birati and Madhyamgram, said commuters. The police booths have thus become shelters for vagabonds. Even at places where the cops are posted, like the Birati and New Barrackpore crossings, the men in uniform rarely haul up traffic rule violators.        
	After the November 12 accident, the cops took half an hour to reach the spot, said Ranjit Saha.         
	Police version         
	The road is narrow and installing median dividers would increase the traffic congestion, said an officer of North 24-Parganas police.        
	I will probe the allegations of policemen accepting bribes to allow illegal parking, said police superintendent Rahul Srivastava.         
	The police blamed lack of manpower for lax monitoring. We do not have enough personnel to man the stretch but we try to do as much as possible. Raids are often conducted to curb illegal parking, claimed an officer of airport police station.

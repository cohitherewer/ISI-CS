The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Five held with political hit-list
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Five held with political hit-list
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Five alleged contract killers, who police said had been assigned to murder two CPM leaders and one each from the Congress and Trinamul, were arrested around the city on Wednesday. Two revolvers, two cartridges, five cellphones, a Maruti car and 27kg of ganja were seized from them.         
	The men in their 30s  identified as Sweti Raja, Deepak Paswan, Sanwar Ali, Mohammad Aslam and Sankar Das  were wanted for several murders and murder attempts in South 24-Parganas, North 24-Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah.        
	Ali was picked up from Tarakeswar in Hooghly and the rest from Barrackpore and surrounding areas.        
	Police tracked down Raja while trying to trace Manish Shukla, who is wanted in connection with the murder of a nephew of a Congress leader from Barrackpore. Rajas arrest led to the arrest of the other four. The men confessed to a plot to kill political leaders, said an officer.        
	It appears that Shukla had chosen Raja to kill targets before the Assembly elections next year. Raja used to brief the rest of the gang members. Their plan was to aim, shoot and walk away, added the cop.        
	Known to be close to the CPM for years, Shukla switched allegiance to Trinamul in June 2009 and was allegedly involved in ransacking a CPM zonal office soon after.

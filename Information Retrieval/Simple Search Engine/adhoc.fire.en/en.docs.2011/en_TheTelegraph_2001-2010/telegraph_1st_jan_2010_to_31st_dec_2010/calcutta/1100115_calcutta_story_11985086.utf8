The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Politics fuels hope among fire victims
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Politics fuels hope among fire victims
          OUR BUREAU                                    
	A show of competitive compassion by political parties ahead of the civic polls has brought back a smile to the faces of the Ultandanga fire victims.        
	The day after Mamata Banerjee promised 650 houses for the residents of the slum that went up in flames on Tuesday, state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the government would rebuild the homes with Central funds.        
	The winners in the game of one-upmanship are the victims, who are now spending days  and the cold nights  in the two relief camps set up by the railway ministers Trinamul Congress and the CPM-run civic body.        
	Rajneetir khelay jodi amader moto gorib manusher upokar hoy, shey to khubi bhalo (If the game of politics benefits the poor like us, nothing like it), smiled Biren Parui, 44, a resident of Number 4 Basanti Colony.        
	We dont care who builds the houses or who pays for them. What we want is a roof above our head, said Sabitri Raha, 34, a domestic help.        
	Minister Bhattacharya said the houses  two-storeyed units where the fire victims as well as residents of adjoining slums will be accommodated  would come up under the Basic Urban Services for the Poor scheme, backed by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.        
	The civic body will oversee the construction, Bhattacharyya said after meeting mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and CMDA officials.        
	Half the project cost will come from the urban renewal mission  a central initiative  while the state will cough up 30 per cent. According to norms, the beneficiaries are to bear the rest of the cost but we dont want to take money from the affected people, the minister said.        
	The CMDA will pay Rs 1 crore and CPM MP Shyamal Chakraborty will contribute an equal amount from his local area development fund. Hidco will fork out Rs 50 lakh.        
	We are also seeking financial help from the railways. If necessary, I will write to the railway minister, Bhattacharya said.        
	The race to score a political brownie point might have kindled hopes in the minds of the homeless, but legal experts are uncertain whether the project  Mamatas or Bhattacharyas  would at all take off, given the dispute over the plots ownership.        
	Mamata had claimed that the slum plot was railway property, apparently because her ministry had in the early 1980s paid Rs 90 lakh to the government to build a terminal on 172 cottahs. The terminal never came up and Bhattacharya said the state was willing to repay the money to the Centre.        
	The railways had given 22 cottahs to a private group while it refused to take possession of the rest because of encroachments, the minister said.        
	It will be difficult to construct dwelling units on the plot because of its disputed ownership, lawyer Sailendra Kumar Rakshit said.        
	Helping hand: A school teachers association will set up a camp near the site on January 21 to help the affected students with books and notes.

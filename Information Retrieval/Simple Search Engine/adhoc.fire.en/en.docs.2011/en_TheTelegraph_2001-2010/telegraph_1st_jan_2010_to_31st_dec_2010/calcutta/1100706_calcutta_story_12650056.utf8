	Chief secretary Ardhendu Sen turned up at the high court during the bandh in compliance with an order by Justice G.C. Gupta asking him to clarify why contempt proceedings should not be drawn against him for not carrying out an order.        
	The chief secretary reached the high court at 10.30am and waited till 11.30am, when the judge heard the case and dispensed with his presence in the case in future. Lawyers usually request judges not to hear cases involving senior government officials on a bandh day. But Justice Gupta was firm on hearing the matter on Monday, a court official said.        
	nAccident victims: The condition of Shampa Bhattacharya and constable Parmeswar Pandey who were injured in an accident on Sunday near Teghoria was stable on Monday.        
	nEnvoy: The ambassador of Macedonia, Peter Jovanovski, called on the mayor on Monday afternoon and expressed the desire of the people of his country to erect a statue of Mother Teresa in Calcutta.

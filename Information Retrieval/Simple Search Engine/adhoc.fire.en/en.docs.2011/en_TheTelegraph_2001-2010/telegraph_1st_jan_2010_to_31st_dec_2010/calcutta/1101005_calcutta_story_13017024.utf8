	With respect to Campus cauldron over camera and card, September 16, I support the decision of the Jadavpur University authorities to install CCTV cameras on campus. Incidents of ragging, consumption of narcotics and other kinds of misconduct must be curbed at the institution.             
	The students should also be concerned about their universitys welfare and reputation. Students should focus on building their career.           
	Sukumar Ghosh, Mukundapur                     
	A few days after thanking their teachers and professors for making an impact on their lives on Teachers Day (September 5), the students union of Jadavpur University has demonstrated the most disgraceful act of dissent.           
	The gherao on campus reflects the ideology of Brand Bengal  might is right! The frequent bandhs and the JU gherao present a bleak picture of Bengal: a state which is not ready to change or for change.           
	Neelima Chakraborty, Address not given    
	According to the report Presi shortlist on govt table, September 10, the search panel set up to select the first vice-chancellor of the Presidency University has sent three suitable names of candidates to the government for scrutiny.             
	The unconfirmed indication from the higher education department that the search team could not convince anyone of international repute to accept the position indicates the disappointment that surely awaits the students. Their worst fears of someone with a distinct political colour occupying the coveted chair might come true.

	While reading about Sujit Shaw, I was thrilled to learn how this bright boy set about achieving his dreams, where we forget to even dream in our half-hearted daily lives (He limps to class but soars in his dreams, August 31).

	Apropos the report Colour culprit in street food faves, September 14, the synthetic food colours consumed are not excreted and collects in the body and may eventually lead to even organ failure.             
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation must spread greater awareness in this regard through advertisements.           
	The civic body should ban the sale of harmful food colours and issue a warning to vendors regarding their use. It should also take steps to enforce the ban on polythene bags and see to it that food is kept in covered vessels and served in clean utensils.           
	Jyoti Prakash Basu, Phoolbagan                     
	This is really a matter of grave concern for all citizens that adulterated food items are being sold in the market. It is a shame that the state laboratory does not have the adequate funds to even collect samples for testing.           
	Neera Fogla, Maniktala Main Road           
	It is alarming to note that banned colours are being blatantly used in food items. Even milk is being adulterated. As the CMC has been ineffective in curbing the menace, the government should request the services of reputable NGOs in this matter, empowering them to draw samples of cooked food items and vegetables.           
	If the samples contain banned colours, the eatery owner should be tried in a fast-track court. Exemplary punishment should be meted out to those who try to play with peoples lives

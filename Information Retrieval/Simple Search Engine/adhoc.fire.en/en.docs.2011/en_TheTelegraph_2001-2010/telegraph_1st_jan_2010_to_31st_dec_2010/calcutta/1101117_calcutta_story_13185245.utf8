          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A dull Calcutta Film Festival will end on a brighter note on Wednesday with the screening of Satyajit Rays Sikkim.        
	The Art and Culture Trust of Sikkim, which claims to be the owner of the documentary, has emailed its consent to the festival authorities for only one screening of the film.        
	The mail came last night and the chief minister has appreciated their spirit. The film will be screened tomorrow, said Manab Bandyopadhyay, Bengals deputy director of information.        
	The film was withdrawn from the festival after its premiere at Nandan on November 11 following an injunction from a Sikkim court. The trust had moved the court alleging copyright violation by the festival authorities.

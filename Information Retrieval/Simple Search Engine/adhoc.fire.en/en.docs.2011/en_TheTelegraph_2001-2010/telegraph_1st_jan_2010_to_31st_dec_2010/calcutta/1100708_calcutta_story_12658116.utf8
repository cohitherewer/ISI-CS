The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayor meets CPM minister
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayor meets CPM minister
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Trinamul mayor Sovan Chatterjee met municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya of the CPM at Unnayan Bhavan on Wednesday to discuss several development issues, including the one on modelling the Calcutta riverfront on Mumbais Marine Drive.        
	The meeting marks a departure from the usual practice of Trinamul leaders boycotting or avoiding meetings with state ministers.        
	The riverfront beautification is a pet project of Mamata Banerjee. Now that party colleague Mukul Roy is the junior shipping minister, it has become easier for the civic body to start the beautification project. The state government has agreed to the proposal, the mayor said.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will sign a memorandum of understanding with RITES, which will be in charge of planning. The CMC, port trust and CMDA will together bear the cost, said Chatterjee.        
	As part of the revamp plan, the CMC wants to pull down dilapidated warehouses, beautify the river banks and construct a 10-km motorable road from Ratanbabu Ghat in north Calcutta to Garden Reach in the south.        
	The mayor also requested the minister to hand over the upkeep of the Garden Reach water treatment plant  now maintained by the Calcutta Municipal Water Supply Authority (CMWSA), a state undertaking  to the CMC.        
	The minister said the CMC, along with CMWSA, will look after the property, said Chatterjee.

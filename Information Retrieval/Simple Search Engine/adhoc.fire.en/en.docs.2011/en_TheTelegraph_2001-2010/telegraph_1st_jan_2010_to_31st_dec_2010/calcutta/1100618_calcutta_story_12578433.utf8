                      Fantasy fiction                    One of the leading writers of modern Bengali literature, Shirshendu Mukhopadhyays approach to storytelling is intelligent, sensitive and lively, yet somewhat detached. As a master narrator, he focuses more on the gradual revelation of his characters than on narration of events. His novels and short stories reveal an undercurrent of love and faith in humanity over human violence and aggression. Funny and Funnier, the English translation of a collection of 10 hilarious stories by Mukhopadhyay, takes the reader on a journey to an imaginary land where incongruity and anomaly are the order of the day. Readers will meet the thief who does not like to steal, the genie that wants to burp, the cow and the tiger that drink together and the gentleman who is too polite to object even when an ox butts him in the ribs. They can also visit the town where ghosts and people co-exist amicably and the village where anyone who has a drink from the well finds even iron digestible. Or join the famous detective Barada Charan as he rapidly uncovers mysterious plots involving stolen gourds and masterful disguises. Set in timeless little towns with genial folks, the authors narrative skills and witty observations will make these delightful tales an instant hit with young people. This evening Oxford Bookstore, Calcutta and Scholastic host the launch of the book. It will be followed by readings of excerpts from the book and an interactive session with the author and translators Palash Baran Pal and Abhijit Gupta.

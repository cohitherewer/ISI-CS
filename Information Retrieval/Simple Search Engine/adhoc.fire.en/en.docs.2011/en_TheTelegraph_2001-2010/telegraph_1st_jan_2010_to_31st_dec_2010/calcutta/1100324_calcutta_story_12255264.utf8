The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro |Fire behind, fatal fall ahead
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fire behind, fatal fall ahead
          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Trapped between a raging inferno and a sure drop to death, seven people stood helplessly on a third floor parapet of Stephen Court as firemen barked orders from below but refused to come up and help.         
	Soma Sen, who runs a training centre for MBA aspirants with husband Sandip on the third floor of the building, recounted her hour of horror on Tuesday afternoon.         
	By the time we realised there was a fire, it was too late. Suddenly smoke gushed in and covered us in black soot. There was a horrid stench. We opened a glass window that had a detachable grill and climbed out. Seven of us stood on an iron parapet. The firemen came but didnt seem to know how to operate the aluminium ladder. Worse, they just shouted instructions from below, none made an effort to come up and help us. There were no nets either. We stood there for half an hour,.till two of our students helped us reach the ladder.         
	In the courtyard-cum-parking area encircled by the different blocks of Stephens Court, other residents poured out their tales of terror. A couple of fire engines were parked inside, but the firemen stood arguing about how to take the hose up. Near them, the blackened entrances of two blocks with Lift 2 and Lift 3 marked above looked forbidding.        
	Suddenly an angry voice cut through the melee. I rushed home as soon as I heard the news and somehow managed to get my mother down, but my husband was stuck. The firemen were of no help. They just stood on the main road and made no effort to come in and penetrate the wall of fire. I finally managed to bring my husband down the stairs with the help of local people, fumed Zinia Dasgupta, a resident of the sixth floor.         
	Others berated the authorities for their misplaced concerns. The fire minister is so concerned about the safety of that one pavilion that the Kolkata Knight Riders have built at the Eden Gardens, but when there is a fire of this magnitude where is he? demanded a disgusted onlooker.        
	He said his friends father had been rescued without any help from the authorities. The tenders were trying to find parking place, he added.         
	Some stood ashen-faced, having seen fellow residents or co-workers jump to their deaths. I had come down for lunch. The minute I realised there was a fire, I called up my colleagues to rush out of our office, which is on the fifth floor. Then I saw a woman falling down, Ankit Sheth said with a shudder.         
	Gouri Guha Niyogi, a resident of Stephen Court since 1990, said she fled the spot after seeing the body of her neighbours who had tried to climb down the drainpipe and had suffered a fatal fall.        
	Outside, Ansh Kumar, the owner of an event management company, was stuck on the ledge of the fifth floor for almost an hour. A skylift finally rescued him around 3.30pm.         
	I thought today I would die. I had started giving up hope. I was so nervous, I dont know how to thank god for saving my life, he sobbed.         
	Around 5.30pm, as the cops barred people from entering the building, a fight broke out between them and the people. Where were you when the people needed help? We were the ones helping out then, screamed one resident, to which one cop shot back: What did you do? You did nothing!              
	EYEWITNESS              
	I was having lunch at Bar-B-Q with four friends. All of a sudden, the restaurant turned dark. Looking outside, I saw thick, black smoke and realised that the MusicWorld building was ablaze. I saw people jumping from the top floors of the building. My friends and I rushed out to help the injured.              
	Nikhil Singh, 3rd year student of St Xaviers College        
	The lights in our office started flickering. Fearing another major power cut, we were about to shut down the computers when I heard shouting and screaming. We tried to rush out of the building. It was dark by then. I clutched the hand of a woman and we managed to grope our way out. Just then, I saw someone jump off the building.         
	I put my hand over my head and rushed out, thinking that I cant die because of my baby girl at home. I saw people dangling from the windows. It was traumatic.              
	Somini Sen Dua, has her office on the first floor of Stephen Court        
	I was walking down Park Street. When I reached the Free School Street-Park Street crossing, I saw the full face of the flames. Parts of air-conditioners, chunks of concrete, wooden window frames  all sorts of things were crumbling. Suddenly the crowd screamed Porlo, porlo and to my horror I saw someone tumbling from the floors on fire. It seemed more like a panic reaction than a premeditated jump. It reminded me of the World Trade Center pictures.              
	M.N. Banerjee, 72, retired bureaucrat        
	I was having lunch at Flavours of China across the street with my family when we noticed the smoke outside. Soon, a massive fire broke out. I saw people trying to flee the burning floors by clinging to cable wires, but they snapped and they fell. The crowd on the road was uncontrollable.         
	Raghav              
	My help told me about the fire and I ran out. The fire was raging by then. It was like 9/11. I was so shaken up, watching elderly people from the building coming out.               
	Suzanne Giri, 40, a resident of the adjoining Queens Mansion         
	My office is above Flurys. I had gone to a travel agency on the ground floor after lunch when suddenly I noticed smoke between two buildings. Minutes later we got news about the fire. We tried calling the fire brigade, but no one picked up. Before we knew, the fire had become huge.         
	I rushed back to my office and then all of us got out. As I was coming out, I saw four people fall off the higher floors.               
	Saurav Chatterjee, 39, CEO of Highlife Management        
	I realised something was wrong when I saw people running helter-skelter. A huge crowd had gathered on Park Street and when I looked up, all I could see was smoke billowing. It looked so frightening, like a disaster movie.         
	Ratul Sood, owner of Burlington, off Park Street        
	The building has two entrances. The fire started on the Middleton Row side. We smelt smoke, rushed out to see people screaming and shouting, and realised that there was a fire. My mother is elderly. My first concern was to get her and my family out of the building. I also told those on the upper floors to open the back entrance and use that to come out.               
	D.K. Bibra, resident

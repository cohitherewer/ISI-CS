The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lets sit where he sat, eat what he ate   Diners target tables that hosted Rahul
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lets sit where he sat, eat what he ate     - Restaurants feel the Rahul Gandhi effect          MOHUA DAS                            (Top) The Peter Cat chair where Rahul Gandhi sat on Wednesday; the Bhojohori Manna table.

	Q: Which are the two most wanted restaurant tables in Calcutta?        
	A: Table No. 21 at Peter Cat on Park Street and Table no. 8 at Bhojohori Mannas Hazra branch.              
	Those are the tables where a certain Mr Rahul Gandhi had turned up as just another diner mid-week. And those are the tables that have emerged this weekend as the centre of attraction at these popular eat-out addresses.        
	We bullied our husbands into taking us to Peter Cat on Friday to dine at the table where Rahul Gandhi had been three nights ago. We love him, gushed friends Ritu and Smita, both 40, who were in JNU when Rahul was in St Stephens.        
	The waiters at Peter Cat have been fielding questions ranging from, what did he order? to was he wearing white pyjama kurta or was he formally dressed?; how is he to look at? (from the women) to was he polite?        
	Most diners have been very curious about Rahul Gandhis visit (on Wednesday evening). They want to know which table he sat at. Those who happen to be sitting on the same chair get very excited, said Hansel Bergeon, the manager of Peter Cat.        
	The Rahul effect can even be seen in what diners are ordering. If Peter Cats signature Chelo Kebab is most wanted, it now has the two other things the Gandhi scion dug into for company.        
	The Chelo Kebab has always been a popular item but we have noticed that a majority of customers have been ordering Chelo Kebab, Grilled Fish Sizzler and Chocolate Souffle more than usual, said Hansel.        
	While his dinner companions had also ordered Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala and more, Rahul had not touched that.                                    Rahul Gandhi stepping out of Peter Cat. (Anindya Shankar Ray)       
	The other food address basking in the Rahul afterglow is Bhojohori Manna, where he had dined on Tuesday night.        
	The maximum number of queries about Rahul Gandhis dinner are somehow coming in at the Hindustan Park branch. Most customers feel that Rahul must have gone there since its more spacious and the menu has greater variety, said Siddharth Bose of Bhojohori Manna.        
	The common query is Shunlam ekhane Rahul Gandhi khete eshechhilo (We heard that Rahul Gandhi had come for a meal here). Why did he go to the smaller Hazra branch, they often wonder.        
	The waiters have been briefed to tackle these questions since we had been told that Rahul wanted to go and eat at a simple Bengali restaurant, said Bose.        
	Apart from wanting to see the four-seater where Rahul had tucked into his Ilish Borishali, the diners at the Hazra foodstop ask who was accompanying him and whether the restaurant had to be emptied to host the Gandhi.        
	Some are very curious to know if he actually paid for the meal, trying to gauge the kind of person that he really is, said Bose.        
	It feels good to know that the man who could soon be PM pays for his meals at a restaurant, said Partha Sen and family from Rashbehari, dining at Bhojohori Manna.

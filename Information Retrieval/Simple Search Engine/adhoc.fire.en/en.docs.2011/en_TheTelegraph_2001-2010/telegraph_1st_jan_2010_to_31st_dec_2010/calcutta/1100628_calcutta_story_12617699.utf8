The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hope to heartache in 90 minutes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hope to heartache in 90 minutes
                                      
	The mood in the England camp was one of cautious optimism in the countdown to the big one at at Bloemfontein. Metro was in touch with a handful of British citizens in Calcutta for whom the 90 minutes on Sunday went from hope to heartbreak.        
	Kick-off        
	Why was there such uncharacteristic quiet in the English ranks? A combination of their stars under-performing and flashes of fast-paced German brilliance meant their worst fears  being knocked out of World Cup 2010  could come true in less than two hours.        
	Now, its either win or go home, Paul Walsh put it bluntly. Ill be watching it at home quietly with two of my English friends, added the founder of Jungle Crows, a rugby club in Calcutta.         
	Design consultant Alan Archment, too, chose quiet over crowd. He settled down at home with his wife and two-year-old daughter. All three were down with the flu and so were desperately hoping for Steven Gerrard and his men to serve up the perfect tonic. I really expect England to get their thing together and put up a good show, said Alan.        
	If Josh Mukherjee, 28, was back home in London on Sunday afternoon, hed be around Leicester Square, a favourite spot when Englands playing the World Cup. But he was in Calcutta watching with a friend. I really hope they win it, said the music samplist.              
	Half-time        
	By 8.15pm, the heart was beating fast and the adrenaline flowing. For Alan, it was all about the goal scored  or not scored  by Frank Lampard. Weve scored twice, been denied once. That second goal.But Im hoping that the game ends with England 3 or 4 to Germanys 2.        
	Alan liked the way Lampard and Gerrard had responded to the challenge, but waded into Wayne Rooney. If this is how hes going to play, Rooney shouldnt be on the team!         
	Paul was happy with the very strong comeback and Josh was optimistic, not having crumbled against the German onslaught and finished the first half on a high.        
	Need to keep that attacking momentum going, but the defence must be more organised, warned Paul. Josh wanted some more pace on the flanks.        
	Final whistle        
	Disappointment with a capital D. The better team won, shrugged Paul, putting up a brave front. Josh was sad to see England just fall apart. High on his blame list were manager Fabio Capello, goalkeeper David James and the goal that wasnt.        
	Alan looked  or rather glared  at the big picture. Its all about the corporatisation of English football. They are busy trading international stars and local talent is on the backburner, fumed the football fan. Ill bet a 100 bucks (Mesut) Oezil will be playing the EPL next season!        
	So, how would he beat the blues? Ill watch a movie and maybe Ill start supporting Germany now!                    MOHUA DAS AND KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR

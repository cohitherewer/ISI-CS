The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vampire takes on boy wiz in twilight zone
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Vampire takes on boy wiz in twilight zone
  - Teen brigade drives book sales on eve of Eclipse release in US as Forks rivals Hogwarts          RADHIKA SEN                          A Twi-hard at Crossword on Tuesday. (Rashbehari Das)                                        
	When Harry Potter arrived, many thought that nothing  or no one  could get close to him. Till the inhumanly good-looking Edward Cullen, vampire, came along and fell in love with the detached and clumsy Bella, a human. Girls all over are dying for him. And that includes in city bookstores.        
	On the eve of the US release of The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, the third instalment in the movie series starring teen sensation Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, sales are soaring at Crossword. The Twilight series is now selling more than Harry Potter, by almost 30-40 per cent. The first book was a phenomenon, said Sidharth Pansari of the bookstore chain.        
	It may take months for the June 30 US release to hit theatres in India, but that hasnt stopped Stephenie Meyer, with her four-part Twilight series from running J.K. Rowling, with her seven books (and six films), close in far-off Calcutta.        
	In the overall book battle between a boy wizard and a good vampire, Hogwarts (Harry Potters school of magic) is still ahead of Forks (the Twilight town). I have read the Twilight series but it doesnt match up to Harry Potter. The Potter storyline goes beyond just romantic drama and includes so many other elements like magic and fantasy, said 14-year-old Ritika Agarwal of Modern High School.        
	The Twi-hard fan count is biggest in the 14-16 age bracket of girls. Customers of all ages flock to the store the day a new Harry Potter hits the racks. That is not the case with Twilight, said Gautam Jatia of Starmark. The demand ratio of Potter and Twilight is 65:35, said an Oxford Bookstore official, adding that the growing demand for Twilight among teenagers is fast bridging the gap.        
	And how do the movie releases lift sales? The movies increased sales of both the books, Twilight and New Moon, by at least 60-70 per cent. Eclipse should be no different, according to Oxford Bookstore.        
	Meanwhile, girls keep swooning. I swooned when I saw Rob Pattinson. That is when I bought the first book. Now I have finished all four books and cant wait to see Eclipse, said 19-year-old Apeksha Thakur. For 24-year-old Twi-hard fan Rittika Roy Burman, book scores over film. When I read the first book, it made me want to believe in the unbelievable. Edward Cullen is every girls dream.

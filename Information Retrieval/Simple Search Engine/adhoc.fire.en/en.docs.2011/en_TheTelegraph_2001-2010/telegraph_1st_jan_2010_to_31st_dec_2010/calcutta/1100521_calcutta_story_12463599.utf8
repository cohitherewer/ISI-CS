The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Off the beaten canvass track
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Off the beaten canvass track
  - CIVIC POLL 2010: CANDIDATES USE TOOLS TECH AND TRENDY, EXAMINEES BRACE FOR PUSHBACK BLUES          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                    Congress candidate Mala Roys poll leaflet; the World Cup itinerary on the back				                                                   
	Good ol graffiti may still be the communication tool of choice but candidates are veering off the beaten campaign trail this civic election with everything from online networking to bulk messaging, World Cup football fixtures to Bengali New Year calendars.        
	The Congress nominee from ward 88, Mala Roy, has got the itinerary of World Cup 2010 printed on the back of her poll leaflets to lure voters to take at least a second look instead of throwing these away after a cursory glance. The CPM candidate for ward 50, Rakhi Bose, has been distributing Bengali New Year calendars with her name on them.        
	Bablu Karim, the Trinamul Congresss candidate in ward 79, had planned to distribute caps with the party symbol and a battery-operated fan fixed to it, but the State Election Commission shot down the proposal citing the conduct code.        
	Party colleague Sushanta Ghosh, a nominee for ward 107, was distributing bottles of mineral water among voters as a symbol of his promise to bring sweet water to homes in Bosepukur until the poll panel stepped in.        
	Ghosh has since been relying heavily on his new campaign manager, a Nokia E63 that he uses not only to schedule his appointments and set reminders but also connect with prospective voters on the social networking site Orkut. I have had an Orkut account for one-and-a-half years now but I never thought I would be networking with voters on that site, said Ghosh.        
	The Orkut community of Trinamul Congress Supporters was 2,153-strong at last count.                              KNOW YOUR CANDIDATE, KNOW YOUR CUP: When will Lionel Messi (above) and Kaka take the field?    
	Another party candidate, Jui Biswas of ward 81, is glued to her laptop when she isnt campaigning door to door, using chain emails to spread her message. I have included my email ID in my leaflets and receive 40 to 50 mails a day. I reply to each mail, said Jui, an MBA.        
	Those who are not on the Net are networking through bulk SMS. We have a database of numbers that is being used to spread our poll message, said Taniya Ghosh, the Congresss nominee for ward 50.        
	Trinamuls Karim, however, insists that not everything a candidate does should be looked at as a gimmick. I have been handing over a blank piece of paper and an envelope to voters during my door-to-door visits, asking them to explain the problems they are facing so that we can address these if our party gets a chance to run the board, he said.       
	The Left Front, which is fighting with its back to the wall, recently launched a refurbished website  www.leftfrontwb.in  with a section where voters can ask their councillors-in-waiting any question. We are aware of the power of the Internet and would not like to miss the opportunity to communicate our views online to the electorate, said tourism minister Manab Mukherjee.        
	Trinamul too has been using its website  www.allindiatrinamulcongress.org  to familiarise voters with its candidates and the manifesto that promises to transform Calcutta into London. We have mentioned the phone numbers of all 141 candidates for voters to speak directly to them, if they wish to, said party leader Arup Biswas, brother-in-law of candidate Jui.

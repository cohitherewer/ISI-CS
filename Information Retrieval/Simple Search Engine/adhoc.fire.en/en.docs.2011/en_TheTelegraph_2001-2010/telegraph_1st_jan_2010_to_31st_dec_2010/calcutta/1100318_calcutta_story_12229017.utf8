The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro suffers 4-hour hitch
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro suffers 4-hour hitch
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A defective rake stalled Metro rail services between Tollygunge and Kavi Nazrul for nearly four hours on Wednesday afternoon, highlighting the transport lifelines failure to modernise its fleet and reduce turnaround time.        
	Trains didnt ply on the southern extension from 12.24pm till 4.14pm with engineers struggling to repair the locked axle of a rake that suddenly came to a halt on the tracks near Kavi Nazrul.        
	An official of Metro Railway said the train was about to enter Kavi Nazrul to pick up passengers after changing tracks at Shahid Khudiram (Birji) station a little after noon when the axle got locked for no apparent reason. The train wouldnt budge. The driver called the control room and our engineers rushed to the spot, he added.        
	Two trains packed with passengers were stranded, one at Gitanjali (Naktala) and the other at Netaji (Kudghat).        
	Services on the old Tollygunge-Dum Dum route continued, though with three fewer rakes than the 18 that do duty on a normal day.        
	Metro Railway was supposed to get two new rakes before last Puja and 13 more, including air-conditioned ones, early this year. Two of them will arrive very soon, claimed an official.        
	For schoolteacher Anahita Karmakar, the midday Metro hitch meant reluctantly trudging back to the crowded street from Masterda Surya Sen (Bansdroni) station to catch a bus back home. Everything goes haywire if services are stalled on a weekday, she complained.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Joyoshi Dasgupta, a physics lecturer at Manindra Chandra College, has cracked the 2009 civil services examinations the results of which were announced on Thursday.        
	Joyoshi, a resident of Lake Town, has come 42nd on the all-India merit list. The alumnus of La Martiniere for Girls had graduated from Presidency College in 2003 and stood first in Calcutta Universitys MSc exams. She has cleared the civil services exam in her third attempt.        
	It has been my childhood dream to join the civil services, she told Metro.        
	Unlike most IAS aspirants, she did not enrol herself with any of the reputable civil service coaching centres outside Bengal. Before the 2009 civil service exams, she had joined a Salt Lake institute.        
	A total of 875 candidates have been recommended for appointment to the IAS, IFS, IPS and other central services, an official said.

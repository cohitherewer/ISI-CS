The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | High court reprieve for Housefull
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      High court reprieve for Housefull
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER         A division bench of the high court on Thursday stayed an order of a single-judge bench and allowed Sajid Nadiadwala to continue using the Laawaris song Apni toh jaise taise in his film Housefull.  The bench, however, asked Eros International Media Private Limited, the distributor of Housefull, to deposit a bank guarantee for Rs 50 lakh in favour of Puneet Mehra, the son of Laawaris maker Prakash Mehra.  The ruling followed an appeal by Housefull producer Nadiadwala against Justice Nadira Patherya rsquo;s order restraining him from screening the song till further orders.  The division bench headed by the Chief Justice also directed Saregama, the copyright holder of jaise taise which featured Amitabh Bachchan, and Eros International to furnish a bank guarantee for Rs 25 lakh in favour of Anandji Virji Shah, who had composed the song with his late partner Kalyanji.  The bench asked Nadiadwala to keep the proceeds of Housefull in a separate bank account. The matter will be heard again in the last week of June.  Puneet Mehra had moved court alleging Saregama had flouted copyright norms by allowing Nadiadwala to use jaise taise. During the hearing, it was revealed that the music company had allowed Nadiadwala to use the song against a payment of Rs 50 lakh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop guidelines for Kali Puja
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cop guidelines for Kali Puja
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti on Sunday morning handed over to Kali Puja organisers a set of dos and donts, with emphasis on following pandal construction norms.         
	We have asked the organisers to abide by the road encroachment norms fixed by the high court while constructing pandals. Ensuring that the high court guideline is followed will be our prime responsibility, said Chakrabarti.        
	When organisers requested the police commissioner for relaxation in pandal construction norms, Chakrabarti turned them down.        
	This is the courts order and we cannot do anything. If the organisers file a petition in court and get a fresh order, we will have nothing to say. We will work to ensure the implementation of the court order, the police chief said.        
	Chakrabarti also reminded the representatives of the 1975 puja organising committees that those bursting banned crackers would be punished. The guideline also spells out the immersion schedule of Kali idols.        
	There would be special police deployment on the night of Kali Puja. Every year, there are complaints of nuisance and mischief on city streets. This year, we have decided to take some special steps to stop this menace.        
	The police have already banned early inauguration of pujas.        
	No organiser will be allowed to inaugurate pujas before November 4. We have taken the decision to avoid traffic congestion, said Chakrabarti.        
	The officers-in-charge of 48 police stations across the city have been asked to hold meetings with residents associations of highrise buildings.        
	We will ask them not to throw crackers from the rooftops of their buildings. The police will conduct surprise raids and stern action will be taken against offenders, said a senior officer.        
	To prevent violation of sound norms, the police have banned DJs and use of loudspeakers in immersion processions.        
	The police stations have been asked to act promptly if they receive any complaint of forcible chanda collection.

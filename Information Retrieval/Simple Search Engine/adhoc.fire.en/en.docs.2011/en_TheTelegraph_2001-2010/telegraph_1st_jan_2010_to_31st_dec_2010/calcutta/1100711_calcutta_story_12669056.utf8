The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | On Shiva the Tibetan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      On Shiva the Tibetan
                              Amish Tripathi shares a light moment at the launch of The Immortals of Meluha. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                            
	Fnance professional and alumnus of IIM Kolkata, Amish Tripathi, 35, has written a novel titled The Immortals Of Meluha, which was launched at the South City Mall Starmark on June 25.         
	The book is the first of a trilogy on Shiva, in which the god of destruction has been portrayed as an ordinary Tibetan man whom myth and legend have deified. The story is set in Meluha, another name for the Indus Valley, in 1900 BC.         
	This book is a revisionary take on history, said the author. I wasnt in control of the story at all. Perhaps this is how Lord Shiva chose to express his presence, he added. The high point of the event was an audio-visual clipping on the book with music by Taufiq Qureshi: the sound of the Tandav stotram, incessant drum beats and blowing of conch shells.         
	Durbar novel        
	The Indian political novel is emerging as a genre of fiction with Hachette India publishing K.P. Singhs Delhi Durbar and Young Turks and Tuhin A. Sinhas Of Love and Politics.         
	A third by Singh is due in October called War Ministry. Evidently influenced by Jeffrey Archer, Singh in Delhi Durbar follows a Vice-Presidents plot to impose military rule on the country. In Young Turks he traces the lives of three school friends carving a career in Indian politics. Why is that its always three friends?         
	Hatchette India was so confident of Singhs novels that it had made a money-back offer to readers if they werent satisfied after reading Delhi Durbar. Thats a smart marketing move but how does the reader convince the bookseller that he is not 100 per cent satisfied?

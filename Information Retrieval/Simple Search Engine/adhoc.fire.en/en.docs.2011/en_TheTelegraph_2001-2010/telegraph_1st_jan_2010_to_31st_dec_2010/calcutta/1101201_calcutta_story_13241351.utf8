The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gas leak scare empties school
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Gas leak scare empties school
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Students were evacuated from a primary school at VIP Bazaar off the EM Bypass on the suspicion of a gas leak after a foul smell pervaded classrooms on Tuesday morning.        
	About 50 boys and girls had barely proceeded to the meditation room after reaching the school, run by Ananda Marga, around 7.30am when they started complaining of the pungent smell.        
	We stopped other students from entering the school. Teachers and officials went round the campus but could not locate the source of the smell, said Avadhut Anandapremabitta, the principal.        
	Soon, the school authorities declared a holiday and asked guardians to take away their wards.        
	Residents later found the smell was coming from an uncovered drain adjoining the campus and alerted police and fire brigade.        
	Firemen said stagnant water and vegetable waste dumped in the drain by stall owners at a local market had combined to generate the gas. They said the gas was not combustible.        
	Biswajit Dey, who teaches chemistry in a college, said the gas was probably methane. Prolonged inhalation of the gas causes nausea but it is non-toxic, he said.

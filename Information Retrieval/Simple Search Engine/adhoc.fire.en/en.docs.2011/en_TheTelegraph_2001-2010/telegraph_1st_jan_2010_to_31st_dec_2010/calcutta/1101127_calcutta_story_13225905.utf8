                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      3 in net for Oxytown double murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                      The house where the duo were murdered                          
	Three youths were arrested on Friday in connection with the September 27 murder of a homemaker and her help in Oxytown but police are still clueless about the motive or the mastermind.        
	A laptop that went missing from the murder spot was found in possession of the trio  Somnath Tanti, Sadaf Parvez and Safique Ahmed Khan  who were picked up from Thakurpukur.        
	The police said the trio had overpowered Mausumi Ghosh, tied up her hands and slit her throat. Mausumis help Parul, who was hit on the head with a heavy object, was murdered to ensure there was no witness.        
	The killers had spared Mausumis two-year-old son Avirup, who had apparently seen the murder and cried out ora maa-ke marche (they are killing mother), and eight-month-old daughter.        
	Sources in the South 24-Parganas police claimed three other members of the gang were absconding.        
	Somnath had visited the Ghoshes house in the Thakurpukur neighbourhood several times when his mason father worked for the family, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Mausumi knew Somnath and had opened the gates to let him in. All the gang members are local people.        
	On Friday, the three were produced at an Alipore court and remanded in police custody. A preliminary probe has revealed they had no criminal background and had been hired to murder Mausumi.        
	Its too early to say who had hired them... Mausumis husband Avik is among the suspects, the officer said.        
	After the murder, Mausumis father had identified Avik as the prime suspect and accused him of pressuring his wife for dowry.        
	The husband, an engineer, proclaimed his innocence on Friday and said he was happy that the killers had been arrested.        
	There is an attempt to frame me.... I am innocent and prepared to face a lie-detector test, Avik told Metro from Munger, where he works.        
	After Mausumis father named Avik a suspect, neighbours attacked his elder sister Chandrima Chowdhury, a doctor who stays a stones throw away, and her husband.

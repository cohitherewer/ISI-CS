The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sashthi traffic surge stumps cops 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sashthi traffic surge stumps cops 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Central Avenue chock-a-block at 6.30pm on Wednesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	A traffic bottleneck in every Puja block was the pandal-hoppers bugbear on Sashthi with the cops clueless for the most part about how to keep the carriageways clear.        
	By the time the police were out in full force, it was 6pm and traffic was almost out of control on most thoroughfares from north to south.         
	Central Avenue bore the brunt of the puja traffic pressure through the day with vehicles sometimes moving barely an inch a minute along the entire length of the road. It didnt help that portions of the road have been barricaded for pedestrians headed for the pandals at Bowbazar and Mohammed Ali Park.         
	The problem worsened in the afternoon with College Street, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Sovabazar Street, Vivekananda Road and Aurobindo Sarani bursting with vehicles carrying people trying to beat the post-Saptami rush. Parking space was at a premium everywhere with the designated spots filling up well before the peak hour.        
	 The bottlenecks on Central Avenue are around Bowbazar and Mohammed Ali Park. The worst affected part is the flank carrying traffic towards Esplanade from Shyambazar, said a senior officer overseeing traffic from Lalbazar.        
	The traffic police deployment on Wednesday was nearly 2,000 personnel, including 1,500 home guards. Green Police members helped the cops restrict pedestrian movement on the carriageways.         
	In south Calcutta, Gariahat, which has a few star pujas within a small perimeter, was a traffic trouble zone through the day.        
	By afternoon, the traffic trail was so long that police officers on duty were claiming that the number of vehicles out on Sashthi had almost doubled within a year.         
	The impact of the car crawl in Gariahat was felt on Dhakuria bridge as well as Southern Avenue.         
	Towards the east, traffic would stall every few minutes on the Rashbehari connector.         
	The deployment of additional forces for traffic control didnt start until late afternoon, which made it nearly impossible for us to restore a semblance of normality, said an officer at the Gariahat crossing.         
	Traffic violations were rampant across the city with the usual suspects  buses, taxis and autos  accounting for most of these incidents. Pandals without proper parking arrangements compounded the chaos.        
	Around 8pm, Tollygunge Circular Road became so congested because of illegal parking that its effect was felt as far away as in New Alipore, where crowds poured in from Behala and its adjoining areas.         
	If Sashthi was bad, isnt Saptami likely to be worse?         
	 Things should be better on the traffic front from Saptami onwards. Calcutta police will use all the manpower at their disposal to manage traffic on the city roads, promised an officer.

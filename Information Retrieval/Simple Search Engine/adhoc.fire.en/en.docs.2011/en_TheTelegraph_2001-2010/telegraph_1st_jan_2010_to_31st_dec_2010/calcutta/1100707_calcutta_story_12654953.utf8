The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Enter, meet-greet-eat experts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Enter, meet-greet-eat experts
  - Town Hall debut for jumbo team        TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                                  
	The first meeting of the jumbo expert committee at the Town Hall on Tuesday afternoon was meant to be a meet and greet platform for those striving to remake and improve Calcutta.        
	Some star-struck councillors and experts hoping to meet and greet the two women who had stolen the hearts of the two heroes of two generations of Tollywood were in for a shock when Supriya Devi and Debasree Roy turned out to be two, er, not-so-alluring men (illustration by Suman Choudhury above).        
	With the lady love of Uttam Kumar not turning up  one of the 37 absentees among 85 experts  and the ex-wife of Prosenjit arriving fashionably late  having received the Town Hall invite at 11am today  the seats bearing their names were taken by substitutes falling unflatteringly short of the remake and improve mission of the meet.        
	Hosts mayor Sovan Chatterjee and expert committee chief Subrata Mukherjee, though, were men on a mission.        
	Kemon achhen?.Ashun ashun. Hands folded and smile fixed, the mayor stood at the door. Today I am surrounded by a number of learned men and women. I hope to gather a lot of knowledge from their expertise, he beamed, before hurrying into the hall, after 2pm.        
	With vast empty spaces at the two giant tables signalling absenteeism  and some late arrivals  the seating arrangements were remade and improved so that Chatterjee and Mukherjee appeared surrounded by a sea of expert support.        
	In other words, forget the names and grab the seats closest to the mayor and the chairman.        
	Pride of place among the experts went to nonagenarian Amala Shankar who sat next to the big two throughout the meeting that lasted an hour and 40 minutes.        
	Over several rounds of lychee or pineapple juice and tea  followed by fish fry, jeera rice, matar paneer, Kashmiri aloo dum, peas kachori, mishti and pastries  the first meet-greet-eat session of experts meandered along.        
	Many people have said a lot of things about the size of the committee, but I feel having such a large committee for the city is fine, declared Mukherjee. We want to make Calcutta an international standard city and for that the expert committees inputs are vital.        
	The opening day was not really meant for vital inputs. This is just an introductory meeting but from the next day we will have proper meetings with an agenda, said the former mayor, urging the experts to introduce themselves and hold forth on how the committee should function.        
	A few big ideas did make their way to the talks table  from review of property taxation (Abhirup Sarkar) to steps to combat malaria (Subrata Moitra)  but the principal outcome of the debut meet was to decide when and how to keep meeting.        
	Also that the expert ideas could be aired in Bengali, English, Hindi and Urdu.        
	The full expert committee will meet once every two months, on a Saturday afternoon at the Town Hall. Sub-committees will be formed to look into specific issues, said Mukherjee.        
	But why so many missing-in-action experts? The chairman blamed it on a combination of the viral fever stalking the city and on the extended weekend (Mondays bandh included) that had delayed the delivery of the letters to expert doors.        
	The meeting was primarily an introductory one. Though some of the experts could not attend the meeting we are still happy with the turnout, especially that of Amala Shankar at the age of 91, Mukherjee said.        
	Metro checked with a handful of absentee experts and most confirmed that they were either under the weather or had firmed up other plans before the letters urging them to be at the Town Hall at 2pm arrived on Tuesday.        
	The next time we are hopeful to have a better head count, said Mukherjee.        
	The mood of the first meeting of the jumbo expert committee entrusted with the giant task of remaking and improving Calcutta was, perhaps, best summed up by singer Nirmala Mishra. No one asked me to speak and I dont know what to suggest. But I really loved the ambience. It was great to meet some friends like Sandhya (Roy) and Arati (Mukhopadhyay) after a long time, she smiled, engaged in a chat over sip and bite.  I don rsquo;t know what to suggest. But I really loved the ambience and being part of such a meet. It was great to meet some friends like Sandhya (Roy) and Arati (Mukhopadhyay) after a long time
  Nirmala Mishra, singer  The CMC should provide a platform to provide better publicity to Bangla Adhunik gaan. Our songs never get the publicity they deserve
  Arati Mukhopadhyay, singer  I am a misfit here among so many learned men and women hellip;.I would later like to recommend that the CMC forms a police team of its own
  Goutam Ghosh, singer  The CMC can constitute a department to look after stray dogs and cats
  Debasree Roy, actress  I was born in a village and today I am sitting here in such a galaxy and between two such stalwarts (Subrata Mukherjee and Sovan Chatterjee). I do not know what to say hellip;.I might later recommend more bins by the roadside
  Amala Shankar, dancer

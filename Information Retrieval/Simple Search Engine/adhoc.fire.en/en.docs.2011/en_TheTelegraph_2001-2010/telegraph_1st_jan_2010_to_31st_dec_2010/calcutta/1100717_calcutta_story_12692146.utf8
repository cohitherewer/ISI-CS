	Doctors and the government have issued an appeal urging people not to panic over swine flu, which has affected a dozen-odd people in the city this year.        
	The situation is under control and there is no reason to panic. We have stepped up our surveillance, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said. Metro spoke to doctors to get answers to some common queries about swine flu              
	What is swine flu?        
	The infection caused by the H1N1 virus. The virus is believed to have originated in pigs and mutated to affect humans.              
	Is it different from the ordinary flu?        
	Yes, because of the mutant nature of the virus which is a combination of the swine, bird and human flu strains. The virus that causes the flu we more often suffer from has only the human strain.              
	Is it a scare?        
	No. A patient can turn critical only if left untreated. The risk factors, however, are more for patients already suffering from heart, kidney and lung ailments. Doctors say its important to know the symptoms, get a suspect tested and start treatment immediately if the report is positive.              
	Who are more vulnerable?        
	Pregnant women; people above 65 years of age; children below five years; those suffering from asthma, renal problems and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; as well as patients on immuno-suppressive drugs.              
	What are the symptoms?        
	High temperature (over 100.4F), muscle ache, unusual tiredness, headache, cough and runny nose, sore throat, respiratory distress, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or vomiting.              
	What drugs to be taken?        
	Anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza, but not without consulting a doctor.              
	How does the disease spread?        
	Through air and human touch. The virus spreads through droplets coming out of the nose or mouth when a patient coughs or sneezes.        
	Getting close to a patient with uncovered nose or coming into contact with objects handled by a patient  such as door handles, handrails and phones  can lead to infection.              
	What confirms swine flu?        
	A throat and nasal swab test               
	Where is the test performed?         
	In Bengal, the swine flu test is only conducted at the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (Niced) laboratory at Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata. All hospitals have been asked to report to the health department about swine flu suspects, wholl be taken to the Beleghata hospital by Niced officials.                                      Where are swabs collected for test?  Apart from the Beleghata hospital, samples are collected at RG Kar, MR Bangur and most private hospitals.  How long does it take to get the report?  Usually, within 24 hours of the sample reaching Niced.  What to do once swine flu is confirmed?  Take the patient to the Beleghata hospital, where he/she will be kept in the special isolation ward. Those opting to be at home should wear masks, stay in an isolated room and avoid direct contact with family members for five days. Utensils used by the patient should be washed separately, preferably with warm water.  What precaution should a patient rsquo;s relatives take?   Avoid direct contact with the patient. Enter the patient rsquo;s room wearing a gown and a mask. Wash hands with soap after stepping out.  Can private hospitals treat swine flu patients?  Yes. Most big private hospitals have isolation wards with ventilators where swine flu patients can be kept and treated.  Are our government hospitals equipped to handle such cases?  The Beleghata hospital is the only referral centre with 11 cubicles in the special isolation ward. The authorities say all the cubicles can be equipped with ventilators. The government has asked RG Kar and Bangur hospitals to set up special isolation wards.  Can hospitals refuse to admit swine flu patients?   No. If a hospital feels it does not have the infrastructure to treat the patient properly, it should refer him/her to the Beleghata hospital which cannot refuse admission to any swine flu patient.  Is it safe to eat pork?  Yes. WHO says there is no evidence of swine flu spreading through the meat of infected animals. But the meat has to be cooked properly.  Is the siuation worse than last year?   No, it rsquo;s same as last year. But there are chances of the virus spreading rapidly because of lack of infrastructure and awareness.

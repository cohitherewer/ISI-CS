                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mystery murder after love poems
          A STAFF REPORTER                                           The room where Rebeccas body was found.   Picture by Tamaghna Banerjee      
	The murder of Lesley Rebecca Vincent, the 20-year-old found on Sunday in her Thakurpukur flat with her throat slit, was probably a spur-of-the-moment act.        
	That was all that police could piece together on Monday, with the victims partner  and prime suspect  still missing and the cops clueless about his antecedents.        
	Going by the notes in a pocket diary it appears Evan Vincent, the so-called husband of Rebecca, loved her deeply. The diary has several poems dedicated to her. So this does not appear to be a murder for revenge or gain, said a senior police officer probing the case.        
	Diary apart, the police could only find a mobile phone with no battery or SIM card but several love stickers pasted on it.        
	But the cops did manage to stitch together the tale of a couple struggling to make ends meet in the one-room flat where the naked body of Rebecca was found with her hands tied behind her back and her feet tied together.        
	The landlady, Namita Chowdhury, told the cops that Evan and Rebecca had moved out of the flat for five months, unable to pay a monthly rent of Rs 1,500. In June, a man who introduced himself as John, the girls uncle, paid the landlady Rs 11,000 and pleaded with her to allow the two to return to the rented flat and stay on till September.        
	Rebecca had told the landlady that she worked for a call centre and she was married to Evan, both claims that are now under the scanner.        
	She claimed to be a BPO worker earning Rs 15,000 but the house was practically bare and she hardly had any clothes, said an officer of Thakurpukur police station.        
	Evans pocket diary contains several detailed recipes, so it could well be that he worked as a cook somewhere. The two would leave home early, return late at night and not mingle with the neighbours, the officer said.        
	Rebeccas father has been called in from Ranchi, where he works as a schoolteacher, to help crack the case.

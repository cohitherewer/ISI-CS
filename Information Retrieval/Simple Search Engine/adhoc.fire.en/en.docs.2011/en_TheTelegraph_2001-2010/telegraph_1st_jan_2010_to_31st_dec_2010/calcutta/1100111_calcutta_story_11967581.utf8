          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A day after asking people to go and see the sufferings of Tibetans under military occupation at a Bodh Gaya peace conference, the Dalai Lama had hope on his lips on Sunday. He was in Calcutta to confer the Ladies Study Group Charitable Trust award on Disha Foundations Neena Singh and addressed the gathering at length.        
	Historically, the Communist Party of China has changed with the times. Also, many Chinese intellectuals are backing us through their writings. They may be in the minority but intellectuals lead society. Despite restrictions, Tibetan children are now travelling to enrol in monastic schools here. So there is hope, he told invitees inside and later Buddhists gathered outside the hotel, who had travelled from as far as Himachal Pradesh and Darjeeling for a glimpse of the monk.        
	He also heaped praise on Indian values, calling himself a reliable chela of India, the guru. Its your messages that I carry abroad. But you must think for yourselves to improve your life.

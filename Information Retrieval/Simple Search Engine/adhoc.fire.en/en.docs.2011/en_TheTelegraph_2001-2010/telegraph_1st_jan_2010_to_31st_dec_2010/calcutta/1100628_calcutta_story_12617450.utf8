  - UN consent must for police to board Karachi-bound vessel at Kidderpore          OUR BUREAU                                              The Aegean Glory at Kidderpore dock. (Bishwarup Dutta)            
	The detained Karachi-bound ship carrying military hardware for Pakistan docked at the Calcutta port on Sunday afternoon, but security agencies could not search the vessel for want of the mandatory clearance from the United Nations.        
	The Aegean Glory was detained on its way to the city, where a consignment for Nepal was to be offloaded, after a port trust pilot reported that the ship was carrying arms and ammunition that its clearing agent in Calcutta had not declared.        
	A probe revealed that the military hardware was sent by the UN mission in Liberia for the Pakistani army. Since the ship was carrying UN cargo, we cant search it without the world bodys consent. The consent hasnt yet arrived, Surojit Kar Purkaystha, the inspector- general of police (law and order), said on Sunday evening.        
	The documents of the consignments on board are in order. We will only check the cargo to be offloaded here. Its beyond our jurisdiction to scan the items meant for other ports, Kar Purkaystha added.        
	The Panama-registered, blue-and-white ship arrived at Netaji Subhas Dock in Kidderpore at 2pm and dropped anchor an hour later. A hovercraft, guided by a police vessel, led the way for the Aegean Glory to sail to the city from the Sandheads, where it was detained.        
	The vessel triggered interest among Calcuttans, many of whom had turned up at the Bichali ghat jetty, close to the dock, to catch a glimpse. I was following news of the ship since Friday and wanted to have a look at it, said Dipankar Pal of Mudiali. The authorities, however, didnt allow anyone to go near it.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Neglect cry at Peerless Hospital
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The death of a 53-year-old man, allegedly because of medical negligence, triggered tension at Peerless Hospital on Tuesday.        
	Swapan Sarkar, who lived near the Balia crossing on Garia Station Road, was admitted to the hospital on Friday with a profusely bleeding nose.        
	He was alright on Monday morning. He went into convulsions after a blood transfusion in the evening. His condition deteriorated this morning and he died at 12.40pm, said Swapans brother Dibyendu.         
	Doctors said Swapan suffered from ischaemic heart disease and had died of blood loss and cardiac failure. Last night his blood pressure dropped drastically. His haemoglobin count was 8. Given his heart condition it was very difficult to bring it back to normal, said a doctor.        
	Neighbours and relatives who gathered in the hospital lobby, however, alleged foul play. They demanded to see senior officials. We want a detailed record of Swapans treatment and the medicines he was administered, said a relative.        
	After an hour, members of the mob dragged out a senior hospital official and tried to take him to the local police station, which led to heated exchange and scuffle between the agitators and hospital employees.         
	Family members met hospital officials in the evening. We will give them the record of treatment, said Sudipta Mitra, the medical superintendent of Peerless Hospital.        
	He added that the hospital would lodge a police complaint against three persons who are not Swapan Sarkars relatives for inciting the mob.        
	Swapans family members did not lodge a police complaint till late on Tuesday.

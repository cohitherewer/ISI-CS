                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Retail major draws investment roadmap
          SUBHRO SAHA                              
	The $3.2-billion Landmark Group based in Dubai is gearing up to strengthen its retail presence in Calcutta following the launch of its maiden outlet in Rajarhat.        
	After opening the first store of its value fashion format Max in City Centre New Town early this year, the Dubai group is preparing to roll out a Rs 30-crore expansion roadmap for the east, with Calcutta as the fulcrum.        
	Our market survey on Calcutta has thrown up exciting feedback and we hope to roll out six Max outlets across the city over the next three years, Vasanth Kumar, the executive director of Max in India, told Metro.        
	Landmark is also planning to launch in town its high-street fashion format Splash and open at least three outlets of its hypermarket or large supermarket offering. To complement the fashion and food-and-groceries spread, the group will soon bring to Calcutta the Gloria Jeans chain of coffee shops, of which there are four in India.        
	We are looking to be present essentially in malls and we have faith in Calcutta as a fast-maturing retail market. We are also open to partnering real estate developers in a model where we bring in our formats with a minimum guarantee comfort and revenue-sharing as an upside for the realtor, added Kumar.        
	The group is also planning ventures in Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Dhanbad, Siliguri and Durgapur.        
	Max was launched in early 2004 in West Asia and has become the largest value fashion chain in the region. It has 115 stores across West Asia, Egypt, Turkey, Yemen and Palestine.        
	The mainstay of the Max format is kidswear, with a strong appeal to college girls as well. The merchandise is mostly priced between Rs 199 and 599.         
	Max is currently the largest value fashion retailer in the country. We are the pioneers in this segment and aim to open 100 stores pan-India by 2013, said Kumar, spearheading the groups aggressive growth plans in India.

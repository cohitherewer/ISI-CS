The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sleepy source for Bolly biggie   Martyr hall misses action
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sleepy source for Bolly biggie     - Surya Sen Bhavan in Jodhpur Park propped up Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Most of the original photographs of the Chittagong revolutionaries used in Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey were sourced from the Martyrs Gallery at the Shahid Surya Sen Bhavan in Jodhpur Park.

	The grandest of celluloid dreams have often been culled from the quaintest of sources. Case in point: behind a Rs 35 crore Bollywood biggie are the dusty picture frames and the old torn books from a nondescript address in Jodhpur Park.        
	The look of Ashutosh Gowarikers period thriller Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey, adapted from Manini Chatterjees Do And Die, has largely been born out of Shahid Surya Sen Bhavan, a two-decade-old house standing at 432 Prince Anwar Shah Road.        
	Take the closing credit roll of the film, with the photographs of the revolutionaries placed beside the actors playing them. Most of those have been sourced from the Martyrs Gallery in Surya Sen Bhavan, diagonally opposite the EEDF hospital.        
	Ashutosh Gowariker has come here more than once to take pictures and books and to do his own research for the film, says Santosh Majumdar, the joint secretary of Biplabtirtha Chattagram Smriti Sanstha, which manages the Bhavan.        
	Gowarikers words in the visitors book of Surya Sen Bhavan back in July 2008 said it all: I would like to thank everyone in the institution for selflessly working towards protecting and spreading the good work of all the martyrs, especially Shahid Surya Sen and his detenus, and everyone that contributed to the Chittagong Armoury Raid.                                
	Surya Sen Bhavan also contributed in a big way in Neeta Lullas costume research for the film. In an interview to t2, she had said: I spoke to the lady who was the caretaker of the Surya Sen hall.         
	That lady, Sapna Mitra, is an executive committee member of the Smriti Sanstha and helped Lulla get the exact designs and patterns of the saris worn by Deepika Padukone and Vishakha Singh in Khelein Hum... I look after the library here and have a fair idea of the kind of clothes they used to wear back in 1930s, said Mitra.

	Cut to 2010 and the day after Calcutta saw a glitzy premiere of Khelein Hum... at INOX (Forum), attended by Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Shahid Surya Sen Bhavan was its usual sleepy self.        
	The rooms on the ground floor double as a homoeopathic clinic and the hall on the first floor hosts cultural programmes every now and then. The three statues  of Surya Sen, Ambika Chakraborti and Ganesh Ghosh  outside the house are faded and soiled by crow droppings.        
	Inside, a solitary newspaper clipping with a picture of Abhishek Bachchan as Masterda adorns the notice board.        
	Abhishek, Ashutosh and the rest of the Khelein Hum... gang who had made it to the city for the Calcutta premiere of the film were expected to visit the Surya Sen hall on Sunday afternoon.        
	Mr Gowariker really wanted to come and visit us and then take us to the screening, said Mitra.        
	But security reasons and time constraints meant that Shahid Surya Sen Bhavan failed to make it to the big Bollywood map riding on a star visit.

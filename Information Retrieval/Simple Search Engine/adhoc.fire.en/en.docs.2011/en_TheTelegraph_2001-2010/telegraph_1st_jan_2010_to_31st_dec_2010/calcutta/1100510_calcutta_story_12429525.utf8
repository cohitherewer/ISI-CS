The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tree fell nods under scan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tree fell nods under scan
          JAYANTA BASU                           One of the trees that were felled in Sector V                                   
	The state forest department is allowing various agencies to cut trees in and around the city without finding out whether it is necessary, environmentalists have alleged citing recent cases.        
	In February, at least 600 trees were felled in Bishnupur on the southern fringes of the city by CESC for installing a tower and an electrical line. After an inquiry into the incident, the state pollution control board ruled that such large-scale cutting of trees was not necessary for the project and slapped a fine on CESC.        
	Environmentalists have also cited the felling of 30-odd trees at NRS Hospital last month. The forest department had granted permission for cutting 19 trees on the premises to beautify a pond despite the contract the hospital authorities signed with a company executing the project prohibiting the felling of trees.        
	In Sector V, the cutting of trees to widen a road  permitted by the forest department  was stopped by the administrative authority following complaints from various quarters.        
	Residents and environmentalists pointed out that the trees that were being cut were near the boundary walls of buildings beside the road and the carriageway could have been widened without felling them.        
	That the forest department authorities are allowing the felling of trees without applying their mind is evident from a number of recent cases, said environment activist Subhash Dutta.         
	The forest department has often allowed trees to be chopped off without valid reason. The incident at NRS Hospital is a case in point, said Lt-Col S.R. Banerjee, honorary wildlife warden of the city.        
	The forest department also stands accused of letting off those who illegally fell trees lightly. We could have filed an FIR against the NRS authorities for cutting more trees than the 19 permitted but settled the matter after they paid a fine, said a forest department official.        
	Not a single person has gone to jail in Bengal for cutting trees illegally, said Dutta.        
	Before giving permission for tree cutting, we consider whether it is necessary and stress on compensatory planting. We will probe whether permissions have been granted without adequate checks, said K.S. Rajendra Kumar, the additional chief secretary of forests.

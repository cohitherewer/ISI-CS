The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Terror cop in threat rerun
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Terror cop in threat rerun
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                            
	Prasanta Majumdar, the police officer who had arrested slum-dweller Milan Molla on a false charge and allegedly threatened to brand him a terrorist if he didnt pay a bribe, is back to playing terror cop, says the harassed family.        
	Aami to boro officer hoye jaabo kintu tor ki hobe bujhe nish (I will be promoted but you better realise what will happen to you), sub-inspector Majumdar, reinstated within a month of his suspension, allegedly warned Milan during a visit to the office of the deputy commissioner of police (port) last April.        
	Milan, 26, had gone there along with father Tafazzul, who was summoned to record his statement before the investigating officer. He told me that he would soon be given a clean chit by the department and then he would make life difficult for me, the Dum Dum resident told Metro.        
	Metro had first reported on September 27, 2008, how Majumdar and some colleagues had allegedly asked him to choose between the tag of terrorist and a Rs 1.5 lakh bribe.        
	Majumdar had arrested Milan, who sells stationery and scrap for a living, on August 6, 2008, three days after a freak blast in Cossipore in which he lost his younger brother Deedar, cousins Ramzan and Shaqib, and granduncle Hasan. An inquiry ordered by police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti later found the officer guilty of pressing a false theft charge on Milan to harass his family.        
	The Molla familys allegation that they paid Rs 35,000 out of the Rs 1.5 lakh demanded as bribe  Majumdar had allegedly threatened to implicate Milan in the blast that killed his sibling and relatives  has been dragging for almost two years.         
	 Sarkar ebar change hoye jachheaami to beriye jaabo (The government will change soonI will come out clean), the sub-inspector, now posted at Bhowanipore police station, allegedly told Tafazzul.        
	The cop was apparently alluding to CPM leader Mohammad Salims support to the Molla family when Milan was in custody and his insistence on a thorough investigation. After Majumdars suspension, some colleagues from the polices port division had gone to Milans house and promised to return the Rs 35,000 that his family had borrowed from various sources to pay a part of the bribe.         
	The Mollas, however, havent got back the money yet.         
	According to Tafazzul, a mason, Majumdar met him twice near his house in Bankra last month and threatened him with dire consequences if his son didnt withdraw the bribe complaint. I do not trust the cops any longer. They might implicate my son again, added Milans mother Anwara Bibi.         
	Majumdar claimed he never threatened either Molla or his father Tafazzul. What they are saying are outright lies, he said.        
	He also insisted that the case against him was concocted by cadres of a political party.         
	Mohammad Salim, who had requested city police chief Chakrabarti to institute a probe, said he was unaware of Majumdar allegedly threatening the Molla family to withdraw the complaint.        
	I will talk to the police commissioner again so that the accused officer is punished separately for threatening the family. The police should also return the bribe money, he told Metro.        
	Suresh Chandra Das, the retired assistant commissioner of police whose preliminary findings had led to Majumdars suspension, said: If he has threatened the family midway through the departmental proceedings, its a very serious offence.        
	A senior officer of the polices port division said Majumdars suspension was withdrawn in due course after the investigation team had cross-checked all the evidence available at the time.         
	So why is the probe into the bribery angle taking so long? The inquiry team needed time to check the veracity of the statements made by Milan, his family members and people from whom his mother Anwara Bibi is supposed to have borrowed Rs 35,000 to pay the first instalment of the alleged bribe, the officer said.

	A Metro Railway train hit a buffer and got derailed at Briji (Shahid Khudiram) station on Sunday afternoon, disrupting services for the rest of the day.         
	While the train was changing tracks to make the return journey, its rear coach hit the buffer and two of its wheels got derailed. The two drivers on the train have been suspended and a probe is being conducted, said a Metro spokesperson.        
	The train had arrived at Garia (Kavi Nazrul) station from Dum Dum around 3pm. After the passengers got off, it proceeded to Briji station, which is not yet open to the public, to change tracks.        
	The rear coach and the buffer (a device to prevent trains from going past the end of the tracks) were damaged in the mishap that followed.         
	Senior Metro officials rushed to the spot. It took nearly three hours to put the derailed coach back on track.        
	Trains plied only between Dum Dum and Tollygunge from 3pm to 6.30pm. For the rest of the evening, trains ran late, stopping around five minutes at stations.        
	We will probe why the train hit the buffer. It seems the drivers were at fault. An inquiry will reveal the actual cause of the mishap, said a senior Metro official.        
	The train was sent to the maintenance yard at Tollygunge for repairs, which could take several days.         
	Officials said absence of a train might lead to a crisis as the 18 rakes that were being used were inadequate. The first air-conditioned rake is scheduled to arrive in end-June.

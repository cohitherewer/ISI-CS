          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Class V student of a north Calcutta school was charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder after one of his friends with whom he had a scuffle in class died on Friday.        
	The case was registered after the victims father lodged a complaint with Maniktala police station against his sons friend, who is also the class monitor.        
	The post-mortem will be carried out on Saturday. We need to know doctors observations to identify the cause of death, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	Ramesh Podder stated in his complaint that his 12-year-old son Rupen had returned home from the Muraripukur school on July 2 with severe abdominal pain.        
	He said he had fallen after hitting a bench during a scuffle with his class monitor. I took him to a local doctor, said Ramesh, a Ultadanga resident.        
	As the pain did not subside, the parents took Rupen to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on July 7. He passed out several times on July 7. The pain, too, was not subsiding. So we took him to RG Kar hospital, where he was admitted, recalled Ramesh.        
	Police sources said Rupens classmates had told investigators that the child had a fight with the monitor on July 2. His friends said Rupen had complained about minor pain after the scuffle, said a cop.        
	Ramesh said his son had died of internal haemorrhage suffered during the scuffle.        
	A doctor at RG Kar hospital said the child had suffered an injury in the intestine which led to infection in the the colon. The infection might be because of bleeding of the intestinal wall.        
	There were no injury marks on the body. Only the post-mortem report can confirm whether an internal haemorrhage had caused the death, said another doctor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rare songs 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rare songs 
										      caleidoscope                        Pankaj Kumar Mullick				                           
	The family of singer Pankaj Kumar Mullick (1905-1978) has come up with a CD containing his less-known and unreleased song recordings. Hey Nutan was released by singers Dwijen Mukhopadhyay and Sumitra Sen at an event organised by Pankaj Mullick Music and Art Foundation on August 8 at the GD Birla Sabhagar.         
	Though the sound quality of some of the songs is poor, the CD is a collectors item. It has a Rabindrastuti in Sanskrit (lyrics by Banikumar, and sung by Mullick) that stresses the bond between the singer and the bard. A few of the songs, such as Esho hey Baishak, Ashaadh kotha hotey aaj, Shiter boney, Amar Milan lagi and Hey Nutan, were recorded during rehearsals in the mid-1960s.         
	Diner sheshey (originally a poem Shesh Kheya) starts with an introduction in Mullicks voice. The singer was proud of this composition as he had set tune to it.         
	It was the first time that Tagore had allowed someone from outside his family to set his words to tune. PC Barua also used the song in the 1937 film, Mukti.         
	The CD also contains two versions of Jana Gana Mana recorded in 1952. One of them is the original longer version written by Tagore.         
	Nehru had deputed Mullick to record the definitive version of the National Anthem.                   A scene from Char Adhyay during rehearsals.   Picture by Aranya Sen      
	Tagore novel in play        
	Tagores novel Char Adhyay premiered at Tapan Theatre on August 8. Tagore wrote the play during the Independence movement. By the time Sambhu Mitra staged it, the Naxal movement was on. Youngsters of today face the same dilemmas as those faced by Tagores characters, says director Shantanu Bandyopadhyay.         
	The play features singer Pallab Kirtania as the revolutionary Antu or Atin and his lover Ela is played by three actors instead of one (Suranjana Dasgupta, Kaveri Basu and Rokeya Roy).         
	Char Adhyay, sponsored by Niva Arts, will be staged thrice a month at Tapan Theatre.                   Shyam Sundar Goswami      
	Music for church         
	Vocalist Shyam Sundar Goswami (Picture right by Sudeshna Banerjee) likes singing in old temples and palaces. In Calcutta, he has performed at Sovabazar Rajbati and Chhatu-babu-Latubabu and Flagstaff House in Barrackpore. Such venues go with the mood of darbari sangeet, says the kheyal, bhajan and thumri exponent who performed at Alliance Francaise du Bengale recently to mark his visit to France in June.         
	It was Goswamis guru Jadunath Chakraborty who advised him to choose such venues. So in France, Goswami, trained in the Kirana gharana, gave a recital in Le Festival dArt Sacr at a 12th century monastic school in an abbey in Champeaux on Seine-et-Marne, about 20 minutes from Paris. I sang without a microphone, so good was the acoustics. He also gave concerts in two churches.            
	Curiosity kills the commuter  
	 No one can beat a Calcuttan in the ability to strike up a conversation with a stranger without caring how annoying it can be. In the Metro the other day, a burqa-clad woman was accosted by another, who seemed to be in her 30s. They were sitting next to each other. The 30-something could not keep her curiosity to herself. ldquo;So don rsquo;t you feel hot in this? rdquo; she started off, pointing at the burqa of the other woman. Then she got closer. ldquo;Is this cotton, polyester or synthetic? rdquo; she asked, her fingers reaching out for the fabric. 
  That was only the beginning. ldquo;Who is this woman travelling with you? A friend or your sister? rdquo; she next asked. On being told they were from Bangladesh, she asked: ldquo;Why have you come to Calcutta? rdquo; Then, ldquo;Where are you staying? rdquo; 
  Her victim probably regretted the fact that one cannot walk out of the Metro.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop crunch toll on fringes traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cop crunch toll on fringes traffic
          KINSUK BASU                          Place different, problem same: Traffic troubles are an everyday affair at Kestopur (below) and near Behala tram depot. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha and Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                          
	The city fringes are struggling to cope with traffic chaos but cops say they can do little with the men and machines at their disposal.         
	VIP Road in the north, Behala in the south-west and the EM Bypass in the east are the areas worst affected by traffic problems.        
	While there are at least three bottlenecks on VIP Road, traffic comes to a standstill during peak hours between Behala and Joka. On the EM Bypass, basic infrastructure for traffic management is missing.        
	At Kestopur, Baguiati and Kaikhali, buses making U-turns and a steady stream of pedestrians crossing VIP Road hold up traffic throughout the day. If a vehicle breaks down at these spots the situation becomes unmanageable, said a senior traffic officer in North 24-Parganas.        
	The thrust is on traffic policing in Sector V and Salt Lake. Key stretches elsewhere are taken for granted, he added.        
	Things are just as bad on the southern periphery.        
	Vehicles often come to a standstill near Behala tram depot on Diamond Harbour Road, where trams share the meagre road space with other vehicles. At Behala Chowrasta, buses, minibuses, autorickshaws, rickshaws and cars have to compete for space to move.        
	Autorickshaws occupy bus stops near Barisha High School, forcing buses to halt elsewhere. Traffic pours on to James Long Sarani from lanes with no traffic cop to control them.        
	Traffic bosses cite paucity of resources to tackle the problems effectively.         
	According to the police, there are 54 key intersections in North 24-Parganas and 36 in South 24-Parganas, most of which are without signals. Those who man these do not have wireless handsets, motorcycles or even a place to stand properly.        
	There are just 2,800 traffic police personnel for 18 districts across Bengal. The volume of traffic has grown exponentially but there has been no effort to augment the force to ensure effective traffic policing, said inspector general (traffic) Adhir Sharma.        
	With 15-odd constables, one has to cover the Bypass along with the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector and adjoining roads in Garia, Sonarpur and Rajpur. There are few traffic signals and only about 250 constables and seven police vehicle drivers for the whole of South 24-Parganas, said a traffic officer.        
	Last October, the cops wrote to the state government seeking to increase the strength of the traffic force to over 15,000 keeping in mind mishaps on the state and the national highways and the working hours of the IT, BPO and the ITeS sectors. The letter had also sought augmentation of equipment and vehicles.         
	The finance department wrote in a letter dated July 13: In the present proposal a total of 15,071 posts have been proposed to be created The increase, therefore, is about 618 per cent we require to ensure first whether traffic intensity has increased proportionately        
	The traffic cops have been inconvenienced by the department not releasing Rs 3.15 crore it has earmarked in the state budget for this financial year (09-10).        
	We had placed orders for 200 wireless sets but cannot purchase them unless this money comes, said an officer.

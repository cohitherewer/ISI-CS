          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A cancerous tumour in the kidney will no longer necessitate removal of the whole organ, thanks to a keyhole procedure that helps detach the affected part.        
	Earlier, the entire affected kidney had to be removed and sooner or later the extra workload began to tell on the other kidney. Thats why the new procedure, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, is also called kidney preserving surgery, said Shivaji Basu, the chief urologist at Fortis Hospital, where two such surgeries have been performed since last October. The post-surgery recovery has been satisfactory for both patients.        
	In this procedure, the cancerous part of the kidney is removed with a small amount of normal tissue around it. A biopsy is done on the normal tissue on the operating table itself to make sure that the cancer has been removed completely, said Basu, who conducted the surgeries with consultant urologist Amlan Chakraborty.        
	To the best my knowledge, this was the first laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in the city on carcinogenic tumour, said Ranjan Kumar Dey, urologist at RG Kar hospital.

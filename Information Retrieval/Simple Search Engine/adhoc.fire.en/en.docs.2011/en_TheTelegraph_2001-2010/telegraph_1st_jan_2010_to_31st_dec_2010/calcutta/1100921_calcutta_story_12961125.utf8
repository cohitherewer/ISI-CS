                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tourists wait for open roads
          A STAFFF REPORTER                               
	Tourists from the city and its suburbs remained trapped at various places in Uttarakhand on Monday with the water level in the rivers continuing to rise and important roads closed because of landslides.         
	Bright sunshine in some parts of the state in the morning gave the trapped tourists hope that was later belied because the blocked roads could not be cleared.         
	We were told that we would be able to move out by late afternoon. But here we are awaiting an update tomorrow morning, said Santanu Banerjee, a Howrah resident putting up at a traders house at Maletha village near Badrinath, in the evening.         
	The four rooms in the house are occupied by 40 tourists, each paying Rs 500 per night.        
	The state government was unsure on Monday about ways to bring the tourists back home safely. We do not have confirmed reports on the Uttarakhand situation yet. If necessary, we will intervene the way we did during the recent Leh mishap, said state home secretary Samar Ghosh at Writers Buildings.        
	We are co-ordinating with the Uttarakhand government. We will do the needful, said chief secretary Ardhendu Sen.

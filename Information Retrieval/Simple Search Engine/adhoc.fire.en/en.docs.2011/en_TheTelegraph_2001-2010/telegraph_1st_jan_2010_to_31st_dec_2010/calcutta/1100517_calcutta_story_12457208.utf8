The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heat respite off radar
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Heat respite off radar
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The sultry weather over the weekend is unlikely to change for at least the next couple of days.        
	The next two days will stay the same for the city. No major change is on the radar, said an official at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.         
	The conditions favouring the formation of thunderclouds over south Bengal over the last week have made way for normal summer conditions for the weekend and the first half of next week.        
	The low pressure trough over Jharkhand and its adjoining areas has receded. The embedded cyclonic circulation, too, has dissipated, said an official of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi.        
	According to the IMD official, the lack of a low-pressure trough has checked the flow of moisture from the Bay of Bengal and stopped the formation of thunderclouds.         
	Sundays maximum temperature was a few degrees above normal, with the maximum being 38.1 degrees.        
	Monday, said the weatherman, would be hot and uncomfortable, with temperatures ranging between 29 and 38 degrees Celsius.         
	Isolated rain may occur in parts of Gangetic Bengal but that will not affect Calcuttas weather, said the IMD official.         
	An official of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida, said: Unless there is a drastic change, normal summer conditions should prevail in the city over the next 10 to 14 days. Monsoon usually reaches the city and its suburbs around June 7.

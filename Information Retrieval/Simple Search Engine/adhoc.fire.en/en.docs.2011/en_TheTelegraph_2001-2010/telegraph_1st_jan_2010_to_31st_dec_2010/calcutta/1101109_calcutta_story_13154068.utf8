The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | India tour on cycle
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      India tour on cycle
  - Journey for a cause by city youth and Polish trio         SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Chayan Mondal on his cycle on Monday. (Sudeshna Banerjee)                                        
	Around the country in 500 days. That is the aim with which Sonarpur boy Chayan Mondal paddled off from the Maidan on Monday afternoon. His mission is to spread awareness about eye donation through the 28 states that he would cycle through in the next year and a half.        
	As a Hercules Top Gear stood ready outside, carrying his mission statement Your eyes can add light to someone elses life in front, the 22-year-old was inundated with advice  Do not cycle after sunset, Do not speak on the cellphone while cycling... Some also announced financial help to offset a part of his journey expenditure of Rs 1 lakh.        
	The soft-spoken 22-year-old lad who graduated recently with geography from Fakirchand College in Diamond Harbour already had his eyes set on the road. Studying his route map, he murmured: The toughest part would be the Srinagar to Leh stretch.        
	The boy should know a thing or two about hilly terrains, having completed a course from Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling. I have climbed the 21,911ft Mt Rathong in West Sikkim, says the avid trekker who is a member of Sonarpur Arohi, a local adventure club. His solo cycling expeditions have taken him to Digha, Chandipur and Gangasagar.        
	But this would be his first attempt at anything of this scale. No wonder his family is worried. He always spoke of this dream ever since he was in Class XII. But he never told us he was finalising plans till only two months ago. We tried to dissuade him but he would not listen, says sister Arpita.         
	International Eye Bank general secretary Malay Ray recalled how Chayan had read that 20 lakh people were blind in our country and were waiting for a gift of cornea. He came to us to ask if he could go on a tour to spread the message. We readily agreed.        
	It is such a shame that people spend a lifetime in the dark while we destroy the eyes of the dead, said the son of the panchayat upapradhan from Usthi village, as he set off.

           Under threat: Howrah bridge. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                     
	Apropos the report Spit eats into the base of bridge May 24, in the name of populist politics, we seem to correlate poverty with indiscipline and allow the masses such indulgence, possibly for fear of antagonising the people and losing votes.           
	I suggest that the authorities properly clean up the mess once and put up notices proclaiming their intention to keep the place clean and firmly request the people to refrain from such dirty practices. They should also notify imposition of steep penalties (not token fines , the monetary penalty should be at least Rs 300 per offence) for committing such nuisance and firmly impose the same on the spot .           
	In the event of the offenders inability to pay the fine on the spot, the offender should be provided with a bucket and mop and asked to thoroughly clean up the spot. Initially, hard policing will be required but once the message spreads, I am sure people will mend their habits and be more conscientious in keeping the city clean. Its time to shed the kid gloves and take tough measures to set things right.

	Pictures of different deities such as Kali and Shiva may be hung on the pillars of Howrah bridge to guard them against spit as is done on many building walls in Calcutta and other Indian cities. People fear to spit on them. The gods are the best guards. Asok Kumar Das,           
	California, US                     
	A fine can be slapped on those spitting at the base of Howrah bridge. Otherwise, a few disposable dustbins could be kept on the bridge. Occasional demonstration of the harmful consequences of spitting on the bridge can be useful in curbing the habit.           
	Asik Iquebal,           
	Address not given           
	It should be a multi-step process, probably running simultaneously. The first and foremost would be to cushion the affected area. However, it would be more appropriate to let people know what they are doing by spitting. Do they spit the same way in their bedrooms or their living rooms? If not, then why at a public place? The authorities must create awareness among citizens on civic sense. Secondly, why is gutkha not banned yet in India? Why is gutkha made only in developing countries like ours but not in developed countries? Why is it that the people of the US dont even throw cigarette butts outside and we take the pride in making public places dirty? It is the mindset that needs to be changed in the long run. Aditya N. Lal,           
	New Jersey, US           
	If gutkha is banned by law then it would be very easy to stop the nuisance. Otherwise dustbins can be used. At least the bridge would be saved. Rupak Majumder,           
	Address not given                     
	An old suggestion that works with more than 90 per cent effectiveness: Swamp the pillar bases with images of gods. The material to be used is can vary. Tiles or metallic images welded or cemented to the beams or any other method will do. It will be cost-effective too. The idea is to invoke the fear of God to save the bridge. The choice of material is important as the surface will be in constant contact with rainwater and pollution. Sambit Pal,           
	Address not given                     
	It is indeed a shame that Howrah bridge is in such a sorry state. It shows the lack of basic civic sense among the general public. It definitely calls for attention of authorities and fellow citizens. A heavy fine on the spot is a solution, and the amount should be substantial. Also the offender should be made to clean the mess.

	Address not given                     
	A fine for spitting can perhaps be the only solution to enforce discipline among irresponsible citizens. Online monitoring system and CCTV footage may be used for follow-up action on the offenders. Applying coal tar epoxy paint at the bottom of the bridge might help in protecting the structure from corrosion.

	Apropos the report Toppers on a different scale (May 20), no applause is enough for The Telegraph for not only refraining from carrying the toppers list but also for highlighting the students who have succeeded, not necessarily topped, by fighting against all odds.           
	The obsession with marks and making demigods out of the toppers has an adverse effect on the child prodigies in the long run, as rightly pointed out in the report; this result-oriented communalism compels the failures and not-so-successful to think of themselves as pariahs. The resultant inferiority complex is enough to drive them into a state of depression; some even are forced to take suicidal steps.           
	The report has sent a strong message to all, especially the upcoming generations, that mere marks in examinations are not the be-all-and-end-all of life. Rather, the real examination lies in making a mark in the society by grit, courage and not losing the focus even when the going gets tough.

	Apropos the report C for Civic, C for Corruption (May 22), the corrupt practices that CMC councillors often indulge in have been wonderfully highlighted. I would like to add a few more misdeeds indulged by these civic guardians in exchange for money.             
	They have a close rapport with promoters who grab waterbodies that are converted to land for construction of highrises, flouting all civic laws. They also arrange for issuing false birth certificates from CMC in collusion with the civic staff. The councillors often issue low-income certificates to affluent families to help them avail of undue privileges from the railways and government hospitals and also recommend remission of civic taxes to high-income groups. Many councillors allow illegal wine shops to thrive in their areas.           
	With the civic election round the corner and some political parties desirous of change, I wonder if the corruption would go through any change in the coming days.

	A mention must be made of the Santoshpur chorporation. If a person defaults on his tax, he has to make an application on a prescribed form. This form is sold not in the corporation office, but outside at a Xerox shop  Rs 6 for three pages! Calcutta people protest the US intervention in Iraq, but dont care about what happens in their own backyard!           
	Shayan Sen,           
	UK                               
	Apropos the report Flagged off: poll tricks (May 12), it is frustrating to see that none of the political parties cares about the election commissions order on writing on the wall. It is evident from the sea of graffiti displayed prominently on the boundary walls of residents.             
	In Labony Estate in Salt Lake, where I have been residing for the last 35 years, the whole complex has been defiled with writings on the walls. Im not personally against wall writing during polls since its the only handy tool at the disposal of the political parties to campaign for votes. The practice has been going on since the very beginning of elections in post-Independence India unhindered by any poll code. But then, it must have the endorsement of the affected houseowners whose walls are so distastefully defaced and which continue to decorate the same even after the polls are over.           
	State election commissioner Meera Pandeys assurance to the effect that she would look into the matter to find out whether there was any violation of the model code of conduct prohibiting graffiti on a private wall without consent is well in order. But she should see to it that the assurance is put into effect as the date for D-day is fast approaching.

	Salt Lake                               
	Apropos the report Citys first citizen club (May 6), I think Dr BC Roy was the citys best mayor. He was chief minister of West Bengal from 1948-1962 and mayor for 1931-1933. He was the key figure behind the first post-Independence Calcutta Municipal Act of 1951. He envisioned all advantages of a citizens life for Calcuttans  from government buses to Salt Lake to the Metro Railway. Dr Roy was the real architect of modern Bengal.             
	Bhaskar Sengupta,           
	Barisha                     
	My vote goes to Rajendra Nath Majumdar. At his initiative and after his successful meetings with the late Morarji Desai, central government establishments in Calcutta started paying property tax to the Calcutta corporation. Incidentally, this is his birth centenary year. He was born on August 9, 1911.           
	Ranadeb Majumdar,           
	VIP Road                     
	I consider Anandi Lal Poddar to be the best mayor of Calcutta. He was mayor for a very short time. Had he served Calcutta for some more years, the city would have achieved the status of the financial capital of India. Arun Singhania,           
	Address not given                     
	I think the best mayor was Anandi Lal Poddar. R Kumar,           
	Address not given                     
	My vote for the citys best mayor would be for Rajendra Nath Majumdar, 1961-1963. Ranita Ghosh Dastidar,           
	Dallas, US                     
	My vote for the best mayor goes to Rajendra Nath Majumdar. Prasenjit Adhikari,           
	Chicago, US                     
	I think this vote is a campaign in favour of Subrata Mukherjee as most of the people have seen only the last few mayors.           
	But they cannot possibly see what Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose or Anandi Lal Poddar have done for Calcutta. I think Poddars short stint could be compared to Lal Bahadur Shastris short tenure as Prime Minister and in my view he was the best mayor of Calcutta. Deepak Daneriwala,           
	Address not given                               
	The Stephen Court inferno and its resultant high toll on human lives bear testimony to the fact that Calcuttas fire department is incapable of dousing a high-rise blaze. Astonishingly enough, a few brave youths did a heroic job in saving the lives of the trapped residents although they were bereft of fire-fighting equipment. I request the state fire minister to recruit these youths in his department.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,           
	Majdia, Nadia                     
	The fire at Stephen Court has left a deep scar on Calcuttas image, which will take time to heal. What will not go down well is the callous nature of the authorities to check safety rules. In Shreeram Arcade, near New Market, rules are openly violated. Boys are found smoking in front of the womens toilet in the basement of the market. Plastic and other inflammable items are stored in shops at the basement. The open space behind the market is used to park bikes and scooters by police. The police are only violating safety procedure by allowing the parking. Many shopkeepers are seen smoking inside shops. Earlier, when a fire had broken in the arcade, the safety pumps were not in working condition. Anirban Sen,           
	Raja Ram Mohan Roy Street                     
	Apropos the report Safety chute for high-rise horror, March 30, a rapid escape chute that had been developed indigenously by the Centre for Fire, Explosive and Environment Safety, New Delhi, has not yet found a manufacturer. Such a device would undoubtedly be useful as a first line of escape for those trapped in a burning building and could save many lives. The government should make it mandatory for each and every high-rise  old and new alike  to install an adequate number of such chutes on every floor. Thus a demand will be created for it and many an entrepreneur will come forward with manufacturing proposals. But let this not detract the dire need to add to and upgrade the fire departments equipment. The men who put their lives at risk to fight fire need smoke masks, fire-suits, helmets (fireproof ones not plastic), interpersonal communication system (not cellphones), jump-nets or cushion and long ladders to reach their water jets to the highest floors. Bill Mansell,           
	Park Street                     
	lThe devastating fire in Stephen Court had exposed the lack of preparedness for a high-rise blaze in the city. Proper equipment such as sky-lift, large ladders, more fire tenders, water and other fire equipment should be readily available to douse fire quickly. There are many old houses without proper resources to put off fire quickly. Even live electrical wires are found dangling dangerously. B.N. Bose,           
	Dum Dum Park                     
	Last March it was Stephen Court, tomorrow it can be Stephen House, Queens Mansion, Karnani Mansion or Karnani Estate, just to name a few old buildings, which are equally under threat of fire. Continued measures should be taken to prevent any more tragedies in the city. The space below flyovers should be utilised to park fire brigade vehicles and other equipment instead of parking them in an extreme corner of the city.

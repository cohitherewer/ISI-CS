                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen directors bail pleas rejected
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                          The blaze at Stephen Court      
	The high court on Wednesday rejected the anticipatory bail pleas of Sanjay Bagaria and Sushil Kumar Sureka, two of the three directors of the company that manages the fire-ravaged Stephen Court, and asked them to surrender in the metropolitan magistrates court.        
	Bagaria and Sureka  along with the third director of Stephen Court Ltd, Pradip Kumar More  are key accused in cases lodged by police and the state fire services department following the March 23 blaze that claimed 43 lives.        
	Arrest warrants and proclamation notices  which make it mandatory for accused to appear in court within a month to avoid being declared proclaimed offenders  have been issued against the trio.        
	Opposing the bail pleas, public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said: It takes only 10 minutes to reach Stephen Court from the office where the two directors sit (23 NS Road). The key to the collapsible gate of the roof was with them. They could have sent the key and saved many lives.        
	Goswami was referring to the victims who had tried to flee to the terrace but could not because the gate was locked and were burnt or choked to death on the staircase.        
	The public prosecutor submitted that the directors of Stephen Court Ltd did not take any fire safety measures in the building. They have flouted all the fire norms. Considering the gravity of the crime, the court should not allow their bail prayers.        
	The petitioners lawyer, Sekhar Basu, claimed the charges against Bagaria and Sureka were baseless.        
	My clients are ready to help the police and others in their investigations. They will not leave the city if their bail pleas are granted, Basu said.        
	But the court rejected the bail pleas and asked the duo to surrender in the lower court.        
	On Wednesday, the city sessions court had admitted a petition by Bagaria challenging the legality of proclamation notices issued against him and the two other directors. The court will hear the petition on July 7 and has till then stayed the probe into the Stephen Court fire.

                      Incisive investigation                    A whodunit inspired by that inimitable legend of crime fiction, Sherlock Holmes, 221 B Baker Street presents an interesting psychological exploration of the minds of accomplished, celebrated professionals. Being staged as part of Airtel Lifestage Kolkata Theatre Festival, it introduces the audience to several characters, who, though renowned and successful in their distinctive fields, are given to certain strange whims, fancies and fascinations. They have their own failings and even express their fondness for (or disdain towards) fictionalised crime. Against such a background is introduced the possibility of murder. The temptation of a Holmsian solution beckons, while its action moves towards an exciting denouement. Drama and direction: Arindam Mukherjee.

                      Celebration of Indian contemporary art                    When I look, I find that the whole world is a procession of line and shape with a musical undertone. It is that music which should have a signal of colour ...  Rabindranath Tagore        A celebration of its enthusiasm and passion for Indian contemporary art, Vibgyor, the ongoing art show hosted by Gallery Grandeur, features a rare collection of exquisite designs painted or minutely carved by some of the countrys well-known artists.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Biz firms vow never to return
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Sayan Sengupta, 22, one of the employees of Microsys who died on Tuesday                                  
	Its back to business for Rawat and Sons Engineering and Microsys Technical Enterprises, but not back to Stephen Court.         
	The decision to leave the building that had been home to them for decades came after the two companies lost 15 employees between them to Tuesdays fire.        
	The business has to go on. So many people are dependent on us, but we cant go back to that building anymore. The fire will always haunt us and we cannot risk losing more lives to another such accident, said Pradeep Rawat of Rawat and Sons, which is housed on the fifth floor of Block II.        
	Rawats daughter Shruti Bansal slipped and fell to her death while trying to reach a drainage pipe outside a window on Tuesday.        
	Microsys, an ITeS company that deals with website designing and hardware maintenance, lost eight of its 35 employees. Those who died belonged mostly to the telemarketing and sales and marketing divisions.         
	The company is scouting for office space.        
	Our office is on the fourth floor of Stephen Court, near Lift No. 2. There were around 13 people in office at the time of the fire. Only five of us made it, said Senthil, the network manager of the company, which had just hired a team of 20 young people.        
	Rawat and Sons, railway contractors with over 200 employees across the country, lost seven of their workers to the inferno.        
	Our main office is in flat 5K of Stephen Court but most of our employees work at various sites across the country. Those who lost their lives in the fire were like family to us, said Pradeep, who has been working out of the Park Street address since 1991.         
	Four of his employees were charred to death and two others slipped and fell while trying to escape through a window.         
	On Thursday morning, some of Microsyss employees and Pradeeps nephew Manas, who also works in the company, arrived in front of Stephen Court, hoping that they would be allowed to go in to see if any documents could be salvaged.        
	We keep a back-up of all data in case the hard disk crashes but we never expected that our entire office would crash like this, rued Manas.        
	He added that some documents were kept in fireproof safes and might have escaped the damage but they were unable to find out if the papers had survived the fire.        
	We are being harassed from morning. I was called in and then threatened by police for asking to be allowed into the building. I cremated my sister yesterday and lost many friends. They should be more understanding, said Manas.         
	The PF and ESI records of all our employees were in the office. They are dependent on us. We are desperate, he added.

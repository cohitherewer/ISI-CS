                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Skin haul in scientist apartment
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five animal skins, bones and skulls were seized from a Beleghata apartment whose owner claimed to be a researcher in biotechnology.        
	Officers of the Central Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and police raided the CIT Road flat on Monday following a tip-off about the illegal items.        
	The owner, who said he was attached to a chemical and bio-technological laboratory in Salt Lake Sector V, was asked to appear in court and explain why he had kept the banned items in his house.        
	We had obtained a search warrant from court and sought help from police. A citizen cannot keep the items we have seized without valid reasons, said an officer of the bureau, which functions under the Union environment and forest ministry.        
	The flat owner told the sleuths that he had bought the items for his research work.        
	A team from the bureau will talk to the laboratory authorities in an attempt to verify the claim.        
	We provided all help to the bureau, joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.

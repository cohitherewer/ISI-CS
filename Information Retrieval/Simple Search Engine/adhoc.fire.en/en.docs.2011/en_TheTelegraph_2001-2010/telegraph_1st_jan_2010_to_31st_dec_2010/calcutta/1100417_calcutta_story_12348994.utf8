The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Apple of i on hush-hush high

  - Grey market for pricey iPad          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                  
	The iPad is here, hush-hush, and a hot-seller, not so hush-hush. The multi-touch masterpiece of Steve Jobs slipped into Calcuttas grey market seven days after the US launch on April 3 and those buying it are busy flaunting it.        
	Among the first off the iPad blocks was Agnidev Chatterjee, a film director, who picked one up on April 10 from a mall in south Calcutta. It will take months for it to officially come to town and being a Mac user for the past 10 years I couldnt bear to wait that long, he says, tapping the treasured 9.7-inch touchscreen at his Tollygunge studio.        
	Chatterjee has been joined by a fast-growing line of tech buffs in town. We didnt think that our customers would be so excited but those who are coming in to buy something else are seeing the iPad and picking it up. The interface is so compelling that we have been selling eight-10 pieces a day, says the storeowner from whom Chatterjee bought his latest Apple fix.        
	Brought in from Singapore and Hong Kong, the WiFi version of the iPad is selling in the grey market for Rs 40,000 (16GB) and Rs 50,000 (32GB). In the US market, the price tag today reads $499 (Rs 22,113) for 16GB and $599 (Rs 26,544) for 32GB.        
	The apple of everyones i is drawing Apple devotees and the do-the-new brigade. Babli Kripalani of Bang Bang, a gadget store in AC Market, has witnessed quite a scramble.        
	Our first stock got sold out when it arrived four days ago. Customers  most of them existing Apple users  had told us days in advance to let them know as soon as it was in, he says.        
	The biggest draw he feels is the big video screen of a tech tool that enables users to surf the Net faster than the iPhone, play games and do almost everything one can do on a laptop.        
	I was waiting for the iPad because of iBooks, the virtual bookshelf. I dont see the WiFi version having any problem since it isnt being routed through a service provider. The 3G version that comes with a SIM card can face a khulja SIM-SIM problem, says Vishnu Mohta, 27, who owns a MacBook Pro, an iMac and an iPhone.        
	The lack of after-sales service could be a rotten apple, though. Those who buy unauthorised iPads from the grey market will lose out on after-sales support, warns Sanjay Chordia, the owner of Imagine, Apples premium store in the city.        
	There could be a problem because the wireless settings run on scripts as per country. The same thing happened when the iPhone entered the grey market and those who burnt their fingers then might not be ready to take another chance with the iPad, he adds.        
	Another grey area slowing down the iPad sales surge in the weeks to come will be the cost factor.        
	Its not worth the money if you already own an iPhone and a Mac Book. I bought it because I could feed in high-quality videos of my serials to show them to my clients, says film-maker Chatterjee.

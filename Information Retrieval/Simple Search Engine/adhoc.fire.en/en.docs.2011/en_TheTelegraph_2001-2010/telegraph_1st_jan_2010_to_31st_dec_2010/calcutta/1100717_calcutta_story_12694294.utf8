The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trendy Tolly takes to English titles
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trendy Tolly takes to English titles
  - Name in Shakespeares tongue but soul still Madly Bangalee           KUSHALI NAG                                                  
	Wanted, Hangover, The Japanese Wife, Clerk, Houseful, Challenge, Chalo Lets Go, Madly Bangalee.        
	Whats in a name? Shakespeare might have thought there wasnt much but Tollywood thinks theres a lot to lose or gain, depending on whether the name is in the Bards tongue or Vidyasagars.        
	With a spate of Bengali releases bearing English words in their titles, Tollywood is going trendy.        
	Shree Venkatesh Films, which not so long ago boasted box-office hits with names like Sasurbari Zindabad, agrees that an English name gives a trendy feel to a film now. Bengali films are changing, in terms of technology and look. They cater to the urban upmarket audience, so having a title like Challenge, Wanted or Autograph gives the film an edge. The days of Pratibad and Pratishodh are gone, says Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films.        
	But an English name for the sake of an English name is not the answer. The title of a film must finally depend on the subject. For example, our recent release Amanush couldnt have had an English title, explains Soni.                                                                                
	The second consideration is that some English words are more commonly used than their Bengali counterparts.  
	 ldquo;The word lsquo;wanted rsquo; is not confined to English anymore. Even my tea-boy understands it. Our film is about a criminal on the run and the police have plastered his posters with the word lsquo;wanted rsquo; on his picture. Before zeroing in on this title, we toyed with 50 other names but none was suitable, rdquo; says Himanshu Dhanuka, the producer of Wanted.     
	English words often turn out to be more apt than their literal Bengali translation. ldquo;Challenge nibi na sala made so much impact but just try saying that in Bengali mdash; lsquo;Sharto nibi na sala. rsquo; It sounds hilarious, rdquo; adds Dhanuka.     
	Challenge, for instance, was all about ldquo;attitude rdquo; and the title had to reflect that. ldquo;The protagonist (played by Dev) had little to do except fight goons and dance with his girlfriend, so the first thing that came to my mind was lsquo;challenge rsquo;, rdquo; explains director Raj Chakraborty.     
	Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha, whose Cross Connection worked well with the youth, have picked Benglish for their next film mdash; Prem By Chance. ldquo;Cross Connection was made for a semi-urban audience. I couldn rsquo;t have called it Durobhasey Prem! Nobody would have understood that. My next film Prem By Chance has the two most common English words. lsquo;By chance rsquo; is a part of our lingo, rdquo; says Sudeshna.     
	English words that come easy hold the key. Try Hangover in Bengali and you will know. ldquo;My film is a comedy about a middle-aged man with a soft spot for pretty young girls. The Bengali equivalent for lsquo;hangover rsquo; would have been lsquo;chhonkchhonkani rsquo;! We couldn rsquo;t possibly have replaced lsquo;hangover rsquo; with that, rdquo; says Prabhat Roy. Hangover, starring Prosenjit, is currently running in the suburbs.     
	Makers like Roy will fall back on an English title only if they can rsquo;t find a suitable Bengali word. ldquo;My next film is called Binimoy (starring Debasree Roy and Rituparna Sengupta). I am not calling it lsquo;exchange rsquo;, rdquo; he stresses.     
	Having an English title no longer means alienating the non-English-speaking audience in suburban Bengal. Because a simple English name is often better than a tongue-twisting Bengali word.   
	 ldquo;My distributors were furious with the title Mehul Bonir Sereng. They told me nobody would understand it. But I stuck to my decision. Why can rsquo;t we have poetic titles like Asani Sanket and Jotugriha? rdquo; asks Sekhar Das, who did a volte-face with the naming of his under-production film Necklace, which was earlier called Chorer Bou.  
	 ldquo;After re-reading the script I felt Necklace would be more apt than Chorer Bou because the story centres around a lost necklace. Besides, lsquo;necklace rsquo; would interest the youth, rdquo; he says.     
	The last word about the first word of a film comes from Srijit Mukherjee whose debut film Autograph, starring Prosenjit and Nandana Sen, is in queue for release. ldquo;The bottom-line is, English or Bengali, the name must have an impact. lsquo;Soi rsquo; is the Bengali for lsquo;autograph rsquo;, but even people in the suburbs come up to stars and ask for their lsquo;autograph rsquo;, rdquo; he justifies.     
	Clearly, when it comes to the name of a Tollywood film, it rsquo;s more than just a game      [+uc('.')+]

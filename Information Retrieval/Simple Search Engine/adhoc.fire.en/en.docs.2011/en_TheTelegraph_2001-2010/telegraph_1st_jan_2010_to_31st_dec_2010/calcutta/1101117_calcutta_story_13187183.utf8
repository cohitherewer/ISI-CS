The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HS: 7-point something
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HS: 7-point something
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education is moving towards a more scientific and rational gradation system, splitting its existing five-point scale into a seven-pointer.        
	The council on Tuesday convened a meeting with representatives of various teachers bodies to discuss the pros and cons and examine how soon the new gradation can be implemented.        
	Most teachers have agreed to switch to a seven-point scale to make the gradation system more rational and scientific. This will now be placed at the executive body meeting of the council for approval, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, the president of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education.        
	If the council approves the decision, it will be forwarded to the state school education department.        
	The new gradation system can be implemented after the state government puts its seal and issues an order announcing the implementation, said an official.        
	The council hopes to introduce the new system from 2011. But we cannot finalise the implementation until we get a clearance from the government, the official added.         
	Grade AA will be the highest slot in the proposed seven-point scale. Under the existing five-point scale, the highest grade is A+. (See box.)        
	Under the system introduced in 2005, students are awarded both marks and grades in all subjects. Although the mark sheet shows both marks and grades, the total aggregate is not mentioned in the mark sheet and no division is awarded.        
	Examinees of HS 2007 were the first to be assessed through grades.        
	With the gradual modernisation of the HS course and restructuring of the question and marking patterns, students are able to score more in the school-leaving board exams. The five-point scale was suitable at the time the grading system was introduced as there were less high-scorers then, said Kanti Biswas, the former school education minister.        
	The council has taken the right decision to switch to a seven-point scale now. More students are scoring above 90 per cent and so creating a new bracket between 90 and 100 is justified, he added.        
	One of the main goals of the grading system was to reduce stress and competition and also discourage students from depending too much on private tuition in their quest for marks.        
	The council on Tuesday also decided to allow schools to conduct their pre-HS selection tests in December, instead of November, in order to increase the number of teaching and learning days.

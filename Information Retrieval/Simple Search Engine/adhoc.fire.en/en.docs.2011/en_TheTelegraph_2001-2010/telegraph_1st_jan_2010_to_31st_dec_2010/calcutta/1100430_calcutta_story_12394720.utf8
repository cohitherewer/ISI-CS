The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | I did not even get into the test car
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      I did not even get into the test car
                            
	A reader of Metro responded to Thursdays story on the driving licence farce played out under the Alipore RTO and emailed his recent experience of the same.        
	I have been driving since 1985. My driving licence expired in 1998 but I did not renew it because by then I had stopped driving. Recently, when I decided to get back behind the wheel, I approached a motor training school in Behala.        
	I was told that if I paid something extra the process could be expedited. They took Rs 1,200  around 50 per cent more than the actual fee.        
	After a few days I was asked to report for a driving test on Penn Road in Alipore. Cars from various motor training schools were parked on one side and almost 150 candidates were waiting in queue. Everyone was apparently waiting for the motor vehicles inspectors to arrive.        
	Suddenly, a training school representative I had come through instructed four or five candidates to hop into the back seat of a Maruti Omni while he took the wheel. He drove off, returned in a couple of minutes and told the next batch to hop in.        
	I asked the training school rep what was happening and why no motor vehicles inspector was around to take the test. Sir, you dont worry. You will get your licence, came the polite reply.         
	My turn  to at least board the car  had not yet arrived when there was an announcement that all of us had to go for a photo session to the Alipore RTO.        
	What about my test? I asked, quite stunned.        
	Let it be, sir. Why should you work so hard in this heat? Let us do the needful, the representative told me.        
	At the RTO, the training school reps called out our names and the application forms with test approval certificates were handed over. I was assured that my licence would be delivered within three weeks.        
	I shudder to think of all those being given a licence to kill every week without even touching the wheel during the test. We are all responsible for making our streets so unsafe.

                              UNLIBERATING: An ad for a jewellery brand in central Calcutta claims shooting gold prices have left parents worried about their daughters weddings. When will women be free? Picture by Bishwarup Dutta				                           
	A restaurant in the city recently thought of celebrating 63 years of Indias freedom with a special buffet. To get into the groove, the restaurant invited two freedom fighters to announce the event.         
	But the two men, one 88, and the other 89, were at a loss. Eta ki pratishthan? (What institution is this)? asked one as waiters started placing the dishes deftly before them. No, no, Im not hungry, protested the other gentleman. When it was explained that they would have to eat, they were more confused.         
	Really? Is that why we have been asked to come? The lady from public relations tried some sweet talk. Well, we are celebrating Independence Day and what better way than by paying our respects to freedom fighters? After all you are the ones who made it possible, but she was cut short, Are you in politics? The young lady was left groping for an answer.         
	The best was yet to come. This is a business establishment and like all business establishments, Im sure it is profit-driven. It would be nice if the owner could do something to help the poor, said the 89-year-old freedom fighter. The said owner had disappeared from sight.         
	In between posing for pictures, with uttariyas that were presented to them by the restaurant management, nibbling at the food and answering questions put to them by the assembled media, the two freedom fighters also recalled the days of Independence struggle.         
	We would have political meetings at the Coffee House, said the 88-year-old. Both were unhappy with the present.         
	This is worse than British rule. People do not have food to eat. Spurious medicine floods the market. A handful of people are sucking money out of the majority. This is not the kind of state we had imagined while fighting for Independence, said the other.                         A scene from Walking to the Sun      
	Amal and jewish orphans  
	At the ongoing Happenings Rabindra Utsav where several plays were presented by groups from Bengal and beyond, none opted for traditional representations of Tagore.   
	What for instance can the plight of Jewish orphans and the World War II Holocaust have in common with Dak Ghar? In Shanbags Walking to the Sun (staged on August 10 at the Academy of Fine Arts), if Amal seated at his window still longs to explore all that lies beyond the hills, the Polish doctor, Janusz Korczak, recalls that even as he led the children away from the last summer camp in the face of impending war he had given them the assurance that if one crossed the hills and walked to the sun one could see many-coloured flowers and butterflies against the golden yellow sun.         
	In this English-Hindi play written by Vivek Narayan the two worlds, real and imaginary, occupied separate sections of the stage. But often Amal seems to watch Korczak and leaving his bed sneaks into the Jewish camp and Tagores song Dure kothai dure dure sung by Moushumi Bhowmick is followed by the wail of a siren.         
	While one Mrinal (Calcutta-based actor Ramanjit Kaur) seeks fulfillment through poetry written secretly on her typewriter, another Mrinal (male actor Vansh Bhardwaj) playfully splashes Bindu (older actress Gick Grewal) with water. In fact in Stree-r Patra (presented by The Company on August 12), Neelam Man Singh Chowdhury, a senior director and chairperson of the theatre department of Punjab University, turns the entire stage into a play-area where imaginary spaces, dreams and hopes collide with mundane and harsh realities.         
	Sudip Gupta and his Calcutta-based Dolls Theatre used unconventional puppets, actors and other objects to portray Tagore the freedom fighter in Aaguner Parashmoni (August 13), while lifers from the Baharampur correctional home presented Tota Kahini (August 11).         
	They asked me whether Tagore had ever served a prison term because he seems to know exactly what it feels like, says actor Pradip Bhattacharjee, who has been conducting the Cultural Therapy Program at jails.         
	Rehearsals were held inside the prison where lock-up time is from 6pm to 6am. The men and women are kept apart and are never allowed to interact with the outside world. But they have worked together as actors and travelled (albeit in prison vans with police escorts) to shows in West Bengal and Delhi. The colourful rendering with folk music, dance and masks carried the strength of lived emotions.                         Madonna      
	35=40  
	Demi Moore might be married to a much younger Aston Kutcher and Madonna at 51 may be dating a 20-something Jesus Luz, but that is in Hollywood. In India, we still like our men to be older, even if the lady is of a certain age. Call it patriarchy.   
	A new matrimonial website aimed for an older age group fixes the minimum age limit to be 40 and above for men, but 35 and above for women. Ironically the website is called 40plusmatrimony.         
	If the membership figures on the website are any indication the marriageable age in India is going up. A random partner search on the website throws up many profiles of men in their 40s, who were never married. The really good news: many of the women above 35 are proudly employed and dont think too much about their single status.

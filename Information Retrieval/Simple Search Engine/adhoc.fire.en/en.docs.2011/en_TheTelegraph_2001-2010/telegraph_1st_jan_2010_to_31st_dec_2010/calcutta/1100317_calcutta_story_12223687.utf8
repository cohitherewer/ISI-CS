          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A CID officer told the high court on Tuesday that third-year engineering student Soumik Basus death on the Besu campus in 2006 was an accident.        
	The Siliguri boy fell from the second-floor balcony of a hostel on the morning of August 9, 2006, after a night of clashes among students, and died. A special superintendent of the CID told Justice J. Biswas that the state investigative department had conducted a thorough probe into the incident but did not find evidence of foul play.        
	On March 10, Justice Biswas, acting on a plea by Soumiks parents Ashok and Dipika, had asked a CID officer to come to the court with documents relating to the students death. The parents had alleged that the department had failed to conduct a fair probe into Soumiks death.

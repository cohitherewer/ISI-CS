          A STAFF REPORTER                          Three of the tease accused at the airport on Monday evening. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Six passengers of IndiGos Patna-Calcutta-Bangalore flight were offloaded and arrested at the city airport on Monday evening for allegedly misbehaving with an air hostess.        
	The six had boarded the flight at Patna and were bound for Bangalore. After take-off, they misbehaved with an air hostess, an officer at the airport police station said.        
	The six have been identified as A.K. Singh, Salman Khan, Amjad Khan, Niyaz Pasha, Ali Ahmed and Md Hidayatullah. The police said all were residents of Bangalore and had gone to Patna to take part in a business conference.         
	The pilot had contacted the Calcutta air traffic control and sought help after landing, the airport official said. The flight landed around 7pm and the six were taken to the police station.        
	The accused, however, denied the charge. We had asked the air hostess for warm water but she brought cold water. There was an altercation and we insisted on speaking to a senior crew member. But, instead, we were arrested, said A.K. Singh.        
	IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said: The pilot reported the matter to the police. Such incidents cannot be taken lightly.

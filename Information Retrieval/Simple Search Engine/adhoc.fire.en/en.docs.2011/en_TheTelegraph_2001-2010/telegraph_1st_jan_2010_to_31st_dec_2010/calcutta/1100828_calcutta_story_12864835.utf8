  - CPM shutdown call in wake of turf tussle with Trinamul        A STAFF REPORTER                          BAGHA JATIN NOT BARAMULLA: Residents stand scared as a policeman fires teargas shells during the CPM vs Trinamul clash on Friday morning. (Amit Datta)                                        
	A clash with Trinamul Congress supporters over the election of the chairpersons of two boroughs on Friday prompted the CPM to call a 12-hour bandh in several south Calcutta pockets  including Jadavpur, Bagha Jatin and Kasba  from 6am on Saturday.        
	The bandh call was followed by announcements from party leaders assuring Calcuttans that they would not be inconvenienced but residents of the troubled pocket were not convinced.        
	Tapati Das, an elderly resident of Jadavpur, said she would dare not venture out on Saturday. Why this sudden bandh? I was to visit my daughters house with my 11-month-old grandson. But I have decided not to step out tomorrow.        
	Sujan Chakraborty, the South 24-Parganas secretary of the CPM, said: The EM Bypass, and the Rashbehari and Prince Anwar Shah connectors have been kept out of the bandhs purview.        
	He also promised that the bandh would not be enforced on the underground and overground railways, as well as on other emergency services.        
	The civic wards where the bandh has been called are 103, 104, 110, 111, 112, 113 and 114 (in borough XI, covering Santoshpur, Jadavpur, Bagha Jatin and parts of East Putiary) and 101, 102, 105, 106, 107, 108 and 109 (borough XII, covering Kasba, Haltu, Ruby, Kalikapur and parts of the Bypass).        
	We have been campaigning since the evening, asking residents to make the bandh successful, said a CPM cadre. The party had taken out a procession at 4.30pm that went from the borough XI office off Subodh Chandra Mullick Road to Bagha Jatin railway station.        
	Police said 30 people were injured in the clash that resulted in the CPM calling the bandh. The clash started at 11am. Our men had to resort to lathicharge to disperse the crowd. No complaint has been lodged and no one has been arrested, said S.K. Chaudhari, additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas.                  
	Sources in both parties claimed Mitali Banerjee, the Trinamul councillor of ward 99, and Rinku Naskar, the CPM councillor of ward 102, were among the injured.        
	Trouble had been brewing in the area since the newly-elected Trinamul board of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation realigned some wards of boroughs XI and XII in an attempt to ensure that both chairpersons were from the party.        
	When mayoral council member Debasis Kumar, who is also the presiding officer for the election of the chairperson of borough XI, reached the borough office on Friday morning, CPM cadres did not let him in and allegedly attacked his car.        
	The CPM-backed Borough Punarvinyas Birodhi Mancha, which started an agitation last week against the swapping of wards, said residents of wards 101 to 104 would have to travel two-four km extra to reach their borough offices because of the realignment.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee said: The clash could have been averted had the police not been silent spectators.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said: We are opposing the bandh because the Trinamul is against such forms of protest. We are confident people will foil the bandh.

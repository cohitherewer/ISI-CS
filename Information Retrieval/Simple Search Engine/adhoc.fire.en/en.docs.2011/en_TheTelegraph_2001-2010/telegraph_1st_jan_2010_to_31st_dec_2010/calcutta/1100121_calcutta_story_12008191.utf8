          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four alleged criminals have been arrested on the charge of triggering violence at Harimohan Ghosh College in Garden Reach on January 7.        
	Mukhtar and his three accomplices  Israel, Jawed and Akhtar  have been charged with attempt to murder and rioting. They have been remanded in police custody for seven days, said an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy section.         
	Mukhtar, who enjoys the patronage of local CPM leaders, had masterminded the violence. Raids are on to nab the other gang members, the officer added.        
	The clash that broke out over the filing of nomination for the students union election left six Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporters and four policemen injured. Four buses were damaged.        
	The injured students were admitted to SSKM Hospital with pellet and splinter injuries.        
	Sleuths said Mukhtar and his gang had fired in the air and shot pellets from airguns targeting the rival camp. They also hurled bombs and bricks at the opponents.        
	The violence broke out after Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporters put up a roadblock protesting alleged atrocities by the SFI.        
	An officer said Mukhtar was involved in several criminal activities, including extortion and drug-peddling, in the port area. A large number of traders and importers have lodged complaints against him, the officer said.

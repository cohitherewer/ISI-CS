The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fake arms licence accused held
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fake arms licence accused held
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The alleged kingpin of an arms licence racket was arrested in Birbhum and several firearms issued against fake licences seized during raids in Durgapur on Thursday night.         
	The haul by the Criminal Investigation Department follows the seizure of 18 firearms issued against fake licences from the city and its suburbs over the past few days.        
	Police were tight-lipped about the identity of the kingpin, who is in his 40s. He was held in Dubrajpur, Birbhum.         
	In Durgapur, 44 single and double-barrel guns, which were procured with fake licences, were found in the storerooms of two security agencies. Most of the guards who own the guns are absconding.        
	The guards used fake licences to procure guns because they knew it would be difficult for their employers to verify the documents, said a CID officer.

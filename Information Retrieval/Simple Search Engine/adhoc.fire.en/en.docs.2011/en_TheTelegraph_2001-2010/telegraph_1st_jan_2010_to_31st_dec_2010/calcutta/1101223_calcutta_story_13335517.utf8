The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Murder cry in students death
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Murder cry in students death
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Kajal Kiran Mandal                                  
	A youth found dead beside the railway tracks near Garia station on Sunday night has turned out to be a college student, whose family alleged SFI activists had killed him because of his link with Trinamul.        
	Police, however, seem to be sure that the death of 19-year-old Kajol Kiran Mandal, a second-year BA student of Dinabandhu Andrews College in Garia, was an accident, possibly linked to a heartbreak.        
	Kajol had left his home at Garagachha, near Garia station, on Sunday evening. When he failed to return even by midnight, his family lodged a missing diary with Sonarpur police station.        
	Late on Tuesday night, Kajols father Kanak was told about a body recovered by the Jadavpur GRP. The body was identified as Kajols on Wednesday. He was the youngest of four siblings.        
	Kajol had been getting threat calls from SFI supporters. We suspect they killed him. A murder case has been lodged with Sonarpur police station. We want the police to immediately arrest the SFI activists who were behind the murder, father Kanak.        
	Ganji Anil Srinivas, the superintendent of railway police, Sealdah, said: Its a clear case of accident. The youth was hit by a train. There were witnesses who had warned him about the train but he did not budge.        
	Srinivass version tallied with that of the South 24-Parganas police that have started an independent probe.        
	Some people saw him walking along the railway tracks between Garia and Narendrapur stations when he was hit by a train around 9.30pm, close to two hours after he left home. The injuries on his body were accidental in nature, said an officer of Sonarpur police station.        
	The sleuths have not ruled out a link between the accident and Kajols recent break-up with his girlfriend, a Class XII student of a local school.        
	An officer said the girl had recently ditched Kajol as her parents did not approve of their relationship.        
	The girl was not even ready to speak to Kajol. On Sunday, he had called the girl from the cellphone of one of his friends. They had a brief conversation, after which he left home, the officer added.        
	The Trinamul Chhatra Parishad (TCP) refused to buy the cops version and blamed the SFI for Kajols death. TCP supporters took out a rally with his body from NRS hospital, where the post-mortem was conducted.        
	Kajol contested the college polls twice. SFI supporters were threatening him for the past few months. We are sure they had killed him, said TCP president Baiswanor Chatterjee.        
	SFI leaders denied the allegation and demanded a complete probe.

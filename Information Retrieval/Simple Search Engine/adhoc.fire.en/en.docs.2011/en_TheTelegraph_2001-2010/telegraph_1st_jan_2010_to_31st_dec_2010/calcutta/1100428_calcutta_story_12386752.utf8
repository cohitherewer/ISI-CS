The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cadres clear bandh pitch for cops and cricket 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cadres clear bandh pitch for cops and cricket 
          OUR BUREAU                      A stranded family of 22 from Nashik enjoys a meal of khichdi cooked over a Sealdah tea-stall stove after arriving in the city from Darjeeling on Tuesday morning to catch a train back home. ldquo;If you want to have a good time, you can do so even in a railway station, rdquo; said the patriarch of the family. (Amit Datta)                                 
	Calcuttas ubiquitous bandh army was conspicuous by its absence from the streets even as the city suffered a silent but total shutdown on Tuesday.         
	Citizens who had stepped out fearing they would be accosted by the lathi-wielding brigade were surprised to find nobody stopping vehicles or threatening drivers, barring a few exceptions.        
	Another common feature of bandhs in the city  supporters pulling down shutters of commercial establishments  was not reported from anywhere in the city.         
	If the bandh machinery was at work, it was behind the scenes and at places where it mattered, including the Metro rail stations that people were prevented from entering.         
	 Where have all the party cadres gone? I did not see any of them anywhere on the streets trying to enforce the bandh, asked a trader who had left his central Calcutta home on his new motorcycle early on Tuesday for a joyride on the EM Bypass.         
	Unlike on previous bandh days, passage to the airport was also smooth throughout Tuesday, though finding an open toilet inside the terminal did pose a problem for passengers.        
	Cadres carrying party flags and standing on VIP Road to prevent vehicles from reaching the airport are a common sight during bandhs.         
	The flags were visible on Tuesday but only on lamp posts and dividers along the airport route; the hands that usually carry those flags were nowhere to be seen.        
	So while the bandh brigade stayed underground, it was hard to miss the police presence at every major crossing. As the police watched, street cricket prospered.        
	Cricket on bandh days is not new but I had never before seen so many matches being played on the streets of the city. Maybe this is the IPL effect, smiled a young man on a bike.         
	For a feel of the bandh bandobast, one had to visit the Metro stations.         
	Groups of youths were deployed at almost every station to block the entry of passengers even as empty trains shuttled between Dum Dum and Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar) at regular intervals.        
	The peaceful bandh was reflected in the number of arrests on charges of disruption. The only two persons to be arrested, both from Chetla, were charged with shattering the windshield of a car.         
	We usually arrest at least 20 people on a bandh day. The number is higher if the bandh or strike is called by the Opposition, said a senior police officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Card reward to crore fraud
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Card reward to crore fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Textile trader Mukesh Kishanpuria figured out that he could defraud airlines by cancelling tickets twice simultaneously while buying and cancelling tickets to earn credit card reward points, according to cops.        
	Kishanpuria, who allegedly defrauded Jet Airways of Rs 2.9 crore, was arrested on November 10. On Monday, he was remanded in police custody till November 19.        
	Kishanpuria was an active online shopper. He used to buy air tickets using his credit card and then cancel them to earn reward points, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Credit card reward points can earn customers free gifts and other benefits. Some banks also offer cash rewards against credit points.        
	Initially, Kishanpuria used to buy and cancel tickets of Air Deccan and Kingfisher as their ticket cancellation charges were nominal. When the airlines increased their cancellation charge to Rs 450 in 2007, he switched to Jet Airways, which then had a cancellation charge of Rs 100, said joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.        
	While cancelling a Jet Airways ticket online, he noticed that the server was taking a few minutes to process the request. On a hunch, he sent a help to cancel a ticket from the airline counter while he cancelled the ticket online from home. The plan worked and double the price of the ticket was credited in his account, added the joint commissioner.         
	Between August 2008 and February 2010, Kishanpuria made around Rs 2.9 crore buying and cancelling 618 executive class Jet Airways tickets.        
	The fraud came to light during an audit of the airlines accounts.         
	The computer used by Kishanpuria for his online transactions was seized from his home on Indra Biswas Road in Tallah in north Calcutta.        
	The City College graduate spent the Rs 2.9 crore he had allegedly defrauded to buy gold jewellery online. He then sold the ornaments to get cash in return, said an investigator.

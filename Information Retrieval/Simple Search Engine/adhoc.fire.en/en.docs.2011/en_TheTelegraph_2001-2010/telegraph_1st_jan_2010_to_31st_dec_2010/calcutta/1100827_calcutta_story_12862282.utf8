                      Music rewind                    This is a concert he last did many years ago. The singer with his guitar and song. After trying his hand at new sounds and experimenting with rock and electric in the last few years, Bertie Da Silva promises to return to the roots of his music, stripping his sound down to its most elemental form. The subtleties of acoustic guitar, voice and occasional harmonica will be followed by music that rips and explodes as friend Amyt Datta joins in on his acoustic guitar and Willie Walters with his double bass. Fun, mayhem and carnival for all music lovers  thats what tomorrow nights do is all about! Bertie In Acoustic Concert is presented by t2, Vodafone and Patton, in association with Someplace Else and Selvel.                    Event: Music concert by Bertie Da Silva and friends When: August 28 at 7 pm Where: ICCR auditorium,

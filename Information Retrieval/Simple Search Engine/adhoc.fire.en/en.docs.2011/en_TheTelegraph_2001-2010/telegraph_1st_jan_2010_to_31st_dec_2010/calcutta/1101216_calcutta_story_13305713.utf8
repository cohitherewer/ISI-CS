                     Exam no-show: The report Students boycott block exam, November 20, pained me greatly. I remember how much we wanted to study at Jadavpur   University but those who are studying there do not even bother to sit for exams.     Asit Kumar Bhattacharya,
  Bidhan Sishu Sarani		                        
	What I have lost on the rally day are             
	(What did you lose/gain from Wednesdays rallies?, November 25):           
	 Hope of living in a city free of political rallies that wreck the daily life of the common man           
	 Faith in the political parties and the administration of the past, present and future           
	What I gained on the rally day are:           
	 Despair of living in a city where I do not know how and when I can reach home at the end of a days work           
	 Mental strength to accept the reality that we will not be able to complete any important task outdoors on a day political rallies are held.           
	Jaya Ghosh,           
	Dr Sarat Banerjee Road                     
	It seems Calcutta will never change for the better (Road or campus, held to ransom, December 1). Law-abiding citizens will have to live with rallies, roadblocks, hawker raj, strikes and other handicaps that characterise Bimaru Bengal.           
	A.S. Mehta,           
	New Alipore                     
	Political parties will never stop holding the city to ransom because we, the common people, tolerate everything. A handful, with the support and protection of police, are hence powerful enough to put the city out of gear for hours.           
	At times, two to three rallies are organised on the same day without any thought on how the commuter will suffer. Most of the rallies do not attract more than a hundred. Arent the leaders scared that the millions they inconvenience would one day want to overthrow them?           
	Raj Bagri,           
	Behala                               
	The decision to ban Maruti Omnis as pool cars has certain fallacies (Pool car crash kills, injures, November 13). The car is allowed to operate as an ambulance and taxis.             
	Instead of banning the use of Maruti Omnis as pool cars, the government needs to ban the car totally if it thinks the vehicle is not good enough for the Indian road.           
	From my experience I can say, it is not the models of the pool cars but the way they are driven that causes accidents.           
	I would suggest special workshops for drivers. The government has to ensure that pool car drivers complete their training properly before they get their licence.           
	Ranajit Mukherjee,           
	Park Circus                               
	The proposal to introduce discipline as a subject seems to hold promise (Enter, discipline in class, November 10). The plan could dispense with the need for physical and verbal punishment. Also, it provides students an opportunity to take up social work. Schools should ensure that marks are deducted according to the type of offence. But enforcement of discipline should not be so strict that students cannot enjoy themselves.             
	Oishimaya Sen,           
	Tollygunge                     
	Disciplining should start from home and parents play an important role in this. Teachers should also know what it means to be disciplined. The main aim is to work as a team with students. Parents and teachers should counsel and not use force.           
	A.K. Mukherjee ,           
	Address not given                               
	Kudos to Metro for reporting about corruption in the public vehicles department (Teen gets licence to kill, October 25). The condition at Burdwan district motor vehicles department is no better than at the Beltola PVD. The nexus between officials, touts and cops have made it a haven for licence-for-a-bribe.             
	Lack of inspection officers is often the excuse given by the department heads to explain the lax policing. If the preliminary processing of applications is done online, touts might disappear.           
	Subhankar Mukherjee,

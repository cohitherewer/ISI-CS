The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Students blink first, eye return to class
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Students blink first, eye return to class
          OUR BUREAU                                          
	The engineering students of Jadavpur University blinked first in their battle of attrition with the authorities and withdrew their class boycott on Friday.        
	The climbdown follows a rare tough stand taken by the university rsquo;s executive council, which ruled out talks on the academic impasse till the students joined classes.  
	 ldquo;The council members unanimously observed that there is an immediate need to restore normal academic activity on the campus. The students should immediately lift their agitation and join classes, rdquo; JU vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh said after the meeting.  
	The Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students rsquo; Union (Fetsu), which had orchestrated the boycott of the semester exams and regular classes, hurriedly convened a meeting of its general body on Friday evening. The decision to lift the boycott was announced soon after.  
	 ldquo;We will withdraw our boycott and attend classes from Monday, rdquo; said a Fetsu leader.  
	After boycotting the semester exams, held between November 19 and December 4, the students had refused to attend classes from December 7, when the new semester began.  
	The executive council had cancelled its earlier meeting on November 19, citing ldquo;lack of academic environment rdquo; on the JU campus.  
	Several teachers, past and present, had complained to Metro earlier that things had come to such a pass because the authorities had made it a habit to buckle under pressure from the students.  
	 ldquo;This time, we wanted to convey a firm message mdash; that the fixed academic calendar of the university could not be played around with, rdquo; said Partha Pratim Biswas, a member of the executive council.  
	He was among those council members held hostage by the students in September for 50 hours at a stretch. The authorities rsquo; decision to install CCTV cameras for greater security on the campus had triggered the protest.  
	 ldquo;We had no option but to put our foot down at some point. Enough was enough, rdquo; said a senior teacher.  
	Although none of the 3,000 engineering students turned up for the November 19 to December 4 semester exams, the teachers went to the exam hall every day and sat through the three hours in empty classrooms. The message was clear mdash; the exam was being held on schedule and it was up to the students to turn up.  
	Having skipped the entire exams, the students are likely to lose a year unless the authorities throw them a lifeline.  
	The vice-chancellor said that once the boycott was withdrawn, the engineering and technology faculty council of the institution would convene a meeting and discuss how to end the stalemate.  
	 ldquo;But the students will have to ensure that they maintain discipline on the campus. The faculty council will consider the grievances of the students only after we find that they are not disrupting normal academic activities or spoiling the academic environment by shouting slogans and skipping classes, rdquo; said Ghosh.  
	The students had been protesting the police lathicharge on November 9 during chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee rsquo;s visit to unveil an auditorium. The executive council on Friday decided to set up a two-member committee to probe the incident.  
	 ldquo;We are satisfied that the authorities have finally ordered an inquiry to probe the police lathicharge on the students holding a peaceful demonstration on November 9, rdquo; said a Fetsu leader.  
	Should campus authorities learn from the JU model and act tough?

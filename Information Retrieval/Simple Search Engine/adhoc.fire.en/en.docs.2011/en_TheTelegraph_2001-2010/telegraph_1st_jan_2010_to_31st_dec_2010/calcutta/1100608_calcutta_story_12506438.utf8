The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal floors come up in dead of night
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Illegal floors come up in dead of night

	The promoter of a south Calcutta apartment block blacklisted by the municipal corporation for violating norms has been allegedly adding floors in the dead of night with the entire locality aware of it except the cops and the councillor.        
	According to official records, the four-storeyed structure with a few families already inhabiting the first floor is the second illegal building to come up on the two-cottah plot at 44A in Abdul Halim Lane, under ward 62 off AJC Bose Road.         
	Officials of the CMC confirmed issuing a red card against the building last month and lodging an FIR with Taltala police station to ensure that construction didnt resume, but residents of the area said the top three floors were fast nearing completion.        
	Sources said 44A, ringed by private buildings, would come alive after dusk with construction workers armed with torches toiling through the night. We were given to understand that a police team would keep watch but there is not a cop in sight, complained a resident.        
	Debashis Manna, the executive engineer of buildings in Borough VI, said the onus was on Taltala police station to stop further construction based on the FIR lodged by the CMC. We had instructed the police to provide round-the-clock surveillance so that construction work at the site didnt resume, the official said.        
	The police did arrest the owner of the plot, Philomena Lipika Gomes, on May 29 on the basis of the FIR but construction hasnt stopped yet, insist residents.        
	The police also havent been able to pinpoint the promoter of the building, though a few names are being flung around. We have picked up some workers from the site but the realtor who is behind the illegal construction is still unidentified. Being a remote alley in a congested ward, it becomes difficult for us to keep a 24-hour watch on the plot, claimed an officer at Taltala police station.         
	Re-elected councillor Iqbal Ahmed initially pleaded ignorance about a building being illegally constructed in his ward despite a CMC red card and a police case against the unidentified promoter.         
	I do not know that the construction at 44A Abdul Halim Lane has been declared illegal; neither have I received a complaint from any resident regarding the illegal nature of the building. The CMC informs the police about such discrepancies but doesnt notify the local councillor. I was busy with the civic polls over the past few weeks. I will look into the matter as soon as possible, he told Metro.        
	Ahmed, who later visited 44A and spoke to CMC officials, admitted on Monday that the construction was illegal. As of now, I can assure you that work at the site has been stopped, he said.        
	Lipika Gomess mother, the late Laxmi Gomes, was the owner of the original two-storeyed building at 44A. The CMC declared the structure illegal and ordered its demolition in 2005 after Laxmi allegedly fell off the first floor and died. The Gomes family left the area soon after and the plot remained vacant until October last year, when realtor Subhajit Sharma, alias Sonu, allegedly took possession of the property to build the apartment block.        
	One of the violations is apparently the width of the lone approach to the plot. The road is a four-foot narrow lane with open sewers on one side. There is no way an ambulance can enter this skinny alley, forget a fire brigade engine, in the event of an emergency, a CMC official pointed out.        
	When Metro visited the site last Saturday evening, there was no policeman on duty to prevent construction from resuming.         
	The apartment block, with its first floor occupied, looked well on its way to completion with cement bags, sand and rods piled near the entrance. A game of carrom was in progress in a shed, the board illuminated by a bulb whose power source was a nearby street light connection.

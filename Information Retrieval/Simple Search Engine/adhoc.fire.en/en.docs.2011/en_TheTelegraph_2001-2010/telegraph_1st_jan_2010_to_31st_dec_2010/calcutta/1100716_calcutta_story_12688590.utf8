The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fake HRD envoy missing
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fake HRD envoy missing
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Ramesh Bhattacharjee                                  
	Ramesh Bhattacharjee, who had entered La Martiniere for Boys claiming to be a representative of the human resource development ministry, has been absconding since the high court rejected his plea for anticipatory bail on Tuesday, police said.        
	A team from the detective department raided Bhattacharjees house on Ultadanga Main Road on Wednesday night but had to return empty-handed.        
	He has been absconding since the high court rejected his anticipatory bail plea on Tuesday. We decided to conduct the raid immediately after the plea was turned down, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Bhattacharjee, accompanied by two others, had visited the Loudon Street campus on June 23 and asked the authorities for a report on the death of Class VIII student Rouvanjit Rawla, who was found hanging at home four days after being caned by principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi.        
	The police have lodged a case of impersonation and misuse of national emblem against Bhattacharjee, who had flashed an identity card bearing the symbol to claim that he was from the HRD ministry.        
	The ministry later denied having sent anyone to probe Rawlas death.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), said a search was on for Bhattacharjee.        
	Sources said the Ultadanga house had been under police vigil since Wednesday night. He did not return home last night. Neighbours, too, gave us the same report. It seems Bhattacharjee has realised that he would be in trouble if he returns, said another officer.        
	Sleuths said the high courts decision to reject Bhattacharjees plea for anticipatory bail had left them with no option but to arrest him.        
	The two men who had accompanied Bhattacharjee during the visit were Anthony Arun Biswas, the president of the All India Minorities and Weaker Sections Council, and Dilip Datta, a retired deputy secretary in the school education department.

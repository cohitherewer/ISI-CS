          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Promoter Anup Ray, who was abducted on Tuesday and released the day after against a ransom of Rs 7 lakh, has been suspended from the CPM for his lifestyle that the party thinks is unbecoming of a communist.        
	Ray had headed a local committee of the CPM before being appointed secretary of a branch committee.        
	Raghunath Kushari, the secretary of the partys Calcutta district committee, said on Thursday that Ray had been suspended from the party and an inquiry started against him.        
	We have acted on the basis of some reports and suspended him. An inquiry into his activities has begun, Kushari said.        
	CPM sources said most of the district committee members had favoured Rays suspension on the ground that his lifestyle did not match communist ideals. The move is part of the partys rectification drive.        
	We have been hearing complaints about his lifestyle for the past two years. His realty ventures and his associations, too, are questionable, said a CPM state committee member.        
	According to him, the partys state secretariat has ratified the decision to suspend Ray. State secretary Biman Bose and two other secretariat members had categorically said that action should be taken against him, the state committee member added.        
	While the political fallout of the abduction drama was unfolding, cops said they had found a bag containing ornaments that Rays family members had thrown from a local train near Subhashgram, in South 24-Parganas, to secure his release.        
	The bag contained four gold bangles and a gold chain, together worth Rs 1.25 lakh. The family members have confirmed that the ornaments belong to them, said S.N. Gupta, DIG, presidency range.        
	As told by the abductors, Rays wife Sangeeta and three other women had thrown two bags, one containing jewellery and the other cash, from the train early on Wednesday. Ray was set free minutes later.        
	The realtor allegedly told the sleuths on Thursday that a woman he had a property dispute with nine years ago might have plotted the abduction. He also named one of the purported abductors, who is an extortionist, said an officer.        
	The sleuths claimed to have found discrepancies in Rays assets and bank accounts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ward that had it best
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ward that had it best
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The mayors ward is arguably the part of the city that benefited the most in terms of civic services in the past five years. So much so that even the Trinamul Congress candidate from Ramgarh, Amitava Banerjee, has said that if other areas were developed similarly, Calcutta could become London.        
	The statement must have pleased his opponent, CPM candidate Dipak Kumar Nag, who seeks to follow Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas giant footsteps.         
	Before the last civic elections, residents of ward 100  bounded by Garia bridge, Ganguly Bagan crossing and Raja Subodh Mullick Road  used to carry home bottles of filtered water from office so that they did not have to use the hard groundwater for cooking. Now most of them get supply from Garden Reach waterworks in the morning.        
	Eighty per cent of the roads, streets and lanes in the ward were kutcha five years ago. Now passages barely a few feet wide have a top-coat of bitumen.        
	Halogen lamps have replaced traditional ones on light posts that were non-existent in pockets of Naktala, Baishnabghata and Lakshminarayan colony an election back.        
	Manhole covers still go missing as often as they did a decade ago but are usually replaced in 36 hours, according to residents. Stolen manhole covers worth over Rs 10 lakh have been replaced in the past four years, said an engineer of borough X.        
	According to civic sources, funds from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters footed the bill of most of the development projects. The borough office only paid for maintenance work.        
	Nags detractors claim that the mayor pursued the development projects despite opposition from his party. The buzz on the street is that Bhattacharyya shifted to Kalikapur two and a half years back over differences of opinion with CPM workers in the area.        
	Bhattacharyya, however, said he changed residences for professional reasons. Did he succeed in developing his ward? I cannot claim 100 per cent success because the area is still without a ward health unit, stated the mayor.         
	All residents of Ramgarh will receive supply of filtered water only after a reservoir is commissioned at Ranikuthi, he added.        
	We would give him 60 out of 100. I doubt whether the momentum of development can be sustained in his absence, said Saswati Sarkar of Lakshminarayan colony.        
	Banerjee is banking on water to win the poll.         
	People in some pockets of Ramgarh are getting water from Garden Reach not because of Bhattacharyya but former Trinamul mayor Subrata Mukherjee. The distribution line for Garden Reach waterworks was laid while Mukherjee was at the helm, he pointed out.

										      AUTUMN FLUSH                        A will made in 1798 by William Hare				                           
	M. Spade, William Hare, Richard Norman, Parah Hall, Peter Cochrance, Alexander Colvin, William Ainslee and others, Mrs Sarah Tottie, Francis Botelho, Edwin Benjamin Goodall, Marie Louise, Thomas Malcolm, Ralph Bource, B.L. Gupta, Henry Morly, Mary Malcolm, E.A.N. Langdon, W.A. Halson, Mrs Ezekiel, S.J. Jacob Judah Ezekiel, Miss Rebecca, R.M. Ezra. What follows is a bunch of recognisably Indian names: Bengali, Sindhi, Marwari.         
	Who were these people and why am I mesmerised by their names? They owned or leased a property in the heart of central Calcutta, behind the Indian Museum, with which I have been familiar all my life. In the Fifties of the last century it was a gracious old bungalow.         
	On the side as you entered were the stables (without horses), on the left an old gnarled mango tree into which children had for a long time built steps to the top. It produced mangoes, entirely tasteless and lacking in flavour but neighbourhood kids would climb the tree and taste them anyway. Its trunk served as wickets when they played cricket and the goalpost for hockey or football. At another corner of this plot was a huge simul (silk cotton) tree.         
	The play area (which must once have been a manicured lawn) would be covered with its bright red flowers in February and the fruit yielded enough soft silken cotton for pillows for children later in the summer. A large guava tree that might have produced guavas of a good quality stood at another corner of the compound except that they disappeared before they ever attained any sort of maturity.         
	To reach the house itself, you went up six marble steps into a large verandah that still had the wherewithal to hold and operate punkahs though when I saw it there were electric fans everywhere. The house sprawled into rooms and bathrooms. Kitchens and tubewells for water were on the side and the rear of the building. I have heard it housed as many as 150 people in troubled times in the late Forties of the last century.         
	Lease and sale deeds, wills and probates for the property go back to 1794. A will made in 1798 by Hare confers his soul to God, his body to dust and property to his wife.         
	In the period between 1794 and 1914 they are in exquisite copperplate handwriting, on paper that is in shreds. The rest were typed on heavy duty typewriters. They make fascinating reading. Most of all I (as usual) love the womens names in the list. Did they own the property in their own right or were they inheritors?        
	The name of Sarah Tottie is particularly interesting. She purchased it in 1814 from Alexander Colvin and then her name disappears from the list. Strangely the name survives today in the lane just behind the property (Totties Lane) which now houses various shops and godowns. I imagine her as a much-loved lady who allowed the local children free run of her property, a woman who planted trees, sat in the verandah and looked out at them playing on the lawn. Or did she herself live in style and carry on a nefarious business in the lane behind?         
	Equally intriguing is a bunch of Jewish names at the end of the list, particularly Ms Rebecca Ezra. Did she also own Ezra House on nearby Kyd Street, now the Central Drugs Laboratory? The park around Ezra House was actually thrown open to children in the evenings in the old days. It housed colourful parakeets, talking parrots, a zebra, an ancient brown owl and a huge turtle (Galapagos?) on which children would take rides. I remember these vividly.         
	High-rise concrete buildings housing hotels, laboratories, factories, workshops, shops and offices have taken over this once comfortably gracious and cosmopolitan area. I guess its the price we pay for modernity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Varsity fails to crack the code
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Varsity fails to crack the code
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A proposed model code of conduct for student elections that Calcutta University has put in cold storage could have prevented Thursdays flare-up at Asutosh College and similar skirmishes on campuses across the city.         
	With both the CPM and Trinamul desperate to bolster their student strength before the 2011 big fight, it was almost certain that the rivalry would hit campuses during the November-February poll season. So its surprising that the university didnt take pre-emptive action, said a teacher at Asutosh College, which witnessed violence that robbed a student of vision in one eye on Thursday.        
	The draft code contains a clause granting the university the right to intervene at any stage of student elections. Although Thursdays incident was not directly related to polls, the unrest in Asutosh College over the past few days could have been controlled had the university implemented the code, the teacher said.        
	The West Bengal State Council of Higher Education had proposed the code six months ago but it is yet to be placed before the universitys syndicate, its highest policy-making body.        
	In the absence of a strict code of conduct, Calcutta University can now intervene in poll-related matters only if the college head seeks help. We are not denying that student polls can be conducted better once the code is implemented, vice-chancellor Suranjan Das admitted on Friday.        
	So why hasnt it been implemented? According to him, the code needs to be examined thoroughly to avoid legal complications later. Our legal officers have advised us to implement the code only after amending the university statutes. That will take some time, argued Das.        
	College principals feel that a code would have helped keep things under control, if not insulate campuses from the heat of the political battle outside.         
	Several city institutions  Jagabandhu College, Sarsuna College, Garia College, Charuchandra College, Maheshtala College, Thakurpukur Vivekananda College and Manindra College, to name a few  have been witnessing unrest over the past few weeks.

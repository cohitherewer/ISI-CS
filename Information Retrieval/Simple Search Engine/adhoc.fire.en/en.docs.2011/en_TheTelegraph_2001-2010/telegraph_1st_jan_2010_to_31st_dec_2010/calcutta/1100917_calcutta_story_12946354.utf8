          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE AND TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          A girl in the school bus being brought to hospital. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	3.15pm. A Qualis stopped in front of Charnock Hospital and four air hostesses got off with two boys bleeding from the head.        
	Our employees, alerted by air hostesses cries for help, immediately carried the boys to the emergency ward, recalled a hospital official.        
	We sent an ambulance as soon as the air hostesses told us about the Rajarhat accident involving a school bus. The group guided the ambulance to the mishap spot, the official added.        
	The other injured  three students and a teacher of Delhi Public School Megacity and a motorist  were later brought to the hospital in the ambulance and two taxis.        
	Hospital officials said the five injured students  Agniva Kole (Class VIII), Sayantan Sarkar (Class V), Satadru Dey (Class X), Archita Ghosh (Class III) and Sukalpa Nath (Class VII)  were treated for head, hand and shoulder injuries. They were later released from the hospital.        
	The teacher, Suman Duggal, 29, was injured in the spine, head and shoulders. She was released in the evening.        
	Only the biker, Shankar Jana, 27, was critically injured and is admitted in the ICU. A CT scan of his brain has been performed, said Saibal Mitra, a consultant physician at the hospital.        
	Doctors said Agniva had received five stitches on his forehead, Sayantan eight on his head and forehead and Satadru three stitches. I cant speak. I am suffering from a severe headache, was all Satadru could murmur on his way back home.        
	Agnivas father Avijit said: My son is complaining of headache and hallucination. He is still in trauma and can hardly speak.        
	Parents and relatives who rushed to the hospital accused the school of negligence, though principal Indrani Sanyal kept saying: The injuries are very minor and our driver was not at fault.        
	The father of an injured student said the driver should have been more alert. We are lucky that our children have escaped with bruises and stitches. It could well have been a disaster. The school cannot shrug off its responsibility. It should conduct a thorough probe and ask the drivers to be more alert.        
	Principal Sanyal, who was at the hospital, denied the allegation of negligence.        
	The bus was not overloaded, nor was the driver inexperienced. It was a simple case of accident for which the driver was not responsible. The school has taken proper care of the children and arranged for their treatment. We informed parents about the accident as soon as we heard about it, Sanyal said.

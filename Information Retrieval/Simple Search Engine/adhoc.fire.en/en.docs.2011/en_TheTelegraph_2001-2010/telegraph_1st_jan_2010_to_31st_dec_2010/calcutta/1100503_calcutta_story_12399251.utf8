          RITH BASU                          Team India celebrates an Afghanistan wicket at Gros Islet on Saturday. (AP)                                  
	Move over purple Knights, the men in blue are here. Calcuttans have put behind the disappointment of the KKR show in IPL 3 to raise a cheer for their favourite cricketing outfit: Team India.        
	The towering sixes that flew off the Indian bats against newbies Afghanistan and seasoned South Africa has only fuelled hopes of the fans for a second World Twenty20 crown.        
	When the hopes of Souravs boys of making it to the IPL semi-finals for the first time fizzled out even before the last game, I had started supporting Sachins team. But when it comes to my country, I am too passionate to cheer anyone else even if India is thrown out of the competition, said Rajib Das, 31, an executive in a tech company.        
	The fans are more involved also because they feel the matches would be more intense. Bengal U-22 cricketer Jayojit Basu put it in perspective. Unlike in the IPL, you definitely wont see Chris Gayle smiling sheepishly at the batsman after being struck for a six. He would be all fired up, he said.         
	Many agree. The IPL matches were almost friendly ones. World Twenty20 is the real thing, said a student of St Xaviers College, who has been staying up to watch all the matches.        
	He is not alone. Interior designer Sonali Sarkar, 37, who sat through most IPL matches plans to do the same for Team Indias encounters in the Caribbean. There is no Calcutta connect anymore after Souravs retirement but then there was none when I started watching cricket, she said.        
	But would she miss Bollywood? Only Shah Rukh Khan, she said.        
	Bengal Under-19 player Arijit Banerjee said Bollywood would not let itself be missed and tinsel town stars would turn up in the Caribbean islands to cheer the team.        
	Ask the Calcuttan who his IPL heroes were and the answers predictably are Sachin and Sourav, in that order.         
	And who would they miss in the World Cup? Its Sachin again.        
	With Virender Sehwag out of the tournament, the opening slots are a worry, especially with Gautam Gambhir too not doing well at the moment. Sachin could have played a huge role in the tournament, rued Baguiati homemaker Ananya Roy.        
	Amid the craving for veterans who wont walk out in the Team India blue anymore, the city is unanimous that Robin Uthappa and Saurabh Tiwari might be missed, going by their IPL form.

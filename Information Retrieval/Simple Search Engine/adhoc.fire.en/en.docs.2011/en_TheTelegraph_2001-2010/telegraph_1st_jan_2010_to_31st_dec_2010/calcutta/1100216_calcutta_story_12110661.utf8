                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      All is well as GenX bats for Test     Spirited show of young loyalists

	Sachin Tendulkar is wobbly on 97. As a Wayne Parnell delivery raps him on the pads, the Eden Gardens lets out a collective gasp. Then a hush. Till a voice from amid a gang of youngsters in the club house lower tier rings out loud, Aal Izz Well, drawing laughter and soothing nerves.        
	If Day 2 of the India-South Africa Test saw Eden filling up despite it being a Monday, it was thanks largely to GeNext, who seemed just as much at home here as they would when filling up cinemas screening 3 Idiots or stadiums playing T20.        
	Take Arnab Banik. The engineering student had taken the 6.40am Burdwan local to come all the way from Konnagar in Hooghly. Its too crucial a match. Our team needs all the support, he said.        
	As if to thank the young and the restless for their continued support of the longest version of the game, Mondays menu served up the best possible advertisement for Test cricket  over 350 runs being scored for the loss of six wickets and youth icons Sachin and Virender Sehwag stroking the South African attack to all parts of Eden.        
	No wonder Urmi Ojha, who had bunked college to come to the ground with her father, was all smiles. The worlds top two teams are competing for the top slot and India has had a great day. It cant get better than this, gushed the first-year student of Loreto College. Nothing beats watching a match live. The Sehwag fans among my friends will be so jealous, said the Eden debutante.        
	Sachin fans like Sreyoshi Ghosh, 22, had come to see the master play what might be his last Test at the Eden. With yet another Mexican wave sweeping the stands, Sreyoshi said she would return for the IPL, but little could match the satisfaction of a good day of Test cricket at the Eden for her.        
	Test cricket is clearly working as a sieve in the stands, straining out the men from the boys. I am more into the five-day format, shrugged second-year computer science student Anubhab Sahin.        
	IPL has more masala with Bollywood joining in, but Test cricket has all the class, added Sushobhan Chowdhury, a 24-year-old trainee in a financial firm, who supports the KKR more for Sourav Ganguly than for Shah Rukh Khan.        
	The Test team among GenX fans is often outnumbered and outshouted by the growing clamour for instant cricket. Most of my friends tell me that its so boring to sit out a whole day without a result, but I dont care, smiled Urmi.        
	It was this indomitable and infectious spirit of the youth at the Eden on Monday that probably drew the South African players wives and girlfriends (WAGS) out of the air-conditioned confines of the VIP box and into the roar of the rank and file.        
	The atmosphere is unbelievable. We have seen cricket around the world, but with such big crowds coming in were having the most fun here, smiled Sue Erasmus, the light-haired girlfriend of J.P. Duminy.        
	The one chant that united young Calcuttans and South Africans at the Eden? Aal Izz Well with Test cricket.

  - FOUR-DAY EXHIBITION HIGHLIGHTS THE BEST FROM SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES          ADITI RAY                          A participant explains his project to visitors at the Eastern India Science and Engineering Fair, held at BITM from January 12 to 16.Picture by Aranya Sen              
	For Sandip Gupta, the difficulties of navigating an unknown city were secondary to getting right his project on the utilisation of hydroelectric power for transporting water to high altitudes.         
	Soumik Hati had designed a wireless smoke alarm system. In case of a fire, a metal strip will expand, completing the circuit that will set off the alarm, explained the Class VII student of Burdwan Municipal High School.        
	Sandip, a Class XII student of Government Senior Secondary School, in Namchi, Sikkim, and Soumik were participants at the Eastern India Science and Technological Fair at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, held from January 12 to 16.        
	I spent six months on the project. I would like to implement it in my town if I receive infrastructural support, said Sandip.         
	A variety of experiments, from demonstrating the movement of the earths tectonic plates, an automatic system of street lighting to a paper recycling project, found place at the fair. The participants, from 11 eastern states, included 180 schools, eight science clubs and 14 science and engineering colleges.        
	Among the projects by colleges were a wireless alarm system by Techno India, Salt Lake, and a waste water management project by Haldia Institute of Technology.        
	Rajdip Bhowmik of Bir Bikram Institution, Dharmanagar, Tripura, was declared the winner for the best individual exhibit, for his project on measuring the surface tension of liquids, in the science section. Diptojyoti Panja and Arkajit Mondol, from Patha Bhavan, Visva-Bharati, received the best group exhibit prize. All three received scholarships of Rs 250 per month for two years.        
	In the engineering section, reserved for colleges, the winner was a project on a chair for the handicapped, by students of Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology. They each received a scholarship of Rs 1,000 per month for a year.        
	An automatic railway gate crossing system by MCKV Institute of Engineering, Howrah, was declared the best applied technology project, with the participants receiving Rs 500 each per month for a year.         
	Said Faisal Khan, a Class IX student of St Xaviers School, Purulia: I learned more by observing the experiments at the fair than I do from textbooks. I wish we had more of such fairs for students.  
	CHIT CHAT  
	Beyond syllabus  
	Indira Gandhi Memorial High School, Dum Dum celebrated its 25th anniversary with a colourful carnival from January 30 to February 1.  
	The highlight was an exhibition by the four houses. While Red house offered insights into the human anatomy, Blue took us on a tour of India, Yellow showcased global warming and Green designed a model town equipped with good infrastructure.   
	Games stalls like Treasure Hunt, Lock and Key, Tail the Horse and Fortune Pot were the most popular. A fashion show by the senior school was a hit with the young crowd.   
	All branches of the school, including Barasat and Brijdham, attended the carnival. Said the rector of the school, Manan Ojha: ldquo;We have many programmes lined up in which students will get to explore beyond the syllabus. The valedictory ceremony for the school rsquo;s silver jubilee celebration will take place on January 18 next year. rdquo;

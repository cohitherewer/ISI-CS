                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Walk for four-legged friends

	City celebrities are taking to the streets with their pet dogs to show how much they care for our four-legged friends.        
	Fifty familiar faces from all walks of life will take part along with their pets in a walk in and around Victoria Memorial from 3pm on February 6 for the cause.        
	The walk is the first initiative of Karuna, a project by Debasree Roy Foundation that is being supported by Prabha Khaitan Foundation.        
	The actress, who was moved by reports of dog abuse, hopes to spread awareness and contribute to wellbeing of canines by organising the walk.        
	Roy said Dona Ganguly and her daughter Sana were likely to take part in the event.        
	Roys Tollywood colleague Sabyasachi Chakraborty said: Such an initiative was needed for a long time. Animals are also a part of society.         
	We will start by vaccinating 100 dogs in the first three months. Animal birth control is next on our agenda. We would also like to set up a burial ground and push for an amendment to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, said Rana Ganguly of Lake Markets Moitri Veterinary Clinic, which is supporting the project.        
	On the anvil is an animal shelter built over five cottahs in Tangra. Two animal lovers had donated land for the project, said Roy.

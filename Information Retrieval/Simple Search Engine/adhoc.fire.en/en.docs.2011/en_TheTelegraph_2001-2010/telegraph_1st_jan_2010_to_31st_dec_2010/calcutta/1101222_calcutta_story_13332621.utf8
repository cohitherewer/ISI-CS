                      An intricate matrix of relationships                    As part of Nandikars ongoing 27th National Theatre Festival, Himachal Cultural Research Forum amp; Theatre Repertory (HCRFTR) will stage Vijay Tendulkars acclaimed play, Sakharam Binder this evening. This is perhaps Tendulkars most intensely naturalistic play. Its protagonist, Sakharam, is a book-binder by profession who scorns and abhors the institution of marriage. Instead, he indulges in contractual cohabitation, based on convenience, with destitute women who have either been abandoned by their husbands or have walked out on them. He turns religious and domesticated when he is with Lakshmi. Yet, in his association with Champa he transforms into a sensuous, lewd drunkard, who is totally obsessed with sexual enjoyment.Through the delineation of this character, Tendulkar explores the manifestation of physical lust and violence in a human being. He portrays the basic and essential complexity of human nature, which is neither black nor white, but varying shades of grey. The play weaves an intricate matrix of inter-relationships among its characters. When it was first performed in 1974, the play was banned by the Government of Maharashtra. The Bombay High Court, however, in a vindication of the right of free expression, struck down the ban. Since then, it has been translated from the original Marathi into several other Indian languages, as well as into English, and has been performed thousands of times by hundreds of theatre groups all over the world. Directed by Suresh Sharma.  Event: Sakharam Binder  play in Hindi by HCRFTR When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

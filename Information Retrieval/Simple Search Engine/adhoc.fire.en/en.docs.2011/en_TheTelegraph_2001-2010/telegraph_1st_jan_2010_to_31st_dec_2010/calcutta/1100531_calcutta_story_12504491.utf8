          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sandip Sharma, a paramilitary jawan who allegedly shot at a CPM supporter on Sunday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                         
	Civic elections in the city and its suburbs were marked by sporadic incidents of violence none of which claimed life.        
	At Baishnabghata Patuli in South 24-Parganas, a paramilitary force jawan fired at a CPM worker outside a booth, while he was allegedly trying to rig votes.         
	Arabinda Dhar, 38, who was hit on his left thigh, was admitted to a private hospital on the EM Bypass, where his condition was stable. CPM supporters ransacked the booth, Kendua Mahendranath Girls High School under ward 101, and damaged two electronic voting machines.        
	Residents said Dhar was bringing proxy voters to the booth since morning, ignoring the warnings of presiding officers. After an altercation around 2.45pm, Sandip Sharma of Tripura State Rifles fired at Dhar.         
	I have received a complaint against Sharma. Necessary steps will be taken after an inquiry. He has been suspended, said L.N Meena, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.         
	State election commissioner Mira Pande said there could be re-poll in the booth.        
	Md Miraz, 37, and Sheikh Nur Nabi, 35, sustained splinter injuries after some CPM supporters allegedly hurled two bombs at them in Metiabruz.         
	Forty-nine people were arrested across the city on Sunday for alleged disorderly conduct. Thirty-two people were detained in Salt Lake, where too the polling was largely peaceful.        
	A retired director-general of police, a retired electrical engineer, a former bureaucrat and a former port trust engineer, all members of an NGO called West Bengal Election Watch Committee, were detained when they allegedly tried to enter a polling station at Baisakhi. Many people who had lost their voter identity cards were not allowed to vote with the presiding officers reading out the rule book to them. I even went and lodged a general diary in the local police station, as the presiding officer asked me to, but was not allowed to vote even then, said Siddhartha Patodia of BJ Block.        
	Six persons were injured in clashes in the municipal polls in North 24-Parganas. Fifty-one people were arrested and two firearms seized.         
	Some hoodlums hurled two bombs at a polling station in ward 7 of Khardah Municipality after the polling was over, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas.

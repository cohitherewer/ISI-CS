The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girls bring tease to book
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girls bring tease to book
  - 36-year-old harasser arrested on Alipore campus complaint          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 36-year-old manager of a private firm has been arrested on the charge of teasing students of Calcutta Universitys Alipore campus.        
	Andrew Pradhan, who works in an interior decoration company in south Calcutta, was picked up on Wednesday evening following a complaint by two girls on the Belvedere Road campus.        
	Cops, including a couple of plainclotheswomen, have been posted outside the campus to keep an eye on road Romeos.        
	Vigil has been stepped up around the campus, especially in the afternoon and evening when the students return home. Our primary focus is on Belvedere Road which becomes deserted in the evening. Security has also been intensified outside the zoo as many people go there in winter, said an officer of Alipore police station.        
	Harassment has been on the rise around the campus for the past few months but the students were too scared to lodge a formal complaint. They instead would report the teasing to the police over the phone.        
	Fed up with the constant harassment, the two students went to the police station on January 6 and filed an FIR, alleging that a man on a scooter had been stalking them and making obscene gestures at them every afternoon.        
	The victims initially ignored the harassment and were afraid to approach us but their seniors urged them to lodge a complaint, the officer said.        
	The girls had mentioned the registration number of the scooter in the FIR, which helped the sleuths track down the owner.         
	But the man, who runs an interior decoration company on Sambhunath Pandit Road, said he had given his two-wheeler to his manager Andrew Pradhan.        
	The cops then zeroed in on Pradhan, who was later identified by the complainants.         
	A probe revealed that many students on the campus were harassed by Pradhan. He would sit on his scooter in front of the main gate every afternoon. Whenever he spotted a girl walking alone, he would stalk her and make lewd remarks and gestures before speeding away, said an investigating officer.        
	The accused, who is married, has been booked under Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman).        
	Since the offence is bailable, the accused was granted bail on Thursday. But if convicted, he can be sentenced to 12 months in jail and fined, the officer added.

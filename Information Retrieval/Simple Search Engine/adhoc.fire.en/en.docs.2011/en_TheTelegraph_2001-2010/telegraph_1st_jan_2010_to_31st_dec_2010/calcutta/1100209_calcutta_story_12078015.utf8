          SANJAY MANDAL                          Marlo                                  
	An international-level athletes dream run may come to an abrupt halt, thanks to empty promises and state apathy.         
	Somnath Marlo, a resident of Taherpur in Nadia district, has braved polio, leukaemia and poverty to win laurels in athletics at national and international meets. In 2002, he struck gold in high jump at the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled at Busan, South Korea. His latest feat was in September 2009, at the national sports meet for the physically challenged, where he won a gold in high jump.        
	The 27-year-old is currently undergoing treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia, a cancer of the white blood cells, at a private hospital in the city.         
	I had cleared 1.51 metres at the Busan meet, recalled Marlo, whose father sells eggs at Taherpur railway station.         
	After Busan, Marlo received Rs 5 lakh from the then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Prime Ministers Office also promised him a job. But that remained a promise.         
	Afflicted with polio since childhood, Marlo underwent training at the Sports Authority of India camp in Salt Lake from 2000 to 2006.        
	In 2003, he was detected with cancer. He has been put on targeted drug therapy, said Ashish Mukherjee, the medical director of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute in Calcutta. The institute and a medicine firm are supplying the drug to Marlo.        
	Desperate for a job, Marlo, who has completed his HS, had also approached chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees office. They asked me to contact the sports department. But the sports department sent me a letter stating we cant provide the kind of assistance you want, he said.        
	Marlo started working for a private firm in 2006 but his problems didnt end. My office schedule allows me to practise only two days a week. Also I dont get leave for joining SAI camps, rued the gold-winner.

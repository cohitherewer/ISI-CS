          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	A 30-something mother of two with killer looks and a sweet tongue, who was seen only in the best labels and with the latest phones, has landed in the lock-up for a con too many.         
	Priyanka Pugalia was picked up from her Monoharpukur Road home on Thursday morning for allegedly duping a boutique owner of Rs 80,000.        
	According to police, she had not only cheated other shop owners but also parents by promising seats in English-medium schools for their children and youths by offering to get them Sector V jobs. Her looks and way with words had fooled many into believing her.         
	Bedantika Roy, the owner of the boutique on Alipore Road, had lodged a police complaint in August stating that the cheque Priyanka had written as payment for a number of expensive saris had bounced.         
	Priyanka had initially claimed she would clear the dues in a day or two. Then she said she needed more time since her son was ill. The charade continued till it was clear that she was a cheat, said a police officer.        
	More skeletons had meanwhile started tumbling out of the closet. Cops who visited a flat on SN Roy Road in Behala that Priyanka had rented found she had duped several local youths before moving out. She had promised them Sector V jobs and taken Rs 12,000 from each as application money before leaving the area, said the officer.        
	The trail also led to a preparatory school in New Alipore. Priyanka had allegedly taken Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000 each from parents of several students to get them admitted in reputable English-medium schools in the city.        
	Neither the youths nor the parents had lodged police complaints. But since many had learnt about the incidents, Priyanka shifted to the Monoharpukur Road flat so that no one could trace her, the officer said.        
	There was more to follow. Even on Thursday afternoon, a man who owns a cellphone shop in Tollygunge approached us and claimed that Priyanka had taken away handsets worth Rs 85,000 from his store against a cheque that bounced. We have asked him to lodge a complaint, added the officer.        
	Cops have learnt that Priyankas husband had left her soon after their younger son was born five years ago. Since then she has been living with her mother.

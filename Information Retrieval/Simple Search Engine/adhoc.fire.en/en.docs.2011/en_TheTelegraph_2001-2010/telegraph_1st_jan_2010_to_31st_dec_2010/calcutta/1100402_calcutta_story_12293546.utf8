           Stephen Court on March 23. A Telegraph picture           
	Metro has highlighted the disasters waiting to happen buildings of Calcutta very well in the article Jurassic Park, (March 28). However, I would like to point out that the Jurassic Park depicted in Steven Spielbergs film of the same name was well-maintained and protected but the pictures of old buildings in Calcutta evoke horror. Our city needs immediate action. I would like to suggest a few steps that can be taken by residents in consultation with the CMC/builder/employer:             
	 Cable dressing           
	 Installing trip switches           
	 Installing proper transformers           
	 Checking the earthing parameters           
	 Structural repairs.           
	A.K. Sinha,
  Former deputy general manager, NTPC                     
	Apropos Jurassic Park, one hopes that the CMC, CESC and police read the article and take steps to ensure that old buildings change their wiring and get other repair work done so that the lives of tenants are not put at risk like in Stephen Court.           
	A similar exercise should be conducted at various malls and plazas that have sprung up in congested residential areas. In case of a fire, it would be impossible for fire tenders to reach these sites in time. Hence, it is imperative that firefighting arrangements are strengthened within malls.

	Apropos the questions raised by Somini Sen Dua in the article Why am I so glad to be alive?, March 31, I feel none of us ever bother about fire safety provisions at our workplace because we are so overwhelmed when we finally get a job after going through umpteen interviews!             
	Sen Dua wonders why she is not asking for the fire minister to resign. Well, thats possibly because we are more or less responsible for accidents such as the one at 18A Park Street. Do we ever try to find out about the safety measures in the buildings where we live or work? Do we ever complain to anyone even if we find faults in the safety measures? Do we care to protest against the ministers if we feel they are doing something wrong? We will only criticise the work of others but we will never lift a finger because that would mean hard work for us, the leisure-loving citizens!           
	Sulagna Das,
  Metropolitan Housing Society                     
	I am happy to learn that the writer, Somini Sen Dua, survived the Stephen Court disaster. Her rhetorical question should act as an eye-opener for all of us. It is time we learnt to be accountable for our actions.           
	The lack of preparedness to handle a disaster reflects poorly on our sense of commitment towards our work. Our complacency and laid-back attitude are responsible for the Stephen Court tragedy. We just overlook the possibility of a disaster and this chalta hai attitude ultimately spells doom.           
	Meenakshi Sanyal,
  Abinash Chandra Banerjee Lane                               
	In reply to the question Who is to blame for the Stephen Court blaze?, dated April 1, I feel that the main issue right now is how can we avoid an electrical fire. The caretakers of Stephen Court were taken into custody after the March 23 blaze but what can a couple of men do if funds are not provided to maintain such huge buildings by the owners or the occupiers association?             
	I feel the power supplier (CESC or the state grid) should make it mandatory for all buildings to ensure that all internal wires are well-maintained. If any discrepancy is noticed, the power line should be immediately snapped. This will be much more effective than slapping showcause notices by the civic authorities.           
	Dangling wires are a common sight in almost all old buildings. It should also become mandatory for all buildings to have a circuit breaker/trip switch (one which goes off automatically in case of a short-circuit or over load, which are the main causes of fire) instead of the manual ones. The designated official of the power supplier who visits buildings every month to note the meter readings can be given the responsibility of checking compliance to these rules.           
	All occupiers of a building should know about and have free access to the buildings mains as the first step to control a fire is to switch off the power.           
	Rakesh Bhatia,
  Loudon Street                     
	Metro has rightly asked Who is to blame for the Stephen Court fire. But I feel we should rather be asking who is not to blame! India has been a free country for 63 years, but I feel we are yet to realise what freedom means. We talk about right to education, womens rights and so on but what this country really needs is social protection and mollycoddling, which the present political parties cannot provide. Thus, we are all to blame for tragedies like the Stephen Court blaze. We will continue to cry and blame others for our plight, but we will never stand up and fend for ourselves.           
	Naresh Jain,
  Serampore, Hooghly                               
	Accidental fires cannot be totally avoided even with the most sophisticated fire-prevention systems. Only its impact can be minimised with the help of an effective fire protection system and prompt action by the fire brigade.             
	Unfortunately, in our city, the fire brigade is always late and even after reaching, they take a lot of time to start operations. Over the years, this department of the state government has become the worst performer.           
	The number of casualties at the Park Street fire could have been contained had the fire brigade reacted promptly. Incidentally, the fire brigade headquarters is just a two-minute drive from the blaze spot.           
	Again, it is extremely difficult for any government to ensure that all buildings in the city have adequate fire-safety precautions but it can at least ensure a proactive fire services that acts with lightning speed.

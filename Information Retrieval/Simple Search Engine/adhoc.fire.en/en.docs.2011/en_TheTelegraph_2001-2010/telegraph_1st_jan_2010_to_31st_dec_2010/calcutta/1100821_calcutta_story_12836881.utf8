          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The CPM-backed West Bengal Government College Teachers Association on Friday demanded the state government set up a university to which the 35 government colleges will be affiliated.         
	The teachers lobby had earlier tried to persuade the chief minister to upgrade Presidency College to an affiliating university that would have the government colleges under its fold.        
	The teachers also want the government to set up a college in Calcutta.         
	Teachers of government-run colleges who support the association took part in a rally on College Street on Friday afternoon to press their demands.        
	They later submitted their wish list to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	We had been demanding an affiliating state university for the government-run colleges for a long time. After the upgrade of Presidency College, the demand has become more relevant, said Debashis Sarkar, the secretary of the association.

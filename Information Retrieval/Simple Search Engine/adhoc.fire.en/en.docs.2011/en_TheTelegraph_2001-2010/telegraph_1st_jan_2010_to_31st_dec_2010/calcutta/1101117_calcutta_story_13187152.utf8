The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxi-ing time at terminal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Taxi-ing time at terminal
          SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI AND SANJAY MANDAL                                            
	A day after Diwali, Rahul Gupta landed from Delhi at 10.30pm. He was in the queue till midnight and more for that coveted slip of paper to get a pre-paid taxi. With him were his wife and three-month-old baby, who kept crying out of hunger and exhaustion till they reached their Rajarhat home at 12.40am.        
	Guwahati resident B. Gogoi arrived around 8.30pm and taking one look at the mayhem at the pre-paid taxi counter, decided against putting his wife and four-year-old daughter through it. For the next 30 minutes, Gogoi was seen running from one flying cab to another. Some refused to go by the meter, others blamed him for wanting to go to a suburb.        
	Who should the Guptas and Gogois and every victim of taxi trauma at the Calcutta airport blame?        
	The sole pre-paid counter at the airport is run by the Bengal Taxi Association (BTA), made untouchable by the strong arm of Citu. Add to that an apathetic airport administration, a state government hamstrung by red tape and ruled by the writ of unions.        
	Welcome to Calcutta airport, with no respite in sight.        
	In January 2010, Kolkata Call Taxi Private Ltd, which runs Mega Cabs, had sent a proposal to the Calcutta airport bosses requesting permission to set up a radio taxi booth. Mega Cabs runs such services in airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore.        
	The reply? Hmmmmmm.        
	After eight months, the company sent another letter to the airport authorities, a copy of which is with Metro.        
	The reply? Silence.        
	On November 8, Binod Mishra, a senior official of Mega Cabs, met airport director R. Srinivasan to discuss the proposal.         
	The result? Nay.        
	Asked about the Mega Cabs proposal, Srinivasan said it would not be possible to allow any operator other than the BTA to operate pre-paid taxis at the airport. In an order issued in 1993, the state transport department has given recognition and permission only to BTA to run a booth at the airport, he told Metro.        
	According to him, other taxi associations, including the Trinamul-affiliated Progressive Taximens Association, had also sought permission to set up pre-paid taxi booths. But we had to reject their proposals on this ground, said Srinivasan.        
	Meanwhile, the need gap widens, the queue lengthens, the dadagiri of the taxi drivers grows and the flier suffers.        
	BTA secretary Bimal Guha admitted that many drivers from the association were harassing passengers by demanding extra fare and not maintaining proper queues.        
	For the past year, we have been trying to sort out the problem. There are also irregularities in the fares. We have been asking the state transport department to regularise the fares from the airport to various places but they are not paying any heed, he alleged.        
	Asked about sharing space with radio taxis, BTAs Guha said: Well neither welcome nor oppose any move to allow a private operator to run a pre-paid taxi booth.        
	The taxi association leader managed to at least sound more accommodating than transport minister Ranjit Kundu. Asked on Tuesday if he would respond to passenger pleas and allow other taxi operators  including private ones  to ply from the airport, he hit reverse gear: Kauke allow kora hobe na.        
	But what about the existing BTA booth? Even they wont be allowed. The transport department will manage pre-paid taxi services at the airport, Kundu told Metro.        
	So now, not only will government forces control the airport, they will also man the taxi booth. So much for the winds of change.        
	Devraj Chakravorty, a resident of Noida who has the pleasure of being in Calcutta every month but also the associated misfortune of encountering the pre-paid taxi booth, shudders at the consequences.        
	What Calcutta airport needs is privatisation, like Delhi or Mumbai, not greater government control, said the IT professional.        
	Privatisation, thanks to Karat and Co, remains a mirage for Calcuttans who can take heart from  or gnash their teeth over  Mega Cabs Amritsar experience. While Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore airports may have been privatised, Amritsar is still run by the AAI. But we just started operations there without a hitch, said Mishra.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Three men have been arrested, two of them with a single-shot revolver and a bullet each, and several crude bombs seized on Wednesday and Thursday in police raids to ensure peaceful civic elections.         
	Early on Thursday, cops raided a garage on Lockgate Road, in Chitpurs Saudagarapatty, and seized 17 bombs and half a kilogram of raw materials for making bombs.        
	One of the garage employees, Sheikh Wasim Khan, was arrested.         
	Tin-container bombs that were probably being made to cause disturbance during the polls were seized. We have not been able to find out much about the gang that was using the garage, said a senior officer of the detective department.        
	Another team of officers raided two hideouts in Darapara, Topsia, and seized 30 bombs. The pre-poll raids are being conducted on the basis of specific tip-offs and will continue till the elections, added the officer.        
	Mohammad Farooque, in his 30s, was arrested with a single-shot revolver on Phoolbagan Road. Mohammad Zahid was also arrested with a gun on CIT Road.         
	So far, we have arrested 48 people in the eastern part of the city, said a cop.

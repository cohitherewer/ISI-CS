The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land hurdle foils fire station plan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Land hurdle foils fire station plan
          SUBHAJOY ROY                              
	Scarcity of land has stalled the fire departments plan to set up sub-stations in eight fire-prone pockets in the city.         
	The sub-stations were proposed in Tangra-Topsia, Tollygunge, Shyambazar, Strand Road, Rajabazar, Jadavpur, New Market and the Milon Mela fairground. In most of these areas, there are quite a few factories and warehouses stacked with inflammable materials.        
	The fire department had written to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation a year ago to identify five cottahs in each pocket for setting up the sub-stations. The CMC is yet to write back but officials said except for Milon Mela, five-cottah vacant plots were not available in any pocket.        
	We have planned to set up the sub-stations to reduce the response time during a fire. Our target is to reach the blaze site within five to eight minutes of getting the first call, said Debopriyo Biswas, the additional director-general of the fire and emergency services.         
	When asked about the land crunch, senior officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) pleaded helplessness. We understand their requirement, but it is very difficult to find vacant plots in the areas specified by the fire department, said joint municipal commissioner Shahidul Islam.        
	A senior CMC official said space was available for a sub-station at Milon Mela. We have spoken to the state trade promotion organisation, the custodian of the Bypass site, and talks are on to set up a sub-station on the fairground, he said.         
	A senior fire services officer, however, said his department had not heard from the CMC yet on the station at Milon Mela.        
	Each sub-station will have one bouser of 14,000-litre capacity and one tender of 5,000-litre capacity.        
	Firemen admitted that in many cases the time taken to reach the spot cost dearly.        
	For instance, in case of a fire in a fire-prone zone like Burrabazar, the Strand Road sub-station would be of great help as the nearest stations now are Nimtala, Chittaranjan Avenue and Lalbazar, said a senior officer of the fire and emergency services department.

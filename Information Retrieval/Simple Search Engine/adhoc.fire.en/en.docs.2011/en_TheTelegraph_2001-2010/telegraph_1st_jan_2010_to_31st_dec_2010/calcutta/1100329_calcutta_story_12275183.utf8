The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pranab and Mamata prod to start fire probe
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pranab and Mamata prod to start fire probe

	Pranab Mukherjee joined Mamata Banerjee on Sunday in raising the pitch for a probe into the Stephen Court fire, saying the buck must now stop somewhere after going round in circles for five days.         
	Someone has to take responsibility for so many deaths but who? The fire services department? The state government? The Calcutta Municipal Corporation? The police? wondered Mamata, asking Trinamul Congress units to drum up a campaign for a central probe.        
	The government cannot sit idle after so many deaths. I would like a judicial inquiry with a fixed timeframe, preferably by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court, or a probe by the CBI, added the railway minister.        
	Finance minister Mukherjee, who was in town on Sunday, said a disaster of the scale of the Stephen Court blaze should have been probed by now. This was a devastating fire. A probe has to be carried out to find out how the fire took place and, if there was any lapse, who was responsible for it, he told a news conference at the state party headquarters.         
	But Mukherjee stopped short of suggesting what kind of an inquiry should be instituted.        
	Mamata was less charitable, picking on contradictory statements made by officials about the proposed probe.         
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen had spoken about an inquiry commission last Thursday but chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said on Saturday that the government would set up an inquiry committee whose members would be announced on Monday.        
	The government is yet to decide whether it will constitute an inquiry committee or an inquiry commission to probe the Park Street fire. Its a pity that government officials are making contradictory statements on the matter without bothering about the loss of lives, Mamata said.        
	The chief secretary and the home secretary were unavailable for comment.

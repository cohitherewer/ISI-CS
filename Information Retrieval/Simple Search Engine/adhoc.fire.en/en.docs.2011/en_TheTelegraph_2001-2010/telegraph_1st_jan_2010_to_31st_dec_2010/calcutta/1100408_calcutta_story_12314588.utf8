The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sania saga turns spotlight on the plot she lost
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sania saga turns spotlight on the plot she lost
          DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with Sania Mirza                                   
	Bride-to-be Sania Mirza has one gift less to take away to Lahore  the ownership papers of a plot off the Bypass allotted to her by the Bengal government.        
	Our offer of a five-cottah plot to Sania Mirza in 2007 stands cancelled. That piece of land in Rajdanga is now available for reallotment, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharyya revealed on the sidelines of a news conference on Wednesday.        
	Does the cancellation have anything to do with the tennis stars controversy-ridden Indo-Pak love match with Shoaib Malik?        
	Nonono. Why are you trying to make an issue out of this? She is a young woman who plays tennis very well. Let her be, retorted the minister who had even played host to Sania at a sporting event in Siliguri.        
	But Bhattacharyya did admit to having forgotten all about the five-cottah plot, owned by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, until laffaire Sho-ania hit the headlines.        
	I was reading about the controversy involving her and the Pakistani cricketer when I suddenly remembered that we had allotted her a plot of land. On enquiring about it in my department, I came to know that the allotment stood cancelled, he told Metro in the evening.        
	The allotment was apparently cancelled because Sania failed to pay the discounted amount at which the plot with a current market value of Rs 25 lakh was being offered to her. Bhattacharya, however, insisted that money wasnt the factor.        
	We took repossession of the plot only after Sanias family informed the government sometime in 2008 that they no longer needed the plot, he said.        
	The plot was allotted to Sania in 2007 after the then rising star of Indian tennis expressed a desire to have a base here while chatting with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other ministers during her stay in the city for the Sunfeast Open.        
	Sania had even got chief minister Bhattacharjee to swing a tennis racket in dhuti and panjabi during a previous visit.        
	We have a policy of encouraging sportspersons. So when Sania told us that she liked Calcutta a lot and wanted to have a base here, we promptly allotted her the five-cottah plot, said the urban development minister.        
	A source said the land was offered at a price of around Rs 10 lakh, half the then market value of close to Rs 20 lakh.        
	Sania failed to pay the land price within the stipulated time-frame of a year to 18 months, prompting the urban affairs department to cancel the allotment.        
	A senior official said Sanias father Imran Mirza had taken a look at the plot and quite liked it but didnt bother getting back to complete the deal.         
	Officially, there was no communiqu from the Mirzas about not wanting the land. They did not pay the land price, leaving us with no choice but to take repossession, he added.        
	Sanias mentor and doubles star Mahesh Bhupathi had also planned to set up a rooftop tennis academy in Rajarhat, but that has yet to see the light of day.

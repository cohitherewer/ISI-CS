The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal stalls rise from ashes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Illegal stalls rise from ashes

	A portion of an illegal market that poses a fire threat to hundreds of residents of a south Calcutta locality is being rebuilt for the third time a day after it was burnt to ashes.         
	Several residents in the area around Sandhya Bazar, which had gone up in flames two more times in five years, said they had requested the local councillor and police to ensure that the damaged stalls were not rebuilt or at least made to follow norms, but to no avail.         
	When Metro visited the market near Lords Bakery on Prince Anwar Shah Road on Tuesday, stall owners were busy pulling down the gutted structures so that they could be rebuilt.Our shops will be ready in a day or two, said Jagannath Das, whose tea stall was burnt in the fire.         
	Early on Monday, 13 of the 100-odd stalls in the market had caught fire, triggering panic among residents. The fears were not unfounded since flats opposite the market are connected to it through overhead electrical wires. Four tenders brought the fire under control.        
	The shops are made of tarpaulin sheets and bamboo It is natural that a fire will spread fast. Fortunately, the fire did not touch the electric posts. Had they caught fire, all of us would have been killed, said Shipra Bose, a resident of 5/1 Prince Ghulam Mohammad Shah Road.        
	Three families live in the three-storeyed building, which has no gate other than the one that leads to the market. We woke up around 3.30am because of the heat from the fire, locked our windows and rushed down. But we could not escape as the market was on fire, she added.        
	The market encroaches on the pavement, making it out of bounds. The number of shops is increasing every day and most do not have proper electrical connection. That the market poses a grave risk has been proved yet again, said Soumitra Bose, Shipras neighbour.        
	Biswanath Bose, the walls of whose house were singe in a blaze at the market three years ago, said the two previous fires had not led to any steps by the authorities.         
	Records available with the CMDA show the market is illegal. Local councillor Ratan Dey, of the Trinamul Congress, too said the stall owners were encroachers.        
	They were removed from the plot, which belongs to the Calcutta Improvement Trust, but they returned within days. While Subrata Mukherjee was the mayor, we had proposed to build a market here but the state government did not show any interest, said Dey.

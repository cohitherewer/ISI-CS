Twin thrills for lil champs          SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI                          Twins Akshay (left) and Akash Ramdev at Tolly for the Junior National Equestrian Championship. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	Warm sunshine on a chilly morning, a bunch of youngsters turned out in smart gear and horses eager to do their little riders proud hellip; the Medica Junior National Equestrian Championship is in full swing at the Tollygunge Club. Starting on December 27, the championship organised by the Fort William Riding and Polo Club and Tolly, partnered by The Telegraph, will 
  continue till January 2. Along with the championship there is the Tolly Horse Show, back after a gap of five years.   
	At the jumping arena mdash; located near the 3rd and 7th holes of the Tolly golf course mdash; the mood is like a picnic as members of the small but close-knit equestrian fraternity of the country cheer the spunky kids and their beautiful horses. When a contestant clears all the jumps, there are loud claps and murmurs of ldquo;all clear rdquo;. And since the li rsquo;l champs are beyond reach, it rsquo;s the parents who get the hugs and pats. On the sidelines of dressage and show jumping, Metro got talking with three kids about their passion and their ambition...  
	Akash and Akshay Ramdev are just another pair of 12-year-olds, till they tell you what they want to be: one, an ace polo player and the other an equestrian champ representing India in the Olympics.  
	The identical twins are among the 200-odd children participating in the Medica Junior National Equestrian Championship 2010. On Wednesday, the boys were standing tall in their breeches, having just won a team gold in show jumping.        
	Class VII students of Birla High School for Boys, they have been living in Calcutta for the past two years and started riding a year back at the Fort William Riding and Polo Club.         
	According to Akash, the older twin by a minute, their parents  father Colonel Ajay Ramdev and mother Ritu  were avid riders and discussions on horses dominate the dinner table conversation almost every day.         
	Equestrian is a very exciting sport. I love the way the horse senses my feelings and knows exactly what I want him to do, said Akash, whose favourite steed is Glendylwolf, a 10-year-old chestnut.         
	The thrill and challenge of the sport and the agility of the horses drew Akshay to show jumping. I got interested in equestrian after watching the Olympics, revealed Akshay. Among the horses at the Fort William Riding and Polo Club, he bonds the best with Global, a chestnut.         
	So, whats it like entering the arena and taking on the best riders of the country in the junior category? At first I was a little nervous as this was my first time at a national event, said Akash.         
	But the little big boy  who loves action movies and adores Hrithik Roshan  forgot his fears and enjoyed himself once the medals and accolades started pouring in.        
	Horse riding is hard work. The twins return from school at 2pm and within an hour they are saddled up and ready to go. They practise till 5pm on weekdays. Weekends and holidays mean they are on horseback by 6am.         
	And thats not all. Akash is into basketball and karate, in which hes won silver at a national meet, while Akshay plays golf, lawn tennis and enjoys swimming.

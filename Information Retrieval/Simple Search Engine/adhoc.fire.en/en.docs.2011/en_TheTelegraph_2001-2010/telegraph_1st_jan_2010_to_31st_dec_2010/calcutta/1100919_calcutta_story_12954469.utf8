The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Art for the mart
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Art for the mart
          Folk artistes are being groomed and marketed. But what is happening to their art? Sibendu Das explores                                   SUPER BAUL: A Baul singer performs at Schenzhen in China; (below) a drummer from Bengal finds a kindred spirit in China and (top right) a patachitra                     
	 A patachitrakar received the order to paint the story of Macbeth on a pata. When the painting was done, the story, adapted to an Indian context, was narrated simultaneously with Baul and Chhau performances.        
	 Fakiri singers Golam Fakir and Arman Fakir, trained for the audience, know exactly when and how to take the light, how to set the lapel, how to give a camera look and which is the performers zone on stage. They know how to gauge audience reaction and what to sing where. They know what works with an audience in jeans and what with a more mature audience. They worked recently with film-maker Gautam Ghose for Moner Manush.         
	 Ten years ago, Arjun Khyapa, a Baul singer from a village in Nadia, was not quite sure where his life was headed. His monthly income was about Rs 400.         
	 Cut to August, 2010. Arjun is performing at India Habitat Centre, New Delhi. A man looks for the baul with the yellow turban. Arjun appears speaking over his cellphone: Ei sodyo aamader show bhainglo (the show just ended). On September 21 he leaves for London. When in the country, he earns between Rs 7,000 to Rs 10,000 a month now.               
	Life has changed for the folk artistes from Bengal in the last five years. This year alone, several have performed abroad. In March 2010 four artistes headed for the UK to perform at London and Liverpool. In May 2010, five artistes performed at the International Fair on Intangible Cultural Heritage at Schenzhen, China. Now Arjun Khyapa with four other artistes will perform at London, Liverpool, Copenhagen and Camden world music festivals, and later on at the Camden Durga puja. The Camden puja is said to be the oldest one in the land of the firangis.         
	In our very own Calcutta, many puja organisers are planning cultural evenings with a folk element.         
	Arjun and some of his peers were picked up in 2004 by banglanatak dot com, a Calcutta-based organisation. They groomed and marketed him. They taught him to choose his songs, to hold the mike away from his mouth when making the ph sound. They also got him concerts.         
	With organisations such as banglanatak taking up the cause of folk art, suddenly the artistes are in demand. The organisation claims it shapes raw talent to make it market-friendly and in the process helps the artistes get a livelihood.         
	In 2004 we did a baseline survey and identified six folk art genres from five districts: Patachitra (painting on paper or cloth scrolls of a story) from West Midnapore, Baul/Fakiri (spiritual folk songs) from Nadia, Gambhira (a form of folk drama) and Domni (a comic folk drama) from Malda, Jhumur (a combination of folk song and dance) from Purulia and Bankura and Chhau (a vigorous martial dance with masks and costumes) from Purulia. We initially conducted workshops for 3,200 artistes across these districts, says Amitava Bhattacharya of baglanatak dot com, which has been playing a pioneering role in grooming folk artistes.        
	We realised that development comes only with economic freedom. Hence the focus shifted to culture as livelihood, adds Bhattacharya.         
	So patachitrakars are being given lessons on installation, how to use lights, how to position the artwork.         
	We used to draw on paper, make paper scrolls and thats it. But the new media group from London led by Magda Sabianzik taught us how to utilise space. Now we are getting offers from various puja committees to work on their pandals, says Moyna Chitrakar, 32, a potua from Pingla in West Midnapore.         
	Moyna was one of the participants at the workshop with a team from Liverpool who were experts in installation art. Her husband Malek Chitrakar is also an artist. Both are now pressed for time, juggling between orders for single pieces and puja pandals.         
	The marketing has led to some revival of folk art.        
	In the late 90s, we thought our art was dying. But now the young generation is enthusiastic, says a vibrant Moyna. This Puja about 140 potuas will decorate pandals in Calcutta alone.         
	With more buyers from the country and abroad and platforms to display their art, patachitrakars who used to earn a meagre Rs 500 a month are making anything between Rs 5,000 and Rs 18,000.         
	Researcher Sunil Mahato, who works with the Chhau community of Purulia, thinks there has been a phenomenal shift in the lifestyles and recognition of the folk artistes in the last five years in Bengal. Professional tips have attuned them to the demands of the market, opening up a wide array of possibilities of paid performance.        
	Now almost all of them carry a cellphone. They used to live in mud-thatch houses. Now they have concrete floors with proper toilets. Their children are going to school while they live with dignity in the same society that used to look down upon them once, reflects Mahato.         
	Elders in my village used to scold me when I practised. But now they have accepted that I can earn by playing the flute and I do not face any discrimination because of my passion, says Mohan Patra, a folk flutist from Sareskol village in Bakura.         
	It is Goopy Gyne Bagha Bynes story, if on a smaller scale. Music companies are coming forward to record labels. Stage performances are getting better. And people are asking for more. Recently the European Union and the National Insurance came forward to get the artistes trained by banglanatok and their family members health insurances.   
	Short and sweet  
	But what is happening to the art? Is commercialisation compromising its character? What can a Macbeth pata, which accompanies Chhau and Baul performances, be called?         
	What happens when a Chhau programme, which would last three hours in its original form, is compressed into a 30-minute performance for an urban audience?              
	The artistes are being marketed, their art is intact, claim those who are grooming them. Or if the art is being modified, it is for a purpose: survival.         
	We do not interfere with the art form. We try to improvise, says Sayantani of banglanatak dot com. For instance, when Madhumita, a dancer from the city, interacted with the chhau artistes, she first learned the different steps and mudras of chhau and then choreographed the production using those mudras. So what she basically does is editing and creating a presentation style while keeping the form intact, she says.         
	Lahari Deb, who runs a boutique, employs many patachitrakars to paint her saris. Sometimes we do have to tell them what motifs the customers need. That fetches the money. The artists are more than happy to do so, she says.        
	The original art is being compromised to an extent, says Suchorita Bardhan, faculty member, development communication, Roopkala Kendro.         
	I have known Karunadi, a potua, for a decade. One day I found her motifs had changed from those of Ramayana to global warming and deforestation, she says. Now, when the change comes naturally out of an individual or collective communitys experience, it reflects the artists expression after experiencing various social processes. But when it is mediated from the top according to market standards, by external entities, then authenticity is compromised, she adds.         
	There is also scepticism about saving a traditional art form from outside with providing livelihood. If any urban organisation claims that it is working towards saving the folk art form, I call it complete hogwash. Folk art does not need any external help to survive, says Subhendu Maity, founder member of Lalan Academy that works with various folk art forms of Bengal. For thousands of years, the poor and the ill-fed have been keeping tradition alive. If economic freedom had produced art, then the multi-crore industrialists would have been the performers, he thinks.        
	But Bardhan is quick to point out that economic sustainability and self-reliance is a major priority area. To address livelihood challenges, microfinance through self-help groups is an important way forward and appropriate marketing strategies will provide the much-needed support, she says.        
	And folk art should be enjoyed in its entirety. The moment you take a folk dance to an urban stage, its dimensions change, feels dancer Mamata Shankar too. Interpolating foreign motifs into existing forms is sacrilege, she adds emphatically. But she is also quick to point out a justification behind a modified folk form. Compression of a three-hour Chhau performance into a 30min package is not bad for the art as long as it is acting as an initiation to the art forms for the urban youth, she says.         
	Others feel that if something keeps artistes from starving, theres nothing wrong with it. At least they are surviving, and they are happy. If there is any better alternative, it is always welcome. Is any body listening? demands percussionist Tanmoy Bose.        
	Differences of opinion can be there. But we believe in the survival of the artiste for the survival of the art form, counters Bhattacharya of banglanatok.        
	Meawhile, the singers are getting used to the new world. Says an impressed Gautam Ghose: Just two days in a recording studio, knowing almost nothing about the technical jargon of an urban musician, Golam Fakir took me by surprise when he suddenly said: Ekbaar oi kilick beat ta dan toh (Give me the beat cue please)! he says.

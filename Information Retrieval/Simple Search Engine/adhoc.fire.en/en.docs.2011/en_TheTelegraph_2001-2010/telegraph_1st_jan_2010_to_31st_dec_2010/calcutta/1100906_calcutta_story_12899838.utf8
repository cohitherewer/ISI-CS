	A 30-year-old software developer stepping out of a job interview at a Theatre Road hotel on Sunday afternoon was critically injured when a false ceiling concealing a geyser came crashing down on him.        
	The Dum Dum resident (name withheld on request) has since been slipping in and out of consciousness at a private nursing home. Doctors said the next 72 hours were crucial to his recovery.         
	The youths family lodged a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station against The Astor, accusing the management of poor maintenance.         
	Police said the incident occurred when the software developer was walking down the first-floor corridor around 4.30pm. A portion of the false ceiling apparently caved in after the geyser fitted above it exploded. The youth, who holds an MCA degree and is employed with a software company, slumped to the ground after being struck on the head.         
	Hotel employees rushed him to a nearby nursing home and then called his parents. I received a call from the hotel around 5pm, informing me about my son being admitted to a nursing home. I couldnt believe what I was hearing, recounted the youths mother.         
	A team from Shakespeare Sarani police station went to the hotel after receiving a call from one of his family members. We have started a probe. We will send some of the samples for forensic tests on Monday, an officer said.         
	With the youth unable to talk, family members waited in the nursing home through the evening hoping to hear from the doctors. Its difficult to explain the pain we feel seeing him battling for life in hospital. If a prominent hotel is maintained so poorly, what do we expect from lesser known hospitality addresses? rued a relative.        
	The hotel blamed the callousness of a guest for the accident. One of our guests switched on the geyser and then forgot to switch it off, resulting in the explosion. That caused the false ceiling to cave in and fall on one of the candidates for a job interview being conducted by an IT company, Daljit Singh Sahani of The Astor told Metro.        
	The hotel will bear the cost of his treatment, Singh added.

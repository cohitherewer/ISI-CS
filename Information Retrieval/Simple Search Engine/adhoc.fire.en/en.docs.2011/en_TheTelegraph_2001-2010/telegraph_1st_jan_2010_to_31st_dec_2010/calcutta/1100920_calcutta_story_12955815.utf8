The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Quiz comeback with a bang
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Quiz comeback with a bang
  - Teamwork and individual brilliance in battle of brains          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    
	The best quizzers in the city took on each other as NSHM Corporate Quiz 2010 amp; Fastest Finger First, organised by Advertising Club, Calcutta, in association with The Telegraph, made a grand comeback over the weekend after a gap of six years.         
	First up at The Chrome Hotel on Saturday evening was Fastest Finger First, the prelims of which was conducted at Rotary Sadan the previous evening. Six men, including a chartered accountant, a railway employee, a mutual fund adviser and software consultant, made the cut from among the 105 participants.         
	Many came to me and said they appreciated this effort to recognise individual quizzers because on several occasions they had not been able to participate in quizzes since they were not part of a team, said quizmaster Barry O Brien.         
	Sougata Mitra was one of those who lapped up the opportunity, making it to the finals ahead of many seasoned quizzers. I am a mutual fund adviser and not an employee of a company, so I cannot participate in a corporate quiz, which are meant for teams. Fastest Finger First provided me a chance to test my skills.         
	A few of the questions are easy but the idea is also to crack them faster than others, O Brien reminded the participants. Tathagata Chatterjee, the marketing manager who made it to the finals, agreed. Fastest Finger First tests both the span of my knowledge and how quickly I can recollect what I know.         
	Fastest Finger First is the first of its kind and would go a long way in reviving the tradition of open quizzing in Calcutta, said Kanchan Datta, the secretary of Advertising Club, Calcutta.         
	The battle of brains was won by the youngest man in the field  Rishin Chatterjee of ABP Pvt Ltd, who started quizzing when he was in Class IV.         
	It was over to the corporate teams next. The six that made it to the finals from among the 42 in the fray were Cognizant, HSBC, ABP, Inner Circle and two teams from Tata Consultancy Services.         
	After nine rounds of general quizzing  including The Telegraph unputdownable round, a tribute to excellence in various fields  Sudip Kalyan De and Bahvin Zaveri of Tata Consultancy Services finished first followed by Bhaskar Dutta and Biswabijoy Sen of the same company.        
	The prizes were given away by police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and fashion designer Agnimitra Paul.        
	I remember seven years back my father Neil O Brien and I were the joint quizmasters at the same Advertising Club quiz. Today I can tell him that I remember all that I have learnt from him without him on the show, said Barry O Brien.        
	The event is set to be a permanent feature in the citys quiz calendar. We are happy that we could revive the quiz after six years and received an overwhelming response. We plan to host it on a larger scale next year on, said Datta.

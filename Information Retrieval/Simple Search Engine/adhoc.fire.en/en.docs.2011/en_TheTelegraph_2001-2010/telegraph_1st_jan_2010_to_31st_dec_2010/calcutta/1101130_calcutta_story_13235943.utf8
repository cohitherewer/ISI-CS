The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roadblock army rips education veil
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Roadblock army rips education veil
          MITA MUKHERJEE                          The Metro Channel rally by Left Front-backed teachers organisations and the choked JL Nehru Road on Monday afternoon. (Sanat Kr. Sinha)                                  
	Teachers who helped the Left Front choke the traffic at city centre on Monday cannot think of enrolling their children in state or state-aided schools since they know first hand how students are educated in these institutions.         
	No one knows better than me the kind of facilities available at schools supported by the government. The infrastructure of a state-aided primary school and the policies followed there do not match the requirements of a modern-day student, said Niraj Singh, who has been teaching at a state-funded Hindi-medium primary school in Kidderpore for 12 years, standing in Metro Channel while leader after leader hailed the Left Fronts success in education on the dais.         
	Being a responsible father, I could not admit my two children to a school that lacks modern facilities, Singh added.        
	Fellow rallyist Ashoke Naskar, a teacher in a stated-aided secondary school in Mudiali, echoed him. Vernacular schools have failed to keep pace with the changes in the modern education system and lag far behind private English-medium schools, said Naskar, whose wife too works in a state-aided Bengali-medium school. Their daughter studies in an English-medium school run by Christian missionaries.         
	Both Singh and Naskar are the CPMs own. A commerce graduate of Ranchi University, Singh is a member of the CPM-controlled All Bengal Primary School Teachers Association, one of the most powerful Left lobbies of school teachers in the state. Naskar, a Calcutta University postgraduate in geography, is an active member of the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Association, the biggest lobby of secondary school teachers in Bengal.        
	The primary school teacher, active in the CPM association since 1999, does not hesitate to admit the Left Fronts blunder of abolishing English in primary classes in the early-1980s.        
	From 2003, English is being taught in Class I. But several lakh students have suffered because of the faulty policy, especially young boys and girls from Hindi-speaking families like ours who had no option but to study in the state-aided Hindi-medium schools, said Singh.        
	He loves Calcutta and has no plans to leave the city, though he knows his counterparts in Punjab, UP, Bihar and other states earn more than him. On the stage, a leader was saying how many times the salaries of teachers have gone up during the Left Front rule.         
	As the next speaker boasted about the number of women among the 4,000 teachers attending the rally, a woman professor spoke about other problems that did not find a voice on the dais.        
	Shahnaaz Nabi, the head of the Urdu department of Calcutta University and a member of the CPM-controlled West Bengal College and University Teachers Association, said: Nearly 95 per cent of the seats in the MA Urdu course of our university are taken by women which shows that women are no longer lagging behind men in higher education. But unfortunately, job opportunities for women have not increased. The government needs to look into this problem.

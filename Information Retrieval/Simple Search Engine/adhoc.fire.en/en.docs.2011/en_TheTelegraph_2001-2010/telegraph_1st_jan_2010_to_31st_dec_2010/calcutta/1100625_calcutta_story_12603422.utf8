          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Suman Saha, 28, an Agartala resident, was arrested at Dum Dum airport on the charge of stealing the cellphone of a trader on Thursday afternoon.        
	Both Saha and the trader, Pradip Das, were bound for Agartala. Saha was to board a Jet Airways flight and Das a SpiceJet flight.        
	Das had left his phone at the X-ray counter during security check-up. When he realised the phone was missing, he alerted officials. The officials showed me the footage of a closed-circuit TV and I saw a man pick up my phone, he said. The man was later identified as Saha.        
	When confronted, Saha denied having taken the traders phone. But during a search we found the complainants phone in Sahas pocket, said a CISF officer. Saha was handed over to airport police station.

          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Anshuman Mohan. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Anshuman Mohan, 15, plays the drum, loves photography, spelling bee, horse-riding, swimming and playing squash and tennis, and is also serious about school. Too much? Not unheard of, actually, in todays kids. What really sets Anshuman apart is that he is the author of Potato Chips, a novel about four school friends, which has been published by Harper Collins.         
	In school I would be told that my essays were a cut above others. The novel just started happening. When I was in the middle of it, I realised that I probably had a story that could be published, says Anshuman.         
	The Class X student of St Xaviers Collegiate School, who was a finalist in CNBC Awaazs Responsibility and Rupaiyya and HDFC Standard Lifes Spell Bee in 2009, was 13 when he wrote the novel. The story of four friends, all students of St Xaviers, have parallels with his life. Well yes, any good story does have its base in real life. The protagonist Aman does have bits of me, says Anshuman, a resident of New Alipore. Like him, Aman is a student of Akshar, who then moves to St Xaviers. The world is one of schoolwork, family, having fun, fights and patching up. Theres philosophy too: Students are like potatoes Only the finest of us will get made into chips, whether that is a future to be looked forward to or not. Thirteen-year-olds are more mature than people think them to be, says Anshuman with a laugh.         
	When he decided to get his book published, I just got hold of every publisher. Harper Collins was very excited about the work, he says. Did they try to bully a kid? Oh no, they were very professional.         
	Anshuman is already working on his next book. But he doesnt want to be a professional writer. It doesnt pay enough. I want to be a millionaire, he says.

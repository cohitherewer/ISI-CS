                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stop loading, carry on looting
										      KINSUK BASU       THE GREAT COAL ROBBERY   A TELEGRAPH EXPOSE      captured: the raiders of the black diamond                          1. Men mount wagons to dump coal on the ground at Hazratpur dump yard of Borjore on Tuesday				   2. The coal emptied from the rakes piles up while police keep watch              3. The looted coal is carried away from the dump yard in baskets  4. Coal is transferred from baskets to gunny bags and wheeled away                                
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cannot stop the daylight loot of coal from the captive mine in Borjore in Birbhum, his power minister pleads helplessness and calls it a law-and-order issue, the local police tell the mine authorities to suspend operations for an indefinite period and the hapless consumer spends yet another sweltering evening in the dark.        
	For the third day in a row not a single wagon was loaded from the state governments captive mine in Borjore even as power shortage in the state crossed the 275MW mark resulting in two hours of loadshedding across the districts.        
	Supply of a single coal rake  with 59 wagons  could have generated at least 210MW in any of the five West Bengal Power Development Corporation (WBPDCL) plants.        
	Looting of coal in the coal belt is an old problem, which has intensified in recent days. The chief minister has asked the administration to tackle the issue. Its more of a law-and-order problem and the police will have to take appropriate action, Sen said on Friday evening.                        I have read today rsquo;s report in The Telegraph. Looting of coal in the coal belt is an old problem, which has intensified in recent days. It is a grave problem. As your report says, the coal is being looted there and then transported elsewhere. The chief minister has asked the administration to tackle the issue. It rsquo;s more of a law-and-order problem and police will have to take appropriate action  
	Nirupam Sen 
  at the Press Club on Friday evening      
	The state government is a co-owner of the Borjore mine, a joint venture between EMTA Group and the WBPDCL.        
	In an expose on the blatant loot of coal from a dump yard in Hazratpur, a village along the Burdwan-Birbhum border, Metro had shown how a section of the local police was in connivance with the looters, who hawk their daily haul in the illegal dump yards of Barkolaghat, Sahapur and Bhimgarh.        
	This is a serious law-and-order problem and thats why we have asked the mine authorities to suspend loading of coal for some time. We are drawing up plans to stop the loot. We will inform the mine authorities when to resume operations, said R.N. Mukherjee, the superintendent of police, Birbhum.        
	As the first step of a larger offensive against the looters  a point chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee iterated at a meeting in Writers Buildings last week  the district administration withdrew the police force from the loading site.        
	The cops were not there on Friday and looting of coal from the dump yard continued, said a source in the Borjore mine, adding that the loot from the dump yard or from loaded trains has been a regular affair since the mine started operations last June.        
	Records available with the mine authorities suggest that the raids stopped only for seven days, between January 12 and 18, when some local political leaders  from the CPM and Congress  tried to strike a deal with the authorities.        
	The leaders promised us that 330 local people would get jobs in the mine but later we realised that it was a hoax and the leaders had taken money from the mine authorities and duped us, said Sheikh Moti, a resident of Sahapur village, around 2km from the mine.         
	WBPDCL officials confirmed the attempt by the mine authorities to strike a deal with local politicians and claimed that things went awry when the Hazratpur panchayat  a CPM stronghold since 1977  failed to reach a consensus on the 330 names.        
	We have tried all possible options to run the mine successfully, but nothing has worked. The local administration has left us in the lurch, the political parties have failed to deliver on their promises, and the loot goes on, said an official of Bengal EMTA Coal Mines Ltd.        
	Power minister Sen echoed this helplessness and admitted that the administration had failed to stop the looting of coal and snap the supply line of looted coal to illegal dump yards in the Ranigunj-Asansol belt.        
	The helplessness of the administration has cast a shadow on another captive state government mine in Gangaramchowk, around 6km from the Hazratpur dump yard, scheduled to be operational from this October.         
	The same dump yard will be used for coal loading once mining begins. If the condition remains the same, there is no point in starting the operations, said a senior power department official.

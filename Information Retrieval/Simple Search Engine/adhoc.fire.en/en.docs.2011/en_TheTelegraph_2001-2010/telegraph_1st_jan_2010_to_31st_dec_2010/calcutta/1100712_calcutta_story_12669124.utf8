The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU in a spot over salary refusal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      JU in a spot over salary refusal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University is in a fix over the refusal of a teacher to accept his salary for three years.        
	Sayan Nandi, a lecturer in the construction engineering department, has been refusing his salary cheques since July 2007 to protest the authorities decision to withhold his remuneration till he submitted his permanent account number (PAN) to the university.        
	Nandis salary was withheld for around six months. The authorities withdrew their order and released the teachers salary along with the arrears in July 2007.        
	But Nandi has refused to accept any cheque since, saying the authorities would have to first accept that his salary was withheld on a flimsy ground.        
	The university was forced to suspend the teachers salary as there is an order from the income tax department saying every employee must submit his/her PAN, said pro vice-chancellor Sidhartha Dutta.        
	Nandi refused to speak on the matter when Metro called him.        
	Fearing a legal complication if he kept refusing his salary, the universitys executive council took up the issue at a recent meeting.        
	The council decided to ask the general secretary of the Jadavpur University Teachers Association to talk to Nandi and try and settle the issue.         
	We may have to take a stern measure if the teacher still refuses to budge, said a university official.        
	An executive council member, however, said the university statute did not include any provision stating what action should be taken against an employee who was refusing his/her salary.        
	In a similar incident, a zoology teacher of Calcutta University who was suspended in 1995 did not accept his salary when the authorities withdrew the suspension order.        
	Though he retired three years ago, he still has not collected his dues and the post-retirement benefits, a source in the university said.        
	Later he filed a case in court which is still pending, the source added.

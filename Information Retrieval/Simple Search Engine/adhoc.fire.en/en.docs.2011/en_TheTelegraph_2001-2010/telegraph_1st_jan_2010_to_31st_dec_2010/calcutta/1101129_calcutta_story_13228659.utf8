                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Envoy bullish on German biz boost

	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has offered to meet German business captains to clear obstacles, including the sensitive land issue, and facilitate more German investment in the state, said German ambassador Thomas Matussek.        
	The envoy, who met the chief minister on Friday on his first visit to Calcutta after assuming his position in Delhi, told Bhattacharjee that German investors want to come to Bengal but certain obstacles need to be overcome. Scarcity of land is a prime concern.        
	Bengal has a serious public relations problem and the strengths are never packaged and marketed well. In that light, the chief ministers proactive response was a very encouraging sign. I will certainly do my utmost to persuade German political and business delegations to come to Calcutta without prejudice, Matussek told Metro.        
	The ambassador felt that the business environment in Bengal is much better than it is perceived outside.        
	The envoy also stressed that Germany would be delighted to help Calcutta come up to speed with a world-class airport to match Delhis showpiece Terminal 3, if approached by the state. The ambassador felt failure to create a positive first impression can cost the state a substantial share of overseas investment.        
	On the tricky land topic, Matusseks advice to German businessmen would be to talk to the landowners and the farmers directly.        
	The ambassador, who also met the governor and was the chief guest at the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce AGM, was confident that German SMEs could play a huge role in business with Bengal, particularly in the mining and steel industries, through support technology.        
	Matussek is very happy to see German car majors doing well in Calcutta and the business heads of Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen pitching for their products from the same platform in the city.        
	Stressing the deep cultural bond Calcutta has with Germany, the envoy promised that Calcutta would be an important centre for the Germany and India 2011-2012 festival starting next October. There will be rock concerts, art exhibitions, co-operation of museums, dance, theatre and a Siemens workshop.

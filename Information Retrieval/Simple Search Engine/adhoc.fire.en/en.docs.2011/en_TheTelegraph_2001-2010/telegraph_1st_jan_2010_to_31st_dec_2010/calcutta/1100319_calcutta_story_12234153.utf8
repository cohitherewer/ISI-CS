The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Snag robs city of power
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Snag robs city of power
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Phased power cuts plagued most of the city on Thursday, adding up to two hours in some areas. The culprit this time? Low generation by CESC.         
	Its not peak summer yet and already there have been so many days of power cuts. This summer could be one of the worst in terms of blackouts, said Suhasini Roy, 43, a resident of Gol Park, laughing away the promises made by the authorities regarding improvement in the power situation.         
	Thursdays disruption was triggered by the collapse of a 250MW unit at CESCs Budge Budge station, which brought down the utilitys peak hour generation capacity from 1,225MW to 975MW.         
	During peak hours, CESC sent out 902MW and imported 482MW to meet the 1,384MW demand. The load-shedding was around 110MW during peak demand. Budge Budge generated 460MW, Southern 135MW, Titagarh 221MW and New Cossipore 86MW. The state grid supplied 468MW of the total imported power, said a CESC spokesperson.         
	Towards evening, parts of Shyambazar, Hatibagan, Sovabazar, Girish Park, Bowbazar, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Elgin Road, Ballygunge, Gariahat and Tollygunge faced intermittent power cuts that added up to 60 to 120 minutes.         
	We have been out of power for nearly two hours. A Calcutta free of power cuts will perhaps remain a pipe dream forever, grumbled Bowbazar trader Avinash Murarka on Thursday evening.        
	The power situation has been dismal since March 5. Insufficient supply of high-quality coal had lowered the generation by the state utility, while snags have hindered CESCs supply. The state utilitys generation normalised this week.         
	Thursdays maximum temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius didnt help matters either. To add to the citys woes, supply from the Science City Distribution Station is likely to be affected between 8.30am and 1.30pm on Saturday as CESC is scheduled to work on a switchboard extension.         
	The areas likely to be affected include Chowbhaga, Silver Springs, Panchannagram, Uttar Panchannagram, Milon Mela, East Topsia, Hughes Road, Arupota, Science City, ITC The Sonar Calcutta and Metropolitan Co-operative Housing Society.

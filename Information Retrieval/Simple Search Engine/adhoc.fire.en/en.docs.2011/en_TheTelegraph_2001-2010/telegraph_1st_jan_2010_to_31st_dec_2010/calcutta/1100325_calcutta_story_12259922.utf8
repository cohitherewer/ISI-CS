The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Focus on Fiddler on the Roof
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Focus on Fiddler on the Roof
          SAMBIT SAHA                          The Queens Park Mansion house of Parasmal Lodha (below). Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury                                          
	Its time to remember Parasmal Lodha. Not because hes the man whod threatened to take over Peerless in 1986, but as extra-floor Lodha or Fiddler on the Roof.        
	Lodha had built the incongruous fifth and sixth floors of Stephen Court that was gutted on Tuesday in the citys worst fire tragedy.        
	Old residents of the Park Street mansion have drawn attention to the fact that when the two floors were added by Lodha access to the spiral staircase was denied beyond the fourth floor.        
	As the inferno raged inside on Tuesday, trapping residents and office workers because neither the lifts nor the regular staircase could be used, that alternative exit, which is outside the building, could have meant a difference between life and death.        
	Lodha built the additional floors in the early to mid-Eighties, according to reports from that period, and had them legalised when the late Prasanta Sur was the municipal affairs minister, the civic body having been superseded. Its not clear, in keeping with the shadowy world of real estate, from whom he had bought the roof rights.        
	Just as in Stephen Court, he had built two more floors in Tobacco House, standing cheek by jowl with the Lalbazar police headquarters, and in Nicco House at Dalhousie.        
	Metro tried to catch up with Lodha at his Queens Park mansion on Wednesday. The attendants on the portico confirmed that the Lodhas were in town, but they were not at home in the afternoon. When called on the phone, Lodhas wife answered and said he would get back but did not till the time of going to press.        
	A real estate veteran said: He used to be called extra-floor Lodha because of his ingenious ability to add floors on top of any house.        
	From extra-floor Lodha to Fiddler on the Roof was but a small step, though in a twist that is unlikely to be popular with admirers of the famous Broadway musical that was made into a movie in the Seventies based on a book set in pre-revolutionary Russia.        
	There was no music in what he did to Stephen Court. Even a cursory look at the building before the fire would reveal the boxy ugliness of the added floors in comparison with the expansive faade of the original property that now carries the heritage tag. Tobacco House bears a similar scar.        
	The Fiddler would approach house owners with an offer to buy the roof rights and build additional residential or office space. The task of ensuring that the entire deal was legal Lodha took upon himself, the source said.         
	Coming from a family of moneylenders from Sujangarh in Rajasthans Churu district, Lodhas reputation grew in the real estate business as someone who got things done without falling on the wrong side of the law. Well-known city industrialists tapped him, too.        
	It was said that Lodha, who shed his small-time builder label to shoot into prominence after the Left Front came to power in 1977, was close to a powerful minister of the time.         
	His roof serenade has fallen silent over the past 10 years. In the mid-Nineties, the owners of Peerless, the Roy family, struck back to assert control. Sources said Lodha, who would be in his 50s now, still owns some shares in the unlisted financial powerhouse but lies low.

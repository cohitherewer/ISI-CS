The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brakes on taxi ad boards
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Brakes on taxi ad boards
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu on Thursday turned down a proposal by taxi operators to install backlit advertisement boards on top of taxis.        
	The operators who met the minister at Writers Buildings had initially sought a hike in the Rs 2 per litre state government subsidy on diesel. The subsidy should be at least Rs 3-4 per litre. If the subsidy is not increased, the fares should be, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association.        
	According to sources, when Kundu ruled out a hike in subsidy, Guha demanded that the advertisement boards be allowed.        
	Taxi owners can earn around Rs 800 per month by installing advertisement boards on top of taxis. Each driver can earn about Rs 300 per month from the advertisement, said Guha.        
	While Guha claimed the minister had asked for a fortnight to consider the proposal, Kundu told Metro in the evening that he had rejected the scheme outright.

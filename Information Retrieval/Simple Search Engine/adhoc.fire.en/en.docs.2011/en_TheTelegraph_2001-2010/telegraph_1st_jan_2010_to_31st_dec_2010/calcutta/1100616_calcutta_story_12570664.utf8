The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Aerobridge retired hurt for four months
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Aerobridge retired hurt for four months
  - State-run terminal faces flak from airlines          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	Calcutta, one of the two major state-run international airports in the country, has been operating international flights without an aerobridge for nearly four months.        
	The only aerobridge at the airports international terminal had developed a snag four months ago and has been lying unused, inconveniencing passengers. There is a problem with the aerobridge but it will be operational within this week, said airport director R. Srinivasan on Tuesday.        
	All the major airlines operating international here have complained to the airport authorities about the inconvenience caused and requested them to take steps to get the aerobridge up and running fast.        
	Had it been an airport operated by private parties like in Mumbai or Delhi, this would have been repaired much faster. But Calcutta being run by the Airports Authority of India (along with Chennai) there is hardly any initiative to restore the aerobridge, said the official of an international airline operating to the city. The effort by the authorities to restore it has been lackadaisical and no one really seems to be bothered, he said.        
	Airport officials claimed that the Indonesian firm from which the aerobridge was procured around eight years ago was not providing proper after-sales maintenance.        
	The aerobridge has been developing technical snags and there are certain spare parts which need to be imported. However, the maintenance service provided by the manufacturer is not at all satisfactory, said a senior official at Calcutta airport.        
	The norm for international airports across the globe is to have a number of aerobridges for smooth passenger transit. The fact that the international terminal has been functioning without an aerobridge for so long proves how far we are from achieving global standards, said an official.        
	The out-of-order aerobridge, through which passengers walk into the aircraft from the terminal building or vice versa, has been parked in bay number 44 for months.        
	In the absence of an aerobridge, passengers have to board a bus to get to the aircraft, which takes longer and is more inconvenient, said an airport official. Wheelchair-bound passengers also have a harrowing time. A flight takes at least 15 minutes extra for boarding and disembarking without an aerobridge. Besides, the airline has to incur the extra cost for passenger coaches, said a Singapore Airlines official.        
	Calcutta airport has three aerobridges at the domestic terminal against close to 30 at Delhi and more than 20 at Mumbai. The plan for the new terminal is to install 18 aerobridges.

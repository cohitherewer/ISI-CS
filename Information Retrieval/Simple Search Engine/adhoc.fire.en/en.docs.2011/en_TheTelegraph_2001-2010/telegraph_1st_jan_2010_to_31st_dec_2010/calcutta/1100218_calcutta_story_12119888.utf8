                The Salt Lake municipality announced on Wednesday that a residents convention would be held on February 26 in the BD hall to discuss the issue of adding a floor to existing houses. The municipality decided to organise the convention after state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya asked its chairman to hold discussions on the matter before giving residents the green signal to add a floor to their houses.    The public vehicles department on Tuesday launched a drive against pool cars running without a valid permit and seized 15 vehicles till Wednesday. The government had earlier announced that pool cars older than 15 years or holding a permit issued before 2000 would not be allowed to ply after February 15.    Around 50 students of Pratap Chandra Memorial Homeopathy Medical College and Hospital in Narkeldanga gathered outside their institute on Wednesday evening to protest a delay in receiving provisional semester certificates and poor internship stipends.

      Hello It's Wednesday , April 7 , 2010                    
	Eden match    Headed for the Kolkata Knight Riders-Delhi Daredevils showdown? Park your car on the Strand Road side if you do not have a parking sticker.    Show your true colours. Pick up a jersey, a flag, a headband or all of the above.    Shout KKR, KKR on the way in. That is what the stadium DJ would get you to do once the match starts.    If you have a gallery ticket, go an hour early. Otherwise, tracking your seat, or even finding one, becomes a bother.    If you have a pair of binoculars, take it. Cameras are a no-no.    Buy water pouches (Rs 10 for four) near the gate, before taking your seat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rajdhani ticket, local train
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rajdhani ticket, local train
  - Shoddy treatment adds to passenger woes after shock on showpiece          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE AND UTTAM DUTTA                          A stranded Rajdhani Express passenger struggles to get off the train on the tracks at Baruipara, 27km before Howrah, on Monday morning. A key braking device of the train got unhinged, leading to the derailment of the engine. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha                                        
	Croissant, cheese omelette and steaming tea for breakfast followed by shock and apathy served cold summed up Monday morning for passengers on the Howrah-bound Rajdhani Express that jumped rails 27km before its destination.        
	If I had a choice, I wouldnt travel by train again, declared Delhi-based social worker Agamani Bhattacharya, fuming at the shoddy treatment that followed yet another barely averted tragedy on tracks at Baruipara.        
	Couldnt they have arranged something better than a local train for the rest of our journey? she demanded, picking up her luggage to leave Howrah station almost three hours later than the Rajdhani Express was scheduled to arrive.         
	For elderly passengers like ailing Dhaka resident Shahidul Kabir, in his 60s, the morning brought more than just an accident scare and an uncomfortable journey in a crowded local train compartment. My father has been complaining of chest pain since the incident. He also suffered a leg injury when the train jerked to a halt, said son Saiful, who had taken his father to Chennai for treatment of respiratory distress.        
	Shahidul didnt receive medical attention until he reached Howrah station in the afternoon. There was no medical facility at Baruipara station and his condition seems to have deteriorated, Saiful told Metro.        
	Graphic design student Nandini Dasgupta, travelling alone for the first time, said she wasnt bothered as much about the railways failure to take care of the stranded passengers as by the thought of what could have happened.        
	I had just finished breakfast and was relaxing with a book when suddenly there was a noise and the train jerked violently before coming to a halt. I immediately remembered my mother advising me to be alert at all times given the spate of rail accidents and close calls in recent months, recalled the 20-year-old.        
	With Nandini immediately calling home to say that her train was probably involved in an accident, mother Swapna Dasgupta panicked.        
	I was so scared. I told her father, Now you know why I wanted to go to Delhi to escort her back home. I am not going to allow her to return to Delhi alone, said Swapna, who would have left for Baruipara immediately had her daughter not repeatedly assured her that she was safe.        
	Another first-time train traveller who did not wish to be named later wrote on Facebook: Travelled first time by train and saw a life and death experience....Rajdhani out of track...just got a new life...thanks to god.        
	Thirty-something Agamani said the frequency of train accidents was appalling. The Rajdhani Express is supposed to be a showpiece train and even that is not safe any longer, she rued.        
	Trader Dilip Kumar, a resident of Delhi who is in the city on business, said the railway authorities took close to two-and-a-half hours just to react to Monday mornings incident.         
	They were lazy. There was no water and no medical assistance throughout for some of the older people who took ill. What would have happened to us had this incident occurred at night? If the authorities are this callous about the Rajdhani Express, god save passengers on other trains, Kumar added.        
	It took a tweet from quizmaster Derek OBrien, also the chairman of the Railway Passenger Amenities Committee, to convince many in the virtual world that there was no casualty. All passengers are safe on the Delhi-Cal Rajdhani Express. I just spoke to the GM ...PASSENGERS SAFE..., he tweeted.        
	Samir Banerjee, the stationmaster of Howrah, contested allegations about the stranded passengers being meted out shoddy treatment. The moment we heard the news, our senior officials, including the general manager, rushed to the spot. Also, we arranged for a special train with a medical team and railway personnel to bring back the passengers, he said.        
	Many were glad they didnt wait for the train. Our car was waiting at Howrah station but I called the driver to Baruipara, said B.K. Kanojia, who was returning from Kanpur with six of his family members.

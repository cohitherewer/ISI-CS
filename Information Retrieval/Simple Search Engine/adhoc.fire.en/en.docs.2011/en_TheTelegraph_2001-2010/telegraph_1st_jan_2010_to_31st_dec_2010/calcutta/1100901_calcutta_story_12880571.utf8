                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Doctors end strike 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The ceasework by junior doctors at SSKM Hospital and Calcutta Medical College and Hospital was withdrawn on Tuesday evening after the authorities agreed to meet some demands of the protesters.         
	The 300 interns and house staff at Calcutta Medical College withdrew their strike around 5pm following two rounds of meetings with the authorities. The doctors started the strike on Monday morning to press for more security.        
	Pampa Dutta, a 35-year-old resident of Premchand Boral Street near Bowbazar, was arrested on Tuesday morning for allegedly attacking junior doctors after her relative died at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital on Monday. The assault triggered the ceasework.         
	At SSKM Hospital, the junior doctors withdrew their 24-hour ceasework around 6.30pm following a meeting with the hospital authorities. A notice warning visitors that attacking doctors is a non-bailable offence has been put up at the emergency ward.         
	We joined work after arrangements were made to stop overcrowding in the wards, said Gauranga Pramanik, a junior doctor.

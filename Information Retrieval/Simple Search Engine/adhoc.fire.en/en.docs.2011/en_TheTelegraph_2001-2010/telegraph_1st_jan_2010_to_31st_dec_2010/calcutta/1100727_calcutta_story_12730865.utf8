                      Towards a peaceful planet                    In his book Identity And Violence- The Illusion of Destiny, Amartya Sen, perhaps one of the worlds great thinkers of all time, tells us how to go about building a more peaceful world. It is a sweeping philosophical narrative in which Sen proposes that the murderous violence that plagues our society is driven as much by confusion as by inescapable hatred. Challenging the reductionist division of people by race, religion and class, Sen firmly presents an inspiring vision of a world that can be made to move toward peace as firmly as it has spiralled in recent years toward brutality and war. Characterised by Sens masterly prose, ease of erudion and ironic humour, the book tries to make sense of our existential confusion. This evening, Ananda Publishers hosts the launch of Parichiti-O-Hinsa [Essays], the Bengali translation of the book by Bhaswati Chakravorty. It will be formally launched by former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee in the presence of the author.                  Event: Launch of Parichiti-O-Hinsa, a Bengali translation of Amartya Sens Identity and Violence  The Illusion of Destiny

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power stays put day after
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Power stays put day after
          KINSUK BASU                                    
	The only bright spot on a dark night for Brazil fans was that there was no blackout.        
	Fears of a rerun of Thursdays serial transmission trip across Calcutta kept the power authorities on tenterhooks through Friday evening even as soccer and samba went Dutch in a shocking reversal of World Cup calculations.        
	Both CESC and the state-owned West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd had issued notices putting men and machine on maximum alert, asking them to treat the business end of the Cup as an emergency and even cancel leave if necessary.        
	Unless its unavoidable, our officials have been asked not to go on leave. We are definitely treating this phase (till July 11) as an emergency, said Moloy Dey, the chairman of the state power distribution company.         
	At CESC, officials overseeing the three command stations were asked to bolster their quick-response teams. We have already reinforced the breakdown team and the group dealing with low-tension faults, announced Aniruddha Bose, the companys vice-president (commercial).        
	The communiqus to different units followed a freak fault being confirmed as the reason for the power trip that had plunged much of Calcutta, including hospitals and the police headquarters, into darkness on Thursday. The blackout had ranged from 45 minutes to four hours in different areas.        
	In a post-mortem on Friday morning, the CESC top brass concluded that the blackout was the fallout of a series of trips that started in Budge Budge probably after the metal thread of a kite fell on an overhead tower line. As a result, transmission lines carrying around 500MW of power from three units in Budge Budge to the nearby Chakmir substation tripped immediately, an official explained.        
	The Chakmir substation supplies power to parts of central and north Calcutta.        
	Another line from Budge Budge, carrying around 250MW of power to the substation in Kasba, tripped because of a power surge that was triggered by the Chakmir line crashing even as generation was on. The domino effect continued with one of the units in Budge Budge going down as well. With demand rising, the generating stations at Titagarh on the northern fringes of the city and New Cossipore also collapsed, the official said.        
	The CESC top brass apparently spent most of Friday trying to put in place a back-up system for the rest of the World Cup. The state power utility also instructed its managers and divisional engineers to immediately take steps to reduce turnaround time.        
	Would the power utilities have shown similar urgency had the Cup not been underway? You cant afford to be slack when Calcutta is watching soccer, admitted Krishna Gupta, the managing director of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd.

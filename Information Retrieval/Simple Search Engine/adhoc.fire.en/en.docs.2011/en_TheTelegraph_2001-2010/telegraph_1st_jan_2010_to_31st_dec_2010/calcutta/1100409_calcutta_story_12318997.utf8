          A STAFF REPORTER                           Roshni Bala Mohanti recalls Thursday mornings horror moments. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	A duo looted Rs 45,000 in cash and valuables from a Jadavpur flat on Thursday morning after being led in by a carpenter hired by the household.        
	All three were arrested in a couple of hours and the robbed items recovered.        
	Police said the robbery was masterminded by 25-year-old Timir Biswas, a Nadia resident who earns his living by working as carpenter in city houses.        
	He had worked in the Jadavpur Central Park flat of the Mohantis, who hired him again recently to make a dressing table, said a police officer.        
	Timir turned up at the second-floor rented apartment around 9.45am when homemaker Roshni Bala Mohanti was alone, said Sunil Kumar Chowdhary, additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.        
	Husband Susanta, who works at British Oxygen Company in Taratala, had left home around 8am with the couples three-year-old daughter, a student of a kindergarten in the locality.        
	I was surprised seeing Timir as he was supposed to come on Saturday. But I let him in as he said he needed to take some measurements for the dressing table. He had worked here before and there was no reason to suspect him, Roshni said.        
	Asking him to wait in the living room, Roshni entered the kitchen when she suddenly found herself surrounded by two unknown men, one holding a knife to her throat.        
	The duo asked me to hand over the ornaments I had on, which included a gold chain with a diamond pendant. They also took away my cellphone and Rs 5,000 from my purse. They made me open the almirah but could not find anything there, recalled Roshni.        
	The two then pushed her into the bathroom and bolted the door from outside before fleeing. Recovering from the shock, Roshni quickly removed two glass panes from the window and cried out for help.        
	Neighbours, alerted by her screams, rushed upstairs, but the duo had fled by then in a taxi waiting for them at the entrance to the apartment block.        
	The neighbours later found Timir lying in a passage in the building. He claimed the robbers had assaulted him but his statements did not convince the residents, who called police. The carpenter revealed during interrogation that he was part of the gang. The duo  Raju Sarkar, 20, and Samir Biswas, 22  were picked up following a tip-off from Timir, said an officer.

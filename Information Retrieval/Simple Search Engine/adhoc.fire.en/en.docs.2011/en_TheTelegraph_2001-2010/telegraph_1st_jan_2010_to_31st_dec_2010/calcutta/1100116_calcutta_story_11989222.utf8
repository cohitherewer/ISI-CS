	A mob damaged a truck parked illegally on Lakshminarayantala Road in Shibpur after a DPS New Town school bus carrying students hit a motorcycle on Friday, injuring the rider. The injured biker, Tarun Nayek, 52, was admitted to a private hospital.        
	Witnesses said he and the bus driver were both unsighted by the truck. Residents blocked the road for an hour, demanding action against illegal parking in the area. The boys and girls in the bus had to be taken home by parents as the driver fled after the mishap.         
	Assault probe: Police have started a probe into the manhandling of policemen and burning of a constables uniform in Shyampukur on Thursday night after a pedestrian was run over by a lorry. Four persons were arrested for attacking policemen and throwing stones at vehicles.        
	The burnt uniform was found in a lane near the crossing of Shyampukur Road and Jatindra Mohan Avenue. A group of 300 people turned violent after 35-year-old Ranjit Das died in the mishap. They took away the uniform of a traffic constable posted in the area, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Body found: The decomposed body of a 60-year-old man was found in his Sovabazar Street house on Friday morning. Police said neighbours had not seen Prabir Kumar Bose for the past few days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suspect names Oxytown killer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Suspect names Oxytown killer
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths probing the Oxytown twin murders have claimed to have identified the actual killer who had allegedly hacked Mausumi Ghosh to death and killed her maid Parul by slitting her throat on September 27.        
	Sheikh Israfil, alias Sumon, had killed the homemaker and her maid with a knife. He is absconding and the murder weapon is yet to be recovered, said an investigating officer.        
	Cops said they learnt about Israfil from Somnath Tanti, who had been allegedly hired by Mausumis engineer husband Avik to kill her.        
	Avik was arrested in Bihars Munger, where he worked, on Saturday. He had allegedly plotted the murder because he was planning to marry a third time and Mausumi was refusing to divorce him.        
	On Friday, Tanti and two others  Sadaf Parvez and Safique Ahmed Khan  had been picked up from Thakurpukur. The trio had allegedly overpowered Mausumi before Israfil hacked her.        
	A police source said they could be taken to the Oxytown house on Monday night in an attempt to reconstruct the course of events leading to the double murder.        
	Tanti, the police said, has confessed to having taken Rs 2.5 lakh as an advance from Avik for killing Mausumi. He said he had bought a two-wheeler for Rs 80,000. The rest was spent on buying gold ornaments from a shop at Amtala, on Diamond Harbour Road, for his girlfriend, the officer said.        
	Tanti had also allegedly withdrawn money twice from Aviks accounts with a nationalised bank by forging his signature on cheques. The engineers cheque book was among the articles that went missing from the house after the murder.        
	Two cheques, for Rs 8,000 and Rs 55,000, were encashed at the Shibrampur and Bakultala branches on the souther fringes of the city, said an officer.        
	Avik, the sleuths said, had contacted Tanti thrice after Mausumis murder. The calls have been traced to PCOs in Munger.         
	The plot to kill Mausumi was hatched in the last week of August, said an officer.

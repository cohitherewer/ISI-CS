                      Camera vision                    Taking a look at the works of renowned cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, The Roving Eye features some of his major cinema made with German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder and American filmmaker Martin Scorsese. Ballhaus began his career as a stage photographer before he began working as a cinematographer for German network television in 1959. In 1970, he teamed up with cinema prodigy Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Their immensely productive professional relationship, which lasted for eight years, spawned 15 feature-length films. Among them were seminal works like Whity, Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant), Despair and Die Ehe der Maria Braun (The Marriage of Maria Braun). To be screened this evening is Chinesisches Roulette (Chinese Roulette; a scene from the film appears here). One of Fassbinders more obscure works, the film is also one of his towering achievements: a rigorous illumination of deception as a survival tactic, and a vicious indictment of victimhood, martyrdom and the games people will play in order to destroy one other.                  Event: Films that focus on the works of Michael Ballhaus When: Till May 1; at 6.30 pm Where: Max Mueller Bhavan auditorium

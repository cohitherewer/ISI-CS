The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Card rule flout rampant
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Card rule flout rampant

	Shoppers and shop owners in the city hardly follow the guidelines for credit and debit card use, increasing the chances of fraud.        
	The recent arrest of some of the alleged members of a million-dollar credit card cloning racket in the city has brought into focus the perils of plastic.         
	Its quite difficult to follow the safety guidelines every time I use a card. There are too many transactions that I have to make. I consider myself lucky that I havent been defrauded yet, said 28-year-old techie Jeetender Talreja, refuelling his sedan at a petrol pump in Shyambazar.        
	Bikash Jana, the 40-year-old cashier of the petrol pump, said: We never discourage customers from coming along to witness the swipe. But barely one in 10 customers does so.        
	Private bank employee Mansi Sharma, 26, said she felt embarrassed to insist at restaurants or retail outlets that her card be swiped in her presence.        
	She is not alone. Most card users Metro spoke to not only do not bother to be present where the card is being swiped, they also do not check the charge slips generated and bank statements carefully.        
	Card users should immediately report discrepancies in bills to the banks, opt for SMS alert for every transaction and destroy a card that would not be used to protect themselves against fraud.        
	For taking all the recommended steps all the time, one needs to be tech savvy, which many like me are not. Things were much less complicated and customers less vulnerable before the spread of the card culture, said Biswanath Bhattacharjee, 55, a trader.         
	Those behind the counter at malls or restaurants said they were willing to co-operate if a customer wanted to double check a transaction.        
	Accurate transactions are a must for our goodwill as well. But most customers dont seem to care, Vinayak Jain, 32, an employee at a Camac Street mall, told Metro.        
	Last week, a young woman was unsure about the amount entered during a transaction. I repeatedly requested her to call the bank helpline to clear her doubt. She shrugged and told me to forget about it. The transaction was of Rs 2,000-odd. What if it was of a higher value? asked Shirsh Tripathi, 38, employed at a central Calcutta eatery.

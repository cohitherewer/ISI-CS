The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Oxford boost for B-school
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Oxford boost for B-school
  - July 2011 launch with focus on retail        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A new B-school is aiming to bring a touch of Oxford to town.        
	The RPG Group on Friday announced the launch of the International Management Institute (IMI) with the Oxford Institute of Retail Management  a part of Oxford Universitys prestigious Said Business School as its global partner.        
	As an individual and as a company, we wanted to give this city one of the best educational institutes, said Sanjiv Goenka, the vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises.        
	The B-school, admission to which will be based on CAT, XAT and GMAT scores, is set to welcome the first batch into its Alipore campus next year.         
	One of the special features of the institute will be its focus on retail research, to be jointly undertaken with the Oxford Institute of Retail Management. The two partners have signed an agreement that aims to make the institute the leading centre of excellence in retail management in Asia.        
	India is an emerging retail market and nobody knows what the challenges of the future are going to be. It is an excellent idea to have an institute with its research focus on retail, said Richard Cuthbertson, the research director of the Oxford institute.        
	Talks are on to tie up with more institutes. We are negotiating with other top global business schools to bring them on board, revealed Goenka.        
	Retail management has gained popularity in India, thanks to a retail boom that has even survived the downturn. Right now there is a shortage of trained retail personnel in the country. With the economy moving out of recession mode, there will be a further boom in the market. Hence the need for a course like this, stressed Goenka. The RPG Group retail basket includes Music World and Spencers Retail.        
	Apart from retail management, the institute would offer specialisation in finance, human resource and healthcare, infrastructure, green technology and power management.        
	The three-acre campus in Alipore, now under construction, will have a hostel with 250 rooms. The Rs 100-crore project will be fully functional by the next academic session.        
	The full-time two-year postgraduate diploma course will start in July 2011, subject to clearance from the All India Council for Technical Education.        
	The course fee has not been fixed yet but it would be lower than that of the IIMs, Goenka promised. IIM Calcutta charges Rs 13.5 lakh for its flagship course.        
	The Alipore B-school will also draw on the experience, resources and reach of its predecessor in Delhi, set up 30 years ago.

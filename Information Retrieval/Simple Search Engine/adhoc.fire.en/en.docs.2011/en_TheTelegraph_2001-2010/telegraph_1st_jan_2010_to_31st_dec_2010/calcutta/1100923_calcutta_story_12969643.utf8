	The long wait for landslide-hit roads to be reopened is telling on tourists and trekkers from Bengal stranded in different parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.        
	Mihir Kumar Mukherjee, 65, had left Calcutta on a package tour of Himachal Pradesh along with 11 family members on September 10. The holiday started well but went horribly wrong when heavy rain triggered a series of landslides that have forced the family to be holed up in Sangla, of Kinnaur district, for the last four days.        
	My granddaughter Kaushiki is ill. We took her to the local health centre but the way things are going, we are really worried for her, said Mukherjee, a resident of Kalyani.        
	The entire family has been surviving on rationed food priced so high that they are fast running out of cash.        
	As many as 32 tourists from Bengal are stranded at Debi Resorts in Sangla. Three trekkers in a group of eight have been reported missing in Uttarakhand.        
	We started from Uttarkashi, heading towards Badrinath via Kalindi pass. Five of us turned back from Vasuki Tal and reached Uttarkashi but the rest are yet to return. We are unable to contact them, said Shyamaprasad Ghosh of Howrah.        
	Ghosh and his fellow trekkers Niloy Mukhopadhyay, Sudipto Mitra, Preetam Meyur and Anjan Doloi are trying to mobilise the authorities to search for the missing trio  N.P. Rao, Anal Das and Dr Arun Adak.        
	For those stranded in Sangla, the indefinite wait has been compounded by the alleged apathy of the district authorities.                                       
	A team of officials did visit the resort on Wednesday afternoon but had no answer to their problems. All we want is an assurance that they will organise some food for us till such time the roads are cleared. We were told that another six days are required to remove the debris, said Mukherjee.        
	The presence of children and infants in the Sangla group  aged between one and 11 years  has added to the worries of the tourists.         
	What will they eat if they are stranded for a few more days? Where will they get the money to pay for things? There are no ATMs nearby and it has been raining still, said Samar Ghosh, whose wife Aparna is in the group.         
	Shambo Banerjee, an MBA student who spent four days in a village called Maletha near Kirtinagar in Uttarakhand along with his father and mother, finally reached Hardwar through an alternative route on Wednesday.        
	There was total lack of information. Many people wouldnt have been stranded had the authorities guided them, said Shambo.        
	Chief secretary Ardhendu Sen said at Writers Buildings that the resident commissioner in Delhi, Bhaskar Khulbey, was monitoring the situation and taking necessary steps in consultation with the Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand authorities.        
	 We have come to know that at present three tourists remain to be rescued in Uttarkashi. We are waiting for information from other places, said home secretary Samar Ghosh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro coaches set to debut
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro coaches set to debut
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two Metro rakes would be introduced soon, railway minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday after admitting the delay in getting new trains.         
	The arrival of new Metro trains has been delayed. But two rakes will come in a few days, the minister said at a programme at Sealdah station to flag off a Sealdah-Baruipur ladies special and introduce a digital public address system.         
	Two of the 13 new Metro rakes, sanctioned by the Railway Board, were scheduled to roll out of the coach factory in Perambur last September. The deadline was revised to March but railway officials said it could not be met.        
	The orders were placed well in advance but there were a lot of delays. Manufacturing units are few in comparison to the demand for wagons. That is why a number of wagon and coach manufacturing units are being set up, said Mamata.         
	Coach manufacturing units are coming up at Kanchrapara in North 24-Parganas, Burdwan and Haldia, among other places.         
	According to the plan, the 13 new Metro rakes would be air-conditioned. Once the trains arrive, 11 of the existing rakes would be phased out while seven would be overhauled at the mid-life rehabilitation factory of Metro, being set up at Noapara.        
	Mamata also announced a special train  the Aurobindo Express  that would run from Calcutta to Pondicherry on April 10 to mark 100 years of Sri Aurobindos journey from the city to Pondicherry.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Snag stalls Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An air-conditioned rake developed a snag and stalled Metro services for 16 minutes on Tuesday.        
	The train got stuck because of a technical problem while changing tracks at Dum Dum station around 1.45pm, said a spokesperson.         
	After offloading passengers at Dum Dum, trains have to change tracks for the journey to New Garia. The rake was taken to the Noapara maintenance shed for repairs.        
	According to the spokesperson, trains were stalled for 16 minutes because of this and even after the services resumed around 2pm, there were chain delays.         
	Passengers faced a harrowing time because of the glitch. Passengers of three trains were jostling for space on one train, said P. Mondal, a commuter.        
	The AC rakes are being run without proper trial and so are developing snags, said D. Mukherjee, general secretary, Metro Rail Workmens Union.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools punch holes in spot assessment
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Schools punch holes in spot assessment
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          An ICSE exam in progress                                  
	The heads of Anglo-Indian schools affiliated to the ISC/ICSE council have alleged that academic activities are being disrupted because of centralised (or spot) assessment of answer scripts of Class X and XII exams.        
	The principals of the schools said classes were being affected as each institution had to depute eight to 12 teachers on assessment duty.        
	The centralised evaluation started three weeks ago and is still on. With so many teachers away for so long, how can I run the school? I am afraid we wont get time to cover the entire syllabus, said the principal of a prominent central Calcutta school.        
	The principals discussed the issue at a meeting last Friday and unanimously decided to lodge a complaint with the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations.        
	In an attempt to expedite the publication of ICSE/ISC results and make the evaluation error-free, the council has decided not to allow teachers to take answer scripts home for evaluation.        
	Instead, from this year, teachers have to assess the scripts at designated centres. The schools have been asked to grant 15 days leave to the teachers who will be on assessment duty.        
	The Central Board of Secondary Education introduced the system a few years ago following a suggestion from the Union human resource development ministry.        
	We welcome the move but would like to urge the council to consider the difficulties the schools are facing because of so many teachers being sent for assessment of scripts, said Gillian Rosemary Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School and the president of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools.        
	Some of the school heads feel the council should give them the liberty to decide on the number of teachers they could send for marking papers.        
	In some schools, the teachers have lodged complaints saying they cannot do justice to students if they are forced to evaluate 30-40 scripts each every day. Centralised evaluation has been introduced to eliminate chances of error in assessing answer scripts. But how can we ensure flawless marking if each of us has to mark 30-40 scripts a day? said the principal of a south Calcutta school who did not want to be named.        
	Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive of the council, however, said he had not received any complaint. The centralised evaluation is going on fine across the country.

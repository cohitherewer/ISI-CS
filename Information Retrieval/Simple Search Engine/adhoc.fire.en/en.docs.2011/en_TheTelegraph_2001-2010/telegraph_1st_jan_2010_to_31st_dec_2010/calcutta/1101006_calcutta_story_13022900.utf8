          OUR BUREAU                          Shouvik Bhadra at Chandernagore police station after being rescued. (Ananda Das)                                  
	The Sector V techie who went missing on NH2 on the way to his parents Durgapur home was rescued from a room in a Chandernagore slum on Tuesday morning. Two of the men who had allegedly abducted him were arrested.        
	According to police, Shouvik Bhadras parents had paid between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7 lakh to the abductors, who are from the districts. The family did not confirm or deny the claim.        
	Gang members spotted Shouvik, an employee of Nokia-Siemens Networks and a resident of New Town, eating at a dhaba at Shaktigarh and working on a laptop. He had stopped at the dhaba while riding to Durgapur on Thursday night.        
	Near Budbud, an Omni and a motorcycle blocked my bikes path. There were six men. Pointing a gun, they made me board the Omni and blindfolded me, recounted Shouvik.        
	We drove around for nearly 24 hours before they removed my blindfold. I read Chandernagore on a glow sign. I was then taken to a house in the slum, he added.         
	They forced me to call up my parents and ask them to pay a ransom. During one such call I was able to inform my mother that I was being kept in a slum, said Shouvik.        
	Investigators, who had managed to trace the calls to Chandernagore, started looking for a slum where outsiders had moved in recently.        
	Following another lead, Burdwan police arrested an alleged gang member at a hideout in Memari on Monday night.         
	We found out from him that they were not professionals. They are basically car and truck hijackers who operate between Palsit and Shaktigarh on NH-2. The gang members are from Memari in Burdwan, Chandernagore and Chinsurah in Hooghly and Jagaddal in North 24-Parganas, said an officer.        
	Chandernagore police received information on Tuesday morning that six men had rented a room in Debipur slum in the town a fortnight ago. We raided the room around 11am and found Shouvik. We also arrested one of the gang members, said Tanmoy Roy Chowdhuri, the superintendent of Hooghly police.        
	The man arrested from the slum claimed his name was Surjit Singh and that he hailed from Balia in Uttar Pradesh. He said he had joined the gang recently.        
	According to an investigator, this was the first kidnap by the gang.        
	Shouvik said his kidnappers also made him sign a cheque for Rs 50,000 but it was not encashed.         
	They purchased an LCD television and a refrigerator using my ATM card. They showed their purchases to me. There were four people with me. This morning, three of them hurriedly dressed and left moments before the police entered the room, said Shouvik, adding that the abductors had asked for Rs 10 lakh as ransom from his parents.        
	He was taken to Burdwan on Tuesday evening and will be produced in court on Wednesday morning.        
	Shouviks parents, who had lodged a missing complaint, were tightlipped about whether they had paid a ransom or not.        
	My son was not let off easily. But I dont want to say anything about it. We are very glad that he is going to be back home soon, said the techies mother, Shobha.

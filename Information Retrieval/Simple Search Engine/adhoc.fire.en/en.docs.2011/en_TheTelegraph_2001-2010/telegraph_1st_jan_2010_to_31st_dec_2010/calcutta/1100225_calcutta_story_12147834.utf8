The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police blamed for rampage after mishap 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Police blamed for rampage after mishap 
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                           A burning bus at the mishap site. (Soumen Bhattacharjee)                                  
	The damage and disruption caused by a handful of youths have raised questions about the role of police following the accident on VIP Road that claimed a teenager on Tuesday evening.         
	Police sources and witnesses said the mob could torch four buses and damage 40 cars because the officers on the spot failed to assess the situation, chalk out a strategy and take the standard steps to prevent crowd trouble.        
	The policemen looked helpless when the vandals struck. We had to pull down the shutters of our shops in fear. There was complete lawlessness last evening, said the owner of a furniture store that overlooks the scene of vandalism.         
	The first mistake we made was underestimate the youths who had gathered at the spot. Moreover, we should have sanitised the stretch before leaving, said an officer who was part of Tuesdays operation.        
	About 500 people, who had blocked the road near the spot, were forced to disperse by the cops but 20-25 youths reassembled and started damaging vehicles as soon as the men in uniform marched away.        
	The vandalism could have been prevented if the nearly 200 policemen who were deployed followed the rulebook. There are specific ways to lathicharge. The officers started charging from one point instead of dispersing people standing in groups and vacating most of the area before heading towards the core bunch of agitators. There could have been a stampede, said an instructor at the police training school at Barrackpore.        
	The force should have split into three or four groups. With the first group standing guard near the body, the second could have chased away the mob and the third could have ensured vehicular movement. The vehicles that were stuck because of the blockade became easy targets, added the trainer.        
	Saikat Mukherjee, a LIC official whose black Ford Ikon was damaged, recounted the horror of being attacked by a mob with all routes of escape closed. The windscreens of my car were shattered. My driver managed to leave the car before the stones landed. Otherwise he would have suffered serious injuries, he said.        
	I have been left shaken by the incident. Each time my car stopped at a crossing today, I felt nervous, he added.        
	The 12 men arrested in connection with the incident were remanded in judicial custody for seven days after being produced in Barasat court on Wednesday.

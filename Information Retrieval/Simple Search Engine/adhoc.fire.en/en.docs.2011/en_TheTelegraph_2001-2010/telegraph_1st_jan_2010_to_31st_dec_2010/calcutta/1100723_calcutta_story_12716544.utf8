                      Saying it with letters                    Performed by Mumbai-based company Rage, Love Letters is perhaps Indias longest running English play. Successful the world over, this endearing play (written by A.R. Gurney) has, in fact, been performed by many theatre groups the world over since its debut in 1988, besides being nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Offering a heart-warming look at friendship and love, it is the story of two very different people  told through their letters. Andy Ladd III and Melissa Gardner write letters to each other over a period of 50 years. Childhood friends, Andy, who is a serious, down-to-earth attorney, and Melissa, a lively, free-spirited artist, are total opposites in terms of character and temperament. Yet, they share a lifetime of experiences through a voluminous series of letters and notes written from the age of six to 60. Poignant, romantic, heart-breaking and frequently funny, their correspondence follows a bittersweet path of boarding schools, marriage, children, divorce and missed opportunities. Its the life journey of two soulmates enacted through words, both written and unsaid, who share the greatest gift of all  love. Starring: Rajit Kapur and Shernaz Patel. Direction: Rahul da Cunha. Presented in aid of Concern India Foundation in association with Anamika Kala Sangam.

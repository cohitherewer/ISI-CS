The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic haywire after cave-in
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Traffic haywire after cave-in
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The subsidence near Raj Bhavan threw the morning rush-hour traffic haywire, forcing police to change the route chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy takes on its way to Writers Buildings.        
	Traffic on the road in front of the western gate of Raj Bhavan, part of which caved in, was suspended for almost half an hour till police put in place an effective diversion plan.        
	From 9am to 9.25am, traffic was suspended along the road. From 9.25am, all vehicles heading south down Council House Street was diverted through BBD Bag North, BBD Bag East and Old Court House Street, said a senior traffic police officer.        
	Vehicles heading for NS Road from Strand Road were asked to travel further north in an attempt to minimise congestion in the central business district.        
	The chief minister had to make a detour on his way to office from his Palm Avenue residence.        
	Bhattacharjees convoy was diverted through Government Place North from Council House Street. It then travelled through Old Court House Street, BBD Bag South, NS Road and BBD Bag North to reach Writers.        
	Vehicles heading towards Red Road was allowed to ply down the stretch where the cave-in occurred after 2pm, by which time the crater had been fenced.        
	Traffic crawled along the stretch, with cops struggling to manage the situation over their manpacks.        
	The ripple effect of the cave-in and the subsequent diversion of traffic left several arteries choked and vehicles jostling for space. The affected stretches were RR Avenue, Red Road, Mayo Road and Goshto Pal Sarani.        
	Things became difficult when judges were heading for the high court. There cannot be any hold-up on a judges way. The same thing happened in the evening but we managed to pull it off, said a senior officer.

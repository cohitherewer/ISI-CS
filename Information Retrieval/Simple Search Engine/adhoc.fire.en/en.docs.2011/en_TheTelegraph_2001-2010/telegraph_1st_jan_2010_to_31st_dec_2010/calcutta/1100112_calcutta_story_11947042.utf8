The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Debut on food street
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Debut on food street
          SUBHRO SAHA                                      
	The man who proved that there is life for the Calcutta foodie beyond Park Street is coming full circle with a signature speciality address in the citys original fine dining corridor.        
	Anjan Chatterjees Flame N Grill, the kebabs-and-biryani combo chain under Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd, is set to lay its tables on Park Street this Poila Boisakh with its combination of wholesome food and bite-till-you-burp deals that have skewered the competition elsewhere.        
	I have always loved Park Street. When we started Mainland China on Gurusaday Road in May 2000, Park Street in general wasnt doing too well. Over this past decade, the place has evolved and is now ready for a concept like Flame N Grill, Chatterjee told Metro.        
	Park Street veterans like musician and t2 food critic Nondon Bagchi think the more the merrier for those who frequent the citys food street. Park Street has a generous soul and this wonderful ability to embrace new entities. So Anjan Chatterjee coming here with his kebabs and biryanis is not a bad thing at all, he said.        
	So do the established eateries see Flame N Grills entry as food for thought?         
	I dont think it will affect our footfalls at all because we have a faithful clientele prepared to wait it out rather than experiment, said Rajiv Kothari, owner of Bar-B-Q and Flavours of China on Park Street.        
	The likes of Peter Cat and Bar-B-Q may not be fazed but those in the business agree that the Speciality Restaurants groups Park Street debut will perk up the scene.        
	Anirban Simlai of The Park said Flame N Grill could bring more diners to Park Street rather than wooing customers away from the established eateries. This new place will actually grow the spread and attract more footfall, which augurs well for the wine-and-dine hub, he added.        
	For die-hard Flame N Grill fan Ashesh Mukherjee of Golf Gardens, the new 170-cover restaurant slated to open on April 14 will be a reason to return to Park Street for dinner with my family. The unlimited buffet spread will cost Rs 275 for lunch and Rs 375 for dinner. The restaurant will also have an open section from 3 to 7pm, serving light bites and liquor.        
	The Park Street Flame N Grill is part of Chatterjees Rs 25-crore investment plans for the state over the next two years. Speciality Restaurants is also bringing a new Chinese-cuisine format to City Centre, New Town, apart from a second Machaan outlet. The first one is in Mani Square.        
	Another large-format interactive food theatre is being planned for the city, besides a 24x7 restaurant for Salt Lake, said Chatterjee.

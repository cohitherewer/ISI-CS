	Head for Naya on November 26 for a mix of art and music in a rural setting. Its the story of a village dressing up to attract the city.         
	Naya, a village in Pingla block in West Midnapore district, will hold Pot Maya, a three-day festival to celebrate the success of the local artistes in reviving their heritage.        
	Naya is a village of chitrakars. They are a unique tribe of folk artistes who are painters, lyricists, singers and performers rolled into one. They sing the stories they paint in frames on long scrolls of cloth.        
	Almost every house here has at least one artiste. There is Anwar, who won the Presidents award in 2006; Yakub and Manimala, who recently went to London and Liverpool; then there is Moyna who has been to China with her artwork; and Dukhushyam, well known to many in the artists circle in Calcutta.         
	The patachitra village is only 20 minutes from Balichak, which is located near Panskura and can be reached by local trains from Howrah. By road, you need to take the NH6, turn left from Debra towards Balichak, go up to Mundamari and then again turn left to reach Naya.        
	The patuas are all excited about the upcoming Pot Maya. They are painting their houses with patachitra motifs, getting ready to share the technicalities of their art, including how to make natural colours, and arranging for visitors stay.         
	A new resource centre, which has come up with the support of NGO banglanatak dot com and the European Union, has infused new life into the festival. The artistes will be showcasing 100-year-old pata scrolls.         
	During the festival artistes from Nadia will perform Baul-Fakiri-Qawali, artistes from Purulia will perform Chhau and Poter Gaan will be performed by local artistes.         
	So Moyna Chitrakar is decking the newly built first floor of her house for guests; Dukhushyam has booked the Peer-er Gaan-er Dol (a group of spiritual folk singers); Manu-Mantu-Malek are putting finishing touches to the decorations; Rupsana-Bapi-Jaba are leading the village-cleaning operation.         
	A local decorator has been appointed to make additional arrangements for visitors to sleep at night on rooftops. Overall, there are arrangements for about 150 people to stay overnight. The villagers will procure mineral water for the guests.         
	Eight temporary toilets, separate ones for men and women, in addition to four permanent bathrooms, have been constructed. They have also set up a temporary medical camp.         
	On Sunday, November 28, the entire village will join the guests for lunch. The village is full of scroll-paintings hanging from trees. There are special light arrangements for guests at night.

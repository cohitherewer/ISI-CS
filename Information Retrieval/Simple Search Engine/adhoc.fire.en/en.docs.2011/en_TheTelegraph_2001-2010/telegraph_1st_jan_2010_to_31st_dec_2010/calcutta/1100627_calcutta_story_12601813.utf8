The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Talk to me
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Talk to me
          The elderly are calling helplines to overcome loneliness, reports Chandreyee Ghose                       A still from Ballygunge Court, which dealt with the lives of senior citizens living in highrises       Legal Aid      The law is on their side, though many senior citizens are not aware of how it empowers them. 
    The free legal cell of Calcutta High Court offers help to the elderly. 
  
				 ldquo;They can take up abuse-related issues directly with the unit and their cases will be fought for free, rdquo; says Kaushik Gupta, an advocate with Calcutta High Court.
    Section 125 Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (Order for maintenance of wives, children and parents) compels a child or heir to provide for his dependent parents. 
    An elderly woman facing abuse or turned out of the house by her children can also lodge a complaint under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. If there is any evidence of abuse the children can be jailed. 
    A male victim can seek justice under Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code. 
    The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, has had few takers so far, says Calcutta High Court advocate Jaymalya Bagchi. But this Act compels a child or heir to provide maintenance, including food, clothing, residence and medical attendance, up to Rs 10,000 to parents, including adoptive parents or step-parents.                     
	A crowded lane off Sarat Bose Road takes you to Ballygunge police station. As you enter, you find on the right Pronam, the Senior Citizen Emergency Co-ordination Control Room. Shukla Taraphdar, its administrator, sits inside the office taking calls over a cup of tea. Many of our members dont need immediate attention. They just want to talk to someone, she says.        
	Since mid-2009, the city has seen a spurt of helplines catering to the elderly. The phones have been fairly busy, indicating that a large number of the four lakh over-60 population in the city are turning to a helpline. Many of them call only to hear a voice at the other end.         
	Recently we got a call from a retired professor who was suffering from bouts of depression since her sister moved to another city. With her only son settled abroad, she wanted someone to enjoy cha and adda with, says Taraphdar.         
	She is not always asked to enjoy an adda. Sometimes we even help a member arrange for something as basic as cooking gas, adds Taraphdar with a laugh, which is a far cry from Pronams initial objective of providing only emergency medical help to senior citizens living alone. Once we had to counsel the six children of a woman, none of whom was willing to pay the medical bills, says Taraphdar. She sat with the family for hours in her office till a solution was reached. Another time we had helped hospitalise the father but the son, who lived elsewhere in the city, did not turn up. Later I had a tough time trying to improve the father-son relationship, says Taraphdar. One of her duties includes checking on these members from time to time.         
	Since its inception on June 27, 2009, Pronam, an initiative of Calcutta police, has had 1,577 members. It says it is a pioneer of sorts. Other metros also have helplines for senior citizens but most are concerned with providing security to the elderly. Pronam provides a comprehensive service, from counselling the elderly to even organising social gatherings for them, claims special additional commissioner of police Banibrata Basu.         
	Pronam is not the only helpline that has diversified. A smaller organisation, Healing Touch, which has been running a 24-hour medical emergency helpline for senior citizens since January 2007, now doubles as a counselling service for the lonely  unofficially. Complex cases are referred to psychiatrists, Dr Dhires Chowdhury, in charge of Healing Touch, is quick to add.         
	Mental block         
	But picking up the phone and telling a stranger, even if he or she is sympathetic, about being beaten up by children is not easy.         
	Puja Basu, a lawyer in charge of the Helpage helplines, says she gets around 140 calls a month and about 60 per cent of the callers just want to talk. Not all callers pour out their troubles the minute they pick up the receiver. Some dont even want to say they are lonely. It is up to us to win their confidence and make them open up, she says.                   HELP A CALL AWAY      Pronam: 24190740 
    Dignity Foundation: 30690999
    Helpage India: 1800-345-1253
    Healing Touch: 65160058, 9903388556

	Some open up later. Some are not ready to go beyond talking about themselves. One of our members is often assaulted by his wife and son. He shares his plight with us but refuses to file a police complaint. So in the end our hands were tied, says Leena Das, a social worker with Dignity Foundation, Calcutta chapter.        
	Most callers hail from apartments of south Calcutta, many of whom suffer from depression. Perhaps higher awareness about the helplines prevails in these buildings. Maybe the joint family system in the north still manages to keep old-age blues at bay. When you are cooped up alone in a small flat you feel the need to open up to an outsider, says Das. The 10-year-old organisation set up its 9am to 9pm helpline in the city on January 14.         
	A new helpline, Sanjhbaati, is getting calls from the districts too. Established by an NGO, Scope, in April, it gets regular calls from Ranaghat, Dum Dum and Barasat. Often we counsel depressed grandparents whose grandchildren have little time for them now, says Sumana Sengupta, the secretary of Scope.         
	Abuse and property disputes are forcing more and more elders to seek legal advice. According to a recent Helpage survey conducted in eight cities and covering over 1,000 senior citizens, 22.8 per cent of Calcuttas senior citizens face abuse  the highest percentage in the eight cities.         
	Abuse, disputes and loneliness have always plagued older people, and in every place. What has increased in recent years in Calcutta is the awareness among senior citizens. They are now ready to look for help in the face of atrocities, says Susmita Ghosh, national director (east and north), Helpage India, which started its helpline on July 26, 2009.         
	Lifestyle changes, which picked up later in the city and are taking place at a breakneck speed now, have left an impact. Real-estate prices have escalated in Calcutta as also the cost of living. Maybe that has prompted a recent spurt in crime against parents for property, she says.         
	Loneliness is universal. Those living with children are neglected too. A hectic job life leaves children with little time for old parents, she adds. EMIs have to be paid.         
	Lawyers as monitors        
	Given the demand for legal advice, most helplines have an advocate on board. In Helpage India, Basu attends to all the calls herself. Though the survey claims that 40.3 per cent of the elderly are aware of their legal rights in Calcutta, helpline monitors claim otherwise. The callers are often not aware that their children may be legally bound to pay them maintenance. Making such victims aware of their rights is our primary responsibility, says Taraphdar.         
	Some helplines offer free medical advice from doctors. Dignity Foundation offers a day-care dementia centre too. Its helpline gets around two to four calls daily. Sometimes even a neighbour or a friend of an abused senior citizen calls.         
	The number of calls related to property issues has compelled us to have an advocate on board. Many senior citizens these days want to reverse mortgage their property to remain financially independent, says Avijit Ghosh, the general manager of Dignity Foundation. Reverse mortgage is a loan given to senior citizens on the basis of the worth the property. To reclaim the property, the son or daughter has to pay the loan.         
	But the senior citizens face objection at home on this. We have often tried to intervene in such cases and support our members, adds Ghosh.        
	Abandonment of the elderly is so common in Calcutta that many senior citizens want to ascertain their legal rights in advance directly from a lawyer, adds Basu from Helpage.         
	Meanwhile, the helplines are turning into a social networking outlets for the lonely. Pronams picnics and sports see a huge turnout. Dignity Foundation offers companionship to some callers while their chayer adda and film festival are open for all.         
	Its communication that most senior citizens are looking for. So there should be more dedicated interactive groups to help them come out of their shell, says Sajni Mukherji, a former Jadavpur University professor who writes on senior citizens issues.         
	In the West, state-sponsored carers visit senior citizens regularly, take them shopping, help out in cooking and spend the whole day with them. That provides a lot of scope for interaction. Wish we had some such government-sponsored set-up in India, she adds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shower spells at night 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shower spells at night 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city experienced spells of heavy showers since Sunday evening.        
	However, heavy rain is unlikely in the next few days. Conditions like last weeks are likely to prevail during the first half of this week, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	There was little rain during the day on Sunday.         
	The weatherman said the wet spell at night would keep the mercury in check on Monday morning.        
	Saturday afternoons rainfall had kept the minimum temperature below normal at 25.2 degrees Celsius.         
	In its Saturday forecast, the India Meteorological Department had said south Bengals coastal regions and Calcutta would get a substantial amount of rain and thundershowers on Sunday because of the thunderclouds that had formed over the region under the influence of a low-pressure formation in the vicinity.        
	The influence of the formation died out sooner than hoped. The thunderclouds did not bring the anticipated amount of rainfall, said an IMD official.        
	The weather in the evening and Monday morning would have been much more pleasant had there been more rain on Sunday. The mercury, during this time of the year, is not influenced by scattered light rain or drizzle, said a Met official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scare over flier note to pilot
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scare over flier note to pilot
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Captain, fly me to Houston, US, 60 degree north, scribbled a flier to the pilot on a Jorhat-Calcutta flight on Friday afternoon, sparking security concerns on air and on the ground.        
	Tarun Mahanta, in his mid-40s, wrote the note on the back of his boarding card and asked a cabin crew member to hand it over to the pilot of the Jet Airways flight.         
	Police claimed Mahanta, who said he was a Jorhat-based paediatrician, was mentally unstable. I have a direct link with god and I wanted to go to Houston because he asked me to be there, he reportedly told cops during interrogation.         
	Mahanta, who was arrested, sent the note to the pilot 45 minutes before the flight was to land at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, said airline sources.        
	According to an airport official, after receiving the message, the pilot directed the crew member who had carried it to the cabin to ask Mahanta what he meant. But the flier only said that he wanted to go to the US.        
	The pilot contacted the air traffic control (ATC) and sought security assistance. He also asked the crew to keep an eye on Mahanta. The three sky marshals on board kept a close watch on him. Though he was not violent, he seemed restless, added the airline official.         
	A team of CISF commandos waited at the Dum Dum parking bay for the flight to land. Mahanta was detained after he disembarked along with other passengers.

          RITH BASU                          A Geminid meteor shower                                  
	Brave the night chill, climb up to the terrace and feast your eyes on the years brightest meteor shower  the Geminid.        
	The celestial fireworks will be at their dazzling best for four hours from 12.30am on Tuesday.        
	Weather permitting, everybody in India should be able to see the beautiful sight of numerous meteors streaking across the night sky from the constellation of the Gemini for four hours on Monday night, said Debiprosad Duari, director (research and academic), MP Birla Planetarium.        
	The Geminid gets its name from Gemini as the meteors seem to emanate from a spot near Pollux and Castor, two stars in the constellation.        
	The Geminid, billed as the most intense meteor shower of the year, is rich in fireballs and can be seen from almost any point on earth. It will reach its peak between 12.30am and 4.30am, Duari added.        
	Meteors, also called shooting stars, are bright streaks of light resulting from friction between air and rocky substances travelling towards earth at a tremendous speed. The rocky matter can also be specks of dust.                  The Gemini constellation as it will look like early   on Tuesday 
  Occurrence: 12.30am to 4.30am 
  Visibility: Likely to be good, with weatherman predicting clear sky      
	When earth in its movement around the sun cuts into the path of cosmic debris, the particles enter its atmosphere and the gravity pulls them towards the surface at a high speed  sometimes at 30-50km per second, Duari said.        
	Meteor showers are annual events but the show is different each year, depending on the timing and the position of the moon.        
	Calcuttans have a good chance of viewing Geminid 2010 because the moon will not be very bright and will set around 11.40pm in the city sky.        
	On Monday night, earth will pass through the debris believed to have been produced after the collision between asteroid 3200 Phaethon and another asteroid, most probably Pallas. What clinches it for the Geminid this year is that earth will cut across a very dense part of the debris cloud and one should be able to see 60 to 80 meteors shooting across the sky, Duari said.        
	For a still better view of the luminous showers, Duari suggests Calcuttans should head towards sparsely populated areas and open fields, places that are free from light pollution.

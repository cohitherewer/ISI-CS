The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sourav and Sunday boost to ticket sales
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sourav and Sunday boost to ticket sales
  - Beeline for passage to Eden after KKR win          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                            The cause and the effect: Sourav Ganguly and Shah Rukh Khan at Eden on Thursday; a queue for tickets at City Centre on Friday. (Pabitra Das amp; Anindya Shankar Ray)                                       
	Tickets for Super Sunday at Eden are disappearing at T20 speed with Sourav Gangulys Thursday thunder setting the stage for a full house when Kolkata Knight Riders takes on Kings XI Punjab.        
	Dada ki phatiye khel-lo re! Teentey chhokkar over-ta dekhechhis (What a performance from Dada! Did you see the over where he hit three sixes)? was the buzz on Friday as fans braved the mid-day sun to queue up in front of the ticket counters at Mohammedan Sporting Club on the Maidan.        
	The story was the same at other outlets across the city selling IPL tickets. The counters at City Centre and South City together clocked sales worth close to Rs 2 lakh on Friday.        
	 Double of yesterday, said Samsur Jaman at South City, where a queue had formed even before the counter opened. Those who came looking for Rs 500 tickets but didnt get any happily paid more than double for seats in the Rs 1,200 stand.        
	Prabhas Goswami, manning the City Centre counter, said there was a constant stream of ticket hunters through the day.        
	Apart from the winning Sourav and Sunday combination, what has set the KKR cash registers ringing are the convenient 4-7.30pm match schedule and the prospect of another star shower.         
	Our board exams are also finally over, exclaimed Dewank Harbhajanka, a CBSE examinee desperate to watch his first IPL match at the Eden.        
	Goutam Goswami, the secretary of the South Dinajpur District Sports Association, was in the City Centre queue to buy 25 tickets for Sunday and 20 each for the matches on April 17 and 19. He may have retired but Dada remains an icon. There is no sight in the game better than him playing well at the Eden Gardens, he said.         
	Ditto for Joyita Das, a cellphone company employee headed for the counter at Forum on Elgin Road.        
	So is every fan convinced that KKR has turned the corner? IT employee Abhishek Talukdar, who was despondent after the Knight Riders went down to the Chennai Super Kings without a fight, is on a high since Thursday. Going by the last performance, I think I should invest in a jersey, he smiled.         
	The team winning is always good news for ticket sales. We are waiting for Fridays figures to come in, said KKR official Jeet Banerjee.

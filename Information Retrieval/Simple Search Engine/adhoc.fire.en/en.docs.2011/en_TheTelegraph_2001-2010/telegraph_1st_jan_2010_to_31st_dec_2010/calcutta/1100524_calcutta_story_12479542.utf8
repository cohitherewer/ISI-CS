The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 16-hour wait on platform
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      16-hour wait on platform
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Hundreds of passengers spent Saturday night on the Howrah station platform after an express train that was to leave for Jammu was cancelled three hours before departure.        
	Passengers of the 2331 Up Himgiri Express had started arriving at the station, when around 9pm they were told that the train had been cancelled. The trains departure was scheduled at 11.55pm.         
	The train had to be cancelled as the corresponding Up train did not reach Howrah on time, said a railway official. The railway ran a special train to Jammu on Sunday afternoon.        
	We reached the station around 9pm. A little later, we got to know that the train had been cancelled. Railway officials could not tell us why the train was cancelled, said Sudipto Debnath, a Tollygunge resident who was to take the train. He was part of a group going to Jammu on vacation.        
	Agitated passengers demonstrated in front of the ticket counter and gheraoed railway employees. Around 3.15am, the passengers were told that a special train had been arranged for them at 1.30pm on Sunday.        
	But when the passengers went to get tickets for the special train, booking clerks said they had no information about it.         
	While some passengers hailing from the city managed to return home, many were forced to spend the night on the station premises.        
	The railway did not arrange for our accommodation. That was the least it could have done given that we had to spend 16 hours on the platform because of their problems, said Mamata Debnath, one of the stranded passengers.        
	Tickets for the special train were finally issued on Sunday afternoon, shortly before it left for Jammu.        
	A travel agent who had booked tickets for a 45-member group from Midnapore said 10 of them decided not to take the train after spending the night on tenterhooks.

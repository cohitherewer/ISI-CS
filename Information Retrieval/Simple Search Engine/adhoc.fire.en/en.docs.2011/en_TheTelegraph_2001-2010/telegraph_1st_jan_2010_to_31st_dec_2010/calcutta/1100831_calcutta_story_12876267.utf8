                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Time-table thrown off track
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Train schedules to and from Howrah went haywire for several hours on Monday following the derailment of the Rajdhani Express in Baruipara.        
	Ten long-distance trains had to be diverted and three local trains cancelled. Six local trains were delayed by an hour on an average.        
	More trains would have been delayed or cancelled had the Rajdhani been running on the Down track. The train was on the middle track, which left the two pairs of main tracks free, an official said.        
	Two local trains between Howrah and Chandanpore and another between Burdwan and Howrah were cancelled.        
	Among the long-distance trains that were diverted through Bandel from Shaktigarh were the Mumbai-Howrah Mail via Allahabad, Secunderabad-Guwahati Express and the Howrah-New Delhi Yuva Express. The diversion resulted in the trains arriving in Howrah an hour behind schedule, said an official.        
	A number of long-distance trains, such as the Varanasi-Sealdah Express, were detained at various stations.        
	The railway authorities didnt provide us any information about the delay, alleged Monojit Roy, a passenger of the Varanasi-Sealdah Express.        
	It was an unforeseen incident and our men rushed to the spot and started restoration work on a war footing. The inconvenience the passengers face couldnt be avoided, an official of Eastern Railways Howrah division said.

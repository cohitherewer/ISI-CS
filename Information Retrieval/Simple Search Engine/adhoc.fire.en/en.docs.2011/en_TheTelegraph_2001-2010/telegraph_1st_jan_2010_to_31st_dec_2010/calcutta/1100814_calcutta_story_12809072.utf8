                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Promises flow after plans fail 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	When in trouble, start making promises.        
	Thats what Goutam Deb did at the foundation stone laying ceremony of Rabindra Udyan in Rajarhat on Friday evening in the presence of the chief minister.         
	The housing minister promised a school, a college and also a hospital  to be funded by the government  at a nearby plot. We will give the land free to the government so that it can develop these projects, said Deb, also the Hidco chairman.         
	The youth of this area will be educated in the school and the college and the residents will be treated in the hospital, the minister said in his speech. According to him, education would enable local youths to land the lakhs of jobs that are being generated.        
	Debs Rajarhat dream has run into a roadblock with landowners who feel they werent adequately compensated refusing to hand over plots and resisting projects in places where Hidco has taken possession of land.        
	CPM leaders have blamed the Trinamul Congress  which has trounced the ruling party in a series of elections  for scuttling development projects in the area.        
	Former chief minister Jyoti Basu launched the Rs 18,000 crore New Town project in the mid-1990s. Land acquisition notification, according to the 1894 Land Acquisition Act, was issued in 1996 and after several rounds of hearings on compensation, the agency started acquiring land in 1998.        
	On Friday, Deb tried to win over those who have been resisting the government plans.         
	We have acquired the lands of Muslims, adivasis and scheduled caste people for which we have compensated them well. Where we were supposed to pay Rs 10, we paid Rs 12. But that is not sufficient. We need to give them education so that they qualify for the lakhs of jobs that are being generated, he said.

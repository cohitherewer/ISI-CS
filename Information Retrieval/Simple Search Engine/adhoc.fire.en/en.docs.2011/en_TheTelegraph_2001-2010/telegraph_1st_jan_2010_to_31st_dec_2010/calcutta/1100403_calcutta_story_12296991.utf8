          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five human rights activists, including a woman, were beaten up on Friday on board the Lal Quila Express while the train was passing through Bihar for protesting against passengers with unreserved tickets occupying reserved seats.        
	According to the activists, railway policemen could not be found while they were being beaten up. The ticket examiner was scared to stand up against the mob of about 30, said one of the five.         
	The incident occurred between Ara and Koilwar in Bihar. The assailants got off at Raghunathpur and Buxar.

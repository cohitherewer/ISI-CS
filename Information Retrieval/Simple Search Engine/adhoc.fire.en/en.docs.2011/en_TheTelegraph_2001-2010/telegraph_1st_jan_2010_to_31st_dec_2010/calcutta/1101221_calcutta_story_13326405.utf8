The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Logo bridges a gap, but ground reality gapes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Logo bridges a gap, but ground reality gapes
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          R. Balki of Lowe Lintas, actor Dhritiman Chaterji, industries minister Nirupam Sen and Milan Mela logo (below) contest winner Anish Sethumadhavan on Monday. (Amit Datta)                                            
	A logo is a logo is a logo, right? Not when its the logo of a pet government project and the product of a rare popular hunt, that too online, by a party struggling to keep pace with the times and in touch with the popular pulse.        
	At the grand finale of the Milan Mela logo competition in a star hotel on Monday evening, industries minister Nirupam Sen confessed: Initially I was very apprehensive of such a competition entirely through the Internet but due to financial constraints we had to take the path of social networking. We got an amazing response, something I didnt expect, which shows how the young have accepted this new medium of communication.        
	Not only was it the first time that the government had made use of the Internet for such an exercise, it was also the debut of such a decision being thrown open to the public.        
	This is a classic case of too little too late, scoffed a Trinamul leader, on condition of anonymity. The government is making a grand show of a logo when the brand it stands for  Milan Mela  is a symbol of its ineptitude.        
	Politics aside, the participation in the logo contest was heartening. More than 1,350 entries poured in from creative brains in art colleges and advertising agencies. For the logo of a venue like Milan Mela, which we are developing as an international space for meetings and fairs, we wanted the youth of the country to come up with ideas, Sen added.        
	Partnering the government in this unique experience and helping manage the contest was Lintas. I think its an absolutely fantastic effort on part of the government to get common people to design the logo rather than get an advertising agency to do it, R. Balki, chairman of Lowe Lintas and one of the judges at the final, told Metro.        
	Not only is there a lot of pride involved for the participants its also a revenue-saving exercise for the government, added the director of Cheeni Kum and Paa.        
	The logo created by Anish Sethumadhavan, 25, was the chosen one. I got to know about the contest through agencyfaqs.com and was driven to create a logo, said the young man from Mumbai. It was very tense when the final three were announced and I felt I was in some Indian Idol competition!        
	Anishs logo inspired by the Howrah bridge has the essence of Calcutta and at the same time symbolises a bridge connecting the world to India. Balki picked it as the most progressive of the Howrah bridge-inspired logos.        
	Former creative head of Bates India, Anurag Hira, one of the judges, felt Anishs logo was simple and memorable, the two things that make a good logo.        
	For market research veteran and contest judge Shiloo Chattopadhyay, the logo of a company should encapsulate everything that the brand stands for. The moment you see a logo you should be able to recall the brand.... Good, bad, ugly we are reminded of Air India whenever we see the Maharaja logo. Or the utterly butterly delicious logo of Amul.        
	But Anishs creation may not be the final Milan Mela logo. Actor and contest judge Dhritiman Chaterji said: The winning entries were good but they are a bit raw. They need a professional finishing touch.        
	Nandini Chakravorty, CEO of West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation, which had organised the contest, confirmed the same to Metro. We will definitely use Anishs logo but Lintas will work on it and we may change the colours.        
	But Milan Mela will need much more than a change of colour to bridge the gap between being a dump and a fairground.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata waters tax-free vote tree
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mamata waters tax-free vote tree

	Mamata Banerjee is determined to drive her principal political foe out of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation with the promise of relief to citizens in their day-to-day battle against their biggest enemy, tax burden.        
	In her message to around 35 lakh voters, who will elect the rulers of Calcutta on May 30, the inside cover of the Trinamuls 40-page manifesto spells out a watertight vow  Tax on water? No, no, no.        
	Water is life. The intention should be to provide sweet water to every household. We will not impose tax on water after coming to power in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, said Mamata while announcing Trinamuls civic poll manifesto on Thursday.         
	Desperate to castle the CPM in the semi-finals  the civic polls  ahead of next years finals  the Assembly elections  she has also promised to rationalise the civic tax structure to ease the common mans burden.        
	We will simplify taxes at all levels We will rationalise the tax structure to reduce the burden of taxes, promised Mamata.        
	There are a whole lot of taxes  income tax, service tax, property tax and what not.Why should the people of Calcutta suffer because of so many taxes? she demanded, positioning herself as the slayer of the tax monster in the run-up to the civic polls.        
	It is clear from the manifesto that Mamata is treating this as the battle that must be won before the war. She is wearing the hat of chief-minister-in-waiting even for the civic polls, observed a political analyst.        
	Though Trinamul insiders claimed that the strategy of dangling the tax-cut carrot would help Trinamul in its march to the CMC headquarters, translating the promises into action would be easier said than done. Imposition of water tax is a precondition to avail of funds from two major sources, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. A complete no to water tax may turn off the funds tap, warned a senior civic official.         
	But Mamata is consistent in her stand on water tax as her opposition dates back to 2003, when Subrata Mukherjee, then mayor, decided to impose water tax following an agreement with ADB for a Rs 1,800-crore loan for the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project. In the face of stiff resistance from Mamata, Mukherjees proposal was kept in abeyance. She has also forbidden the Trinamul-controlled municipalities from collecting water tax.        
	The CPM-led civic body, which succeeded Mukherjee, scrapped the earlier water tax proposal but it revived the old ferule-based residential water tax and levied water tax only on households with 75mm and 100mm ferule connection. This formula brought only 20,000 out of the 6 lakh-plus houses into the water tax net.        
	A Trinamul board will find it difficult to get the approval for the next round of Rs 3,000 crore loan from the ADB, said the civic official because of the precondition that the civic body attain self-sufficiency through imposition of water tax.        
	Though Mamata did not spell out the revenue implications of her plan to simplify and rationalise the civic tax structure, if the proposals result in any dip in the CMCs revenues  over Rs 1,200 crore from house tax, trade licence fees and commercial water tax  her big bang plans for Calcutta may fizzle out fast.        
	Property tax in the city proper area is abnormally high while the rates are very low in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur. Rationalisation of rates will increase generation and we will also bring over two lakh unassessed buildings under the tax net and improve collections, claimed a Trinamul leader.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Norwester relief on the radar   Power cuts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Norwester relief on the radar   Power cuts
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The long-awaited Norwester may finally hit the city in the next 24 hours, bringing relief from the swelter at least for a couple of days.        
	The conditions are conducive to Norwesters and one is likely to come in the next 24 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The low-pressure trough over Bihar and a cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal are responsible for the high humidity levels in south Bengal that can pave the path for a Norwester.        
	The prediction has nothing to do with the tornado-like phenomenon that hit parts of north Dinajpur in Bengal and north Bihar around Tuesday midnight, said Debnath.        
	The power situation in the city has also improved with the deficit climbing down to 120MW on Wednesday from 230MW the day before.                          
	Parts of the city suffered power cuts for up to half an hour. For the first time in 10 days we did not suffer prolonged power cuts, said 61-year-old Shyamlal Mukhopadhyay, a resident of Lake Town.        
	The situation was far worse in the areas served by the state utility, where the deficit touched 450MW. Most of Salt Lake suffered at least an hours power cut. We were pleasantly surprised as we were bracing for another full evening without power, said a resident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Path clear for North Wind
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Path clear for North Wind
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The mercury is likely to dip from Saturday, paving the way for the arrival of winter in early-December.        
	The first half of November has been unusually warm. From November 6 to November 18, the minimum temperature was four to six degrees higher than normal. On Friday, the minimum temperature climbed seven notches above normal to 25.4 degrees Celsius.        
	The mercury will dip over the next 48 hours and the weather will improve steadily, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The drop in the minimum temperature to the normal level will eventually lead to the onset of winter in the first half of December, predicted a weatherman.        
	Frequent atmospheric formations over the Bay of Bengal had hampered the flow of the North Wind over south Bengal, causing the warm spell.        
	Heavy incursion of moisture into south Bengal resulted in a cloud cover that checked the flow of the North Wind. More importantly, the wind flow pattern was altered greatly by Cyclone Jal, said a Met official.        
	The trend of abnormally high minimum temperature has continued for a fortnight. This is quite remarkable for November in Calcutta, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi.        
	Echoing IMD, a scientist from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida, said: It is an anomaly and should be examined in the context of climate change.        
	The wind flow has become normal over the past few days. But a cyclonic circulation over Bangladesh and Bengal has been blocking the North Wind. With the circulation moving away from Bengal, the North Wind is expected to introduce a nip in the air.        
	The circulation is heading east. The path of the northerlies and northwesterlies will be clear soon, Debnath told Metro.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clogged sewers cleaned
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clogged sewers cleaned

	The silt thrown up by the gigantic brick sewers under the city is enough to cover the Shahid Minar 10 times over or fill up 150 reservoirs like the Tallah tank. This is the first time the sewers are being cleaned since they were laid in 1859.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) recently took up a Rs 500crore project under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) to desilt brick sewers under nine prominent roads and strengthen the sewer walls. The project aims to relieve the city of chronic waterlogging every monsoon.        
	The work will be implemented in two phases, said civic engineers. First, 24.5km of man-entry brick sewers under APC Road, AJC Bose Road, Lenin Sarani, Hazra Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Colootollah Street, Canning Street, Nimtalaghat Street and Beadon Street will be desilted. In the second phase, the brick walls of the sewers will be refurbished by inserting glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) jackets.         
	The silt scooped out is enough to cover the 48m Shahid Minar 10 times or fill up the 9million gallon capacity Tallah tank some 150 times, said a civic official. The silt is being disposed of at Dhapa and some dumping grounds in the suburbs.         
	Under Rashbehari Avenue, civic engineers found fish in the sewer water. A magur fish weighing about 2kg was a prize catch.         
	The fish must have entered the sewer lines from Adi Ganga through the lock gates, said Nilangshu Bose, the director-general (project and development) of the CMC.        
	The first drainage scheme for Calcutta was drawn up by a British engineer named Clark at an estimated cost of Rs 34 lakh. The project was sanctioned on April 20, 1859, to lay 30 miles (48.3km) of brick sewers and 79.5 miles (128km) of branch sewers to serve the city covering 4,600 acres, inhabited by five lakh people. Now the city is spread across 187sq km and inhabited by over 5.5 million people.        
	For the JNNURM project, two firms from Austria and Germany are supplying the glass-reinforced plastic jackets. The former has set up a production unit in Dhulagarh in Howrah and the latter in Sankrail.        
	I entered an emptied brick sewer and was awe-struck by the civil engineering masterpiece conceived by the British engineers. But I was saddened by the huge volume of debris inside and realised how inefficient we have been about maintaining the sewer lines, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	Silted brick sewers have been the root cause behind waterlogging in the city, say CMC officials. Since 60 to 70 per cent of the sewers was clogged with silt, their capacity to drain out rainwater had gone down drastically, pointed out a civic engineer.         
	People living in the APC Road, Colootollah Street, Lenin Sarani and Nimtala Ghat Street areas should get a relief from waterlogging this year, said CMC executive engineer Somnath Boral, who is overseeing the work under Lenin Sarani.

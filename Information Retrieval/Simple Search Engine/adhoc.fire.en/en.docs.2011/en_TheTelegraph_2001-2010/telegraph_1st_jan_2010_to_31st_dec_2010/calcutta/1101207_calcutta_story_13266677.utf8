The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twin rallies stall wheels at city centre 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Twin rallies stall wheels at city centre 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Commuters walk past stationary vehicles at the Esplanade end of the Park Street flyover on Monday afternoon.   Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Twin rallies combined with slushy roads to make life miserable for commuters in the city on the first working day of the week.        
	The siege of the city centre started at 8am, with about 1,000 deed writers, blocking the Howrah-bound flank of RR Avenue near Esplanade demanding better pay and working conditions. The protesters did not budge till 2pm, severely affecting traffic.         
	An hour earlier, over 2,000 supporters of the Calcutta Dr BR Ambedkar Mission started walking from Sealdah station to Metro Channel throwing traffic out of gear on AJC Bose Road and CIT Road. Vehicles hardly moved after they parked themselves in the protest zone to seek more jobs for the Dalits and voice other demands.         
	All the flanks are clogged and the ripple effect is beyond our control, said a traffic sergeant at the spot.         
	Traffic flow did not become normal till long after the agitators had dispersed at 5pm.         
	Maintenance work on several stretches added to commuters woes.        
	A large stretch on Sarat Bose Road is dug up and so is the area around Gobinda Khatik Road, off Park Circus connector, and the northern flank of Belgachhia Road in the north. Along these stretches, traffic moved slower than usual, said a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.         
	In the evening, wet roads slowed down vehicles across the city, stretching the time taken by office-goers to return home.

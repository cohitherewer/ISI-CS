                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Indefinite wait for test results
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          People watch the Stephen Court fire from a terrace across the road. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The nightmare of the Stephen Court fire refuses to end for the family members of eight victims waiting for the DNA test results.        
	With no official word from the authorities on when and how the results will be made available, the family members are being forced to make futile trips to the SSKM Hospital morgue, where the charred remains of their loved ones have been kept.        
	Sabita Roy Chowdhury, the mother of 22-year-old Jayatree Roy Chowdhury who used to work on the fourth-floor of Stephen Court, has almost stopped eating. She has been inconsolable since the fire and cant bear this indefinite wait for the body. We fear for her wellbeing, said Jayatrees uncle Kamal Nath.        
	We last went to the morgue on Tuesday. Police took our contact numbers but we have not received any update from them, said Nath.         
	Rama Roy, who lost her 21-year-old son Prateek in the fire, is also waiting for the test results so that she can perform the last rites. Just imagine her plight. She went to the morgue and gave blood samples for the DNA test. But she doesnt know when the results will come, said Ashok Sen, a relative of the Roys.         
	The Naths are living through the same agony. We dont know how long the DNA test will take and how the results will be conveyed to us, said Mantu Nath, brother-in-law of 30-year-old Mita Nath, who worked for Guru Ispat on the fourth floor.        
	The families of Ruhi Parven, Jaiprakash Jaiswal, Fatema Farhan Ansari, Bidyut Chandra and Vinit Kumar Karan are awaiting the results of the tests. The bodies of 29 of the 43 victims have been identified. Of the 14 in the SSKM morgue, six are unclaimed.        
	We are expecting the results in seven to 10 days. The results will be available earlier than we had thought. We will inform the police about the results, said C.N. Bhattacharya, the director of Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), where the DNA sequencing is being done.         
	City detective chief Damayanti Sen said the police would get in touch with the families once the results reach them.

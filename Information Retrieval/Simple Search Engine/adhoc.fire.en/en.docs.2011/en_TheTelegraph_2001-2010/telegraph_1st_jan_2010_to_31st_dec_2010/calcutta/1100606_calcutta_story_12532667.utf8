The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Make Hay in Kerala 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Make Hay in Kerala 
                              A visitor at the Guardian Hay Festival                             
	Freewheeling conversation, avant garde film screenings and lively book readings  lounging on deck chairs, soaking in the warm winter sun. The Indian edition of the Guardian Hay Festival comes to Kerala this November. The original festival, the Guardian Hay Festival, called the Woodstock of the mind, is held in the quaint little Welsh town Hay-on-Wye that boasts 30 bookshops.         
	We are excited to celebrate the Hay Festival in India, and Kerala became the obvious choice for its high literacy rate and popular tourist destination, says Lyndy Cooke, executive director, Hay Festival, from London.         
	Says Sanjoy K. Roy of Teamwork Productions, principal organiser of the Jaipur Literature Festival and the Hay Festival Kerala: We were keen to do a literary fest in the south. Like the Jaipur Literature Festival that is held in Diggi Palace, the Kerala festival will combine heritage, culture and tourism. Thiruvananthapuram has offered us the Kanakakunnu palace. We also hope to do a few events in Kovalam, says Roy.         
	But isnt Calcutta the book lovers paradise? As with all other things, big book fests are also bypassing this city.         
	The city was not bypassed, Roy assures. Calcutta has its own lit fest organised by Oxford Bookstore and the book fair and we did not wish to compete with something homegrown.         
	But the success of the Jaipur event lies in the clockwork precision. If authors were left waiting for events to start, no one would be here the next time, says Roy. Can Calcutta assure any punctuality?         
	Calcutta doesnt figure in the scheme of international lit fests. It doesnt compare with the infrastructure or touristiness of other venues. Whether thats good or bad for books is another uestion.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girl dies after eating shop food
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A five-year-old girl died and 32 people were taken ill allegedly after eating kachoris at a Titagarh sweet shop on Monday.        
	Police sealed the shop at Kalianiwas, in ward No. 2 of Barrackpore municipality, after around 100 residents went on the rampage and smashed showcases and broke chairs and tables.        
	The owner of Dipen Sweets is absconding. One of his employees has been arrested, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police. Dhiren Pal, in his 70s, owns the shop.        
	The police said Koel Rakshit, an Upper Nursery student in a local school, and her mother ate two kachoris each at Dipen Sweets around 10am.        
	My wife told me that the potato curry served with the kachoris seemed stale, said Koels father Ganesh, who works in a nursing home.        
	Koel soon started vomiting and then passed out. She was taken to a nursing home where her father works. As her condition worsened, the family members decided to shift her to another nursing home in Baranagar but the girl died on the way.        
	Thirty-two other persons, all of whom had allegedly eaten kachoris at the shop, started vomiting, too. They were admitted to BN Bose Hospital. Among them were seven women and four children. The doctors attending to them said their condition was critical.        
	As news of Koels death and the others falling ill spread in the locality, residents ransacked the shop around 12.30pm. A large team from Titagarh police station rushed to the spot and sealed the shop to pacify the mob.        
	Barrackpore Municipality chairman Uttam Das later visited the spot and announced that action would be taken against the owner if he was found guilty.

	Thank you Metro on Sunday for the travel piece Pot Maya (November 21). I headed for the fair after reading the article and enjoyed every moment of my stay.             
	From Balichak station we travelled by bus, past places with somewhat scary names. For example, one place was called Mundamari (head-hunters).           
	At Naya, the pata festival was spontaneous and well-managed. The organisers convinced many of those loitering outside the venue to join in and spoilt them with endless cups of tea.           
	After a brief introductory session, it was time for a dose of pata and baul songs. We then went on a tour of the village. The houses of the chitrakars were decorated with patas of various sizes, some over 20ft tall and rolled like calendars.           
	After lunch, there was a workshop on making natural colours that I enjoyed very much. My only regret is that I did not go prepared to spend the night there. The arrangements were great. Had I stayed back I could have attended other workshops too.

	The article Maximum city (November 14) made for a good read. The Calcutta skyline is changing fast. While plush residential and market complexes are coming up almost every day, many are living in terrible conditions in slums and shanties nearby. The authorities must focus on balanced development. Otherwise there would soon be social unrest.

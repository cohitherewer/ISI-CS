The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Library catalogue to go online
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Library catalogue to go online
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	Come September, the entire catalogue of the National Library would be available online. Readers in any part of the world would also be able to requisition a book by filling up an online form.        
	They will be able to pick up books requisitioned online within a few seconds of visiting the library. The process will be hassle-free and will attract hundreds of readers, said a senior official of the library.        
	Currently, readers have to wait more than two hours after requisitioning a book to get their hands on it.        
	The Union ministry of culture is funding the digitisation project, estimated at Rs 10 crore, following a call by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the modernisation of the library, which houses more than 50 lakh rare books published before 1860 on its 30-acre campus in Alipores Belvedere Estate.        
	The Prime Ministers Office has given us six months to complete the work. We have approached some software companies but nothing has been finalised. The contract will be awarded after the necessary formalities, said the official.         
	The main objective is to make the library more user-friendly. Online access to the librarys collection has been a long-standing demand of the readers, added the official.        
	Once the digitisation project is completed, people would be able to download membership forms from the librarys website and submit them online. Readers would also be allowed to email queries regarding borrowing of books to the authorities, according to library officials.        
	Saibal Chakraborty, the general secretary of National Library Staff Association, expressed doubt whether the digitisation would be completed within the deadline.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Man held for girl kidnap bid
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A man in his 30s was arrested on Sunday for allegedly trying to kidnap a child from Bhairab Dutta Lane, under Golabari police station in Howrah.        
	Police said Laxmi Setia, 4, was playing outside her home when three men approached her. One of them took the baby in the crook of his arm and started walking away when he drew attention of a neighbour, Binode Agarwal.        
	When Agarwal asked the man where he was taking the girl, he failed to give any satisfactory reply.        
	As Agarwal raised an alarm, other residents rushed in and locked the man in a room. His two accomplices had fled by then. When the police reached the spot, they held a demonstration alleging that child-lifting was rampant in the area.        
	The man will be produced in the chief judicial magistrates court on Monday.        
	Ranjit Shaw, a Fakir Bagan resident, said: Around 14 kids had been abducted from the area over the past five years and none has been rescued. Repeated requests to the police to step up security have yielded no result.        
	Residents had blocked Howrah bridge last year demanding a CBI probe into the cases. The missing children were from Pilkhana, Fakir Bagan, Mothertala Lane, Rosemerry Lane, Karbala and Bhairab Dutta Lane.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mishap death finger at police
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mishap death finger at police
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Cossipore residents have lodged a complaint against a police patrol van for allegedly causing a road accident on Thursday morning and then fleeing without helping the two victims, one of whom died.         
	According to residents, the cops in the van had stopped an Ambassador on BT Road for a traffic rule violation. While speaking with the driver, an officer flung open a door of the car. A motorcycle passing by rammed into the door and Swapan Khatua and Nemai Ghosh, who were on the two-wheeler, were thrown on the road. A speeding vehicle mowed down Ghosh, a 40-year-old local trader, who died at RG Kar hospital.        
	Instead of helping the duo, the mobile van left the spot instantly, as did the car driver, said witnesses.         
	The police slapped a case of death due to negligence against the car driver, claiming that he had flung open the door. Joint police commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said the complaint was being probed.

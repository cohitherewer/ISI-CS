                      Abstractions and configurations        Surya Prakash occupies a unique position in the   realm of Indian art. Surya Prakash: A Retrospec  tive Exhibition sho-ws perfectly how the artist   strikes the right note thr-o-ugh a flawless symbiosis   between form and content. His art projects an imag  ined experience, rather than annotations of the tem  poral world. Meditative and classical, his art also re  flects a contemporary flavour, a distinctive fusion   that encompasses many of the trials and tribula  tions of our modern era, although in a measured ac  cent. Apart from being a consummate painter with a   distinctive visual diction, Surya Prakash has also   been instrumental in shaping the art milieu of Hy  derabad. This dual facet forms the axis of Abstract   Reality: The Art of Surya Prakash written by Shila  ditya Sarkar, which was released yesterday. Thread  ing the different phases of his art chronologically, it   highlights the artists abstracted vision. It is inter  posed with anecdotes and analytical insights, and   portrays the persona of a reticent artist, whose   paintings and exemplary social role continue to in  spire art lovers across generations.                              Event: A retrospective exhibition of paintings by Surya Prakash When: January 7 - 16 (except Sunday); 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Sanskriti, 5C Alipore Park Road

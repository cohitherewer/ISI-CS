  - Govt plans service shield for temporary college teachers          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Part-time teachers are set to become a permanent presence in colleges with a desperate Left Front planning to woo them with a no-retrenchment clause in their service contracts.         
	The proposed pre-poll sop will be applicable to part-time teachers who commit themselves to a single college till the age of 60 at their current consolidated salary, ranging between Rs 7,000 and Rs 10,000. Those who choose to work in multiple colleges can do so without the guarantee of permanent employment.        
	The no-retrenchment clause  officials say it could be notified as early as this month  is the second carrot dangled by the Left Front in front of part-time teachers to keep them from switching loyalty to Trinamul. The decision to streamline teaching staff in state-aided colleges was shelved last June after part-time teachers started deserting the CPM-backed unions.        
	We have submitted a proposal to ensure service protection for part-time teachers and the government has given us an assurance to do the needful, said Anjan Sengupta, the general secretary of the CPM-affiliated All Bengal Principals Council.        
	He justified the proposal by insisting that many state-aided colleges were short of teachers.         
	Until last year, the official line was that part-time teaching posts would be abolished once the vacancies for permanent teachers were filled up. Many part-time teachers had lost their jobs after the West Bengal College Service Commission filled up the permanent posts this year but they have since been reinstated.        
	The CPM-controlled College and University Teachers Association has backed the proposal to retain part-time teachers in colleges till the age of 60 if they didnt change institutions.        
	Many part-time teachers work in institutions for several years at a stretch. We have urged the government to allow these teachers to work till 60, said Tarun Patra, the general secretary of the association.         
	Under the existing system, colleges enjoy the power to replace or remove part-time teachers at any stage of their service.        
	Those who opt for the single-college option under the proposed amendment would need to give an undertaking that they would not object to their services being terminated from any other institution they might currently be working for.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen accused behind bars
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Sushil Sureka in Bankshall court on Friday afternoon                          
	Key Stephen Court blaze accused Sushil Sureka surrendered in Bankshall court on Friday, almost six months after the Park Street landmark went up in flames killing 43 people.        
	Sureka, one of the three directors of Stephen Court Limited that maintains the building, walked into the court in the afternoon and turned himself in before the 12th metropolitan magistrate.        
	He has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and attempt to commit culpable homicide, as well as under the West Bengal Fire Services Act for alleged negligence in maintaining a high-risk building. He has been remanded in police custody till September 27.        
	Sureka and the other two directors  Sanjay Bagaria and Pradeep More  went missing on March 23, the day the building caught fire.        
	Bagaria was arrested on August 25 in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, while More is still at large. Sureka was the fifth of the six accused in the case to have been rounded up. We are looking for More against whom an arrest warrant is pending, said an investigating officer.        
	It seems Sureka was living in Jaipur, where he has a few relatives. Apart from Stephen Court Limited, Sureka has stakes in a few more companies, said Damayanti Sen, joint commissioner of police, crime.        
	We will interrogate Sureka to know more about what happened to the money collected from the Stephen Court tenants for the upkeep of the building.        
	Sureka was an authorised signatory of the Stephen Court Limited account where the rent used to be deposited. We have to match his signature with those on the documents we have seized. The documents will be sent to hand-writing experts, said an officer. We will also grill him about the documents we are looking for.        
	Apart from Bagaria and Sureka, the police have arrested the liftman of the building, Jayprakash Singh, and caretakers Ramprakash Singh and Tarun Bagadia.        
	Ramprakash and Jayprakash are in custody while Bagadia is out on bail.

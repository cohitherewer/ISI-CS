                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Doubts over office robbery
          OUR BUREAU                                    
	A trader has alleged that three armed youths barged into his Middleton Street office on Monday evening and looted Rs 5.2 lakh after tying him up, a claim about which police have raised questions.        
	Manish Kumar Dhandhania, in his mid-40s, told cops that the youths entered his office around 7.30pm, minutes after his employees had left, and took away the cash after threatening him with a dagger.         
	Before leaving the office, Dhandhania claims, the gang tied his legs with shoelaces and his hands with a rope used to hang photo frames on the wall. He managed to drag his chair to the phone and call his wife in their home on an adjoining building in the same complex, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.        
	When his wife reached the office and tried to free Dhandhania, he asked her to first take his photograph before informing the police, she added.         
	Relatives, drivers and guards finally untied the trader, whose family owns factories. Alerted by a guard, I entered the room with several other drivers. Dhandhania was tied to a chair. He had also been gagged. The room had been ransacked, said a driver.        
	Hours later, Dhandhania accompanied relatives to Shakespeare Sarani police station and lodged a complaint.        
	The guard of the house said no outsider had entered the building around the time of the robbery on Monday. Besides, no gang would tie up anyone with shoelaces. It is also curious that the youths entered after everyone had left the office, said an investigator.

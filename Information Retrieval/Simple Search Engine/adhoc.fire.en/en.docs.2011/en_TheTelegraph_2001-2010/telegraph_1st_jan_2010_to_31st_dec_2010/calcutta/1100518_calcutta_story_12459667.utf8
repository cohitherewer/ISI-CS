The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Upkeep staff on Metro
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Upkeep staff on Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The train that derailed on Sunday                                  
	A loco-inspector and two upkeep hands are travelling on every Metro Railway train from Monday to attend to emergencies and minimise disruptions caused by glitches.        
	The three-member team will accompany each and every train from today. The inspector will travel in the drivers cabin while the other two in the rear one, said a spokesperson for Metro.        
	The underground services were often disrupted over the past few months following glitches. A train had hit the buffer and got derailed while changing tracks at Briji (Shahid Khudiram) on Sunday afternoon, crippling services for the rest of the day.        
	A three-member panel set up to probe the derailment spoke to the driver of the train and some other employees on Monday.        
	The Sunday incident has forced the authorities to send an inspector and two technicians for general and electrical upkeep with every train to tackle emergencies. Besides, the inspectors presence will prompt the driver to be more alert, especially when someone tries to commit suicide on the tracks, said an official.        
	Earlier, the inspectors and the maintenance staff were posted at five sub-stations (attached to commuter stations) on the 23km stretch from Dum Dum to Garia (Kavi Nazrul).        
	The time taken by the personnel to reach the spot would delay the services. The presence of maintenance staff on the trains will cut down the response time, the official added.        
	The first few hours since the new system was introduced, however, was not hassle-free for commuters, who complained of late running of trains.         
	I kept waiting for a train at Tollygunge for over 20 minutes around 8am. There was no announcement about the delay. When we asked some officials, they said trains were running behind schedule but could not say why, said Ayan Sarkar, a resident of Behala Sakherbazar.        
	Many commuters alleged that trains ran 15 minutes behind schedule till 9am. Metro officials, however, denied the charge, saying only one train ran late.

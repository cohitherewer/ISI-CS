The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Threat of three-day strike
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Threat of three-day strike
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Transport operators have set the state government a deadline  agree to hike fares by August 9 or face a 72-hour strike from August 10.        
	The threat was rolled out on Thursday by major operator unions of buses, minibuses and taxis who met under the leadership of Trinamul MLA Swarnakamal Saha. The government is leaving us no choice but to go on a 72-hour strike, said Saha.        
	Was this not going against Mamata Banerjees stated policy of not calling strikes? The livelihood of five lakh operators and their families is at stake. We are going on strike irrespective of our political colour, claimed Saha.        
	State transport minister Ranjit Kundu on Wednesday ruled out a fare hike and said: I have received no official intimation (about the strike).... The government will bear a part of the burden of the price hike with a diesel subsidy. Transporters too will have to bear some of the burden.        
	Tarak Nath Bari, secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association, blamed the government stand on political compulsions and warned that the strike would be the prelude to a much bigger agitation.  
	GOVT GIVES: Re 1 per litre diesel subsidy
  OPERATORS SAY: Not enough as the price of diesel has increased four times since August 2009, by a total of Rs 6.72
  TAXIS SAY: Increase fare by Rs 4 to 6
  GOVT SAYS: No

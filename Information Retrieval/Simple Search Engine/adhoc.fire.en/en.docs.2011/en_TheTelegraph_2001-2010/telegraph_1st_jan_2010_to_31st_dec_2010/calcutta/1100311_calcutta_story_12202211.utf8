The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bypass hits a dais block
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bypass hits a dais block
          SUBHAJOY ROY                            CAUSE AND EFFECT: The dais in the middle of the Garia-bound flank of the Bypass; (above) cars stuck in the two-way snarl. Pictures by Sanat Kr Sinha                                 
	Calcuttas right to roads was snatched with impunity on Wednesday by a CPM-backed organisation that captured EM Bypass for a meeting, cutting off commuters from one flank of a stretch between Ruby Hospital and Santoshpur throughout the day.        
	Police started diverting south-bound traffic near Kalikapur to the other flank from 11.30am instead of dismantling the dais in the middle of the road, triggering chaos that spilled over to several stretches of the Bypass and its feeder roads, from Garia to Gariahat.        
	The brazen disregard for rules  and the commuters rights  was later justified by sports minister Kanti Ganguly, the chief guest at the 2.30pm meeting organised by the No. 12 Borough Nagarik Committee to drum up support to save an 89-acre plot to the left of the dais from being taken over by realtors.        
	What happens when a national highway is blocked for 21 days or when a hunger strike in the middle of the city goes on for days? asked Ganguly, pre-empting the question on harried citizens lips and playing the Mamata-did-it-first-and-worse card.        
	He claimed that the Nagarik Committee had no option but to organise the meeting on the main road. We couldnt have erected the dais on the plot because of the court case over its ownership, explained Ganguly.        
	With ICSE, ISC and CBSE examinations underway, students headed for the test centres or returning home on either side of noon were also caught in the mayhem. A Trinamul procession against the CPMs attempt to wrest the plot on the only flank that was open compounded the commuters woes.        
	Megha Bhaduri, returning from her sisters wedding, took 55 minutes to reach her home in Survey Park from the Ruby roundabout in the afternoon. On any other day, it takes hardly five minutes, said the teenager, who lives in a highrise off the Bypass.        
	Vehicles coming from both sides crawled on one flank between Kalikapur and the Metro Cash and Carry outlet until 6.30pm because the dais and the chairs laid out on the road for the meeting hadnt been removed till then. Several ambulances were stuck in the snarls. There are three hospitals in the vicinity  Ruby, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences and Peerless. How can anybody be allowed to block a thoroughfare for nearly eight hours? Is no law applicable to this city? asked an angry resident of Hiland Park.        
	Officials of South 24-Parganas declined comment on the meeting. Permission is given by the local police station and the subdivisional officer. I am not sure whether permission was sought for this meeting, said L.N. Meena, the SP of South 24-Parganas.         
	District magistrate Khalil Ahmed was also mum on the matter, but a source in Jadavpur East police station claimed that the organisers had sought  and received  permission for the event.        
	So was permission granted in contravention of rules?         
	A traffic police officer said the local police station could have initiated a suo motu case under Section 151 of the IPC for obstructing traffic on a thoroughfare. But it is a bailable offence, he added.         
	The meeting, attended by the likes of former MP Sujan Chakraborty, film-makers Tarun Bandopadhyay and Anindita Sarbadhicary, and former footballers Prasun Banerjee and Surajit Sengupta, drew around 6,000 people but harassed many more.

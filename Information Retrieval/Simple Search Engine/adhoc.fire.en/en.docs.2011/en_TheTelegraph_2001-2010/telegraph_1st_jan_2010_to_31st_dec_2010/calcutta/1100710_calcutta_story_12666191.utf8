          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A traffic constable was suspended on Friday for misbehaving with an executive of a private company in a drunken state. An inquiry has been initiated against him.        
	Nityananda Goswami, the constable, was on duty at the crossing of Ganesh Chandra Avenue and Bentinck Street on Thursday evening when he allegedly stopped the car of the executive and asked the driver to give a lift to his friend. When the executive asked him the reason for his demand, the constable reportedly turned furious.        
	The executive then called up a senior police officer. Officers from Hare Street police station soon rushed to the spot. The constable was taken to the police station and sent for a medical test. The constables behaviour was unbecoming of a policeman and he has been put under suspension, Dilip Bandopadhayay, deputy commissioner (traffic), told Metro.

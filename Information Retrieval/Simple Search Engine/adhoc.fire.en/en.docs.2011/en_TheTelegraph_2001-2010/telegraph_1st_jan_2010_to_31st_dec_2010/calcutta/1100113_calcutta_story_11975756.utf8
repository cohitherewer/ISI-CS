The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Route change for Buddha convoy
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Route change for Buddha convoy
  - CM to flout a no-entry rule for the sake of safety on road back home          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee leaves the Ultadanga fire site on Tuesday evening. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                        
	Security concerns have prompted police to change the chief ministers route on the way back home from Writers Buildings, making an exception to the one-way rule on the road in front of the secretariat.        
	Senior officers at Lalbazar said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy from Tuesday was turning right, instead of left, after emerging from Writers. The convoy then travels down the road in front of General Post Office and hits Red Road via Council House Street and Akashvani Bhavan.        
	This is the same route the chief minister takes on his way to office, said an officer.        
	Earlier, the convoy would go down BBD Bag East (in front of Great Eastern Hotel) after taking a left turn at the Writers gate and follow the Old Court House Street-Government Place East route to Red Road.        
	The change has resulted in a violation of the traffic rule on BBD Bag West  the road in front of Writers  where the convoy travels west on a 300ft stretch. Only east-bound vehicles are allowed on the road, the officer said.        
	Joint commissioner (traffic) Ranvir Kumar refused to attribute the rejig to any specific reason  We keep changing the route as required, he said  but Lalbazar sources clarified that the earlier route was too congested and not safe for the chief minister.        
	Besides, protest rallies are held almost daily on Rani Rashmoni Avenue, which is quite close to the previous route. There was always a chance of protesters coming in the way of the convoy. There is also a standing threat from the Maoists, he added.        
	An officer of the special unit, which is in charge of Bhattacharjees security, said: We were finding it difficult to sanitise the previous route. The change has been formalised with the chief secretarys consent.

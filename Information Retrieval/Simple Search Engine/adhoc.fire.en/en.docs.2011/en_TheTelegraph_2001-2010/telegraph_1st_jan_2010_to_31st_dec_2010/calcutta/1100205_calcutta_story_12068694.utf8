The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop action replay at Eden
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cop action replay at Eden
  - GATES TO GALLERIES: TRADITIONAL POLICE COVER FOR TEST          A STAFF REPORTER                          Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti during the floodlight failure at the Eden Gardens on December 24. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Lalbazar, after a growl of defiance, is set to return to its traditional security posts at the Eden Gardens  from checking tickets to manning water booths  for the sake of the Test between India and South Africa from February 14.         
	Following a virtual whimper from the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), to bail them out, senior officers led by police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti met and tentatively agreed to step down from the earlier stance of not providing cover both outside and inside the Eden Gardens.        
	Its not official yet, but sources said the decision followed a silent nod from the home department bosses at Writers Buildings.         
	We are yet to decide. But the fact remains the Test match should happen and with full security in place. At the end of the day the security of both the players and the spectators is of utmost importance. Lets see, Chakrabarti told Metro late on Thursday.        
	Earlier during the day, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya clarified there was no conflict with police over the security arrangements.        
	There will be no change in the security arrangements for the second Test match. It will follow the same tradition that has been followed for international matches at the Eden over the past three decades, declared Dalmiya.        
	Following tradition would mean Chakrabartis force handling internal security, cover for the players, law and order inside and outside the stadium and traffic arrangements, plus checking tickets at the gate and ensuring supply of water.        
	In a recent letter, the police had told the CAB that it should take care of ticket checking at the entrance and also the security inside Eden for the India vs South Africa match. The rest would be Lalbazars responsibility.        
	The cops always wanted to control the checking of tickets as it allowed them to monitor entry and also allow their contacts into the stadium, said a CAB veteran.        
	But that changed following the criticism of the police commissioner, who ordered a probe into the darkness at Eden during the December 24 ODI against Sri Lanka and said that no matches would be allowed at the stadium till the floodlight problem was fixed once and for all.        
	Under fire for exceeding his brief, the top cop had shot off the letter to the CAB to arrange for its own security.        
	There was nothing wrong in the proposal as a cash-rich body like the CAB can easily outsource internal security and checking of tickets to a private agency, said a senior Calcutta police officer.        
	Instead of exploring the option of private security, the CAB wrote back appealing to the police to take full charge for the sake of cricket and its followers in Calcutta.        
	We received a letter from the police commissioner with a few suggestions. We have told the authorities that we are comfortable with the security arrangements in place till date, said Dalmiya.         
	Officers at Lalbazar said if they had stuck to their guns, the Test match could have been jeopardised. Also, given that the security module for the Christmas Eve ODI is barely six weeks old, all it needs is a push of the action-replay button at Lalbazar. Of course, five times over.        
	The arrangements can be the same and even the same set of officers can be deployed. We would just need to conduct a survey as part of our stock-taking exercise before making the deployment and construct a police control room, said an officer overseeing Edens security arrangements.

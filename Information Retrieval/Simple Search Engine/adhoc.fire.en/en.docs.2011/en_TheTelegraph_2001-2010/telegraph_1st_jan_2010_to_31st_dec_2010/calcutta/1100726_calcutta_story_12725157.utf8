The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Woman charred to death
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Woman charred to death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 23-year-old homemaker died of burns suffered during a cylinder burst in the kitchen of her parents house in Bally.        
	Neighbours alleged Sumana Mandal could have been saved had firemen arrived early.        
	The woman was in the kitchen with her three-year-old son when the fire broke out. Neighbours managed to bring out the child but failed to rescue the woman.        
	Three local youths  Abhishek Das, Putul Halder and Amit Kar  rushed to Bally fire station, barely a three-minute drive, and requested the firemen to rush to the spot. According to neighbours, firemen turned up an hour later.        
	Residents, meanwhile, had got hold of hand-held fire extinguishers and brought the blaze under control in 20 minutes. Sumana, however, was charred to death by then.        
	Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of the state fire and emergency services, blamed the delay in the arrival of fire tenders on the residents. They alerted Bally fire station though the area falls under Liluah fire station.

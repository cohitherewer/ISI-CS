The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rare rap for mishap driver 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rare rap for mishap driver 
          KINSUK BASU                          Suresh Yadav                                  
	A truck driver who had mowed down five persons on a Dalhousie footpath three years ago was on Tuesday convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the first time in recent memory an errant driver has been declared guilty of the charge.        
	The fast-track court will pronounce Suresh Yadavs sentence on Wednesday. Legal experts said the driver would be jailed for at least 10 years.        
	The maximum sentence for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, under IPC Section 304, is life imprisonment.        
	Accident victims and their families are happy with the ruling, which they believe will instil a sense of fear among reckless drivers.        
	Such judgments will help bring down the number of fatalities on the road, said Mohan Singh, the husband of Manju Devi who died in a bus accident on Rabindra Sarani a fortnight ago.        
	Singh said drivers responsible for fatal mishaps were rarely awarded a stringent punishment, such as the one handed out to Yadav.        
	Drivers of killer vehicles are usually charged with rash or negligent driving, a bailable offence under IPC Section 279 that carries a maximum punishment of up to six months in jail and/or a fine of up to Rs 1,000.        
	Yadav, in his early 30s, was driving a lorry down Brabourne Road on the night of July 27, 2007, when he ploughed through several people sleeping on the footpath.        
	Biswanath Das, 46, and his four children  Salma Khatun 10, Jamir Ali Seikh, 6, Amir Seikh 4, and Amir Ali Seikh, 1,  were crushed to death. Biswanaths pregnant wife Jabida Bibi was injured.        
	A probe revealed that Yadav, a resident of Buxar in Bihar, was driving with a fake licence. Twenty-four people had deposed during the trial, including the route transport officer of Hooghly from where the license was allegedly issued.        
	Records reveal that the city police had lodged 42 cases last year and 17 this year under Section 304. There has been no conviction yet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Book Fair blackout report submitted
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Book Fair blackout report submitted
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Four days after darkness had descended on a crowded Milon Mela during the 34th Calcutta Book Fair, the post-mortem report trying to shed light on the lapses has been submitted.        
	Nandini Chakraborty, the executive director of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, told Metro that she had submitted the report during the day.        
	The brief was to dwell on three issues  locate what led to the power failure, suggest appropriate measures and, finally, recommend long-term measures for Milon Mela. The report has addressed them all, said Chakraborty.        
	The probe into the January 30 power failure was ordered by Nirupam Sen, the state industries minister.        
	Sources claimed that the report, while taking into account how the Publishers and Booksellers Guild had failed to communicate its exact power demand to the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation (WBTPO), highlighted the infrastructure inadequacies at Milon Mela.        
	When asked if the transformer, provided by the WBTPO, had tripped last Saturday and plunged the fair ground into darkness, Chakraborty said: I cannot say anything on the matter.        
	The guild seemed in no mood to dwell on the dark hours. The requirement and distribution of power at Milon Mela has been well taken care of since and we just hope there arent anymore hiccups, said secretary Tridib Chatterjee.        
	To compensate for the time lost, the book fair will remain open for an extra hour, till 9pm, on Saturday, with ticket counters shutting at 8pm.

Hakobyan said that peace and a strong economy were the pressing challenges for the country now. Armenia and India have friendly relations and we need to build on that, he said.  
	Mall no bar 
  The city streets are accustomed to being treated as spitoons. But the other day a man was seen spitting on the floor of City Centre in Salt Lake. If even pretty malls don rsquo;t inhibit spit, how can pock-marked streets?

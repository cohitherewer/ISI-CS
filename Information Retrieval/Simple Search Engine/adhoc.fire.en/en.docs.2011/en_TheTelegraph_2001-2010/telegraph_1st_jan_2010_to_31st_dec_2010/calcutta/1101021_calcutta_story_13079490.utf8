The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Track toll on road traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Track toll on road traffic
          SUBHAJOY ROY                                    Commuters scramble to board a bus outside Maidan station and (above) a snarl on Park Street flyover. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	Thousands were forced to jostle with each other to grab a toehold in packed buses or run after taxis charging a premium outside Metro stations as Calcuttas transport lifeline went on the blink on Wednesday.        
	The train derailment underground translated into overcrowded buses, long queues for taxis and traffic snarls on the ground. Those who usually reach their destinations in minutes spent hours on the road, missing appointments.         
	I reached Kavi Nazrul around 10am and learnt that the Metro was available only till Maidan. I rushed out of the station and managed to board a bus. But it was so crowded that I had to remain standing on a footboard till Rabindra Sadan, said Debayan Basu, who was headed for Girish Park.         
	Many were not as lucky. I had to wait 40 minutes outside Jatin Das Park station till a bus came along that I could even attempt boarding, said Asima Patra, a regular Metro commuter.         
	The scene was similar at the other end of the city. I had assumed that Metro services would be restored by the time I reach Belgachhia station around 1pm. But on my way down to the platform I heard on the public address system that trains were plying only till Girish Park and that too at 30-minute intervals, said Biswanath Dutta, who was headed for Chandni Chowk. He finally had to change three buses to reach the city centre.        
	Those who could not board buses were at the mercy of taxi drivers out to make a killing.         
	Taxis were plying between Maidan and Esplanade with six passengers each and charging Rs 20 per head, said Sharanya Dey, who was stranded outside Maidan station in the afternoon. The rate from Rashbehari to Esplanade was Rs 130 per passenger.         
	Many Metro commuters got off at Maidan and started walking to their destinations disrupting traffic flow. The queue of vehicles on the eastern flank of JL Nehru Road stretched till the Park Street flyover. The snarl extended to the Exide crossing on the western flank.        
	Vehicular movement also slowed down at the Park Street and Esplanade crossings.        
	With hundreds of people coming out of the station at regular intervals it was impossible to ensure smooth traffic flow, said a senior traffic police officer.        
	The traffic situation was better outside Girish Park station.        
	To prevent mob violence, RPF personnel were deployed in large numbers outside the two stations where trains were being terminated.

                Four plastic and iron parts godowns at Maniktala, near Kakurgachhi railway bridge, were gutted in a blaze early on Wednesday. Eleven tenders took three hours to douse the flames. The cause of the fire and extent of the damage could not be ascertained.     Upendra Prasad Nayak, a former merchant navy officer from Orissa, was duped into paying Rs 2 lakh for nothing when he approached a tout for US dollars on Wednesday. Police said Nayak and his friend Arjun Dolui met the tout in Goragachha, Lake Town. Following a deal, the tout handed over to them a bag full of US dollars against Rs 2 lakh. But after the tout left, Nayak discovered the bag did not contain dollars.     Services in the Sealdah-Barasat section of Eastern Railway were suspended for about 40 minutes on Wednesday afternoon after a crack was spotted in an Up track near Barasat station. Officials said the trains were diverted through other tracks till the crack was repaired.    Two men died after a truck hit the bike they were riding and then crushed them under its wheels on National Highway 6 near Salap, in Howrah, late on Tuesday. Manoj Giri, 35, and Vijayendra Rajak, 37, were taken to Howrah District Hospital, where they were declared dead.    Six shanties were gutted in a fire at Nawdapara in Belghoria, on the northern city fringes, on Wednesday morning. Three tenders took an hour to douse the blaze. Fire department officials suspect an electrical short-circuit had led to the blaze.

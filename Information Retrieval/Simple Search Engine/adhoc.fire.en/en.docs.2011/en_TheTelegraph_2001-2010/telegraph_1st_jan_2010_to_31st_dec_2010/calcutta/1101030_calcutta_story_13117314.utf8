The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Presi promises quick comeback 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Presi promises quick comeback

	Presidency University has vowed to resume normal academic activities in the chemistry department after the festive holidays, dispelling the fears of students and researchers that they would lose months waiting for the fire-ravaged laboratories to be resurrected.        
	The reconstruction will take time but we are planning a series of temporary arrangements like using the undergraduate chemistry laboratories for postgraduate practical classes, said a member of the Presidency think tank.        
	The onus of replacing the damaged equipment and the chemicals destroyed in the fire is on the university, but the rebuilding will be done by the public works department.        
	The damage caused by the fire on Friday will be assessed after the forensic team completes its probe next week.        
	Prof Kankan Bhattacharyya, the director of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, said it could take up to seven months for the gutted laboratories to be fully functional.        
	Even if the government releases funds promptly, it takes time to manufacture furniture customised for a lab, said Bhattacharyya, an alumnus of Presidency.        
	Reader Jyoti Nath Pal said the department would try to ensure that postgraduate students didnt miss out on practicals after the resumption of classes on November 16. We would need to reschedule the lab sessions so that they dont overlap, he added.        
	Students are, however, apprehensive of a shortage of chemicals. Companies normally take three months to a year to deliver certain chemicals. How will the university procure replacements so quickly? a student wondered.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girl death an accident, say cops
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police ruled out foul play in the death of nine-year-old Anjali Chatterjee, who got accidentally locked in an iron chest in the attic of her Jagacha house in Howrah. The post-mortem report indicated the girl had died of suffocation.        
	The Class IV student went missing after she was seen playing on the roof of her house on Tuesday afternoon.        
	After failing to find her in the neighbourhood, the family members went to the roof and found her unconscious inside the discarded chest. She was taken to a nursing home, where she was declared dead.        
	H.K. Kusumakar, the superintendent of Howrah police, said: We are sure after a preliminary probe that there was no foul play behind the death. The girl must have entered the chest while playing and then the lid got locked.

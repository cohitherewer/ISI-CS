The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power normal, swelter relief hope falls flat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Power normal, swelter relief hope falls flat
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Foreigners in the city try to beat the heat. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Monday brought relief from power cuts but not from the swelter.        
	CESC managed to meet the days peak-hour demand of 1,513MW but a cloud cover that failed to bring rain pushed up the humidity and kept the weather uncomfortable.        
	The citys power situation, which took a hit for a week between March 5 and 12, recovered steadily over the weekend.        
	CESC has been generating to its capacity for some time now. The problem was primarily caused by reduced generation by the state utility, which had been getting inferior quality coal, said a power department official.        
	With the coal supply having been normalised and CESC and the state utility taking care of glitches, the power scene improved, he added.        
	A CESC spokesperson said the utility had generated 1,243MW and sent out 1,150MW during peak hour. Budge Budge sent out 717MW, Titagarh 223MW, Southern 137MW and New Cossipore 73MW. The remaining 363MW was imported. There was no load-shedding in CESC-served areas, the spokesperson told Metro.        
	The weather, however, was not as helpful, with the maximum humidity touching 95 per cent. To add to the woes, the forecast of thundershowers towards late afternoon or evening fell flat.        
	There is abundant moisture in the air over south Bengal, which is pushing up the humidity and is also responsible for the cloud cover, said an official of the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	The days minimum temperature was 25.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, while the maximum  36.7  was three degrees above normal.        
	Tuesday is likely to be partly cloudy. Rain or thundershower could occur towards the afternoon or evening. Temperatures are likely to range between 25 and 36 degrees Celsius, said the weatherman.        
	Strong northwesterlies and westerlies are prevalent across the Indo-Gangetic plain. A cyclonic circulation is also likely to form over Orissa and Chhattisgarh on Tuesday.        
	The conditions look favourable for some rain in Calcutta and its neighbourhood over the next few days. But the showers wont be enough to lower the temperature, the weatherman added.

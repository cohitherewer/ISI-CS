	London came down to Calcutta in May when Anglo-Indian author Glen Peters, Rebecca Gould, theatre director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, playwright Lewis Davies and Indian-Irish actress Shereen Martineau visited the city with the aim of turning Glens best-selling murder mystery Mrs DSilvas Detective Instincts and the Shaitan of Calcutta into a play.         
	The three-day workshop, from May 11 to 13, conducted along with city theatre group Tin Can, was held at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre as background work on the play to be written by Davies.        
	The workshop was organised with a development grant from British Councils Connections Through Culture scheme and culminated in a discussion-and rehearsal sketch on May 12.         
	Peters story, set in the Anglo-Indian community of 1950s Calcutta, sees Joan DSilva, a widow, solve the murder of Agnes, an 18-year-old Anglo-Indian girl. Peters was a former student of Don Bosco, Liluah, and left for England at the age of 16.                   Participants at the workshop organised at Seagull Art and Media Resource Centre in May.

	The workshop included discussions on 1950s Calcutta, including the theatre of the period (by Katy Lai Roy of The Red Curtain), sketches depicting Calcutta of the time by a young artist, as well as a days trip across the city. We had stopovers at places like Marble Palace, St Johns Church, Dalhousie and the rooftop restaurant Blue and Beyond on Lindsay Street, spots that capture the citys essence, said Soumyak Kanti De Biswas of Tin Can, who will also direct the play.         
	Gould, who facilitated the workshop, asked the Tin Can actors to enact various situations in the scene-making segment, like Joan DSilva having a good day.         
	Finding a middle ground between the textbook style of UK theatre and Tin Cans visual sensibility was an interesting challenge, said Gould.         
	On May 12, Martineau read out sections from the novel, followed by a 10-minute performance based on the novel by the actors.        
	The goal is to stage the play in both London and Calcutta, said Gould.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Where visitors fear to tread
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Where visitors fear to tread
          SUBHAJOY ROY                                            
	If you have family or friends flying home for Diwali, youd wish they had rather come by train.        
	A trip to Calcutta airport is as much of an ordeal for those who have to wait outside  because of a festival-season bar on visitors  as for those flying in or out. From a cramped parking area and a constricted exit to a dreadfully dirty washroom, visitors get more than a glimpse of the airport that makes us go aargh!.        
	Metro stood outside the airport with several others on Dhanteras evening to share their misery.        
	Car chaos        
	WHAT: Finding a parking space could be as taxing as locating the runway in fog.        
	Satyaki Dutta spent 15 minutes going round in circles. Abandoned trolleys and arbitrarily parked cars and taxis had taken up all the open spaces. It was time for my daughter to land by the time I managed to park.        
	When he came back with his daughter  a student in Pune  they spent another 20 minutes trying to figure out how to reach the car and then leave the parking lot.        
	Two other cars were parked in front. The drivers must have been forced to park there in the absence of any suitable space, said the Behala resident.         
	All this when the parking lot was still not full. Long lines of trolleys were blocking several bays. No metro airport has a car park this small, said retired army officer Santosh Sengupta.        
	WHY: Lack of space, said an official of the agency handling the facility. Earlier, the taxis used to be parked outside. Now, they have come in. The VIP car park, which used to be separate, has also become part of our facility because of some construction work there, said the official.        
	Airport sources said the taxis were forced inside because of the traffic chaos they caused near the exit.        
	But why isnt there someone to remove the trolleys left behind by passengers? No answer.        
	What can visitors with cars do? People should keep their vehicles in the parking lot for the international terminal (500 metres away) when the domestic area is full, suggested airport director R. Srinivasan.         
	Waiting woes        
	WHAT: Dutta was lucky his daughter arrived on time.         
	A narrow passage leads out of the only airport exit. Touts, taxi drivers and visitors jostle for space along the guard rails lining it.        
	Every time an elderly gentleman craned his neck to see if his son had arrived, a cabbie abused him from behind because his view of potential customers was blocked.        
	Theres not a single seat near the exit door, so even the aged have to stand. (Some 50 seats are there near the entrance to the terminal.)        
	In Mumbai, the sprawling, canopy-covered waiting area has hundreds of seats and even a restaurant.        
	Former armyman Sengupta, 66, said: Barring visitors to reduce the chaos inside is okay, but the authorities must also think of people like us. He was there to receive his army officer son, who was coming home with his wife and eight-year-old son.        
	WHY: No special arrangement can be made for the temporary visitor zone, said an official. If seats were placed outside, the congestion would have increased manifold. Besides, there is hardly any space outside the building to add seats, he added.         
	Toilet trauma        
	WHAT: You can thank your stars if the plane is on time. There could be some excruciating running around and cursing to do otherwise.        
	The only washroom outside the terminal building is next to the parking lot, about 100 metres away. If your bladder is about to burst, you will have to dribble through cars and use the only option available for around 400 visitors and several hundred drivers.        
	Anumita Kundu, waiting for her friend from Delhi, said: When I asked a CISF officer for the washroom, he pointed towards the parking lot.        
	She could have just followed the stench but she felt scared to walk through the touts, taxis and the darkness. These are basic facilities, but we lack them, she said.        
	And on top of that, the toilet is a mess. We dont mind a pay-and-use facility as long as it is properly maintained. This one is a hell hole, said a leading travel agent in town.        
	In Mumbai, the waiting area has a clean toilet with proper signage. And enough drinking water facilities.        
	WHY: The authorities feel it is all right to make people suffer because the visitor bar is not permanent. Visitors can enter the terminal after November 7 and access the washrooms inside, said an official.        
	Spot the board        
	WHAT: The airport authorities seem to be doing visitors a favour by letting them know the status of flights. Why else should there be a solitary flight display board in the waiting area?        
	WHY: It is not a problem at all for the authorities  once again, because the visitor bar is not permanent. Just from Durga Puja to Diwali.

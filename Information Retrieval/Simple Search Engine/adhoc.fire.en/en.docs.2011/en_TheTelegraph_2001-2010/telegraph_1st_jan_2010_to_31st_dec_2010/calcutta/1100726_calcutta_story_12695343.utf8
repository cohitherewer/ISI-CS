          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 45-year-old mother of three admitted to a city hospital with common gynaecological problems was found to have two uteruses and vaginas  a congenital deformity found in one in a lakh women.        
	Sabina Shahab, a Dhaka resident, was unaware of the problem till she underwent a surgery at Ruby General Hospital, Calcutta, on July 15. We had planned to remove her uterus and cervix but after we detected the disorder we put off the surgery, said gynaecologist Abhinibesh Chatterjee, who led the team of doctors that made the diagnosis.        
	Usually uterus is formed from two tubes that unite. If the tubes fail to unite such a disorder happens, said gynaecologist Ranjit Chakraborty.         
	Sabinas husband A.K. Shahabuddin, a trader, said her condition was not detected when she gave birth to her daughters.

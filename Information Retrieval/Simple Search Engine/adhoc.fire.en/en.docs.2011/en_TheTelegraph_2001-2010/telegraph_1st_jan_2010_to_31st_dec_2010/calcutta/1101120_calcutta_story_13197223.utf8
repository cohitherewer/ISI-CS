The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pool car protest over ban
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pool car protest over ban
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Around a third of the citys illegal fleet of pool cars went off the road on Friday to protest the ban on ferrying schoolchildren by certain vehicles even as the government kept a door ajar for these wheels.        
	Anjan Mukherjee of the Bengal Car Pool Welfare Association said the strike would continue till Monday, insisting that it was unfair and illogical to bar operators from ferrying schoolchildren by Maruti Omni, Tata Magic and Tata Winger while allowing these to be used as ambulances.        
	If the Maruti Omni is banned, more than 65 per cent of the citys pool cars need to be taken off the road, Mukherjee argued.        
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu, who chaired a meeting at Writers Buildings to discuss the crackdown, said cars with engines under the floor were unsafe to ferry schoolchildren.         
	These vehicles also lack a boot and, therefore, dont have any cushion in front or the back. They are prone to toppling as well, Kundu added.        
	So why does the list of 262 licence applications approved so far include some for banned vehicles? Those who have already got permits will be allowed to ply the Omni, Winger and Magic. But no more applications will be accepted for these types of cars, the transport m77inister said.        
	A Tata Magic ferrying four students of Sudhir Memorial School rammed into a lamp post near the Madhyamgram crossing late in the afternoon. The passengers, students of Classes VI and VII, suffered minor injuries. The driver of the car was detained and the vehicle sent for a test.        
	Transport officials admitted that the decision to allow some Omni, Winger and Magic cars to ply had already taken the sting out of the ban. Its only a matter of time before the transport minister is forced to ease the rules for the rest, a source said.        
	The department has so far received 1,108 applications for registration, less than a fourth of the 5,000-strong fleet.         
	The cars whose applications have been rejected include 470 that came with tax and ownership discrepancies. Another 298 applications were found to be incomplete.        
	Fridays strike left many schoolchildren stranded in different parts of the city as scuffles broke out between operators supporting and opposing the protest.         
	In Chetla, a pool car ferrying students of Sri Sri Academy was stopped by strike supporters and the tyres deflated. The driver of a pool car was allegedly slashed with a blade in Behala while returning from South Point.         
	We have lodged complaints. Those on strike tried to intimidate us into joining them but we didnt, said Abir Roy, the secretary of the Pool Car Owners Welfare Association.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SRK pushes amp; Sana prays
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SRK pushes amp; Sana prays
  - Boys let down go-go boss                                              
	Toss lost, no SRK. Shane Bond races in, no SRK. When will he come? wonders a voice in the contentious IPL Club Lounge. As if on cue, enter the man. Fuss free. In a black full tee and blue jeans. Escorted by IPL boss Lalit Modi.        
	Metro was there, three rows behind Shah Rukh Khan in the Rs 32,000 gallery, to keep an eye on every move he made. This is some of what you did not see the KKR boss do on Tuesday evening, on television (because the cameras did not capture it) or at the Eden Gardens (because we presume you were watching the cricket).          
	 Wife Gauri is holidaying in Dubai with her friends, but the front row is packed with Gauris family (led by her grandmother). He hugs them before hopping over to the enemy side, greets Krish Srikkanth and Team Yellow.  
	 Is handed the KKR tee. Starts to slip on the purple over the black one. Waves to the crowd. Shows a thumbs up. Blows a kiss. Puts on the KKR tee. Settles down. Pulls down collar. Takes out black collar properly. With some help from a blonde KKR girl and also Gauris grandmother.        
	 The stadium deejay plays I Know You Want Me. SRK drums up a beat on the white railing.        
	 Downs a cold drink.        
	 Takes advantage of the strategic break to slip into the air-conditioned comfort of the lounge below, presumably for a smoke.        
	 Gets a second cup of cold drink. Offers one to Kangana Ranaut, sitting not far from his left elbow. Looks a little stressed. Shows time on his watch to a friend. Is the over-rate penalty beginning to pinch King Khan?        
	 Sits quietly, watching intently. Waves to Wasim Akram in the dugout.        
	 Head-bangs to We Will, We Will Rock You.        
	 Juhi Chawla whispers into his right ear. He nods.        
	 A bejewelled Bappi Lahiri stomps across to meet SRK. (Is the temporary structure of the 32K gallery under real threat?) Shah Rukh greets Bappida and hugs Jisshu Sengupta (match one it was Jeet, match two it is Jisshu).        
	 Looks restless. Nods his head to the Chennai Super Kings theme song, after a six.        
	 Gets up to cheer his boys back to the pavilion and then slips to ground level, first to the dugout and then to the AC lounge below.        
	 No sign of SRK well into the KKR batting. Wickets are tumbling, wheres our hero?        
	 Hes back. This time just in the purple tee. Must be feeling the heat.        
	 When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Come on, guys, shouts the team owner to his boys. Gets up. Claps. Urges crowd to cheer. Claps louder.        
	 A rare boundary and he is back on his feet. Go, go, go, shouts SRK, like coach Kabir Khan in Chak De! India. Sips from a cola bottle.        
	 As last wicket falls, he downs his drink. Touches Gauris grandmothers feet. Signs autographs. Disappears.   
	DAD rsquo;S ARMY              The first family of Calcutta cricket was at the Eden Gardens, with wife Dona and daughter Sana cheering on Sourav Ganguly from the IPL Club Lounge, five rows behind SRK. Metro tracked their mood		      
	 ldquo;Ma, look baba, rdquo; smiles Sana, pointing at Sourav down below.  
	 Daddy rsquo;s eight-year-old darling goes ldquo;boo rdquo; when the public address system welcomes the Chennai Super Kings.  
	 ldquo;There rsquo;s daddy, rdquo; she squeals, as he walks back after losing the toss.  
	 Sana moves up mdash; to take a snap of SRK. Returns to her seat, all excited.  
	 Dona drums up support for hubby. ldquo;Wicket wicket bolo, vibration jata hai. After 20 overs, six six bolna. rdquo; So she goes ldquo;out, out rdquo;.   
	 Sana leaves for dinner after gentle persuasion from mother.  
	 She is back by the end of the second over to watch daddy bat. She rsquo;s armed with a ldquo;6 rdquo; sign.  
	 Daddy rsquo;s girl shouts ldquo;no chance rdquo; to an LBW appeal against Sourav. The umpire must have heard her.  
	 ldquo;Baba, baba, rdquo; she chants. ldquo;Come on, Knight Riders, rdquo; she shouts.  
	 ldquo;Good run, baba, come on, rdquo; she urges.  
	 ldquo;Come on god we need to win, rdquo; she prays. ldquo;Baba, baba, rdquo; she chants.  
	 ldquo;Thank god, baba rsquo;s not out, rdquo; she whispers, when Owais Shah departs.  
	 Dona is worried about the negative vibrations. ldquo;Be positive, rdquo; she reminds Sana.  
	 Sourav goes. Sana goes silent. She rsquo;s heartbroken.      SHRADHA AGARWAL

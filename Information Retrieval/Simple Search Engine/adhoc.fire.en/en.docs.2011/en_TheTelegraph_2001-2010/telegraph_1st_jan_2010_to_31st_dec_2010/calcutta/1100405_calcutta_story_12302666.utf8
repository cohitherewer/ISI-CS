The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Theft probe draws a blank
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Theft probe draws a blank
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police are yet to get any lead on the domestic help accused of stealing Rs 25 lakh in cash and jewellery from a Gariahat flat and killing a maid through drug overdose.        
	Two acquaintances of Amrit, the help, have been detained for questioning.        
	Nothing concrete has emerged from the interrogation of the two youths, who live in the Park Circus area and work as domestic help in south Calcutta, said an officer of Gariahat police station.        
	Amrit, believed to be from Nepal, was hired by Pawan Drolias family five days ago. Amrit had allegedly drugged the Drolias maid Annapurna Sharma when the family members were away on Friday evening and fled with cash and jewellery worth Rs 25 lakh.        
	Drolias son Akash, who helps his father run their pen factory in Belgachia, later found Sharma dead in the seventh-floor apartment.        
	An officer probing the case said Amrit, introduced to the Drolias by a guard, might have fled the city. The familys lack of knowledge about Amrits address is coming in the way of the probe. Despite repeated requests, people do not provide us with the photograph, address and other details of their help.        
	The Drolias had told Metro on Saturday that they did not get the opportunity to send Amrits photograph and address to the police station.        
	We have alerted our counterparts in the districts. Apparently, it was a planned act and we suspect two or three people were involved in the crime, the officer added.        
	Drolia talked to the police on Sunday morning and learnt that there had been no headway in the probe.        
	The officers assured us that they would be able to zero in on the culprit shortly, said Drolia.

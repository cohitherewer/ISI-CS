The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fireworks link to pollution
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fireworks link to pollution
  - Particulate count shot up on Diwali-Kali Puja        JAYANTA BASU SANJAY MANDAL                                                   
	Srijita Kanjis relief from asthma for the past two years came to an abrupt end this Diwali, when the eight-year-old suffered a fresh bout of severe breathing problems.        
	She suffered a severe asthma attack immediately after Diwali. The distress continued for a couple of weeks, prompting us to take her to her doctor again, recalled mother Iti, a Kasba resident.        
	Srijitas is not an isolated case. Thousands of city residents, including children, have been forced to breathe in foul air on Diwali-Kali Puja.        
	The bursting and burning of millions of fireworks across the city on November 5 not only affected the eardrums but also choked the lungs and infected the respiratory systems of the residents, an analysis of state pollution control boards data has revealed. The data was generated by 18 manual stations of the board in the city.        
	The average respirable particulate matter (RPM) content in the citys air shot up nearly four times on Kali Puja-Diwali over the previous days figure, from 75 to 262 microgram per cubic metre. The national permissible standard is 100.        
	The RPM level came down to 103 microgram three days later, clearing establishing a link between the sudden spurt in the pollution level to the bursting of fireworks.        
	The data generated by the boards automatic station at Victoria Memorial, a stones throw from SSKM Hospital, showed that the RPM content in the air shot up to 288 and 475 microgram on November 5 and 6, respectively.        
	The situation was similar last year, too, with the RPM clocking 338 microgram around the marble monument on Diwali.        
	The respirable particulate is one of the most potent pollutants that can trigger a host of lung ailments. Plaban Mukherjee, the head of the cardiothoracic department at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, said the RPMs had both short and long-term effects.         
	Apart from causing viral infections, they can aggravate pre-existing lung diseases like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), said Mukherjee.        
	Paediatricians say children are the most vulnerable to RPM hazards.        
	The respiratory tube of children is narrower than adults and easily get choked by particulates. They are also more vulnerable to heavy particles because they settle close to the ground, said Apurba Ghosh, director, Institute of Child Health.        
	Two-and-a-half-year-old Akash has been suffering from severe cough and cold since Diwali and has been unable to sleep at night. He has been suffering for the past two weeks, said mother Sudeshna Nag.        
	We are now scared of Diwali and fear a repeat of the trauma around this time next year, too. No one seems bothered about pollution and its adverse effects on health, she said.        
	Arunabha Sengupta, an ENT specialist at SSKM Hospital, said more than 10 per cent of the patients turning up at his departments outpatients wing since Diwali have been suffering from allergic cough and cold and shortness of breath.        
	The RPMs act as allergic factors and also constrict the respiratory tract, causing breathing distress.        
	Dipak Chakrabarty, the chief scientist of the pollution control board, said all fireworks contained metal salts that caused the release of fine particulates into the air upon bursting.        
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the pollution control board, said the volume of fireworks being sold in the city on Diwali has increased significantly.         
	It should be kept in mind that the RPM content is surging despite restrictions on crackers and the fact that there are considerably lesser number of vehicles on the road on Kali Puja-Diwali than on other days.        
	Mukherjee suggested that there be a deadline for burning fireworks to contain pollution on festive days and nights.

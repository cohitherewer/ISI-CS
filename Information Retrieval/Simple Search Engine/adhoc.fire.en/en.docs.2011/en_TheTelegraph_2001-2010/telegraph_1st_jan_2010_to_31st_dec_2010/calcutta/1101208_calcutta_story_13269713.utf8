The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police trim car park list
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Police trim car park list

	Police have not allowed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to offer parking slots for a fee on 41 roads out of the 70 proposed by the civic body for technical reasons.         
	Currently, Calcutta offers fee-parking space for 7,510 cars on 275 roads. According to the city traffic police, about a million vehicles ply in the city. The number is growing at over 4 per cent every year, making creation of more parking space a must.         
	Cop clearance for 29 more roads  after a gap of almost a year and a half  will allow about 450 additional vehicles to be parked in the city. The slots would not be available before March 2011, said civic officials.        
	Key arteries like Strand Road, Narkeldanga Main Road and BB Ganguly Street, apart from several smaller roads, have been dropped from the list sent to Lalbazar by the civic authorities.         
	Three factors were considered for each proposed road  the demand for parking in the area, whether there is any restriction like No Parking and whether traffic flow would be affected if parking is allowed, said a senior cop.        
	Civic officials, for instance, had sought permission for fee-parking on Creek Row but the cops felt the road was not wide enough to allow smooth movement of vehicles once a part of it is occupied by parked vehicles. Elliot Road and Darga Road were rejected on the same ground.        
	Roads like Little Russell Street and Elgin Road were dropped from the list since they are No-Parking zones. Others like SN Banerjee and BB Ganguly Street were rejected because traffic is diverted to these roads in an emergency, said an officer.         
	Since we need to work with cops, theres not much we can do about roads being removed from the list. We will meet on Wednesday to work out how the new parking zones can be made operational and whether more roads can be added to the list, said mayoral council member Rajib Deb.        
	The CMC earns Rs 6.34 crore annually from parking lots run by co-operatives. Those manning parking lots often charge extra, admitted civic officials.         
	There have been several complaints about over-charging, so we have urged the civic body to ensure that those manning the parking lots should be provided a uniform, an identity-badge and a letter of authorisation. The parking rates should be clearly displayed, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Bandopadhayay.

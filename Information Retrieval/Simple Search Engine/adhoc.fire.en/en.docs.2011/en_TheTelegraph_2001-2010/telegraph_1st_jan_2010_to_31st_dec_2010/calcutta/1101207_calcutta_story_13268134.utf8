                First-year undergraduate students of Presidency University, registered with Calcutta University, on Monday met Presidency vice-chancellor Amita Chatterjee and demanded that their registration be transferred to the new varsity.   he vice-chancellor told the students that their demand would be considered only after the Presidency University statute was ready.  She said she had no problem in inducting first-year students into the university. But the transfer cannot be confirmed till the statute is ready, said Joy Saha, one of the first-year students.   The statute wont be ready before March, Saha quoted Chatterjee as saying.  We are planning to meet higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri and request him to ready the statute by January, said Saha.

	Lately, I have found my mind turning towards Jackie Shroff. Before this disclosure (justifiably) alarms my friends and my family, I would like to explain that I have been thinking of the actor since I saw him market a product with a strange name, one that claims to enhance the virility of Indian men. Kind-hearted folks may feel that it is a bit too early for me to start thinking on such matters. But I would urge them to take a look at the advertisement, for very few commercials are as amusing or wickedly enlightening as this one.         
	I thought at first that Shroff was promoting a breakfast cereal. But then I discovered that this was not muesli, but Safed Musli  a supposedly potent medicine that promises to turn men into virile creatures. In the advertisement, the portly, ageing Shroff is seen entering a house with a disarming smile. He seems to be in a magnanimous mood, and goes about distributing the magic capsules to everyone present.         
	A young couple accept Shroffs offering dutifully. Even the old man and his aged wife are not spared. The elderly lady looks positively thrilled, although I thought that the cure had arrived a bit too late in the day in her case. Job done, Shroff, wisely, retreats from that erotically charged space.         
	If the idea of a bloated and puffy-eyed Shroff as a symbol of red-blooded manliness strikes you as incredulous, you surely havent read about Japani Tel yet. I have often wondered why the makers of this wonder drug chose to call their tel Japani. Japan, I was told during my visit to that country, is one of the worlds fastest ageing societies. My grim-faced host in Tokyo, a man of indeterminate age, had whispered that the government doles out money to Japanese couples if they manage to have a baby. For a product that promises to be an elixir of youth, the choice of the name struck me as a little odd.         
	But then I came across a poster at the corner of Madan Street. It featured a drug that promised to cure infertility for men of all ages. The name of the manufacturing company, written in a scrawl, was G.H. Genitals. For a moment, I stood completely still in the middle of that throng of drivers, tea-sellers and buyers of cheap electronic goods. Jackie Shroff and Japani Tel paled in comparison to this piece of creative ingenuity.        
	But these products with funny names are no laughing matter. They, apparently, cater to a burgeoning market that was valued to be over Rs 200 crore two years ago. I find two things particularly perturbing though. First, in a country notorious for a thriving market in spurious medicine, not much is known about the impact of such drugs on the health of consumers, many of whom are poor and uninformed. Second, I am also intrigued by the token presence of women in these commercials. My guess is that women are still expected to put up with the pill-enhanced antics of their partners demurely.         
	Meanwhile, three footballers who play for a club sponsored by the makers of Safed Musli were arrested after allegedly misbehaving with an air hostess. (Did I hear someone mention overdose?) The sponsor has threatened to drop out. If that were to happen, there would mercifully be 11 less virile men in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic clog on Behala stretch 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Traffic clog on Behala stretch 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A traffic snarl at Taratala on Tuesday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Snarls have slowed traffic to a crawl on the 1.3km stretch between Burdwan Road and Ajanta theatre since Monday evening after parts of Taratala flyover and Majherhat bridge had to be shut for repairs.        
	I needed half an hour to cross the flyover and the bridge on Monday. If this continues, I will have to take another route to work and back, said Arup Goswami, a Behala resident who works in a private bank in Shyambazar.        
	Traffic sergeants pleaded helplessness as vehicles stood still in long queues during the morning and evening peak hours on Tuesday.         
	Those who cover the stretch in three to four minutes needed more than 30 minutes to do so since Monday evening. With a flank of the flyover closed, we put up guard rails on the other flank so that vehicles moved in a single file, said a traffic cop.        
	A concrete chunk on the eastern flank of Majherhat bridge, which holds up high-tension electricity wires, had collapsed on the railway tracks below on Monday evening. The flank was closed till engineers completed repairs early on Tuesday.         
	The situation was worst on Monday evening. With trains not plying to Budge Budge, people were stuck at the Taratala crossing till late at night, said a cop.         
	Repairs on the eastern flank of Taratala flyover from which an expansion joint had been jutting out since last week is the other factor behind the long snarls. Installation of a new expansion joint will continue till Sunday. Vehicles would be allowed on the flank after a week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pre-Diwali blaze in building
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pre-Diwali blaze in building
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	A fire, probably sparked by a pre-Diwali cracker or diya, singed City High, a 15-storey highrise on Prince Anwar Shah Road, and plunged 180 flats into darkness and dread on Wednesday evening.        
	Fire officers said around 12 residents fell ill because of the smoke but no one was trapped in the six-year-old building adjacent to Navina cinema.        
	A preliminary probe suggested that the blaze was sparked by a firecracker  probably a rocket  that landed on the plastic shed of the electrical control room on the 15th floor, a little after 8pm. The other suspect is the host of diyas that firemen found near the electrical room.        
	The flames then travelled through an electrical cable duct and hit the electrical control room on the ground floor.        
	There was a blast and flames started leaping out. We all rushed down, said Subhra Sengupta, a resident of City High, which is split into three towers, each with two sets of staircases.        
	Three fire-tenders managed to douse the flames within an hour, even as the nightmare of Stephen Court, barely seven months ago, cast a shadow from Park Street to Prince Anwar Shah Road.        
	An open flame had probably landed on the shed of the electrical control room on the 15th floor, melted it and set the room on fire. The fire then reached the ground floor through an electrical cable duct and set the electrical room ablaze, said Bishnu Prasad Dhar, the station officer of Kalighat Fire Brigade.        
	The highrise was evacuated in a hurry and the power lines switched off.        
	I saw sparks coming out of the AC in my room and rushed out of the flat with my two kids. Down on the lawn with the other residents, I saw the electrical control room on the ground floor in flames and spotted some flames on the top floors as well, said Vandana Khandelwal, a resident.        
	The apartment is home to the likes of Tollywood actress-cum-Trinamul MP Satabdi Roy and Tollywood actor Abhishek Chatterjee.        
	I live on the ninth floor of the second tower with my wife and child. Just after 8pm, I suddenly heard people screaming outside and went to the verandah. The security guards then came up to my flat and told us to leave as they would switch off the lights. We all gathered in the parking area and the garden, waiting for the firefighters to do their job, said Chatterjee.        
	A large police contingent cordoned off the building and combed it. We used the public address system and checked each and every floor to make sure no one was left behind or injured. Thankfully, all residents are safe, said Supratim Sarkar, the deputy commissioner of police (south).        
	Satabdi Roy, who lives on the 12th floor, was not at home when the fire broke out but she rushed back as soon as she was alerted by her father. My six-year-old son Samrajya was at home with a domestic help. I was so relieved to see him safe on the building lawn. The fire brigade officials were alert and prevented the fire from spreading and causing major damage, said Satabdi.        
	Indrani Kanjilal, a teacher who lives on the third floor, said a fellow resident had fallen down and fractured his ankle while fleeing. An old bed-ridden couple on the 12th floor of the third tower could not come down, but a rescue team went up and ensured that they were safe, she said.        
	Abigail Neogi, a resident of the 12th floor, said they had all been very lucky but the fire should be treated as a wake-up call. Every flat should have an alarm. When people saw smoke and fire, neighbours started calling each other to evacuate the building. That created such panic.

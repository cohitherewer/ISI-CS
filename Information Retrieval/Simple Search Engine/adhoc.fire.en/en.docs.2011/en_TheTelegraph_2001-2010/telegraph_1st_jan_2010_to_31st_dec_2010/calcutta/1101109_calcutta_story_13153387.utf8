The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Long walk from Russia
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Long walk from Russia

	Three Polish youths last week completed in Calcutta a six-month arduous journey on foot, horseback and bicycle that they had begun at Yakutsk in Russian Far East.         
	Tomasz Grzywaczewski, Bartosz Malinowski and Philip Drozdz undertook the Long Walk Plus Expedition to remind people about Polish officer Witold Glinski and his companions, who in 1941 had fled from the Siberian Gulag to Calcutta.         
	After Poland was occupied by the erstwhile Soviets, several thousand Polish were deported to Siberia and put in labour camps called the Gulag. Glinski with six other men escaped and managed to reach Calcutta, said 24-year-old Tomasz, a journalist.         
	In March, the trio had met Glinski in England, where he had relocated after the escape.        
	He is 88 now and does not remember the journey too well, said Philip, a student of Polish Film School.        
	The trio retraced the officers footsteps, across the Lena river, Baikal lake area, Gobi desert and Tibetan plateau to Nepal and then India. The temperature varied from 5 to 50 degrees Celsius and they had to survive on limited food and water.        
	At least we had sleeping bags and winter garments, but Glinski and his companions did not even have that, said Bartosz, a tour operator.         
	The three had to hitch rides on motor boats and goods vessels to cross the Lena river and push bicycles through the Gobi desert with their noses bleeding because of the heat.        
	The Barguzinsky mountains in Russia were particularly dangerous. For 21 days, we did not meet a single human being, said Philip.         
	The journey was enlivened by interesting encounters, such as the one with a history teacher who accompanied them through a Siberian forest or a Polish girl in the Gobi desert.        
	The three were received in the city by the honorary consul of Poland in Calcutta, Mohan Goenka.

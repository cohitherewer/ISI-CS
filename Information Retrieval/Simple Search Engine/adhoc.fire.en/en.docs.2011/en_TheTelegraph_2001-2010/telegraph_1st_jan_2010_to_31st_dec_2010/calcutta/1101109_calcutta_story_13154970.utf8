                      Fundamentals of visual vocabulary                    Among the adjectives art historians and critics have used to describe the works of Jogen Chowdhury, playful is not one that immediately springs to mind. However, in this body of his work comprising drawings, doodles and sketches from 1983 to 2009, he addresses his art with a significant degree of freedom and unselfconscious abandon, thereby infusing it with playful, exuberant forms. Through these works, the viewer feels closer to the artists hand, eye, and mind; they are about searching and thought rather than completion. They can move at the speed of thought, and can occur in thoughts awkward places. Dashed off on stray scraps of paper, they are casual, free and idiosyncratic. The best among them embody a basic, firm language of line which combines, recombines, transforms and scatters, as though seeking form. Each line is a shape with its own peculiar identity  some bleed, some elegantly taper, some are swift  and together they pull against rigid formality and construct their own basic visual language focusing on the visual syntax of point, line and shape. A sleek, curving line on an otherwise unmarked piece of paper makes a decisive assertion of what a line can do: fundamentally activate the space around it.

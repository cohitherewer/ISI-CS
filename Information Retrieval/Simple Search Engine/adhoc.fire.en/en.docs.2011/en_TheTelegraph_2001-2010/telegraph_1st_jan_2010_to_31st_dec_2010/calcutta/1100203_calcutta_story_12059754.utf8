The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata show in Buddha backyard
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mamata show in Buddha backyard
  - Railway minister promises to make Book Fair best in the country          OUR BUREAU                                                Mamata Banerjee displays her book Nandi Ma at Book Fair on Tuesday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)      
	Book-lover Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees favourite fair rolled out the red carpet for rival Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday evening, setting the stage for another ego battle between Bengals big two.         
	Didi aaschey (Didis coming) was the buzz at the fairground rather than Buddhababu aashbe na (Buddhababus not coming)  sources said he was scheduled to make a visit  as officials of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild rushed to welcome Mamata to the 34th Calcutta Book Fair.        
	Fawning guild members, who have been getting stick for the nightlong blackout on Saturday and other organisational lapses at Milon Mela, found Mamata to be not only a sympathetic listener but also eager to contribute. The railway minister promised to help make the next edition of the glitch-a-day fair the best in the country.        
	Its a different matter that the sops chief minister Bhattacharjee lavished on the guild, which might lack efficiency but not cash, failed to make the 34th edition of the fair the best of its kind.        
	Metro had reported on January 30 how the guild had received more than Rs 1 crore worth of dole and waivers despite having investments of Rs 1.2 crore and a bank balance of Rs 65 lakh.        
	Mamata, whose 27th book Nandi Ma was released by writer Mahasveta Devi at the press box a little later, agreed that the fair could have been organised better. Books lead us from darkness to light. But the opposite happened (the blackout) a couple of days ago. We will ensure that from next year the fair is held in a better way, she added.        
	So who was to blame for the lapses this year?         
	I think the guild has done a commendable job. The state government should find a larger venue for such a fair, Mamata said.        
	Mahasveta Devi, who had skipped the Trinamul Congress culture clubs annual party at artist Suvaprasannas Raichak retreat on Sunday, said she was very happy to be present at the launch of Mamatas book on Nandigram.        
	She writes her books with a lot of feelingher books have become bestsellers in Hindi too. She has always stood by the downtrodden, and she is like my daughter. She has this habit of going out in the morning after having only a cup of tea and some biscuits. So I call her up to enquire if she has eaten well, added Mahasveta Devi.        
	Mamata, seated said her latest book was based on facts. Earlier, I had written on the hunger strike for Singur. This book answers the why behind the Nandigram agitation. It should not be treated as literature but a factual account.         
	As Mamata stood up and made her way out, the crowd followed her. Flowerpots tumbled and cardboard walls creaked as the cops struggled to maintain order.        
	Aapnaderke request korchi aar dhukben na. Shob bhengey jaachhe (I request you not to enter the enclosure. Everything will fall apart), screamed ground convener Sudhangshu Dey, also the publisher of Mamatas book, with folded hands.         
	Once the crowd thinned, Mamata released singer Nachiketas book Nachiketa Omnibus, published by guild general secretary Tridib Chatterjees Patra Bharati. A face in the packed office room remarked that the book fair was now an all-Trinamul affair.        
	Mamata left the venue around 7.45pm after coffee.         
	An official said Bhattacharjee might do a round of the fair on Wednesday. Buddhababu had expressed his desire to visit the fair on Tuesday. But when he heard that Mamata would come, he smiled and said, some other day.  
	Mamata Banerjee will hold a sit-in in Metro channel from 11am to 7pm  
	Traffic woes:   
	The demonstration may bring central and parts of south Calcutta to a standstill.   
	Roads to be affected:   
	Lenin Sarani, Dorina crossing, both flanks of Metro channel, parts of AJC Bose Road, SN Banerjee Road, CR Avenue, JL Nehru Road, Bentinck Street, Rani Rashmoni Avenue, Old Court House Street, Brabourne Road, Strand Road, Esplanade East, AJC Bose Road and Asutosh Mukherjee Road. The entire central business district is feared to be choked.  
	Police arrangement:   
	A large number of policemen will be deployed at the venue as well as near all major crossings in central Calcutta from 10.30am. Cops have been asked to take on-the-spot decisions while regulating traffic. The Lalbazar control room will monitor the feed from closed-circuit TV cameras and instruct field officers accordingly.  
	Advice from cops: Commuters, especially those bound for central Calcutta, should travel by Metro.

	I think the system of unit tests should work better. Firstly, it will decrease the pressure on students. There is no need for the half-yearly or the annual horror show. The unit tests are enough to judge the calibre of a student. The system of unit tests can be put to use at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels as well to reduce the pressure on students.

	Annual examinations should give way to continuous evaluation, since in the current system students generally take recourse to cramming, solving model questions and taking the help of tutors to pass the tests. Continuous evaluation through unit tests would make students more attentive and focussed. Further, this system will help avoid undue tension of annual examinations and the need for tuitions would be reduced as well.

	Unit tests introduced in schools have a bizarre effect on the learning process by drawing a peculiar response from students and their parents alike. The unit tests always loom large in the students minds. As a tutor, I also find it exasperating to help them prepare for unit tests at the cost of providing more meaningful guidance. I am often forced to skim through portions of the syllabus as students keep insisting that I prepare them for unit tests the dates of which had been announced suddenly.

	Annual exams should not be replaced by unit tests because both have different utilities. Unit tests help teachers judge a student partially. But in case of annual exams we can judge what a student has learnt throughout the year after reading the entire syllabus. Moreover unit tests in the long run help students prepare for the annual exam. If we retain one type of test at the expense of the other the student will gradually start losing interest in the year-round learning process.

	I think the system of unit tests in schools is a wonderful idea. It should have been introduced long ago. The system is yielding fruitful results in most schools in the state. Through this system teachers can ascertain how the students have prepared themselves throughout a particular month. In case of unit tests students remain in touch with books and hence do well in annual exams. I think the system will minimise the burden on students. The system should also be introduced in colleges and universities. It will help students cope with the vast syllabus.

	Annual exams in schools should give way to continuous evaluation through unit tests. Unit tests make a students base stronger. He can prepare himself properly as he gets time to prepare his lessons part by part. But at the time of annual exams he tries to cram the entire syllabus into his head. This practice deprives him of knowledge in depth.

	I dont think annual exams should be replaced by unit tests. If that happens students will not be able to take the pressure associated with year-end exams. Later when they reach college they will turn out to be lily-livered students. Decades ago, our government tried to protect students from being overburdened by kicking English out of the curriculum. The move has only created a generation of students handicapped in behavioural and communicative skills.

	There should be a balance between the two. Short term unit tests are like text messages, brief, but not as good as the old essays. Students would benefit if they are allowed more time with text books; constant fear of performance in the unit tests puts pressure on them.We should allow them to grow naturally.               
	

MADHABI BANERJEE,

	Annual exams are a must as they are a test of a students long term memory. Continuous evaluation through unit tests makes the student meticulously go through the syllabi covered recently and tests only the short term memory. Abolishing annual exams would mean that the students would not go through the text books thoroughly and will depend upon notes given by teachers. Also, in case of unit tests they are continuously giving exams and are not getting proper time to hone their creative skills. So there should be a balance between the two and there should not be too much stress on unit tests.

	Continuous evaluation will make a student prepare a subject thoroughly. He/she will remember and be able to answer questions promptly whenever asked. Otherwise students tend to forget what they have studied because of lack of practice. Continuous evaluation will force the student to study sincerely every day.

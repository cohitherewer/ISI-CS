The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Appeal to end court strike
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Appeal to end court strike
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The state government on Tuesday sought 15 days to decide whether a revised pay scale should be introduced for the high court employees with the rider that the process would begin once the employees withdrew their strike.         
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta sent a note to Chief Justice J.N. Patel explaining the governments position on the matter and requesting the court administration to convince the employees to call off their strike so that the pay hike issue can be settled through discussion.         
	After receiving the note around 3.35pm, the chief justice directed the high court registrar-general, M.P. Srivastava, to call the leaders of the five employees unions and convey the finance ministers message to them.        
	Around 4pm, the registrar-general called us to his chamber and showed us a copy of the finance ministers note. The registrar-general told us that the chief justice had expressed hope that the employees would call off the cease-work and give the government a chance to review the proposed pay scale, said Debabrata Chakrabarti, the general secretary of the High Court Officers Association, one of the five unions.         
	The presidents of two of the five associations are not in Calcutta. They will return on Tuesday night. Till they arrive and we discuss the matter with the chief justice, we cannot do anything, he said.        
	The ceasework resulted in a total shut down of the high court for the seventh consecutive day on Tuesday.         
	According to an estimate, about 5,000 cases would have been heard in the five working days. Litigants, especially bail petitioners, are the worst sufferers. At least 800 bail petitions would have been disposed of in the five days. Many are languishing in jail because their petitions could not be heard, said a court official.        
	Out of the seven days, five were working days. The government has incurred a revenue loss of about Rs 80 lakh because of the strike, added the official.        
	High court sources said the chief justices appeal would provide the protesters an escape route with some of them demanding withdrawal of the strike. The employees wont get their salaries and festival allowance if the strike continues. So there is pressure to call off the strike for the time being, said a source.

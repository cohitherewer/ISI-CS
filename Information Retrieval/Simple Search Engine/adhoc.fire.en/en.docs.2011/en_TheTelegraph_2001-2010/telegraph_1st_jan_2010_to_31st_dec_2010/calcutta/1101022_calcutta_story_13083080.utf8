The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gone with the tide
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Gone with the tide
  - Sinking feeling for campaign to curb pollution           JAYANTA BASU                          Idols float in the river at a spot between Babughat and Judges Ghat, the stretch where the maximum violations have been reported. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Calcutta High Courts order to protect the Hooghly from immersion-related pollution seems to have been washed away along with the floating idols that drift farther away from shore during high tide.        
	We spotted over 150 such frames midstream between Babughat and Judges Ghat (also known as Gwalior Ghat) during just one boat trip. These structures were allowed to drift from various ghats and have been floating further away with the tide. The purpose of the immersion guidelines has been defeated, rued a member of the pollution control boards monitoring team.         
	Haldar Motiur Rahman, a crew member on the launch carrying the team, said a daytime recce would have revealed many more floating idols. This is nothing. There are so many bamboo structures floating around along with thick tufts of hay that navigation in this part of the river has become a problem, he added.         
	Green activist Subhash Dutta, who had supervised the clean-up operation by Port Trust workers, blamed police for the mess. A section of police personnel deployed at Judges Ghat cut the ropes that were supposed to keep the idols from floating away in a bid to create more space for immersion. We have since retrieved at least 40 frames, he said.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), countered Duttas claim about the efforts to minimise pollution of the Hooghly during immersion going waste because of the alleged callousness of a few cops. We have not received any complaint. It is completely baseless, he insisted.        
	Promod Gupta, who oversees religious and social activities at Judges Ghat, admitted that the process to use ropes to prevent idols from floating away was not followed properly.        
	Three-fourth of the immersed idols were allowed to drift away from Judges Ghat by cutting the ropes that were holding them back, said Gupta, who formed a 15-member team to retrieve bamboo frames from the waters.         
	At Bagbazar Ghat, ragpickers looking for recyclable material did help drag back many floating frames but it wasnt enough. They are more interested in the larger idols. The smaller ones are allowed to drift away, said an official.        
	Debasish Kumar, the mayoral council member responsible for immersion arrangements on this side of the river, claimed that the civic body focused on Babughat and Judges Ghat this year but failed to explain why idol frames were still floating in the waters.        
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the pollution control board and member convener of the high court-appointed river-monitoring committee, insisted that everyone tried their best to adhere to the courts directive. The guidelines could not be complied with in totality because of some practical difficulties. We will sit with Port Trust and civic body officials to solve these problems, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 3-in-1 trigger for mishap
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      3-in-1 trigger for mishap
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rule 1: No resoled tyres         
	Rule 2: No speeding (limit is 40kmph on most roads)        
	Rule 3: No parking for trucks on any thoroughfare during the day        
	All three basic rules of the road were broken when a private minibus racing a state bus down the Moulali crossing on Wednesday afternoon rammed into a divider at breakneck speed, leaving three passengers injured and several more badly shaken.        
	Police said the minibus plying on the Howrah station-Shibtala Math route with four resoled tyres would have overturned or ploughed into vehicles on the other flank of the thoroughfare had it not hit the divider and come to a halt.         
	The potentially fatal accident, which occurred around 1.50pm in front of the Ramlila ground in Moulali, was caused as much by an illegally parked truck as by speeding on retreaded tyres. Witnesses said the three injured passengers  out of the 15-odd on the bus  were lucky to escape with a few bruises.        
	I was playing football when I saw the minibus racing a state bus on the C-1 route just beyond the traffic signal, only to swerve and almost run into a parked truck. The next thing I knew, there was a bang as the minibus rammed into the divider, recounted Mohammed Nadim, in his 20s.        
	The driver fled even as the shocked passengers stepped out of the minibus (WB04B 0475), prompting a group of youths to vent their anger on the already damaged vehicle and the parked truck. The state bus sped away.        
	An officer at Entally police station said the drivers of the two buses were equally guilty of speeding, claiming that the cops would pursue the case. Residents of the area blamed the police for the accident, saying they were participants in the anarchy on the road.        
	An official of the transport department said the minibus wouldnt have hit the divider had its tyres been of good quality. I am told three of the four tyres and even the spare were resoled ones, he added.        
	So is the transport department monitoring whether buses are illegally using resoled tyres? You know what the situation is, was the officers one-line excuse.        
	Metro had previously reported how tyre resoling units were thriving in the city with police and transport department officials looking the other way.

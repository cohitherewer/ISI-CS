										      BOOK BAZAR                      Dhritiman Chaterji and Amit Chaudhuri at the event                     
	When asked why he had stopped writing and taken up music, Amit Chaudhuri smiled and said: For the last 15 years I have realised I dont want to be identified by one genre but rather bring in different things into a newly created space.         
	This newly created space came alive at the salon of Bengal Club on Friday evening, reverberating with the baritone of Dhritiman Chaterji as he read out excerpts from Chaudhuris The Immortals, interspersed with the authors rendition of evening ragas and Rabindrasangeet.       ANASUYA BASU

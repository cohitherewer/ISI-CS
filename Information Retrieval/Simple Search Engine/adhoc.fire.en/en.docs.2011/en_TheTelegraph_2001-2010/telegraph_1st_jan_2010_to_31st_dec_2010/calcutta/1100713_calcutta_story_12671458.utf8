The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic squad to catch strays again
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civic squad to catch strays again
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The civic dog squad will resume the practice of catching strays and hand them over to NGOs for sterilisation to control the canine population in the city.         
	The squad had stopped catching and killing dogs in 1998, when NGOs were given the responsibility of catching and sterilising strays.         
	A flurry of complaints regarding stray dogs has forced the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to alter the policy.         
	A census carried out by the animal husbandry department in 2006 had put the citys stray dog population at 36,000. The number has now doubled, said chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay.        
	The three NGOs working on the sterilisation project can operate on a maximum of 450 dogs a month. They get Rs 445 for each surgery from the Animal Welfare Board of India.         
	According to Chattopadhyay, at least 20 NGOs need to be engaged in sterilisation for the dog population to come down in the city.         
	We will call a meeting of the NGOs that have been sterilising dogs next week and convey the message that because of their failure, the dog squad will have to start catching street dogs again, said.         
	We welcome the civic bodys decision to catch stray dogs and hand them over to us for sterilisation. We will save energy and fuel, said Sushmita Roy of Love N Care for Animals, one of the three NGOs.        
	The civic body is also looking to check the population of stray pigs in the city.        
	The CMC has infrastructure to deal with the dog menace but there is no arrangement to tackle the pig problem. The biggest hurdle is that most of the pigs that roam the streets are owned by civic sweepers or their relatives. I will raise this matter in the mayoral council meeting, said mayoral council member (health) Atin Ghosh.

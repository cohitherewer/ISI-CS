The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Italy helping hand for Tollywood
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Italy helping hand for Tollywood

	Italy, the seat of celluloid masterpieces such as Roman Holiday, is making overtures to the city film fraternity.        
	Ritwik Ghataks Titas Ekti Nadir Naam has been digitally restored and enhanced by Immagine Ritrovata, the film restoration laboratory of Cineteca di Bologna, a leading institute in Italy.        
	It was screened in Cannes and also featured at the Il Cinema Ritrovato Festival in Bologna from June 26 to July 3.        
	Carrying the thread forward, the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry (IICCI) in Calcutta is stitching together a market Italy project, with help from the Italian consulate office, to woo Tollywood filmmakers to the land of Fellini, by showcasing its myriad scenic attractions.        
	Italy can offer a unique tapestry of landscapes, arts and culture  from the magic of Florence or romantic Roma, to contemporary couture from Milano and breathtaking scenery under the Tuscan sun, Pankaj Parekh, IICCIs eastern region chairman, told Metro.        
	The chamber is planning a seminar and workshop involving producers, directors and leading actors of Tollywood, showcasing the treasures of various regions of Italy.         
	This will be done in conjunction with ENIT  the Italian state tourist board  and representatives from Toscana, Genoa, Rome, Vicenza and Florence, besides the National Park of Five Lands.        
	This is a great idea, and can go a long way in introducing a more international perspective to cinema from Bengal generically, said filmmaker Goutam Ghose, also a member of the chamber who is planning to shoot a part of his next film in Italy.        
	At least 25 per cent of my next project Lala  Encounter in Bombay (based on a novella by Sergio Scapagnini), an Indo-Italian production with RAI Cinema, will be shot in Italy. The chambers plan to raise awareness about Italy as a shooting destination can enrich our films, he added.        
	Ghose is also excited about the restoration of Titas Ekti Nadir Naam. The restoration of the Ghatak classic was part of an international cooperation project by Immagine Ritrovata, which participates in important restoration projects commissioned by the World Cinema Foundation and The Film Foundation, institutions established and chaired by Martin Scorsese.        
	Many of our classics havent been preserved right and the prints are badly damaged. Lets face it, we still dont have the technical expertise or resources in Calcutta to preserve our films well, and the initiative by the Bologna lab augurs well for the industry, Ghose pointed out.        
	The international foundation created by Martin Scorsese for the restoration and preservation of what he has called neglected cinema, intends paying special attention to smaller productions.        
	We are keen to facilitate dialogue and handholding with Bengali cinema, and a structured exposure of our countrys scenic beauty and diversity to Tollywood could only be mutually beneficial for both Bengal and Italy, observed Silvio Pentrella, acting consul-general of Italy in Calcutta.

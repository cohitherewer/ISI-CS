The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Snag disrupts Metro service
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Snag disrupts Metro service
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Metro Railway services were disrupted yet again on Friday after a Garia-bound train got stranded for over 45 minutes at Kudghat (Netaji) station because of a snag.        
	The glitch was repaired at 2.05pm after which normality resumed.        
	The traction motor that draws current and keeps the train in motion developed a snag at 1.22pm, Metro Railway officials said.        
	Technicians on the train spotted the problem but failed to fix it and called for more support staff. After the motor was repaired, the train was taken back to Tollygunge for a detailed check-up, said a Metro Railway spokesperson.        
	While most of the passengers got off the Garia (Kavi Nazrul)-bound train, a few remained on board and took the ride back to Tollygunge, said an official.        
	A truncated service was run between Dum Dum and Tollygunge till the snag was repaired.        
	Fridays incident once again highlighted the sorry state of the rakes in use by Metro Railway. Sources said half of the coaches had outlived their span and needed to be replaced.        
	These old coaches have run for more than 25 years. But instead of being replaced, they were blended with new coaches to form an eight-coach rake, alleged Dilip Mukherjee, general secretary, Metro Railway Mens Union.         
	A senior Metro official, however, said: The old coaches are in running condition and we have the permission to use them.        
	 Ill on flight: Vinita Gupta, a flier in her 30s, became unconscious on a Jet Airways plane after it took off for Bangalore from Calcutta on Friday morning. The pilot made an emergency landing at the airport. The flight took off again at 8.15am without the passenger.        
	 Injured: A 35-year-old guard was injured when a bus in reverse gear hit him in Sector V on Friday evening.         
	Rahul Pal was admitted to Bidhannagar State General Hospital in a critical state. The driver fled.

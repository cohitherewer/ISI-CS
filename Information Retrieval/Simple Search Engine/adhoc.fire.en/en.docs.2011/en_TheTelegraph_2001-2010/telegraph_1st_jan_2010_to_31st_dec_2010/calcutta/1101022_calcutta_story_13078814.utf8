The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops to tweak Puja traffic plan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops to tweak Puja traffic plan
          KINSUK BASU                              Police plan to put up barricades closer to Puja day and impose restrictions on immersion processions in 2011				                                 
	Inaugurations from Panchami, restrictions on road barricades and a ban on DJs performing in immersion processions will ease traffic trouble before and after Puja 2011, feels the police commissioner after days of festive chaos on the city roads.         
	The Lalbazar bosses believe puja inaugurations on Tritiya and Chaturthi this year contributed greatly to traffic trouble with the combined load of pandal hoppers, shoppers and office-goers proving too much for the traffic police to handle.         
	For the past few years, Puja revelry had been starting well before Sashthi. We had been trying to modify our arrangements accordingly. But there should be a limit. From next year we will not allow pujas to be inaugurated on Tritiya, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti told Metro.         
	Panchami is the earliest the cops will allow pujas to be inaugurated, it was decided after a high-level post-mortem of the festive arrangements this year.         
	The final stocktaking happened on Thursday when all the divisional commissioners shared their Puja-duty experience with their bosses at Lalbazar.        
	The top cop also plans to deploy more policemen on the road in the run-up to Puja 2011. Next year from Panchami, we will make special arrangements to handle Puja shoppers, those returning home from office and pandal-hoppers simultaneously. We have already sought 500 additional personnel from the state government and finance minister Asim Dasgupta has accepted the proposal in principle, said Chakrabarti.        
	We will also appeal to the NCC directorate to deploy more cadets from next year to help us man traffic, the police commissioner added.         
	According to insiders, most of the additional personnel will be deployed in the morning and afternoon when the 16,000-plus cops who are out on the road on Puja nights rest.        
	But only more cops will not help. Senior officers said they would ensure that barricades to manage crowds are not put up early so that the entire width of roads is available for as long as possible.         
	Two barricades ate up nearly 14ft on both flanks of Central Avenue this year. We have to ensure that the barricades are not put up too early. The same applies for Gariahat, said an officer.        
	Performances by DJs atop trucks during immersion processions will be stopped.         
	DJ shows have to be banned since people stop in their tracks and watch them, causing long queues of vehicles. Immersion takes longer and there is noise pollution, added the officer.         
	The police are also considering the unusual step of requesting the government to do away with a holiday on the day after Dashami and instead declare Sashthi a holiday.        
	On Sashthi, it becomes difficult to force those returning home from office to abide by restrictions meant for the revellers. A barricade may come in the way of ones house and it creates tremendous problem. We want to do away with this, said the police chief.

	Thousands of students of GD Birla Centre for Education at Netaji Nagar were herded out on Monday morning following a bomb scare resulting from a hoax call.        
	A man identifying himself as Akash Chatterjee called the school around 10.25am and said a bomb had been planted in the building. The 2,800-odd students were asked to leave their bags in the classes and gather on the playground.        
	The students, many in tears, were later taken to an adjacent building under construction.        
	Police and the bomb detection squad declared the campus safe around 3.30pm.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trader bag snatched
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three youths on a motorcycle allegedly snatched a bag containing Rs 5.14 lakh from a city trader in central Calcutta on Tuesday.        
	Subhasish Bose, 32, was walking down Kartik Bose Lane, near Amherst Street, around 10.45am, when the youths intercepted him and snatched his bag holding a metal object against his back. Scared, Bose did not put up any resistance, said an officer of Amherst Street police station, where Bose had lodged a complaint.        
	The incident occurred when Bose, a resident of Deshapriya Park and owner of a company dealing in consumer goods, was returning to his office after receiving payment from a client.        
	We have picked up some local rowdies to ascertain the identity of the trio. We are also questioning Bose to find out if he had professional enmity with anyone, the officer said.        
	An officer of the anti-rowdy section of the detective department who visited the spot said: No witnesses have been found yet. The youths might be part of a snatching gang in the city.

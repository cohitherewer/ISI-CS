                      Spiritual journey of mankind                    Mans journey from the darkness of ignorance, hopelessness and desperation of life, to the light of knowledge and understanding is difficult, full of turmoil, doubt and treachery. It is only the fragile support offered by faith and hope that helps him on his way. But even faith seems inadequate to counter the rigours of the journey. Nevertheless, faith carries man through to enlightenment and the newness of life represented by the child, full of innocence, simplicity and potential. The Child is Rabindranath Tagores only poem originally written in English. Tanusree Shankars interpretation depicts the flowing, rhythmic, spiritual journey of mankind through the ages, from the bondage of ignorance, ultimately to the freedom of enlightenment and self-realisation. At the same time, it may also be considered a celebration of the mother  the feminine principle in the universe. Recitation: Victor Banerjee. Concept and choreography: Tanusree Shankar. Music compose and orchestrated by Debajyoti Mishra.                   Event: Choreographic presentation of Tagores The Child by Ananda Shankar Centre for Performing Arts When: Today and tomorrow; 7 pm Where: Rabindra Sadan

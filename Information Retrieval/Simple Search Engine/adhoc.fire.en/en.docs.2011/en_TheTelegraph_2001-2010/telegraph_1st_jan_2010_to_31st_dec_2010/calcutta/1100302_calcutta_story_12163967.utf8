                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court poser on award denial
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday directed the Centre and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to explain by April 17 why scientist Srimanta Kumar Rout was not conferred the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award despite his name being announced as one of the winners in 1992.        
	Justice Dipankar Dutta passed the order on a petition by Rout, a reader at Calcutta Universitys zoology department.        
	My client learnt from All India Radio and Doordarshan news on October 19, 1992, that he had won the award along with other scientists, said Routs counsel Supradip Roy.        
	On December 16, 1992, my client came to know that the award was conferred on the others, but not on him. Since then, he has made several representations to the central government wings concerned but did not receive any response, added the lawyer. According to Rout, he was denied the honour illegally.         
	Rout, who was nominated for the award by Calcutta University, had joined the institution as a lecturer in 1982.

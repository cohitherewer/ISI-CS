                              Students of DPS Ruby Park perform at their annual function on May 3 at Science City. Around 700 students presented The Ramayana as a dance drama, preceded by a skit portraying the evils of the society. Commissioner of Calcutta police Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti was present as chief guest. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                            
	The Burning City        
	The sun came to my room,         
	As if I was in a stupor,         
	Scorching my soul, Melting my bone,         
	Charring the old porcelain.         
	With flames that burn a thousand hopes,         
	Fire that snatches life away,         
	I slithered away         
	Like a wounded snake.         
	But there was no time to flee,         
	No leisure to pray.         
	Theyll dramatise their alibi,         
	Order a joke to investigate.         
	What if the writers feel the sun?         
	Would they designate the term unfortunate?

	Soul Searching        
	Days are short        
	Nights are longer;        
	Is that why        
	Our deeds become blunders?        
	The night always assures secrecy        
	And secrecy is demanded by each foulery.        
	So let me ponder upon this:        
	That only daylight is my friend,        
	And let the dusk and dark be my offenders.

	Sky by night   
	Apeejay School organised a night sky observation camp at the school premises in February. The school coordinator Ranu Datta accompanied the students in observing night sky.        
	 Students saw the moon and learnt to identify different constellations through powerful telescopes. They learnt to spot the Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Mars, Jupiter and other heavenly bodies. The high point was spotting the rings of Saturn.        
	 I never expected that star-gazing could be so exciting. I hope we have more such camps, said Bhanu Garg of Class VII.              
	Douse that flame        
	The Interact Club of MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth organised Fire Service Day on April 16 along with the Association of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services, west zone. Pulak Sharma, the station officer of Howrah fire station, conducted a seminar on fire fighting, followed by an interactive session. Trained firemen also put up a fire drill for the students.

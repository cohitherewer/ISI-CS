The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kidnap fear tells on tech hub transport
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Kidnap fear tells on tech hub transport
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                          A security camera in   Sector V. Picture by Amit Datta      
	Employees of companies operating out of Bengals tech hub have struck taxis and shuttle cars off their list of conveyance options after dark.         
	Systems engineer Sudipta Chakraborty of IBM, who usually hires a taxi or hops into a shuttle car in front of her Sector V office to reach home in Salt Lakes BD block, has started waiting for the office pool car since hearing about a cabbies hand in Capgemini manager Sandipan Dass abduction.        
	I was scared after hearing the news (of Sandipans abduction) on TV. My parents have strictly forbidden me from even boarding shuttle autos. Staying back in office till 9pm to catch the pool car is a pain but at least its a lot safer than travelling alone, Sudipta, who steps out of office at 8pm on most days, told Metro.         
	What makes the Sector V-New Town belt even more dangerous is the lack of policing and inadequate lighting along certain stretches of Salt Lake and the Rajarhat Expressway.        
	Bhaskar Das, an ICICI sales manager who was recently robbed of his wallet and watch in a taxi at Sector V, said the incidence of snatching and intimidation by taxis and shuttle car and auto drivers had increased since last year. With the police ignoring complaints, criminals are having a field day here. I am contemplating buying a motorbike because its not safe to travel by taxi at night anymore, he added.        
	Those living close by are also afraid to walk back home alone lest snatchers or kidnappers accost them.        
	My home is barely a 15-minute walk from my office in DLF building on the Rajarhat Expressway. Some colleagues escort me home these days, said Rohini Mukhopadhyay, an employee of an infotech company.        
	The Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which administers the tech hub, convened an emergency meeting with the police and representatives of IT companies on Wednesday to discuss ways to beef up the security in the area.        
	The primary problem is lack of policing. That apart, this area could do with more street lights. We also demand a pre-paid taxi booth for employees of the IT sector. The authorities will then have the registration numbers of the taxis our employees are boarding, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris (India) and secretary of the Sector V Stakeholders Association.        
	The police superintendent (North 24-Parganas), Rahul Srivastava, promised better surveillance in Sector V and New Town once infrastructure was upgraded.        
	We intend installing 82 CCTV cameras (there are six at present at Sector V) in Salt Lake, Sector V and New Town as part of the security beef-up. Patrolling will be intensified, too. The Sector V outpost will become a police station on March 7 and a new police station will come up at New Town, he said.        
	An infotech executive who lives in Kasba, not far from Sandipans house, said she had heard such promises several times before. We want real solutions, not empty promises. I have asked my husband to pick me up on his way back home from his Baguiati office. I dare not go home alone now, she added.        
	For employees of the sunshine sector, nights have never been more dark and dreary.  
	Safety first  
	82 security cameras to be installed in Salt Lake, Sector V and New Town  
	Three Sector V taxi booths to be under camera surveillance  
	Sector V police outpost to become a police station. New Town to get another police station  
	56 additional policemen for Sector V police station  
	More intensive night patrol  
	Check on illegal parking

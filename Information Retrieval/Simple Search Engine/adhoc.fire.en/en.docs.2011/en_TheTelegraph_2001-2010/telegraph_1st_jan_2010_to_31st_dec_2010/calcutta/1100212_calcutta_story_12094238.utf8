The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Games got brighter amp; bigger   Colour purple it is for KKR
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Games got brighter amp; bigger     Colour purple it is for KKR
  - CHEERLEADER FOR SRK          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Dont be surprised if you see Neha Dhupia joining the Kolkata Knight Riders support camp this season. Six years after the Bollywood heroine got noticed by declaring only sex and Shah Rukh Khan sell in Bollywood, she was back on SRK turf. Neha starred in a fashion show on Thursday night to mark the city launch of an energy drink that will be a principal sponsor of his team this season. I have no favourites but since KKR needs all the support right now, smiled Neha, soon after Shah Rukh had via an audio-visual clip flaunted the XXX label on the back of his KKR jersey (which will soon go from black to purple).

	wow just got the new reebok official knightriders jerseys. purple amp; gold. thanx reebok. got bit sentimental looking at them. cant wait to wear        
	Thats Shah Rukh Khan on Twitter, going gush-gush about the new Kolkata Knight Riders jersey, amid all the love and hate tweets about My Name Is Khan.        
	After the KKR disaster in the first two seasons, SRK has done away with black from his team jersey. The gold, symbolising victory, is still there, but the black representing Ma Kali, has been replaced with purple.        
	Im not superstitious, says the boss. I thought the black and gold was the only thing working for us, but since everyone agreed on change, we went ahead. If this new colour works for the team, all my films will also be of that colour!        
	Like boss like captain. A lot of people have suggested that we change the colour black, Sourav told Metro. Last year the Deccan Chargers changed their colours and they did well.        
	Everybody from Juhi Chawla to astrologer Sanjay Jumaani to Souravs family friend Nilaanjana Chakraborty agreed on the colour (parachute) purple.        
	I like it because its a lot like the Middlesex T20 team colour, adds Sourav. We couldnt get that exact colour and so weve gone for something a little darker.        
	According to numerology, purple corresponds with Number 7 and the destiny number of both Sourav and Shah Rukh is 7. Also purple is a colour which tones you down and this calming effect will help both the captain and the owner, adds Nilaanjana, a numerologist and colour therapist.        
	Once Shah Rukh okayed purple, it was over to designer friend Manish Malhotra to design the new purple-and-gold jerseys. A couple of variations are lying in Mannat for King Khan to pick the final design once the MNIK storm eases.                    SOURAV rsquo;S CHOICE: The Middlesex T20 colours    
	According to a Reebok spokesperson, the KKR jersey is one of the best-selling items among all IPL team merchandise. The Khan 12 tee was a huge hit in Season One and even last year, when the team sank to the bottom, it was cool to be seen in a KKR jersey.         
	With the colours changing, the fans will have to buy brand new KKR jerseys and brand pundits put it down to a smart move for a fresh boost to the merchandising.        
	Other teams have also changed colours before and a few will change colours this time its about trying something different, is the word from the KKR office.

	The bags of at least three international fliers had been rummaged and items stolen from one of them at Calcutta airport in the past couple of months.        
	All three had to wait much longer than usual at the conveyor belt to collect their bags that had been tampered with it before they arrived.        
	Two of the fliers were allegedly not allowed to lodge a complaint, while the third filed one with the airline concerned but is yet to get a reply.        
	A digital Handycam, chocolates, clothes and some other items went missing from a bag of Jatinder Kaur Saini, who arrived from Sydney via Bangkok on a Thai Airways flight on December 13.        
	The camera was a gift for my brother. I was carrying it and some other items in a bag which the airline had allowed me to carry as hand baggage till Bangkok, said Saini, who teaches at a school in Sydney.        
	At Bangkok, the airline told her during security check that the bag was oversized and had to be registered as checked-in luggage.        
	At Calcutta airport, the bag I had checked in at Sydney came out quickly on the conveyor belt. But the second one arrived after 15 minutes, she said. The lock of the second bag was intact but when she opened it on returning home, the camcorder and the other articles were missing.        
	Airport sources said there had been several complaints of luggage locks being tampered with and items taken out.        
	Saini lodged a complaint with Thai Airways. When Metro called the airline on Thursday, an official said: Call our office on Monday.        
	Bariatric surgeon Sarfraz Baig, who arrived in the city from Kuala Lumpur on an Air Asia flight on October 20, found one of his bags slit open but no item was stolen.        
	I waited for 30 minutes for my luggage to arrive. One of the bags was slit open while the locks on the other two had been tampered with, recalled Baig.        
	When the surgeon approached an airport official, he allegedly refused to register a complaint. He told me I should have called an official at the conveyor belt and shown him the bag, said Baig.        
	City businessman Rajesh Chainani, who was on the same flight as Baig, had a similar experience. One of his bags had been slashed and the lock tampered with but no item was removed.         
	The airport authorities refused to accept a complaint. They also didnt tell us where to go to lodge a complaint, said Chainani.        
	An airport official said aggrieved passengers should approach airlines since baggage handlers are appointed by them.

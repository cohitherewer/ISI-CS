          Malaria and dengue never leave town. Unknown viruses rage through it. Calcutta may be heading towards a fever epidemic, says Jayanta Basu                                            
	Once the sahibs and memsahibs of Calcutta used to hold a party around mid-February every year to celebrate their survival for another year in a city where fever would wipe out thousands, as the numerous tombstones in Park Street symmetry bear witness. Fever, apparently, also had a role in the birth of the city as Job Charnock is said to have hopped on to the Calcutta side of the Ganges on being afflicted with malarial fever, when he was heading for Bator in Howrah, which was more developed.         
	Though parties may be more numerous today, the city has not changed much pathologically over the centuries. More than five million in the city and on its fringes are preyed upon by a range of fevers today; while malaria or dengue have turned into election issues, many of the fevers are attributed to unknown causes. Another unknown fever is now raging on the northern fringe of the city, in the Bagda, Gaighata and Baduria areas. The symptoms, almost like those of dengue, have followed a pattern: very high temperature, body ache, weakness, rashes. There have been rumours on how the fever is permanently damaging organs, if it is not killing its victims.         
	Some doctors feel that the fever is being caused by a weaker variant of the dengue virus. Other viral fevers are taking their toll. Some of these, with common cold and cough are said to be triggered by a combination of viral and bacterial infection. Typhoid fevers with gastrointestinal tract infections are common. Chikunguniya has invaded the Salt Lake area for the first time.         
	Though fevers can be treated if detected early, viral fevers and influenzas may get complicated with secondary infection. Dengue fever may become life-threatening if it is haemorrhagic (accompanied by rashes on body, bleeding from nose, gums etc).         
	According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), close to 6,70,000 people suffered from fevers due to malaria and dengue in the city in the last decade (1999-2009).         
	Private estimates say the number of fever patients in the city is several lakhs more than the CMC number.         
	First, a large number of vector-borne diseases are not reported to the CMC. Second, in recent years the incidence of viral fever has spiralled. Many of the patients are treated by private doctors and the cases are not reported to the civic body, says a state health official. If all the fevers are taken into account, the number can go up to 20 lakh, which effectively means almost one in every three people in Calcutta suffers from fever, he adds.         
	The unknown fever seems to be spreading most, at least among the citys poor.         
	About a decade back, a joint study by the CMC and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) along with an NGO claimed that fevers completely overshadowed other ailments among the slum population in Calcutta and most of them were of unknown origin.         
	Calcuttas air seems to be thick with tiny, unstoppable mutating monsters.         
	Malaria and dengue are still common, but viral fevers, especially during changing seasons, have become dominant and sometimes they are reaching epidemic proportions. In the absence of proper identification of the viral strains, we have no option other than symptomatic treatment, says R.N. Chakrabarty, who has practised as a general physician for decades in north Calcutta.        
	Children and the elderly are the worst sufferers, says Arpan Choudhury, a general physician. Children are found to be affected mostly by the respiratory viruses triggering fevers and often such viral attacks act as triggers for asthma.         
	No wonder Calcutta has the distinction of a fever named after it. No wonder that Ronald Ross discovered the malarial parasite in the city.         
	But what makes the city so vulnerable to fever? The city provides the best possible environment for fever to thrive. A very high population density, unplanned urbanisation, climate change leading to warming, allowing both the vectors and the causal organisms to thrive better and longer, largescale migration from all over the world, footpath dwellers, who are often carriers of germs what more is required? asks entomologist Debasish Biswas, a vector control officer with the CMC. But dont all big Indian cities have similar constraints? They do, but they also have a far better counter mechanism.         
	The most important thing in case of an emergency is to have a proper control and command structure with roles clearly defined. This is completely lacking in the city, especially in case of health emergencies.         
	When something like avian flu or H1N1 strikes, Calcutta can only show a knee-jerk response. The facilities are ad hoc. In case of suspected H1N1 cases, blood samples had to be sent to Pune. The laboratories, apart from a few like the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) in Beleghata, lack modern facilities. The quality of technicians in general is poor. There is no dependable database.         
	It is difficult to believe that Calcutta came up with a Fever Hospital Committee  and worked on the suggestions of its report  as far back as the 1840s.         
	Experts also blame global warming for the spread of viruses. The attacks of viruses on Calcuttas population are on the rise. I feel the change in the climate in the last few years, the warming up is making it conducive for the viruses to thrive as well as turn active from dormant conditions. The risk is definitely looming larger, said Shekhar Chakrabarty, deputy director, NICED.         
	Paediatrician Subhomoy Mukherjee feels that limited medical knowledge often leads to abuse of antibiotics, thus making the viruses resistant to later medicine. Over-the-counter treatment does not help.         
	Some epidemiologists feel that the city may be heading towards an epidemic. But experts feel Calcutta is hardly ready to fight back if there is an epidemic. There is limited disease surveillance  both the CMC and state government have just an elementary monitoring structure in place. The absence of mechanisms to detect the ever-changing viruses quickly, insufficient awareness of its citizens and, above all, an overstressed and inadequate health delivery infrastructure make the condition worse.         
	It is very important to begin treatment at the earliest. All fevers can be treated successfully if detected early, says Tapan Mukherjee, officer on special duty at CMC.         
	Viruses causing fevers in the city often remain unidentified and hence an epidemic triggered by any one of them cannot be ruled out, says Chakrabarty of NICED. Its not that we completely lack infrastructure. Some of the institutes do have electron microscopy and other equipment required to identify viruses but we need a much more concerted efforts between these institutes.

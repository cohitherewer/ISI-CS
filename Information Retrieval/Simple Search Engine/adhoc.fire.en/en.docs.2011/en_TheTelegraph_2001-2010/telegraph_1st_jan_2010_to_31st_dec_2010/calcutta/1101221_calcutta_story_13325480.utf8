The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | East-West on track for 2013 debut
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      East-West on track for 2013 debut

	The East-West Metro is on track for the scheduled October 2013 launch, the Calcutta Metro Rail Corporation (CMRC) announced on Monday though it has not yet got land from the railways to build two stations.         
	We hope to start the East-West Metro commercial run from Sector V to Sealdah by the end of October 2013, said Sumantra Chowdhury, the managing director of the CMRC, in which the state government has a 30 per cent stake.         
	Services on the entire stretch, from Sector V to Howrah Maidan, will start by October 2014, added Chowdhury.         
	The CMRC has accused the railways of not handing over the land required to build stations at Howrah and Sealdah. We would need around 16,000sq m at each of these stations. After the East-West stations are built, half of the land will be returned, said Chowdhury.        
	He insisted that unavailability of land had not delayed the project.        
	The railway minister had written to the Prime Minister that her ministry wants to undertake the project. The central government then sent us a letter to inform us about the proposal. The state government responded that it was ready to hand over its stake to the railway ministry, said Chowdhury, who is also the state transport secretary.         
	The transfer of the state governments stake would need the nod of Japan International Cooperation Agency, which is providing a Rs 2,253-crore loan for the Rs 4,874.58-crore project.        
	According to Chowdhury, nearly 60 per cent of the viaduct between Sector V and Subhas Sarobar and 40 per cent of the six elevated stations have been completed. Twelve per cent of the entire work has been done and the project is on schedule.         
	Out of the 12 stations, six will be underground. Passengers will be able to get off at Central station and access the existing north-south Metro network.        
	Fares for the East-West Metro, which will not be run on subsidy, are likely to be between Rs 8 and Rs 20.        
	We had to submit an undertaking to the planning commission that the fares would be revised every two years. We are also developing properties of 244,000sq ft, from which we can earn rent once the services start, said Chowdhury.

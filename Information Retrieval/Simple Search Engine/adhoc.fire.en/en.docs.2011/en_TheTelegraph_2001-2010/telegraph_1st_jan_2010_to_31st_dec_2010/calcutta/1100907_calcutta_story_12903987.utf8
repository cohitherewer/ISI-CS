          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A city court on Monday rejected the bail petition of Sanjay Bagaria, a key accused in the Stephen Court blaze case, and sent him to jail custody till September 17.         
	Bagaria, the director of Stephen Court Ltd, had been in police custody since he was brought to the city two days after his arrest in Uttar Pradesh on August 24.         
	Bagarias advocate Amit Bhattacharya said: My client is ready to assist the police if the court grants him bail. He will not leave the country.         
	But public prosecutor Ashok Bakshi opposed the bail plea saying there was no guarantee that Bagaria would not abscond again.         
	The judge refused to grant bail to Bagaria. He also extended the jail custody of Jay Prakash Singh, the liftman of Stephen Court, till September 17.

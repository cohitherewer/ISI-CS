The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Auto driver in loot amp; scoot
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Auto driver in loot amp; scoot
                            
	Auto-cracy hit a Calcutta street again on Friday afternoon with a rogue driver snatching a passengers bag and speeding away after he had refused to pay almost double the fare.        
	Tathagata Ray Chowdhury, a journalist with The Telegraph, had boarded N. Pals auto at the Haldiram bus stop and got off at Ultadanga when the driver demanded that he pay Rs 20 for the trip instead of the usual Rs 12.         
	Tathagata refused, only to be abused and have his bag snatched. Police, who were at the receiving end of an auto assault barely 48 hours earlier, were reluctant to act until they learnt that the victim was a journalist.        
	Tathagata, who finally decided against lodging a formal complaint because his worried mother asked him not to, narrates how a regular commute to office turned into a nightmare.              
	I live in New Town and commuting from there is sometimes a problem because of fewer transport options. On Friday, I found an auto to take me from City Centre 2 to the Haldiram stop on VIP Road almost immediately after I had stepped out of home. Little did I know what awaited me.        
	Around 2.05pm, an empty auto coming from the Kaikhali side stopped where I was standing and I hopped in. The driver, a young man in his thirties, didnt mention the fare and I didnt bother asking because I knew that I would need to pay Rs 12 till Ultadanga. Some drivers do ask for more on certain days, but never more than Rs 15. In any case, they usually mention the inflated fare on this route before the passenger boards the auto.        
	The auto ride to Ultadanga on Friday was like any other I have had on that route  the driver would stop every 100 metres or so for passengers and take his own sweet time to resume the journey. By the time we reached Ultadanga, it was around 2.30pm and there was just me and a middle-aged co-passenger.        
	As I took out Rs 12 from my wallet to pay the driver, he looked at the money and said the fare was Rs 20. I protested. He argued that I had boarded the auto in Kaikhali and the fare from there was Rs 5 extra. I asked him why he was lying. He accused me of trying to avoid paying the legitimate fare.        
	I saw no point in continuing the argument; so I kept Rs 12 on his seat and got into a Sovabazar-bound auto. The auto had barely travelled a few metres when another three-wheeler sped past and swerved to block our way. It was him.        
	The driver advanced menacingly towards me and ordered me to get off the auto. His counterpart on the Ultadanga-Sovabazar auto advised me to do as I was told.         
	As I stepped out of the vehicle, the rogue driver snatched my bag and sped away. I stood there angry and helpless, but nobody around me seemed to notice. I was barely able to note down the autos registration number: WB25C 3044.        
	I traced my steps back towards a traffic kiosk adjoining a large electronics showroom, where a lone policeman was on duty. I cant leave the kiosk unmanned, he said, trying to fob me off.        
	I went to Ultadanga police station next, where the first cop I met asked me Why? rather than What? when I said I wanted to lodge a diary. But sub-inspector Bhupen Roy, to whom I was referred, sprung into action the moment I flashed my identity card.        
	Within minutes, I was headed back to the auto stand in a police vehicle with Roy and a constable designated to trace the rogue driver. After the constable got off, Roy asked me to go to Maniktala police station as the auto stand was under its jurisdiction. Dont worry, we will get your bag, he reassured me.        
	By the time I reached Maniktala, word had reached assistant sub-inspector S. Debnath about my plight. The driver and your bag are on the way, he informed me.        
	I asked for a piece of paper and started drafting a complaint. I had barely finished writing when the driver and four other men  all Citu members  entered the police station.        
	Bhool hoye gechhe, babu (it was a mistake, Sir), pleaded the driver. Debnath berated him for his unnecessary act before turning to me to say: Ekhon jhogra mitiye nin (now bury your differences).         
	But what about penalising him? If you use words like snatched in your complaint, I will have to arrest him, replied the officer.        
	I was about to ask him what was stopping him when my phone rang. It was my anxious mother. I soon left the police station with my bag.

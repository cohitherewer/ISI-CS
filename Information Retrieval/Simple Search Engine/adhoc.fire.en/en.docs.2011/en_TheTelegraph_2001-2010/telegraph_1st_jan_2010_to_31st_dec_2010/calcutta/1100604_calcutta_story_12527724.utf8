The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Burrabazar bucks the go-green trend
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Burrabazar bucks the go-green trend
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                            
	The light at Burrabazar refuses to turn green; it stays red or amber.        
	The citys trade hub voted the CPM and BJP last Sunday, but not Trinamul, providing a curious pocket of resistance against the Mamata wave.        
	We are shocked. According to estimates we should have won five of the six wards in the area because of the strong anti-Left and pro-Mamata sentiments. The failure to win a single ward is bad, said a beaten Trinamul candidate in Burrabazar, the day after.        
	So why didnt the Mamata magic work in the six wards with approximately 1.30 lakh voters that make up Burrabazar? What explains the BJP retaining two and gaining one, the CPM retaining two and the Congress retaining one?        
	A preliminary post-mortem threw up two prime factors: selection of outsiders as candidates and pitting weak candidates against strong opponents.        
	The bungle in team selection was blatant enough for a senior Trinamul leader to admit on Thursday: Next time we will have to be very careful about the selection of the right candidate.        
	In none of the six wards did Trinamul field local residents as candidates. All were brought from the neighbouring wards and thrust upon the people, said a disgruntled central Calcutta Trinamul leader. Burrabazar has localised problems like illegal construction and illegal parking. How can an outsider be trusted with solving them?        
	Take ward 23, which the BJP wrested from the CPM. The Trinamul candidate Swapan Burman used to be a resident of this ward, but for several years now he has been living in Kalindi, near Lake Town. BJPs Vijay Ojha won by 113 votes. A local Marwari businessman would have won us this seat, rued a party worker.        
	Then there was the curious case of Shantilal Jain, a BJP veteran for four decades who was brought into the Trinamul core team on May 6 in a last-ditch bid to swing ward votes. But that was not to be.        
	There must be some very strong reasons why this area has gone against the popular mood, admitted Jain, 65.        
	Trinamul fielding featherweights against heavyweights was another factor. The BJP has controlled ward 22 for 15 years and ward 42 for 10 years, both Meena Devi Purohit and Sunita Jhawar are formidable candidates. And who did Trinamul have against them? Political novices like Sunita Singh and Rajesh Sharma, shrugged a Burrabazar voter.        
	A section of Burrabazar voters even cited the Rizwanur Rahman case of 2007 and Mamatas purported anti-Marwari stand.        
	Some Trinamul leaders, though, managed to find a silver lining: We had no sitting councillor in Burrabazar, so we won none and lost none. But the CPM lost one to the BJP.

                       Fatal fetish: Talking over the cellphone or listening to music using earplugs while driving, walking on the road or crossing railway tracks is dangerous. But this has become a common sight and the consequences are tragic. In most cases, people get so engrossed while talking on their cellphones that even loud honking goes unheard. The government should start an awareness campaign on the hazards of talking on the cellphone and listening to music while one is outdoors.    Atif Ayaz,  Serampore, Hooghly		    
	The fire at Presidency University laboratories has once again exposed the vulnerability of several buildings in the city (Dawn flames lick Presidency labs, October 30). Despite incidents of fire occurring at regular intervals, no concrete steps are taken for their prevention. If a fire breaks out in a private building or factory, the owner is booked. But in other cases, no one is taken to task.           
	On October 30, two incidents of fire were reported in Metro. In case of the fire at a private factory in Liluah, the report said the owner would be booked for absence of a fire-safety licence and fire-safety measures. But in case of the fire at Presidency University, no one would be booked.           
	I suggest that to safeguard valuable documents from fire in libraries and laboratories, they should be kept in fireproof storage spaces.

	The less we talk about the exemplary mismanagement at Calcutta airport, the better (Taxi-ing time at terminal, November 17). Each and every official at the city airport tries to shirk responsibility.             
	Recently I had a difficult time trying to locate the yellow cab that had been assigned to me from the pre-paid taxi counter. After half an hour, I found the taxi near a tea stall. I should have hired a rickshaw, gone to Gate No. 1 and hailed a running taxi.           
	The airport authorities do not seem interested in mitigating passenger suffering. They are busy in a game called pass-the-buck.

	The terrible condition of Calcutta airport and its surroundings is being highlighted by Metro for the past few weeks.           
	In this regard, I would like to mention that much of the mess is because of the hopeless monitoring, zero co-ordination and weak control of the Union aviation ministry (New Delhi).           
	We blame the railway minister when we find a cockroach in a coach, but we do not mention the name of the civil aviation minister or his ministry when one major airport in the country is being run most inefficiently.

	Address not given                     
	Privatisation of taxi services at the airport is not the solution as the services are already privatised (Do you want the government/private players to run airport taxis? November 17). The solution is proper functioning of the existing system. What does our cultured, film-loving chief minister have to say?           
	Devdutta Sen,           
	Address not given                     
	Kudos to Metro for exposing the mess called Calcutta airport. The policemen posted at the airport are corrupt. One can always find them in the august company of touts. This state is run by hoodlums. Can we name one service where one does not find these touts  be it the airport, railway stations, hospitals, motor vehicles departments?

	Private players should be involved in airport management in Calcutta. Passengers will be happy if they are greeted with a smile and co-operation. Passengers will never mind paying extra for such services.           
	Rakesh Bhatia,           
	Loudon Park                     
	Taxi services should be handled by private players at Calcutta airport as they are efficient, customer-friendly and their attitude is service-oriented. The government should take adequate steps and formulate policies to bring in more professionalism and transparency in the management of the airport.

	In response to the question What memories do you have of being taught by P Lal?, November 6, I would like to share my memories of this wonderful teacher.             
	I joined St Xaviers College as a student of English literature in 2005. Ours was one of the last batches that he taught. The first memory I have of him is still fresh with me.           
	Professor Lal came into the class with the attendance register and threw it on the table saying: I dont teach roll numbers.           
	This single statement made me realise that unlike other teachers, he wanted to actually know the people he would be teaching. Sir then proceeded to memorising our names at the rate of 10 per class!           
	Today I am a teacher and I try to incorporate Sirs teachings in my class.           
	Vivek Mukherjee,           
	Address not given                     
	Professor Lal taught me English at St Xaviers College in the late Sixties. After suffering through comatose classes with other teachers for days, we would eagerly await the one class with him every week. Professor Lal would sweep regally into the class in his khadi kurta and kolhapuri chappals and transport us into a magical world with his elocutionary renditions of a poem or a piece of prose.           
	We sat mesmerised. At that instant, all of us wanted to become writers. I was there when he recited The Lady of Shallot, and 40 years later, I still get goosebumps as I recall his sonorous voice: The mirror cracked from side to side, A curse is upon me...cried...the lady of Shallot!           
	He could bring alive the eccentric figure of Charles Lamb as he wove a magic web around the Essays of Elia and brought into sharp focus the irrational prejudices of Imperfect Sympathies or the profound sadness of Oxford in the Vacation.           
	Lamb would often combine two words into one and coin an entirely new word (visnomy was a combination of visage and physiognomy). Professor Lal challenged us to coin words of our own and submit them to him. The winner would get a prize, he promised. I won the contest, having minted a number of these compound words that I no longer remember. But Ill never forget how he came into class one day, handed me a hardcover book by an obscure Australian writer, and said: Congratulations, you won!

	In 1971, we had the privilege of listening to Professor P Lal at Calcutta University, delivering in his inimitable style and diction, lectures on TS Eliots Waste Land. His recitation in a deep baritone  April is the cruellest month/Breeding lilacs out of the dead land  still reverberates in memory. One could walk a thousand miles just to listen to his lectures.           
	Prabhas and Dipti Ray,           
	Address not given                     
	My memories of Prof Lal are still vivid. I had the privilege of his tutelage in 1957. The class was intermediate arts at St Xaviers College. Here was a dashing young professor who made the classes vibrant. He had already set his vision on The Mahabharata then. I recall his explanation of schizophrenia with a pointed reference to Robert Louis Stevensons Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.           
	To us, this facet was intriguing. He went on to tell us how the author awoke one night and wrote out the story in one sitting. He then presented it to his wife for a reading. She was so horrified that she tore up the manuscript, which he rewrote. Professor Lals explanation of a dual personality taking over with an evil side was fascinating when I watched Spencer Tracy play the role and portray good and evil within the same body.

	Brand Bengal is essentially a culture of politics (Buddha hires a brand guru, September 10). Political parties are always on the lookout for issues to protest through strikes, processions and rallies that disrupt production, services and normal public life.             
	It seems the masses get easily swayed by the cholchhe na, cholbe na breed of politics. This negativity has plagued Bengal for long and has caused the maximum damage to Bengal as a brand.           
	Whether this culture has been ingrained by the political parties among the masses or the culture of the masses is reflected among the successful politicians is a matter of conjecture. Only an about-turn to a whole-hearted positive outlook can bring about a change for the better in this state.           
	Suman Sankar Dasgupta,           
	Parnasree Palli                     
	The real problem in the development of any society always comes from within. The biggest hurdle is the psychological mindset of the masses. In Bengal, work comes last. Sincerity to our job, particularly if one is in the government sector, is not in our dictionary. Lackadaisical attitude towards work is the biggest stumbling block for brand Bengal.

	Apropos Ransom tossed out of train window, November 25, the incident fits very well with Bollywood plots. The episode does not appear convincing. The detective department should conduct a thorough probe into the incident.

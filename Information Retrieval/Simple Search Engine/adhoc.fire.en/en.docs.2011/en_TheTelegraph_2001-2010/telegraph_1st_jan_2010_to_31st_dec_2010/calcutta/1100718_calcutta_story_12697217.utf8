	If you are dying for a break in the midst of the greenery of rural Bengal, Dhanyakheri is one of the best options.        
	Located at the confluence of the Rupnarayan, Mundeswari and the Damodar rivers, only 7km from Bakshi near Bagnan, this quintessential Bengal village offers you the luxury of a lush green countryside.        
	The stretches of monsoon paddyfields along the Bagnan-Mankur route are soothing to the eyes of those used to seeing endless concrete.         
	There is no crowd and no fear of residents trying to keep an eye on outsiders. Friendly villagers make the trip to Dhanyakheri memorable.         
	At the ferry ghat at the confluence of the rivers, country boats leave for Bakshi, Dudhkumrar ghat, Panseulir ghat, Gupigang, Garer ghat and other places. A cruise on a boat on a moonlit night is a wonderful experience.        
	A small island in the midst of the rippling waters was once inhabited by villagers. Thanks to erosion it has now turned into a kaashphool field.                  
	You can watch fishermen scouring the deep waters for their daily catch. And if you are lucky, your boatman might even sing a bhatiyali song for you. The gentle river breeze, the boatmans song with a setting sun in the background can take you to a different world.        
	You can spend time at an ashram run by the Belur Ramakrishna Mission. The ashram is engaged in charitable activities, especially with flood victims.        
	It has three spacious rooms that can accommodate up to 10 visitors at a time. The bhog served at the ashram can be a welcome gastronomic departure for those used to fast food.        
	The river borders the ashram on the west. The quiet is only broken by the sound of tiny waves lapping on the mud banks.         
	A caretaker-cum-priest performs the daily worship in the ashram besides maintaining a beautiful flower garden here.              
	Going        
	Take a train to Bagnan. From Bagnan railway station you can take a Trekker/auto heading for Mankur. Get down at the Dhanyakheri ferry ghat. You can also reach Dhanyakheri via Bakshi              
	Staying        
	The Ramakrishna Mission ashram is the only accommodation available. Spot bookings can be done for a maximum of 10 people                                (METRO ON SUNDAY THANKS READER SAMIR CHAKRABORTY FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

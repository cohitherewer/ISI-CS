The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The man who plays Mother
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The man who plays Mother
                              Gautam Mukherjee in and as Mother                            
	A film version of Maxim Gorkys Mother directed by Shiladitya Moulik opens at Nandan II on April 16. Gautam Mukherjee, 61, plays the mother, Nilovna, in the film just as he has been doing on stage for over three decades. His is an undying passion for female roles, he tells Metro.              
	Why this film?         
	It is the spirit that is important. What Pavels mother does could have been done by anyone else regardless of country, party, gender or age. The mother for me represents the great strength of our country, our roots, and our own people, without whose participation little is possible.        
	The film builds on the play script by Bablu Mukhopadhyay from Maxim Gorkys novel, which our group, Souvik Sanskritik Chakra, staged on May Day of 1978.         
	The Russian film Mother by Vsevolod Pudovkin (1926) also followed the novel. It was silent but it tore at our hearts and not for a moment did we think that Nilovna belonged to a different country. This film led us to decide on making a Bengali version.               
	The film was shot in Chinsurah to give it a Russian feel, why was that so important?         
	Yes, various locations in Chinsurah were used  a 200-year-old Dutch cemetery, the century-old Hastings Jute Mill  but all that was to build the mood. The novel focuses on the Russian Revolution of 1905 , but the gestures, the tone are all humdrum Indian, even Bengali.                 
	What draws you to womens roles? Some would consider it is absurd at a time when there are so many gifted actresses around...        
	Yes, I have been told so, many times, by actresses who said I robbed them of a livelihood. But why shouldnt I do what my heart wants... I have always wanted a part of the deep energy that is woman. It must have something to do with my love and admiration for my mother who was beautiful and gentle but also very strong.         
	Kirtans fascinated me as a child. The same Kirtania became Rama, Sita and Ravana almost in one breath. Still later I came to know Babli Rani, Chhobi Rani, Dulal Rani, Kanchan Rani and Chapala Rani, some of whom the press described as fairies. I even got to act with some of them.         
	So many actresses have acted in male roles  Molina Devi did Aaban (a pharaoh), Saraju Bala did Kakatua in the play Misor Kumari and Keya Chakravarty played both Shanta and Shantaprasad in Bhalomanush. So why not the other way round? I admire women but I am not happy with the way some actresses portray female roles. Also I feel every actor should build in themselves the capacity to be anything and everything... a hill, a deer...               
	How do you become a woman on stage?         
	Unlike some other actors I dont think this has to do with any subconscious sexual urge... its sheer technique which one has to perfect with repeated practice, observation and understanding. Take the scale of voice, if you start with pa instead of sa you get a womanly voice, but even so it has to come from within.         
	I hit jackpot with my first appearance as a woman  Hirimba in Amal Roys Ghatothkatcha. The Durgapur Cultural Association used to then host a huge state-wide festival. That year some 120 actresses competed but they chose me for the Best Actress Award. I also won awards for Mother in a Hyderabad competition where Tapan Sinha and Habib Tanvir praised my performance. I have acted as Jahanara in Shahjahan, Puntti in Buroshaliker Ghare Ron and Pasha in Chekovs Chorus Girl, where I had to sing and dance on stage.              
	Any new roles in mind?        
	Yes, I am working on Antigone, we hope to be ready by May or June.                     SEBANTI SARKAR

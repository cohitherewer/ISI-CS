The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pre-Puja deadline for cool Metro
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pre-Puja deadline for cool Metro
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Peeved with the slow pace of the extension work on the Metro Railway till New Garia and the technical glitches that have delayed rolling out of new air-conditioned coaches, the railway ministry has set a fresh pre-Puja deadline to get both projects on track.        
	A new internal deadline has been set to complete the extension project and press the new rakes into service by the end of September. Officials have been asked to complete the construction of platforms and make the new rakes compatible by then, a railway ministry official told Metro from Delhi.        
	The first air-conditioned rake has not rolled out yet because of technical problems, but a second prototype AC rake arrived from the Integral Coach Factory in Perambur on Wednesday.         
	Metro officials claimed that the technical glitches faced by the first AC coach, that arrived from the coach factory on July 17, have almost been rectified. We will be able to set them right by August 24, said an official.         
	The main hurdle, apparently, is that the Metro Rails power supply to the third rail is in direct current mode whereas all other railway networks in India, including the Delhi Metro, run on alternating current mode.        
	As a result, the control circuits of the coaches are unable to synchronise the functions. Sometimes the doors are closing before the engine starts while at times the doors are not closing, said an official.        
	Each coach has a circuit which controls the functioning of that coach and synchronises with the others.        
	But the official claimed that the AC trains were almost ready to hit the track. The troubleshooting for the second coach will take far less time since some of the problems were communicated to the coach factory and so sorted out at source.         
	Once Metro authorities give the go-ahead, other rakes will be rolled out.        
	The first two AC rakes of a proposed 13-strong fleet were originally scheduled to arrive in September 2009, but have missed the revised March 31 deadline as well.        
	The railway ministry has also removed a senior official involved in the project for the slow progress.        
	Metro Railway has been ferrying nearly five lakh commuters every day with 15 rakes. Out of the 18 rakes, two have been sent for an overhaul and another is undergoing repairs. Of the 18 rakes, 11 are to be phased out.

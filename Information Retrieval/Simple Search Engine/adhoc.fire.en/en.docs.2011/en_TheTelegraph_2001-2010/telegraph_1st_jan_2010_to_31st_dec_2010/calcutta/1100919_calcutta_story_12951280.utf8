                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Men become nature
										      EYEWITNESS                        A work by Ramlal Dhar				                           
	Ramlal Dhars last body of works being exhibited at Gallery K2 reflected his vision of an idyllic, rural society far removed from the cares and troubles that assail our daily lives. The artist, who used to teach at the Government College of Arts amp; Craft died recently at a relatively young age after a prolonged illness.         
	In his work he seemed to revert to the age of innocence when he grew up amidst the lush green surroundings of Barak valley. The predominant colours here are green, yellow and blue and even the primitive human beings he depicted are in these shades as if they, too, were a part of the nature they saw around them.        
	Most of his earlier work was devoid of human presence. Here the women and men are shadowy presences who seem to be an extension of the solitude that reigns supreme in these gouache on board paintings. He painstakingly uses dots of various shades of green, yellow and blue to build up his images of foliage, clumps of trees and flowers in vases. One cannot miss the note of sadness in these paintings that in hindsight seem to augur his death.              
	Mahbubur Rahman and Tayeba Begum Lipi, who are an artist couple from Bangladesh quite well-known in India, are holding a joint show at Akar Prakar now. Their allusions to art history, earthshaking events related to the freedom struggle both in India and Bangladesh, and dramatic changes brought about in society following globalisation enrich their body of work. Both artists are highly skilled artists and they use their talent in realistic drawing to allude to everything from Buddhist art to pixalated images. Viewers may find Mahbuburs paintings a bit heavy going but Tayeba has a light touch and she cleverly uses simple things like safety pins, safety razor blades and spangles to drive home her message. Both artists seem to be struggling to set themselves free from the influence of colonialism, whose long shadow still darkens the Third World nations.       SOUMITRA DAS

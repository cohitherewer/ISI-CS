The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Governor protests gherao 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Governor protests gherao 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Governor M.K. Narayanan hands over the DLitt scroll to dramatist Badal Sircar. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Protest by all means but please dont gherao, governor and chancellor M.K. Narayanan pleaded with students of Jadavpur University at the 55th annual convocation on Friday.        
	In recent months, they (students) have unfortunately resorted to tactics of gherao and violence to demonstrate their protest.While democratic protests are acceptable, violence needs to be avoided, Narayanan said, referring to a series of disruptions ranging from a 52-hour gherao of teachers to an exam and class boycott by engineering students.        
	A university, the governor added, was a seat of wisdom and its students were privileged individuals who must understand the futility of violent, disruptive politics better than others.        
	If a gherao is a no-no in Narayanans book, so is the presence of police on campuses. I dont think we need policemen during student union elections, the former IPS officer later told reporters in reply to a question on the violence in the run-up to college polls.         
	Narayanans hard talk at the convocation  he had joked at another event on Wednesday about earning the sobriquet of unpopular governor for not being able to say nice things about people  mirrored the stand taken by the university authorities on the boycott of exams and classes by engineering students.        
	The students have since agreed to return to classes and even apologised to their teachers in writing for their conduct during the exam boycott.         
	In September, Jadavpur University students had gheraoed vice-chancellor Pradip Narayan Ghosh and other executive council members for 52 hours to protest the decision to install CCTVs on the campus.        
	Students of engineering, except those in their final year, then boycotted the semester exams after the varsity authorities refused to withdraw the FIR against 35 students accused of trying to block chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy on November 9.         
	When a new semester began on December 7, the students boycotted classes over the same issue. The climbdown began after the universitys executive council ruled out talks on the academic impasse till the students joined classes.        
	Governor Narayanan said the students needed to realise that they could achieve with restraint what they couldnt with aggression.        
	I appeal to you to avoid these tactics (of disruption). The doors of the vice-chancellor and the chancellor are always open to you, he told the congregation at the varsitys open-air theatre.        
	Prof Yongxiang Lu, the president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Badal Sircar, dramatist and theatre director, were conferred the DLitt.

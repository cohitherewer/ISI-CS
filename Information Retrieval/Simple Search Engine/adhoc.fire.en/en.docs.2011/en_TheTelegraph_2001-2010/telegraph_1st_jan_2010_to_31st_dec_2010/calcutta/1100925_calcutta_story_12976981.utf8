	Members of the corporate world will be grilled about their own professions at a quiz in Calcutta Club on Saturday.        
	The EMTA Corporate Management Quiz, organised by Calcutta Club and the management department of JD Birla Institute, in association with The Telegraph, will see 200 teams competing.        
	Concepts in management keep changing and the quiz is a sounding board for the corporates to see how prepared they are, said Suman Mukerjee, director, JD Birla Institute (department of management) and national management quizmaster of All India Management Association (AIMA).        
	The quiz started in January 1999 with AIMA as one of the organisers. JD Birla Institute (department of management) has been organising the event since 2004.        
	The organisers will donate Rs 2.5 lakh to mayor Sovan Chatterjee for the beautification of ward 63, where JD Birla Institute is located.

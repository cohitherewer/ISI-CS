                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hot hooves on the greens

	The home of the oldest polo club in the world is in for exciting equestrian action.        
	Equine expertise and saddle skills will be on display at The National Equestrian Championship and the 58th Calcutta Horse Show, which start on the Pat Williamson Grounds on Monday.        
	The Asian Games trials for showjumping  being held in Calcutta for the first time  will add to the buzz, feels Lt- Col H.R. Sunil of the Army Service Corps. Cross country and dressage, two other equestrian events in which India is likely to field teams in the November 2010 Guangzhou (China) Asian Games, are part of the tournaments.        
	The Indian cross country team has won bronze in the last three Asian Games. This time too, we will be sending a dressage team, said Lt-Col Shakti Rathore, who is coordinating the events on behalf of the Eastern Command.         
	Along with teams like the Eastern Command and the 61st Cavalry, the West Bengal Mounted Police will also be participating in the nationals. The big names include Navjit Sandhu, Gulab Singh, Jyoti Dhawan, Rathore and Sunil.        
	The six-day extravaganza will also feature tent pegging lance, tent pegging sword, hacks and hunter, said Lt-Col Rathore. Events like trotting race and boot and hay race are reserved for children.        
	It will be a great learning experience for the children, as the best talent in the country will perform in front of them, said Lt-Col Sunil, who is posted in Calcutta and has won 18 medals in the three equestrian world championships in which he has represented the country.        
	Calcutta Polo Club, established in 1862, is the oldest in the world. The city also has one of Indias most respected equestrian training centres,  Fort William Riding and Polo Club. We are keeping the events open to all, hoping the show will renew interest in equestrian sports in the city, said Brig Respwal, the chief co-ordinator of the tournament.

	Two government departments are blaming each other for the spate of fires in city educational institutions as campuses wait in vain for an assessment of their fire-safety measures.         
	The fire services department has claimed that poor maintenance of buildings by the public works department (PWD) is to blame for the recent instances of fire in educational institutions.        
	The PWD has brushed aside the charge saying its responsibility ends once it completes the construction of a building and hands it over to the owner.        
	Fire-safety inspection, the PWD insists, is the responsibility of the fire services department.        
	Caught in the blame game are several educational institutions, including Calcutta University, that have sought an assessment of their firefighting arrangements but are yet to get a response.        
	On Friday, the top brass of the fire services department concluded after a stock-taking exercise that the PWD needed to play a more pro-active role to ensure firefighting measures were in place in state-run educational institutions.        
	On Friday, two fires broke out in state-run schools Hindu School and a school at Laatbagan in Barrackpore. Both buildings had been built by the PWD. The department should say why it did not utilise our services to ensure that firefighting arrangements were in place in the buildings, said D.P. Biswas, the additional director-general of fire services.        
	Fire safety, unfortunately, has become a part-time exercise, he commented.        
	A senior fire services officer said the PWD authorities had been asked to explain why fire-safety measures were not in place in several buildings built by it.         
	For instance, we have written to the PWD to find out what measures it had taken to ensure fire safety in the new secretariat building. If the PWD has erected a building, it must also maintain it, said a senior officer.        
	PWD officials said they could not ensure fire-safety in buildings unless they were paid for the job. The amount made available to the department under unplanned budgetary allocation is largely spent on maintenance of roads, leaving little or nothing for upkeep of buildings, they claimed.        
	PWD secretary Ajit Ranjan Bardhan accused the fire services department of passing the buck while highlighting the lack of allocation for building upkeep by the government departments.        
	Maintenance cannot be free and we cannot go on maintaining a building indefinitely.... The departments must realise that it is time they made separate allocations for maintenance of buildings under them. Only then can they afford annual upkeep, he added.        
	For the sake of the city students who attend classes in rooms that are fire prone, the responsibility must be fixed soon.        
	Now, even if school and college authorities want to improve fire-safety measures, they cannot do so because of lack of help from experts.         
	After the Presidency University blaze, we reviewed the fire-safety measures on our campuses and wrote to the fire services authorities requesting them to suggest necessary changes. We have not received a response, said Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of Calcutta University.         
	The university had conducted a similar review a year ago and submitted a report to the fire department seeking its suggestions. There was no response to the earlier letter as well, said a university official.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girl takes fight to harasser
  - JU student grabbed by cyclist in New Alipore, calls top cop          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Brinda Dasgupta suffered what so many young women are subjected to on the streets every day. But the 22-year-old on Thursday did what most young women rarely do  lodge a complaint against her anonymous harasser.        
	The resident of New Alipore is not very hopeful of the nondescript man on a bicycle being caught, but she refuses to give up without a fight.        
	This is what the first-year post-graduate student of Jadavpur University told Metro hours after the horror walk:        
	I was walking down a lane beside the New Alipore Association from my house to the Taratala auto stand around 9.45am. I vaguely noticed a man cycling down from the opposite side. All of a sudden, the man swerved right into my path, groped me in a horrible manner and sped off.        
	For two seconds I was in shock. Then I turned around and started running after the cyclist. I screamed to the people on the road, Stop him! Stop him! Guards, domestics and vegetable-sellers on the road looked on, disinterested.        
	I kept telling them that the man on the cycle had attacked me and begged them to stop him. Two or three people started after him, but as if they were on a casual morning jog. By then, the man had cycled into another lane and was gone. He was wearing a striped T-shirt and trousers, I think.        
	I called up my mother, who asked me to come back home. I said I had to go to college. But halfway down the road, I broke down.... Back home, my mother called up the New Alipore police station and asked for the OC but no one cooperated. It was only after we got in touch with the police commissioner that two cops came over to our house. They claimed that this was the first harassment complaint they had received in a year-and-half.        
	Thats so strange. The lanes of New Alipore have become nightmarish. Walking to the auto stand or going to the local market, my sisters and I get harassed all the time. My grandfather built our house in 1955, and I have grown up here. Do I now have to live in fear? Of being subjected to catcalls and whistles or being stalked by bikers and groped by cyclists?        
	Did I incite the man  should I call him that?  by wearing jeans and a T-shirt? I am shocked, I am shivering. When can we leave our homes without the fear of being harassed on the streets? Is that too much to ask?        
	When Metro posed Brindas questions to top cop Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, he said: I have spoken to her personally and the case has been handed over to the detective department for a thorough probe. We have decided to intensify vigil in places like Alipore and New Alipore. The unfortunate incident is a wake-up call for us to be more alert.        
	What does a woman do? There are a few helplines, including 1091, exclusively meant for women and children. Besides, one can seek help from the nearest police kiosk.        
	If only it was as easily done as said.        
	How can this menace end? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

	The two youths arrested on Monday night on the charge of illegally carrying a pistol and 50 bullets are members of an arms smuggling racket, police said.        
	Sujoy Sarkar and Sanjib Das have revealed some names and we are carrying out raids to arrest them, said an officer.        
	The duo were picked up from Beleghata when cops spotted them abusing a taxi driver. A search revealed a .32 pistol of Italian make tucked in Sanjibs waist, under his T-shirt. Sujoy was carrying the bullets.        
	The police suspect they were on their way to deliver the consignment to a gang.        
	Sanjib studied till BCom first year and then worked as a salesman for a private company. Sujoy did not study after passing Class XI and was working as physiotherapist. Both are from lower middle-class families and had no criminal record, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Sanjib is a resident of Suren Sarkar Road in Phoolbagan while Sujoy lives on Beleghata Main Road.        
	We have talked to their family members and they seem unaware of the duos link with the arms racket, said the officer.

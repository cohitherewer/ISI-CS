                      Rediscovering Tagores heroines                    Unconventional relationships  a married woman in love with a younger brother-in law, a love triangle between a man, his wife and his sister-in law, an intimate affair between a married man and a distant cousin  are the subjects of Rabindranath Tagores three novellas, Nashtanir (The Broken Home), Dui Bon (Two Sisters) and Malancha (The Garden and the Gardener). In these three novellas (written between 1901 and 1903) Tagore focuses on the subtle nuances of unsanctioned relationships, exploring feelings of loneliness and insecurity among middle-class housewives in colonial Bengal. They reflect Tagores remarkable understanding of a womans psyche, all three works underlining the incompatibility between husbands and wives, and how the ensuing void leads to forbidden relationships. In Charulata, Sharmila and Neeraja  the three strong yet vulnerable heroines, Tagore presents emerging new women with thoughts and desires of their own. While Sukhendu Rays translations retain the cultural and linguistic ambience of the originals, Bharati Rays introduction places them in the social context of early 21st century Bengal. This evening, M.K. Narayanan, West Bengal Governor, will launch Three Novellas, Rays English translation of these works. To be followed by a panel discussion on the theme of the book. Participants: Nabaneeta Dev Sen, Supriya Chaudhuri, Swapan Chakravorty and the translator.                  Event: The launch of Three Novellas, Sukhendu Rays English translation of Tagores Nashtanir, Dui Bon and Malancha When: Today at 6 pm Where: Oxford Bookstore, Park Street

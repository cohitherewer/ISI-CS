The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dare not slow down top cop
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dare not slow down top cop
          KINSUK BASU                                          Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti      
	If youre caught in a traffic snarl when the CPM pitches its circus tent opposite Metro cinema, dont hope for any relief or redress, unless, of course, you happen to be the police commissioner.        
	The officers-in-charge of three traffic guards were summoned to Lalbazar on November 2 and served notices allegedly because Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had been slowed down by the kind of traffic that constantly trips the weekday commuter.        
	After Chakrabarti left his Loudon Street residence at 10.05am that Tuesday, he apparently had to stop-and-start at several points on the way to Bodyguard Lines in Alipore for a meeting. His car was further slowed down by a bus in front, first on AJC Bose Road and then on Alipore Road.        
	The delay was for a few minutes and it was not that the commissioner couldnt reach the venue on time (for the monthly crime conference and pre-Kali Puja briefing). The traffic arrangements were all in place but what can anyone do if the car is slowed down by a bus? asked a senior officer.         
	A lot, if you are the top cop. That very afternoon, the officers in charge of the Vidyasagar Setu, Bhowanipore and South traffic guards were put up before Chakrabarti. Two days after this, a letter was issued to the three officers asking for an explanation.         
	The notice, issued by additional commissioner Debasish Roy, states: You are hereby directed to submit your explanation in writing as to your failure to ensure proper manning of vital traffic beats at about 10.00 hours on 2.11.2010. If you fail to submit your explanation by seven days or if your explanation is not satisfactory, departmental proceeding would be initiated against you.        
	The Lalbazar bosses tried to play down the boss angle, claiming the move was more about accountability. The whole exercise is an administrative move to ensure smooth traffic and lets not read too much into it, Roy told Metro.         
	The accountability line was tough even for the force to swallow. Had the letter (notice) not been because of the commissioner, why does it speak only about manning traffic beats that fell on his route on the morning of November 2? asked a senior officer of the traffic department.        
	Told about the avowed attempt to ensure smooth traffic, a parent stuck on AJC Bose Road with her school-going son on Tuesday said: If the common Calcutta commuter was anyones concern, every traffic officer would have been showcaused every day.

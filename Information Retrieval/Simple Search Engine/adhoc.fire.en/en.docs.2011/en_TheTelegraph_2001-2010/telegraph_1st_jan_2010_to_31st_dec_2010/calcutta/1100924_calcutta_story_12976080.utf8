The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Disaster cloud on school trips   Schools steer clear of trains
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Disaster cloud on school trips     - Plan change in troubled time          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                                      
	Trip to Meerut and Varanasi: Cancelled        
	Expedition to Ladakh: Cancelled        
	Excursion to Orissa: Advanced        
	Journey to Mumbai: Shifted from train to plane        
	A spate of natural and man-made disasters coupled with apprehensions of unrest have forced city schools to press the pause button on excursions or alter their schedules, routes and modes of travel.        
	If Lakshmipat Singhania Academy has cancelled its participation in the CBSE School Games in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Babri Masjid verdict, Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan has opted for plane rather than train to take 27 students to Mumbai following yet another rail accident.        
	Calcutta Girls High School has advanced a September trip to Orissa so that the students return journey does not coincide with the aftermath of the Supreme Courts ruling on the Babri Masjid case, while The Heritage School has called off a proposed Puja tour of Ladakh.        
	The cancelled trips may have left most students disappointed but their parents couldnt be more relieved. Safety comes first. The parents and the school collectively decided to call off the trip to Leh in view of the prevailing weather conditions, said Seema Sapru, the principal of The Heritage School.        
	Safety is also the reason why Atanu Banerjee is paying a few thousand rupees extra for his daughters December trip to Egypt to represent her school in a global event.        
	My daughter and her friends could have travelled by train to Mumbai, from where they are booked on a flight to Egypt. But the series of train accidents in recent months was at the back of my mind until the school suggested that they make the full trip by air. I had no hesitation in making the extra payment despite being stretched, Banerjee told Metro.        
	Sunita Sen, the principal of Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan, said parents were ready to send their children on even bus trips but not by train.        
	The Jnaneswari train tragedy in Maoist-infested West Midnapore in May was the first hitch of the excursion season, triggering a series of cancellations.                          
	Delhi Public School, New Town, was to send a batch of students to Dalhousie and Wagah in June but called it off.         
	 Accidents are a matter of chance but I would not like to risk the safety of students for anything, said principal Udita Ganguly.        
	South City International School, which was planning a trip to Ranthambore National Park and another to Jaipur in October and December, has cancelled both with parents refusing to send their wards by train.        
	Train accidents have become frequent, said principal John Bagul, blaming that for only one yes from a group of 100 students.        
	Most schools planning to send students on Puja or winter excursions have already altered their plans to exclude travelling through the Maoist belts of Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, Apeejay School (Park Street) and St Augustines Day School are all looking at options closer home or even overseas.         
	Travel agents confirmed receiving enquiries about bulk flight bookings.        
	Competitive airfares have become an alternative to train travel for schools, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.

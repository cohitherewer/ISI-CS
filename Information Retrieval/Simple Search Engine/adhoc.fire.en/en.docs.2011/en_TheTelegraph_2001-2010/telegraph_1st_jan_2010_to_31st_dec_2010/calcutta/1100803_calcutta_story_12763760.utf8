          DOEL BOSE                  Winners of Tiitans, the science quiz organised by TTIS at the St Xaviers College auditorium on July 17

	After the preliminary screening, three semi-finals were held with five schools each. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Calcutta Girls High School, DAV Public School, South Point High, Delhi Public School (DPS) Ruby Park, and MP Birla Foundation made it to the finals.

	We were more prepared this year, having divided the work between us, said Kajori Nandy, a Class X student of Calcutta Girls High School, before the finals started.         
	The questions from quizmaster Partha Ghose ranged from the full form of Yahoo to the main constituent of coal gas.     
	The finals consisted of five rounds. In the visual round Who am I?, students had to identify renowned scientists with the help of a photograph or a video clip. The last round, Gravity, was a buzzer round, with questions like the first element to be produced artificially (techtenium).         
	The enthusiasm of the students often led them to reach for the buzzer before time, bringing on negative marks for the team.         
	Subhechha Chatterjee, a Class X student of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, said: The questions were not too difficult. We just had to remember what we had studied in school.         
	The winners, Arunava Chanda, Harsh Chajher, Atma Anand and Abhishek Rungta from DPS Ruby Park were high on confidence, remembering their previous years win. We are hoping for a hat- trick next year, quipped Arunava. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and MP Birla Foundation were the first and second runners-up, respectively.

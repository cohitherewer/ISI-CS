	lIn response to the article dated September 7, Grotesque gold on white landmark, I want to ask: why shouldnt the Metropolitan Building be coloured? After all it shows that the government is at least doing something.           
	Also, going by the rising price of gold, may be this is the governments way of popularising the next-best thing  gold-painted jewellery!           
	On a more serious note, it is sad that the state has not been able to imitate the Wests positive qualities. Beautification and maintenance of the city and its rich heritage is a far cry in Calcutta. The indifference of citizens is also a problem in developing the city.           
	The most shocking part of the article was the mayors ignorance about Metropolitan Building. While the previous one proved his callousness by claiming the abundance of greenery in Calcutta after a severe storm, the present mayor is ignorant of the entire city! Most of the times he appears unprepared and fails to act confidently. Should such a mayor be in power?

	I do not think the new colour combination of Metropolitan Building (white and gold) as chosen by the conservation committee is ugly. In fact, I feel the golden caps make the building look more beautiful than if it were all white.           
	The restorers of a heritage building must bear in mind that the structure should be restored to its former glory. However, I support the new colour combination of Metropolitan Building. Our city has to grow colourfully while keeping the pristine simplicity intact.

	In response to the report Shutdown strikes wrong chord , September 8, I would like to point out that bandhs are not taken seriously in Calcutta anymore. This is because most of the people are not even aware of the reason behind a bandh. Even if they know there is a bandh, they are least interested in knowing the cause or the party involved. Bandhs have become just another excuse to stay home.             
	Pratika Gupta,           
	Address not given                     
	I defied the bandh by going to work. Even our employees came to work as they also understand that these bandhs are pointless and can never do any good.           
	Umang Lalani,           
	Address not given                     
	Bandh has been the most common menace in Bengal for a long time. I think people should realise that a political party that calls a bandh has only its own interest in mind and thinks nothing of the hardships it inflicts on the people. I think the people should raise a voice against bandhs as they affect the common man the most.

	I do not agree with your report on many Calcuttans defying the September 7 bandh. All the people Metro met that day were seen at shopping malls, multiplexes or restaurants. But how many attended office or college? Chilling out is no defiance of a bandh. I would have saluted them if they had been found at their workplaces.           
	Ankita Singhal,           
	Agarpara                     
	I am from Calcutta but presently work in Hyderabad. I believe the September 7 bandh was a countrywide shutdown, but Calcutta was the worst affected.           
	Bandhs are damaging the reputation of our beloved city. This will obviously be followed by serious economic consequences.           
	Bandhs offer no solutions to problems. Please say NO to bandh. Come out and work. These political buffoons can do no harm. Once the common man becomes conscious about bandhs, the enforcers will cease to matter.           
	Deboleena Ghosh,           
	Hyderabad                     
	I defy every bandh, whether called by the Left or otherwise.           
	I make it a point to attend office during every bandh as a mark of defiance more than anything else. On a couple of occasions Ive reached my office before 6am.           
	But what saddens me the most is the attitude of a majority of Calcuttans. How can an entire community sit idle at home on a working day with a ludicrous smile on their faces when questioned as to why they have not attempted to go for work? You would not find this attitude elsewhere in our country.           
	We can of course debate forever whether it is safe to venture out on such days when political goons unleash their terror of cowardice on the general public by snatching away our fundamental right to go to work, but my question is, how many of us have even attempted to get to work on a bandh day?           
	I had gone to the market the evening before the bandh and was astounded to see the mad rush for buying fish and mutton.           
	But never mind, despite being at the mercy of these goons for all these years, we will all obediently stand in a queue under the hot sun sometime next year and vote for these jokers!

	Kudos to the Aviva Great Wall of Education (September 1 to 5). Under this initiative, it was heartening to see educated people coming forward to offer their books for underprivileged children so that they get a glimpse into the world of joy, entertainment and knowledge. We hope that our little fellow citizens will be immensely benefitted by the books.             
	Mousumi Ghosh,

	I wish that such book donation drives are organised in the future too. It was overwhelming to see Calcuttans donating over 3 lakh books. I had purchased textbooks from classes I to X for the wall.

	My sister and I received many books as prizes in school. Over the past 12 years, these books have been very close to our hearts. But when we got to know about the Aviva Great Wall of Education in The Telegraph, we realised that our prized books could be best utilised by donating them to children who have always dreamt of books but never got to read them.

	The enthusiastic response from children to elderly persons of Calcutta to donating books in several languages and on various topics shows their great kindness and humanity. Our citizens always come forward for any worthy cause.

	Your report Rat bites patients hand, September 1, has not come as a surprise.             
	Patients often get bitten by rodents, civets, and strays in state-run hospitals. The health minister, instead of wasting his time ranting against frisking at hotels, should improve the working of the state hospitals and medical colleges.           
	The deputy superintendent of Medical College and Hospital should be suspended for his irresponsible act of asking a patients relative whether he had rats in his house while trying to justify the rodent menace at the hospital.           
	A.S. Mehta,           
	New Alipore                     
	Nibbling of limbs of patients by ants or rodents in government-run hospitals is becoming a common occurrence. A referral hospital like Medical College and Hospital is no exception.           
	We cannot blame the hospital authorities alone. Patient parties also have the responsibility of ensuring the cleanliness of each ward for greater interest of the critically ill patients. Heaps of garbage and mounds of medical waste is a common scene in all government hospitals. At Burdwan Medical College and Hospital such unhygienic waste can be spotted close to the infectious cholera ward, which is dominated by stray dogs and cats.           
	The situation is worsened by the reluctance of group D employees to do their work properly, thanks to the blessing of Citu and other unions. There should be display boards throughout the hospital premises informing visitors not to spit, urinate or litter except in designated areas.           
	As alleged by the sister of the patient in question, the misbehaviour of nurses in government hospitals is also a common complaint. These nurses act as if they are doing charity for the patient.           
	A secured government job is the principal impediment to the desired services. Thus one sees dedicated services at private elite hospitals by nurses and attendants. They are very friendly and caring towards patients even without the expectation of tips. However, one must point out that in many of these elite hospitals and nursing homes, nurses are quite underpaid.

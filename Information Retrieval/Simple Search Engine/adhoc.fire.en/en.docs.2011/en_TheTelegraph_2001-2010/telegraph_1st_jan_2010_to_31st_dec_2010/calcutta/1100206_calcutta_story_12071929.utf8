          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The state government had followed norms while handing over a 62-cottah plot in Salt Lake to Sourav Ganguly for building a school, advocate-general Balai Ray told a high court division bench on Friday.         
	A group of township residents had moved the court alleging foul play in the allocation of the CA block plot. Ray on Friday claimed the petitioners had no locus standi in the matter as they were in no way deprived. How is the interest of the petitioners hampered if the government allows someone to construct a school building on the said plot? asked Ray and pleaded with the bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice P.C. Ghosh to dismiss the case.         
	Answering a question by Justice Ghosh, the advocate-general said the government had published an advertisement in two newspapers before handing over the plot.         
	Advocate Arunava Ghosh, who represented the petitioners, said he would hand over evidence of norm flout to the court during the next hearing on February 12.

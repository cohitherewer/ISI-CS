The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salute to those who shape lives
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Salute to those who shape lives
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Sharmila Ghose took her students on a steamer ride from Babughat to Belur to explain to them the concept of relative speed. The students found out the vessels speed upstream and downstream and used the data to calculate its relative speed, said the mathematics teacher of The Future Foundation School.         
	Satabdi G. Bhattacharya has promised a Class X student that she would convince his doctor parents to let him study humanities in classes XI-XII. He wants to pursue humanities but his parents forced him to take up science in Class IX. I am trying to convince his parents to let him study what he wants, said the biology teacher of DPS Newtown.         
	The skill and passion of these two teachers were recognised at the TTIS Golden Flame Awards 2010 on Tuesday. Ghose won the Mathematician award and Bhattacharya the Touchstone award for helping students make prudent career choices.         
	The aim of the award, on its fourth year, was summed up best by the emcee, actor Barun Chanda. This award is institutionalised to accord recognition and honour to those who help shape the future, he said at the Satyajit Ray Auditorium of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR).        
	Two hundred and thirty-five teachers from 50-odd schools in and around Calcutta were in contention for the award. After the initial screening and interview, 21 teachers  three in each of the seven categories  made the cut.         
	The categories included the Communicator award (for successfully developing English as a language of written and spoken communication), Scales award (for excellent track record in teaching a particular subject), Aristotle award (for inculcating leadership qualities), TTIS Award (for making students aware of their responsibilities towards society and community) and Innovators award (for employing non-conventional, innovative methods to teach).         
	For the teachers who made it to the finals, education is not confined to the four walls of the classroom. Environmental science teacher Mummun Dey of The Heritage School, who got the TTIS Award, no-plastic does not merely mean avoiding plastic. My students have taught women from a village how to make paper thongas that they sell to grocery shops. The drive reduces the use of plastic and also gives these women a secondary source of income, said Dey.         
	Bisakha Sen of Loreto Day School, Sealdah, who received the Innovators award, strives to make classroom teaching interesting. My students compare William Shakespeare and Rabindranath Tagore in class, which makes their lessons interesting, said Sen.         
	Pasham Chatterjee of The Future Foundation School received the Communicator award, Juhi Mathur of Birla High School for Boys the Aristotle award and Santashree Bhattacharya of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy the Scales award.         
	The award ceremony was interspersed with performances by students showing their gratitude towards the teachers.

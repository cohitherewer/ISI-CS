  - Parties place bulk orders					 					      KINSUK BASU                        A sandesh platter in one of the landmark sweet shops of the city. (Sanat Kr Sinha)				                                       
	You may be on either side of the calorie divide but if its elections and results, the choice of indulgence is obvious  sweets.        
	Sweet shops across the city received bulk orders on Tuesday with supporters of various parties and candidates preparing to celebrate Wednesdays municipal results with mouthfuls of mishti.         
	We sent a consignment of some 2,500 pieces of jol-bhora sandesh to Hazra on Tuesday afternoon, and there are orders for more on Wednesday, said Sudip Mullick of the Radharaman Mullick Balaram Mullick outlet in Bhowanipore.        
	One candidates supporters have placed an order for assorted sweets with Saphalyer abhinandan (greetings on your success) written on them.        
	I can tell you that the orders are mostly for our signature sweets, though it would be improper to name any of these clients, smiled Sudip.        
	With counting scheduled to start at 8am and the first results expected to be announced within three hours, most sweet shops are preparing in advance for a deluge of orders by mid-day. You have to be prepared. We scale up our production of sandesh by nearly 25 per cent whenever results of any major election are declared, said Prasanta Nandy of Girish Chandra Dey amp; Nakur Chandra Nandy.         
	The big orders usually start coming in the afternoon, he added.         
	While the ubiquitous rosogolla is the most popular choice, laddoos and gulab jamuns are not far behind in the mishti wish list. Some candidates are known to order a particular sweet to celebrate their poll success.        
	Sudhangshu Sil (tipped to be the Left Fronts mayor if it wins) has been a loyal customer for years and his choice has always been our chocolate sandesh, said Sanjay Das of Makhanlal Das and Sons, a north Calcutta landmark. Supporters cutting across party lines also seem to prefer our koda paker sandesh.        
	The Trinamul Congress has said it wont celebrate on Wednesday as a mark of respect to the Jnaneswari Express victims but sweet shops expect orders to come in for private celebrations.

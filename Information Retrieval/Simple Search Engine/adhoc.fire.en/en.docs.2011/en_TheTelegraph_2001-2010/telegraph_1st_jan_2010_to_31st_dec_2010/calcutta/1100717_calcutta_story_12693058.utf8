          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Cash and jewellery of more than Rs 3 lakh were stolen from the Sonarpur house of a private bank employee while he was visiting relatives with his wife.        
	The complaint lodged on Friday by Pashupati Das stated that 15 bhori of gold jewellery, 10 bhori of silver ornaments and Rs 45,000 in cash were stolen from his house, said an officer of Sonarpur police station.        
	Last Sunday, Das and his wife had gone to Bandel, where their daughters in-laws live. They returned home late on Thursday.         
	Das found the lock on the main door broken. The television set was missing from the drawing room. In the living room, the almirah lock was broken and the money and the ornaments inside were missing, the officer added.        
	The thieves probably used acid to break the lock. It looks like the thieves even had fruits and drinks kept in the refrigerator, said an investigating officer.        
	Das had bought the jewellery for the rice-eating ceremony of his granddaughter. Neighbours said they did not notice anything unusual.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tribute to Basu, tears for biz
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Industrialists pay homage to Jyoti Basu on Tuesday. Picture by Kishor Roychowdhury                                  
	Seven city-based chambers of commerce gathered on Tuesday to mourn Jyoti Basus death but ended up mourning the death of industry during his 23-year rule.        
	Speaker after speaker took the dais to recall the former chief ministers contribution but none had anything to say except his role in setting up Haldia Petrochemicals, Bakreshwar Thermal Power Plant and scripting the states industrial policy in 1994.        
	Most took the easy way out and talked about Basus success in running a coalition government for over 23 years and his role in implementing agrarian reforms and panchayati raj that empowered the poor.        
	He was the real father of coalition politics, said S.S. Beriwala, the president of the Merchants Chamber of Commerce and one of the organisers of the programme at a star hotel.        
	The other chambers that joined the event to pay homage to the legendary leader were the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Indian Chamber of Commerce, Bharat Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta Chamber of Commerce and the Oriental Chamber of Commerce.        
	The organisers had claimed that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen and CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury would attend the meeting but none turned up. Later, the chief ministers office clarified that Bhattacharjee had not confirmed his participation.        
	A CPM spokesperson said Sen and Yechury, too, had not confirmed their presence.        
	Left Front chairman Biman Bose was the lone political figure at the event.        
	While speakers hailed Basu for creating an environment of communal harmony, none broached the other legacy of his regime  militant trade unionism that many believe led to the flight of capital from the state.        
	How can you say such things here? This is not the right forum to criticise Basu, a speaker said after the meeting.        
	An industrialist, who once bore the brunt of Left trade unions strong-arm tactics, later told Metro: Basu did nothing for industry. Bidhan Chandra Ray had done much more during his 14-year tenure.        
	Recounting Basus way of handling industrial disputes, the industrialist said: He had a great sense of humour and he used to address the issues with his characteristic one-liners But finally he would say all parties to the dispute must be taken care of.        
	An old-timer in a leading industry association, however, said that empowering the trade unions was needed in those days to save the working class from exploitation. But he was quick to add that the former chief minister  a trade union veteran himself  had allowed the movement to cross its limits.        
	Had Basu used his acumen and influence over fellow politicians in a more fruitful way, he could have taken Bengal ahead, he explained.        
	Though other speakers avoided the controversial topic of militant trade unionism, Left Front chairman Bose referred to it, much to the discomfort of the audience.        
	Jyotibabu stressed the rights of workers. He had made it clear that industry would have to look after the workers to ensure a congenial atmosphere, said Bose.

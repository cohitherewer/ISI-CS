                      Motionless moments                    From a scientific point of view, we know that everything about us and the universe is basically energy in motion. And on a spiritual level, what all human beings are striving for is union with The One, whether we choose to call him God or anything else that suits our religious consciousness. For Prarthana Modi that state of union will be a state of complete stillness... when we finally come to rest. The ongoing solo show is titled Still. It is basically about stillness in the midst of the constant movement in our lives and in everything about us. It is about getting in touch with ones inner self. And about feeling calm and peaceful within.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Prarthana Modi When: Till September 8; 11 am - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SC turns down bhujia baron plea
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SC turns down bhujia baron plea
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI                              
	The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay the life sentence awarded to Haldirams owner Prabhu Shankar Agarwal and asked the bhujia baron to appeal to the high court.        
	A trial court had on January 30 sentenced Agarwal and four others to life imprisonment for conspiring to murder and attempt to murder. Agarwals appeal against the order is pending in the high court.        
	Had the apex court allowed Agarwals plea and stayed the trial courts order, the businessman would have been out on bail till his appeal was disposed of by the high court.        
	An apex court vacation bench of Justice Deepak Verma and Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan asked the high court to dispose of any fresh plea by Agarwal at the earliest.        
	Agarwals lawyer had submitted before the bench that though his client had been sentenced for conspiracy to murder and attempt to murder, he had been tried only for the former offence.        
	A person can be convicted on a count he has never been charged with, but there should be enough evidence for the court to do so, he said. Against Agarwal, the lawyer claimed, there was no such evidence.

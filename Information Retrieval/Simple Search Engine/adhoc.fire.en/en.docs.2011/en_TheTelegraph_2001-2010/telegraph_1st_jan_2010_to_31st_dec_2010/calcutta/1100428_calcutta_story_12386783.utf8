The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rash driving charge against leaders driver
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rash driving charge against leaders driver
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Lakshman Seth                                  
	Police have charged CPM strongman Lakshman Seths driver, who took a forbidden U-turn near Fort William on Monday, and the driver of the CSTC bus that hit the leaders Scorpio immediately after with rash and negligent driving.        
	Both drivers have been booked under sections 279 and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC, said an officer of Maidan police station.         
	Rash and negligent driving carries a maximum punishment of six months in jail or a fine of Rs 1,000 or both. The other charge carries a maximum punishment of six months in jail or a fine of Rs 500 or both.        
	On Tuesday, Metro highlighted how the cops had chosen to file a routine motor collision case. We will lodge a case against Sheikh Osman Ali (Seths driver) only if the bus driver files a complaint with us, an officer had said on Monday.        
	We found out that both drivers were at fault and that resulted in the collision. Despite noticing that the Scorpio was making the prohibited U-turn, the bus driver did not slam the brakes and dashed the car, which toppled over, said an officer on Tuesday.         
	Another officer hinted that the case was registered following instructions from the Lalbazar top brass.        
	Will Osman and the driver of the bus be arrested?         
	They should be arrested as they have been booked under Section 279 of IPC. But when is a big question. We are awaiting instruction from our superiors, added the officer.         
	When Metro informed Seth that a case has been registered against his driver, he said: I am not aware of it. The police can file a case for violating traffic norms and rash and negligent driving if they think he was involved. I do not have anything to say about it.         
	The bus driver was also at fault as he failed to brake in time. I have returned to my house in Haldia and do not know anything about the case being filed by cops against me, Osman said over phone.

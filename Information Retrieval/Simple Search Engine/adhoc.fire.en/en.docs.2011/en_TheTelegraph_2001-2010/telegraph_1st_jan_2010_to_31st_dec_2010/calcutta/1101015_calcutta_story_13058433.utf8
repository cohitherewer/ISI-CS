The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Care and craft for spirit crown
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Care and craft for spirit crown
                              Lake Youth Corner				                           
	Mudiali-Lake Market        
	A decent blend of aesthetics and civic sense characterises the pujas in Mudiali and Lake Market.        
	Tribal and folk art dominate the themes. Some puja committees have managed to marry the vibrant colours of these indigenous art forms with fire-prevention measures, first-aid facilities and drives to preserve the greens.         
	Tridhara Sammilani, a True Spirit veteran, has failed to maintain its high standards this year with drinking water and first-aid missing from the counters.        
	The puja has scored in terms of traffic control with help from a private agency.        
	Their pandal, open on all sides with a transparent fire-resistant sheet around the idols, was different from the stuffy interiors of most other pujas. The Tridhara interiors complement the theme that dwells on the creation of the universe.        
	The narrow triangular entrance to Parasar Nabodaya Sangha, beside Lake Market, seems to pose a risk in an emergency.         
	The pandal of Adi Lake Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsab Samity at Lake Place  a mud hut with Madhubani paintings on the walls and thatched roof  looks pretty but its first-aid box was stuffed with junk.                    25 Palli Sarbojanin    
	Lake Gardens Peoples Association scored with its clean and green theme, featuring terracotta idols and murals painted with vegetable dye. The enclosure for administering first-aid is air-conditioned and there are rest rooms for the aged. The Mithila paintings in the pandal encourage biodiversity, said the organisers.        
	The bold and colourful pandal of Bengal United Club in Tollygunge stood out with its arched bamboo passage lined with figures made of cloth patches. It has adequate fire-fighting arrangements, two nurses and a wheelchair for the sick. Helpline numbers and a map of the locality is given to visitors.         
	Bengal United distributed blankets among 45 underprivileged children on Chaturthi while Tridhara Sammilani treated 300 children to a meal this year.         
	Saradia Sammilanis pandal on Pratapaditya Road  a decrepit house with warnings stuck on its walls asking people to stay away  confused many visitors. The inside was adorned with paintings, a gramophone and antique furniture.        
	The organisers unfortunately did not pay as much attention to waste disposal, drinking water, first-aid and fire prevention.        
	The Pratapaditya Road Tricone Park Barowari Durga Puja pandal, modelled on a white temple by artisans from Midnapore, looked pristine but fell short on the True Spirit parameters.        
	South End Club left pedestrians and vehicles fighting for the right of way. Samaj Sebi Sangha made innovative use of solar panels to illuminate the area.        
	Mudiali Club has closed-circuit television cameras and a well-stocked first-aid counter and an ambulance on stand-by. The earnestness of the organisers showed in smoke detector alarms, water filters and public insurance up to Rs 5 lakh in case of a mishap. Twelve feet wide gates allowed easy movement.        
	Kidderpore-Alipore        
	The theme at Kidderpore Pally Saradiya is Mahamaya, who has no form. The theme maker has tried to capture a sense of illusion. But dirty toilets, a first-aid box with only the most basic medicines, no emergency numbers on display and other such lapses bring the visitor back to reality quickly.                    74 Palli Sarbojanin    
	The pandal of Nabarag in Kidderpore looks like a beautiful old Calcutta house. The theme is inspired by three poets  Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Rangalal Bandyopadhyay and Hemchandra Bandyopadhyay.        
	What the puja gained in aesthetics, it lost in the absence of basic amenities. The womens toilet was just a plywood enclosure, the drinking water source a leaking tap attached to a dirty roadside metal tank and the wheelchairs the organisers had arranged for the elderly could not be found.         
	At Kidderpore Milan Sangha, the first-aid counter did not have medicines. There was no water purifier despite a sign announcing its presence.        
	The village puja theme of 25 Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsav Samiti came alive with lots of colourful dcor. Diyas along the walls and a thatched roof complete the look.        
	Enough sand buckets and fire extinguishers were scattered around the pandal. There were also toilets, a first-aid kit, basic medical instruments and paramedics.        
	Nearby, 74 Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsav Kidderpore made a good first impression. There was a No Smoking sign, sand buckets and fire extinguishers along with a step-by-step guide spelling out what to do in case of a fire. But there was no drinking water.         
	At New Alipore Young Mens Association, men and women from the area sat around chatting. The idol is traditional. There was an ambulance, a wheelchair and a first-aid box. Toilets and drinking water were easily accessible.         
	The Sahapur Sarbojanin pandal is modelled on a pagoda. Its toilets were not satisfactory, the drinking water source questionable and the first-aid box empty. Sahapur Bijoy Sangha did not fare much better.                     Tridhara Sammilani    
	The first thing that caught the eye at New Alipore Sarbojanin Durgotsab was the sabeki idol and the pandal made of hogla leaves.        
	The committee lost points for the absence of a helpdesk with emergency numbers, drinking water and first-aid.        
	The premises of the New Alipore Hindustan Club puja was green and peaceful. The toilets were clean and first-aid and drinking water easily available. But the area outside the pandal has been closed to traffic.         
	Basic amenities are missing at Chetla Sarbasadharaner Durgotsab. Ditto for 76 Pally Sarbojanin Durgotsab.         
	The theme of Bhawanipore Students Club Sarbojanin was interesting but the the facilities did not impress. The organisers, like in many other places, claimed that they had arranged for everything but the facilities were still not in place. Few had spared a thought for waste management. Waste bins are a rare sight.

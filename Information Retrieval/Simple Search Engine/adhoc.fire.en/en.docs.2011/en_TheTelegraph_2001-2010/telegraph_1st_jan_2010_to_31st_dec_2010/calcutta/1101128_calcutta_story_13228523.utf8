										      SILLY			 in the city                                    
	The art of conversation, I am happy to report, is alive and well in the local train. It is as nuanced, subtle, encoded, intimate and loud as it should be. I was on my way back from Malatipur in the North 24-Parganas, about one hour and 45 minutes by train from Sealdah. It was a Sunday evening and the train was very crowded. But I was not the only one who had found jumping on tough.         
	As the train left the station, a stout, middle-aged woman took over. She was being held back by another woman, but her voice was issuing forth, more powerful than the clattering wheels. She was castigating the men for crowding the entrance. The exchange, however, turned into the battle of the sexes. As she hurled the choicest Bengali expletives at the offenders, the men inside crouched in the safety of their seats sat up. They were excited.         
	Male solidarity is expressed in strange ways. One man whistled. One got up, gave the woman a standing ovation, wiped his seat with his handkerchief and sat down. One of them threw a paper dart at her. It missed her. But she would not have noticed, for she had found a particular enemy.         
	An old, bearded man had asked her to shut up because a woman shouldnt scream. At which she wanted to descend on him bodily, when the other woman began to drag her away, but the former wouldnt leave without a promise: Ai buro, ek taane tor daari-gonf upre phelbo (You old creature, I will yank off all the hair from your face)!         
	It was a moral dilemma that was felt pretty strongly now: when it was wrong conduct versus wrong decibel, prejudice versus violence, a bullying man versus a screaming woman, which side to take? I looked for blood on the floor.         
	A few more stations  Kankra Mirjanagar, Haroa Road, Bhasila, Lebutala  passed. A man sitting at a window in the last row began to address his friend sitting at the window diagonally opposite to him, in the first row. The words sailed over many heads.         
	What have you got for tiffin? asked the first man.         
	I cannot tell you, answered his friend.         
	Why?         
	Because it would embarrass your boudi.         
	Why?         
	Because if I say what it is, what will all these people think?         
	Bujechhi, the questioner smiled in complicity. You dont have to say a word more.         
	At Barasat station there was an uproar. Someone had fallen off the train: there was a collective gasp, but most couldnt see what had happened. The man who had expressed his curiosity about the tiffin was curious again.         
	What happened? he asked his friend, who could have witnessed the fall.        
	It was a young woman, the friend answered.         
	What? the questioner wanted the words to be repeated.         
	It was a young woman         
	Ok. Married or unmarried?         
	Unmarried.         
	Ok. That settled it. The questioner, satisfied, turned his face away and looked into the darkness outside.       [+uc('Chandrima S.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata in idol hub protest
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mamata in idol hub protest

	Property owners in Kumartuli opposed to the ongoing renovation project are banking on Mamata Banerjee to buttress their cause.         
	A large picture of the Trinamul Congress chief has been put up on the wooden platform on which the protesters, under the banner of Kumartuli Unnayan O Adhikar Rakkha Committee, have been on a dharna for 86 days. They also contacted party leaders who have promised to take up the matter.         
	The protesters are unhappy that the renovation was planned in consultation with only the two idol-makers associations, dominated by tenants. The compensation offered is also inadequate, feel the protesting property owners, some of whom are also members of the idol-makers associations.         
	There are about 140 property owners in Kumartuli but the CMDA only took the permission of the tenants before starting the project, said Apurba Paul, who owns a house in Kumartuli Block B. He did not allow his workshop in Block C to be pulled down.        
	We do not have a document stating who will get what after the renovation. Both owners and tenants will become leaseholders once the project is completed. From the owner of a property, we will be reduced to a leasedholder of a flat, said Partha Dey, a Kumartuli resident who runs a consultancy.         
	According to the CMDA plan, all residents whether they are tenants or owners, will receive a flat each. Property owners will get another flat as compensation.        
	A protester pointed that under the arrangement, a property owner who did not live in Kumartuli but owned a property there would get one flat but those who live in their own houses in the area would get two flats.         
	Babu Pal, the joint secretary of idol-makers association Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity, said: Nemai Pal, the president of our association, Mintu Pal, the other joint secretary, and I are all property owners in Kumartuli. But we recognise the need for renovation. The protesters dont want to become lease-holders. They already have the list of what they would get when the project is implemented.        
	The committee has moved the high court against the CMDA and the thika authorities. But why the photograph of Mamata? We heard her say in an interview that the owners will be given the right to develop their property. Since that is what we are also asking for, we have put up her photograph, said Dey.         
	The protesters are confident that they will get the support of the two local councillors and MP Sudip Bandopadhyay, all owing allegiance to Trinamul.        
	They had approached me to take up their problems with Sudip Bandopadhyay, but I have not met them formally. From what I know, their demands are justified, said Partha Mitra, the councillor of ward 8.         
	Bandopadhyay said: They had approached me but since I am in Delhi, I could not sit with them for a discussion. However, Ill definitely look into the matter once I return to Calcutta.        
	He added that MLAs Tarak Bandopadhyay and Sadhan Pandey had been part of the discussions. Renovation is important, but the state government should be transparent with the people involved. Time is also vital. If the renovation is not carried out on time, the central funds that have been allotted will be withdrawn.

                Calcutta Universitys BCom (general) Part I (2+1) and II (1+1+1) exams will start on June 5, instead of May 31 as announced earlier. The BCom (honours) Part I exams under both 2+1 and 1+1+1 systems will start on June 12, instead of June 2. A university release said the exams had been deferred because of unavoidable reasons.     The decomposed body of a 53-year-old widow was found in her first-floor flat on RN Guha Road in Dum Dum on Thursday morning. Police said Tapati Senguptas hands were tied behind her back and there were no marks of injury on the body. It seems she had been strangled, said an investigating officer. The flat, where the woman had been living alone, was unlocked and there was no sign of it being ransacked. Police said Tapati had taken voluntary retirement from a private company after her husbands death two years ago. The couple were childless.    SSKM Hospital has introduced a red card for relatives of patients who the authorities may need to contact during an emergency. The process of issuing the red cards to various departments was wrapped up on Thursday. It will take about a week to implement the system, said hospital superintendent Debashis Bhattacharya. The hospital now issues only green cards that allows relatives to stay at the bedside of critically ill patients round-the-clock. The new system is being introduced as part of the measures to step up security on the premises following the recent assault on six doctors by relatives of a patient.    The National Library Employees Association organised a sit-in at Bhasa Bhavan for four hours on Thursday demanding child-care leave with pay for women employees, abolition of the upper-age limit while appointing people on compensatory ground and filling up of vacant posts.    A 50-year-old trader from Paradip in Orissa was found dead in a Burrabazar hotel on Thursday afternoon. Police said Akshay Kumar Swain had suffered a cardiac arrest.    Ashish Bhowmick, 23, surrendered at Thakurpukur police station early on Thursday saying he had allegedly killed elder brother Ashok and dumped his body in a drain. The body was found in the Sarkar Haat area.    A drunk 35-year-old man fell on the Metro Railway tracks at Girish Park station on Thursday evening. Pointman Pannalal Kandar got down on the tracks and pulled the man to safety. A Metro official ruled out a suicide attempt since a train was not entering the station when the incident occurred.

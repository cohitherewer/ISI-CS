The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drizzle link to Celsius rise
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Drizzle link to Celsius rise
          A STAFF REPORTER                      The satellite image on Wednesday afternoon shows cloud cover on   South Bengal                          
	The sudden formation of a cloud cover over south Bengal caused a drizzle in the city and its neighbourhood on Wednesday, prompting the weatherman to forecast light showers and a rise in temperature for the rest of the week.        
	The moisture-laden winds from the south are adding a lot of extra moisture to the atmosphere, resulting in a drizzle or light showers and pushing the mercury up, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in New Delhi.        
	Meteorologists expect a slight rise in maximum temperatures over the Indo-Gangetic plains from Thursday and scattered rainfall all over the east in the next two days.        
	The minimum temperature on Wednesday was two degrees below normal at 11.6 degrees Celsius, but that is expected to rise to around 15 degrees Celsius on Thursday.        
	The wind flow from the south is also in conflict with the cold, dry northwesterlies, which drag the temperature down at this time of the year.        
	The wind from the south is hindering the free play of northwesterlies over south Bengal. As a result, temperatures will not climb down for 48 hours or so. The city and its neighbourhood, however, would be sufficiently cool and wet, said a senior scientist from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	The incursion of abundant moisture from the Bay of Bengal has resulted in the cloud cover and the present conditions, which favour light showers and deter a drop in mercury.        
	The moisture-laden winds are being strengthened by the presence of an active western disturbance in the area.        
	The Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore spoke of a cloudy Thursday with even a few spells of light rain.        
	Meteorologists also warned of foggy conditions, to go with the cloud cover, across the Indo-Gangetic plains, that could disrupt flight schedules.        
	According to the IMD, the mercury might dip from the weekend, with the weakening of the moisture-laden wind flow allowing free passage to northwesterlies.        
	So can Calcutta still take a crack at the 10-degree mark? It is still a possibility. The minimum temperature is very likely to drop next week, said the senior scientist at the Noida centre.

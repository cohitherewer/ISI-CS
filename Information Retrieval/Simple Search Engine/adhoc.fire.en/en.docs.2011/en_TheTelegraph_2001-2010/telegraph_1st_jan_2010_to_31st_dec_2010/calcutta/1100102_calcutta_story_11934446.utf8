The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crack the party code
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Crack the party code
          METRO WENT TRENDSPOTTING ALL NIGHT LONG AS THE CITY WELCOMED 2010                                            
	Skin not in: Dare to bare? That was left mainly to the belly dancers on the last night of 2009 with the ladies choosing to play it safe. (The gentlemen of course were left with little leeway because of the club rules.)        
	There were some belles who still braved the cold and flashed skin, but they were the exception and not the rule. Even for those who had shunned the woollens to beat the chill on Christmas Eve, cover-up was the code on New Years Eve.        
	Smart jackets, cardigans and stoles were here, there and everywhere. Halter-backs were demurely covered by pashminas, revealing party tops played peek-a-boo from under matching cardigans.        
	I think the chill factor and the open-air venues prompted people to dress the way they did, said Piyali Chatterjee, a Tolly regular who spotted only one girl wearing a super short off-shoulder number.              
	Leg glance: Pair stockings with short dresses and skirts, designer Dev had suggested while drawing up the New Years Eve dress code in Metro on the morning of 31st.        
	And the women at the social clubs did just that. Legs were hardly left bare. Black was the chosen colour for the stockings, but there were greys and wacky purples too.        
	More than a style statement, it is to protect myself from the cold. But I do like stockings and have them in many colours and patterns, said Mumtaz Sorcar, magician P.C. Sorcars daughter.        
	If not stockings, it was leggings for the ladies. Or calf-length boots.              
	Bhangra meets Bolly: Singh was king on the dance floor. Retro pop was a draw, from Elvis to Abba, but there was no beating bhangra-meets-Bolly.        
	From Singh is Kinng to Desi Girl, Gur Naal Ishq Meetha to Sukhbirs Ishq, Daler Mehndis Bolo tara rara to Mauja hi mauja. I got requests for Ishq even before I took over the console. Ahun ahun from Love Aaj Kal also got a really good response, said DJ Ravi at CC amp;FC.        
	The B amp;B combo is the surest way to get people on the dance floor, added DJ Hussain at RCGC, who spun Chak de phatte, Kala chashma and more.              
	We are family: If friends are party-mates for 364 days, the last night of the year seemed reserved for the family.        
	Partying with family is so much fun, especially when you cant decide which group of friends you want to go out with! summed up one teenaged reveller.        
	From Swabhumi to Space Circle, cousins came clubbing together to usher in 2010. Teenagers turned up with parents and uncles. A grandfather playing Santa to his four-year-old grandson was also spotted. At Calcutta Club, in particular, GenEx partied hard with GenX.              
	Night of PDA: Yesterdays peck on the cheek as the clock struck 12 is todays kiss. Yesterdays exception of the close dance is todays rule. Clearly, public display of affection is part of the 31st Nite party package.        
	From oh-so-cute oldies to first-date teenagers, PDA came naturally to Calcuttas party people all through Thursday night.              
	Whisky the winner: Rum is always popular among party-goers in Calcutta and wine is fast catching on. But whisky was the clear winner on the long night bridging 2009 and 2010.        
	Whisky was the drink enjoying maximum demand at the 31st Nite parties, confirmed Kaushik Chatterjee of United Spirits Limited.        
	Say cheers to 2010!  
	ONE CHANGE I WANT IN CALCUTTA 2010              Prosenjit: Calcutta rsquo;s bandh culture to end forever; a ceasework is not the way to achieve anything. Also, pollution levels to come down.                
	Rituparna Sengupta: A greener Calcutta. And less traffic hazards.                Raima Sen: More people to go to the theatres and more good films to be made. Also, the city rsquo;s roads and traffic to improve.                
	Koel Mullick: Better roads; potholes should go.              
	Swastika Mukherjee: Parks meant only for children, where couples aren rsquo;t allowed to get cosy. It is impossible to take one rsquo;s kids to the parks now.

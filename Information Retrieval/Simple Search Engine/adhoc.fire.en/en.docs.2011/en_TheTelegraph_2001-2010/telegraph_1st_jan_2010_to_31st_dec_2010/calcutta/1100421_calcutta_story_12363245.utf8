The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | College girl in poll cauldron
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      College girl in poll cauldron
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          Zarina Aziz (Tamaghna Banerjee)                                  
	She goes to college, loves watching cartoons, adores Shahid Kapoor, becomes sad when the Kolkata Knight Riders lose a game and cant stop giggling if you ask her if she has a boyfriend.         
	But for residents of ward number 135 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Zarina a.k.a. Zubaria Aziz could soon go from being the giggly girl next door to the councillor whose door they would need to knock to get a problem solved.        
	At 21 years and four months, Zarina is not only the youngest Left Front candidate in an election but also a pathbreaker in a conservative, Muslim-dominated Metiabruz locality where no girl has ever dared challenge the stereotype.         
	It helps that ward number 135 has been reserved for women this election. It helps that Zarinas father Azizul Haq is a former councillor and a Forward Bloc veteran. It helps that the CPI came looking for Zarina rather than she having to look for a ticket.        
	But ask Zarina and she insists that she is not contesting the May election just because the opportunity landed on her lap. I have always been interested in social work. I became involved with the Students Federation of India after I joined college. I now have the chance to make a difference to my community by ensuring that they get the civic amenities they are entitled to, the third-year student of Metiabruz Hari Mohan Ghosh College told Metro.        
	The Haqs have been residing at P222 Rameshwarpur Road since 1952 and in Metiabruz for over two centuries, according to Zarinas father. We are in the zari business but my heart has always been in politics. I am glad my daughter is following in my footsteps, said Azizul.        
	But does it matter to Metiabruz that a young girl still in college is aspiring to replace a veteran  Trinamul councillor Shamsuzzaman Ansari  with a 20-year unbeaten streak?        
	I think I have it in me to do it. I stepped out for a trial run of my campaign last Saturday and was surprised by the enthusiasm with which the people supported my candidature. They have seen me grow up; I can count on their blessings, said Zarina, who wears a burqa whenever she is out.         
	A young girl from the locality who didnt wish to be named said voting for Zarina would mean more than voting for a potentially efficient councillor. She is a girl, and she is Muslim. Its not everyday that you get a candidate you can identify with.         
	CPM leader Rabin Deb said the Left Front was happy to blood someone like Zarina. We have decided to promote more new faces. The Left Front has high expectations of Zarina.         
	Zarinas political idol is, however, from the Congress. I look up to Mausam Noor. If she could become an MP at 28, so can I, she said.        
	The second of Azizul Haqs three children, who will write her final exams on April 30, not only wants to emulate Mausams Lok Sabha victory but also become a lawyer like her.

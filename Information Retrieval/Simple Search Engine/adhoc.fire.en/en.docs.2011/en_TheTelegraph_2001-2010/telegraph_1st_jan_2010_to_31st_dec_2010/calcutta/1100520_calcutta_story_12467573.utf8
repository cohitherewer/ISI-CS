The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | System change blamed for poor scores
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      System change blamed for poor scores
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The centralised evaluation of answer scripts introduced for the ISC and ICSE exams this year has come under criticism, with most schools complaining of unexpectedly poor performance in English in both tests.        
	All categories of schools  from reputable Christian institutions to ones recently set up by private bodies  blamed the new evaluation system for the low scores in English. Council sources said a majority of students scored between 60 and 70 per cent in English in both ISC (Class XII) and ICSE (Class X) exams.        
	This is surprising as most students used to score 70-plus in English, said a council official.        
	The performance in the other subjects, however, is  by and large satisfactory.        
	In the new system  introduced to bring about a parity in marking and speed up the publication of results  the examiners are required to assess the scripts at designated places. Earlier, they were free to take the scripts home for evaluation.        
	The head a school where English scores have been unsatisfactory said: English examiners are overworked as they are too few compared with the number of scripts. While checking so many scripts at a stretch away from the comfort of home, they become too exhausted to focus on what the students have written.        
	Gilian Rosemary Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School, said she was extremely disappointed with the marks scored by her students in English. In my school, the Anglo-Indian students generally score more in English and less in Hindi (second language). I was surprised to find that the trend has reversed this year, said Hart, also the president of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools.        
	Terence Ireland, the principal of St James School, said: I cant rule out the fact that the new system could be responsible for low scores in English.... Each teacher had to mark a good number of answer scripts on a single day in this system.        
	At Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society School, 17 ISC examinees have scored more than 90 per cent in English.        
	Earlier, at least 30-35 students used to score 90-plus in the subject, said principal Dola Banerjee.        
	Echoing the heads view, a senior English teacher of a reputable south Calcutta school said: Initially, we were told that each of us would have to examine only 250 scripts. But finally we had to mark 380. It is impossible to do justice to each student if we are burdened with so many scripts.        
	Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive of the council, said he had not received any complaint about English scores but admitted that the number of examiners was too few compared with previous years.        
	Arathoon blamed the schools for the drop in the number of examiners, saying several institutions refused to send the required number of teachers to evaluation camps. We faced this problem across the country, he said.        
	According to Arathoon, the all-India pass percentage for ICSE is 98.31, up by 0.26 per cent from last year.         
	In plus-II, the pass percentage increased to 97.11, up by 0.03 from 2009.        
	The ICSE and ISC exams this year were conducted between March 3 and April 8.

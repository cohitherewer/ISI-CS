          RITH BASU                          NRS Medical College and Hospital was the only lifeline for ailing people like this woman on Monday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Accident victim Tapan Mandal groaned in pain as his relatives pleaded with attendants of other patients to let them jump the queue outside the emergency ward at NRS Medical College and Hospital on Monday.        
	Six hours have passed since the accident and he still hasnt received proper medical attention. We went to SSKM and then came here. Please understand, requested a man accompanying the Howrah resident.        
	The serpentine queue spontaneously parted to make way for Tapan to be stretchered in.        
	Gestures like these saved the day for the citys lone state-run medical college and hospital at work on Monday as a handful of doctors struggled to cope with a surge of patients turned away from the four other government facilities where junior doctors are on strike over lack of security.        
	On an average, around 425 patients are brought to the emergency ward over 24 hours. As many as 182 patients came for treatment in just four hours from noon on Monday. Nearly 60 of them required hospitalisation, said an official of the hospital.         
	The emergency ward of NRS resembled an outpatient department through the day with the queue of patients stretching well beyond the stairs of the building.         
	An ambulance would screech to a halt every few minutes, its siren screaming.        
	Ujjwal Mandal, 40, an electrician from Malda who fell off a ladder a week ago and fractured a leg, lay on a stretcher with his eyes shut, occasionally asking a relative when his turn would come. We had admitted him to Malda District Hospital but the doctors referred him to NRS after his condition deteriorated. He is in pain but we have no option but to wait, the relative said.        
	Apprehensive of a law-and-order problem if the crowd outside the emergency grew bigger, the hospital authorities called for extra police protection late in the afternoon.        
	Critical patients are being brought in every minute. We are trying our best but the situation may get out of hand any moment. Please send reinforcements, a senior official of the administrative wing was heard pleading over the phone.         
	A colleague revealed that the official had called Entally police station, which has an outpost on the premises, for additional deployment.        
	An assistant sub-inspector said that normally not more than six police personnel would be deployed at the hospital. Today, you will find cops all over, he added.        
	While medical services continued under strict security, junior doctors at NRS did wear black badges as a mark of solidarity with their counterparts in the other four state-run hospitals. We are discussing what our next course of action would be, said an intern on duty.        
	Those making a beeline for NRS would be hoping that isnt a strike.

                      Folk fiesta        In an attempt to revive the endangered world of fakirs, their songs and philosophy, percussionist Tanmoy Bose (picture along) brings to the fore a clutch of 10 wandering minstrels in tonight rsquo;s concert Sahaj Mantra. A programme of folk, classical, jazz and contemporary music, it will specially feature fakiri music like murshidi gaan, marfati gaan and bangla qawali. These traditional songs have unfortunately become obsolete in a world where music and entertainment go hand-in-hand with glitz and glamour; so much so, that hardly anything is done to patronise them. This being the maiden attempt at organising an event of this kind in the city, Bose intends to make the festival an annual affair. To add a different flavour to the fakirs rsquo; traditional form, he, along with his Taal Tantra mates, will jam with them. Though one section of the programme will be dedicated to songs performed in their raw form, fakirs will be encouraged to jam with other artistes to see what forms their music would take in contemporary times. Hosted in association with banglanatok.com, it marks the Indian launch of Tanmoy Bose rsquo;s Baul amp; Beyond, an album in which he has collaborated with baul as well as Western jazz and Blues artistes. To illustrate the relevance of fakiri music in modern times, Bangla band Chandrabindoo, US-based jazz band Jazmin and Anusheh Anadil from Bangladesh (who has also lent her voice to Bose rsquo;s album) will join the minstrels from the Bangladesh border dressed in their coloured robes.															
  Event: Launch of Tanmoy Boses music album Baul amp; Beyond along with a programme of traditional folk and modern music of Bengal When: Today 6.30 pm Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

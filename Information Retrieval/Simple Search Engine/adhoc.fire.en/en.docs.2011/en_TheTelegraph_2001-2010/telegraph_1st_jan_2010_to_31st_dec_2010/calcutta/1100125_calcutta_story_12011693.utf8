The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Election countdown on JU campus
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Election countdown on JU campus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University (JU) has turned into a beehive of political activity ahead of next months elections to the institutions administrative bodies  the court, executive council and the faculty council.        
	The elections are held every four years. The anti-Left lobbies have no representation in the administrative bodies for a decade but are confident of making inroads this time, riding the winds of change blowing across Bengal.        
	The pro-Left camp, particularly the CPM groups, is working overtime to sustain its record of making a clean sweep of all the JU seats in the past three elections.        
	There has not been a single anti-Left teacher in the court and executive council for nearly a decade. But the present political scenario is a pole apart from what it was four years ago. We are confident that many of our candidates will win this time, said a senior anti-Left teacher of the engineering faculty.        
	To turn the tide in its favour, the anti-Left teachers lobby is highlighting how the present administration has politicised the universitys recruitment policies and appointed less qualified candidates for political gains.        
	Most of the teachers recruited in the past 12 years are CPM sympathisers, alleged a teacher.        
	Teachers belonging to the Left lobby are stressing the advances made by JU during the Left regime. Our university has made a lot of progress during the Left rule. We will not allow the CPMs debacle in the Lok Sabha polls to impact our university elections, said a teacher of the engineering faculty belonging to the Left camp.         
	The JU court has 15 elected teacher representatives, of whom four constitute the executive council with at least one teacher from each of the three faculties  science, arts and engineering. Nearly 660 teachers comprise the electorate.        
	The pro-Left teachers are trying to retain the confidence of the voters by citing JUs success in bagging the centre of excellence tag from the Centre and the highest rating from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council.        
	We have already achieved the first phase of excellence. We will now have to develop further to achieve the second phase, which can only happen if the pro-Left candidates come back to power, said a member of the present executive council.        
	The JU court has three non-teaching staff members. Among them, two are elected to the executive council. At present there is no representation of anti-Left non-teaching members in the universitys court.

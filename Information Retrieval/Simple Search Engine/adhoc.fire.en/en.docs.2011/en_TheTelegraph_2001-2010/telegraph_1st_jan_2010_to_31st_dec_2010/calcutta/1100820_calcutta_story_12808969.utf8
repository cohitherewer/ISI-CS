The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech job pinch for Puja manpower
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tech job pinch for Puja manpower
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Elders have been doing most of the work to hold para pujas with youths busy at office                                  
	Shourya Sanyal, a 30-year-old IT manager based in Pune, was the life of his para puja. His duties ranged from collecting subscription from residents to co-ordinating with different groups to ensure that everyone was working in tandem.        
	But that was eight to nine years back, says Shourya, who grew up in New Alipore. Once he got a job, free time became rare.        
	I was working in shifts for almost 10 hours a day. There was no time to organise the para puja. After a year, I left the city and thus ended my association with Puja.         
	Shourya is not an exception. He is part of a growing breed of IT professionals from Calcutta who were actively involved in organising pujas in their locality before they either became too busy to do so or moved to another city.        
	Participation of the youth in Puja has gone down steadily over the past five years and the reason is information technology and related jobs. Many boys keep going abroad on assignments. Others are posted elsewhere in the country, says Neelanjan Deb, who runs a business and is involved with the Deshapriya Park puja.         
	Sibsankar Basu of the Maddox Square puja agrees. He understands the youths predicament. They want to help and try to get ads for the puja but just dont have the time to be physically involved. Studies have become so competitive and then work takes over. We had more time for para activities, he says.         
	Those in their teens or early-20s still collect chanda or do odd jobs for their local puja. But the bulk of the responsibility is shouldered by those in their 50s or 60s. Those between 25 and 35 are conspicuous by their absence.         
	IT gave Bengali boys their first taste of good money. As a result they tend to take their jobs very seriously and spend a lot of time at work, Basu says.         
	Salt Lake residents feel the pinch even more. The township is almost like an old-age home, says Santanu Biswas, who is associated with the FD Block puja. This year, the elders in the block have specifically asked the youth to help out with the preparation.         
	At the College Square puja, too, the focus is on youth participation. How else can we carry on with our puja? This year we are seeing better participation from the youth than in the past few years, says Badal Bhattacharjee, who is associated with the puja.         
	But for every young man who is putting up his hand, many others are moving away. Earlier, at least one member of every family would be a part of the puja organisation. Thats not the case anymore, rues Manoj Shaw of the Mudiali puja committee.        
	For some young men, Puja is not fun anymore. No, I dont miss being part of Puja. I dont like crowds anymore. I guess I have just outgrown the entire thing, says Shourya.         
	If the trend continues, Deb feels the day is not far when organisers will have to hire event managers to hold para pujas.

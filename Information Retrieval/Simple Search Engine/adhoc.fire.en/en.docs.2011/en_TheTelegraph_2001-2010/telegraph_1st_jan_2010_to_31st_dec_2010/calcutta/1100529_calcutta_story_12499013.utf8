	Almost the entire Ahmed clan at 6 Ahmed Ali Road, off Ripon Street, had squeezed into two taxis to reach Howrah station on Thursday night to see off six members of the family going on a holiday to Mumbai.        
	Little did they know that it would be the final farewell for four out of the six who had boarded the Howrah-Kurla Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Jnaneswari Super Deluxe Express at 10.55pm.         
	How can a family be wiped out just like that? We were all so happy last night and now this, cried Sima Iqbal, whose twin nieces Shireen and Samrin, 6, and their parents Sabiya and Syed Javed Alam died in the train tragedy not far from Kharagpur.        
	Family members said teachers Javed Alam, 35, and Sabiya, 30, had timed the holiday with their twins summer vacation.        
	The trip was to have been the familys first big vacation since the girls, students of Jewish Girls School on Park Street, were born.        
	They were supposed to stay with our elder sister Asma Hanim, who is settled in Mumbai, said Sabiyas brother Iqbal Ahmed.        
	The only two survivors were the elderly relatives accompanying the family  Sabiyas mother Mehsar Jahan, 60, and Javed Alams elder sister Zohar Jahan, who is the principal of the Topsia school where the couple used to teach.        
	As soon as news about the tragedy reached 6 Ahmed Ali Road early in the morning, a group of relatives set out for Midnapore praying for a miracle even as other members frantically dialled railway helplines for information.         
	We still havent been able to get through, the helplines are perpetually engaged. We still dont know in which hospital ward my mother Mehsar and my brother-in-laws sister are being kept, Iqbal told Metro late in the afternoon.        
	In Midnapore, relatives allegedly faced problems completing the formalities for claiming the bodies as well as locating the two elderly survivors.                    
	 Till afternoon, there was a faint hope that my nieces would be rescued alive. But that was not to be. We now want custody of their bodies quickly, but the queue for post-mortem is long. I am told the authorities are not making it any easier for those who have lost their loved ones, complained Iqbal.        
	Tragedy also struck another home at Paldaha, on the southern fringes of the city. Bablu Halder, 30, and relative Dhananjay Halder, 25, died in the train mishap, but his wife Ranjana, 27, and daughters Riya, 3, and Tiya, just six months old, survived.         
	Bablus younger brother Shankar is missing.         
	The Halder brothers, both jewellery artisans in a Mumbai shop, were returning from a trip home to meet their parents.         
	They were here for a month and the house was so full of life. They performed Satyanarayan puja on Thursday before they leftWas it because my sons knew they would never return? wailed mother Bimala, 50.

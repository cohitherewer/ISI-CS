                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Realty foray for city-based firm
          SUBHRO SAHA                              
	The city-based Emami Group of Companies, with core competence in personal and healthcare consumer products and FMCG (fast moving consumer goods), is making a foray into the real estate segment, hoping to cash in on fresh buoyancy in the brick-and-mortar domain.        
	We are looking at investment in property and valuation thereof in a band of Rs 4,000 to 8,000 crore across the country over the next five years. The thrust will be on the residential segment, R.S. Agarwal, the joint chairman, Emami Group of Companies, told Metro.        
	The group is in the process of formalising its joint-sector housing outfit with the West Bengal Housing Board, and is preparing to roll out 6.5 million sq ft of built space by 2015, the cross-subsidy model alone accounting for 4 million sq ft.        
	We will develop a 1 million-sq ft project in Rajarhat comprising LIG, MIG and HIG apartments with Hafeez Contractor as our architect, and another 1.9 million sq ft housing complex on Jessore Road, said Rajesh Bagaria, the managing director of Bengal Emami Housing Ltd.        
	Emami Realty, the real estate arm of the group, which is already part of large-scale consortium projects in the city like South City, Rosedale and the forthcoming upscale Urbana, is ramping up its presence in the high-end condo segment and commercial real estate.        
	A large-format mass-housing project is coming up on Mumbai Road, while two IT parks planned in Sector V and the Rajarhat IT corridor, with a combined leasable space of 500,000 sq ft.        
	The group  also having interest in paper and newsprint, writing instruments, edible oils, bio-diesel and contemporary arts, and with a current market cap of Rs 7,000 crore  is scaling up its pan-India presence in real estate, with a clutch of high-end residential projects lined up in various cities.        
	We are doing a Rs 2,000-crore, 1 million-sq ft condo complex in Mumbai and high-end residential projects in Hyderabad and Coimbatore. We are also developing a 1 million-sq ft mixed-use project in Adityapur and have a 375-acre land bank in Jhansi, added Girija Choudhary, the CFO of Emami Realty.        
	The Emami Group, which is pondering a public issue, is also scaling up its presence in healthcare, lining up investment of Rs 2,000-3,000 crore in the next five years, including its upcoming mother-and-child hospital in Mukundapur, off the Bypass.        
	We want to open around 200 outlets of Frank Ross, our pharmacy retail chain, which would make it the biggest in the country, stressed Agarwal.        
	The pharmacy chain currently has 70 outlets operational. Starmark, the books-music-gifts combo retail format from the Emami stable, is also on expansion mode, recently unveiling a store in Mani Square mall.

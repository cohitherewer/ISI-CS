          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Dipak Jain, a former dean of the Kellogg School of Management and the next dean of INSEAD business school, will conduct a workshop on marketing needs for the nanosecond customer at GuruSpeak 2010 on December 19.        
	The annual event, the biggest in the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta Alumni Association calendar, is being organised along with The Telegraph.        
	This year GuruSpeak is of special significance, as it happens to be one of the flag-off events of the golden jubilee celebrations of IIM Calcutta, said Anirban Datta, the chief facilitator of GuruSpeak.        
	Jain is passionate about propagating redefined wisdom in marketing and strategy for redefined customers in redefined times, his subject for our workshop this year, added Datta.         
	The workshop will deal with how one can achieve marketing leadership and sustain strategic competitive edge in a global arena where the customers dictate terms of their purchases by eliminating the middle person in key decisions, such as buying airline tickets, making hotel reservations or even finding a job.        
	GuruSpeak 2010 will begin at 9.30am on December 19 at the Taj Bengal. More than 200 business icons and students will participate in the workshop, titled Marketing 2.0 New Age Wisdom for the Nanosecond Customer.

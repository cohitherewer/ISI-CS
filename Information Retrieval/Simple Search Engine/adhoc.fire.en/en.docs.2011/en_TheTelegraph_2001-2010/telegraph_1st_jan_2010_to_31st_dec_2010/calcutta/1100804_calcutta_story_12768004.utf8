The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Armenian kids call off strike
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Armenian kids call off strike
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Students staying in the citys Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy called off their two-day-old hunger strike on Tuesday after getting word from Armenia that their problems would be looked into.         
	Thirty-five of the 80 students of Armenian origin staying on the Free School Street premises had refused food since Monday morning to protest the alleged high-handedness of the authorities.         
	The students said their parents had met the church authorities in Armenia and had been assured of action in the matter. We are lifting the strike and waiting to see how the authorities respond, one of the boys said. A representative of His Holiness will come here from Armenia on Wednesday to look into the situation, said another.        
	The students have alleged that they were being forced to study in second-rate institutions as the management was not funding their education properly. The college runs a free school for Armenian children up to Class X and also funds the college education of students from the community.        
	Some elders in the community are supporting the students cause. The college has been gradually deteriorating. There were cuts in the provisions for clothes, basic necessities and nutrition. Large amounts were spent on unnecessary renovation and repairs, said Sonia John, a former honorary manager of the college and former chairperson of the Armenian church committee (Armenian Holy Church of Nazareth).         
	Father Khoren Hovhannisyan, the manager of the college and pastor of the Armenians in India, had been defrocked but forgiven and then sent to India to prove his worth as the manager, said John.         
	I had left a corpus of Rs 26.5 crore when I left in 2005. The church earns huge sums from legacies left by wealthy Armenians. From Sir Catchick Paul Chaters legacy, the church earns Rs 14 crore every year, she said.         
	But this wealth was not being used to help the students who come from Armenia, Iran and Iraq, John felt.

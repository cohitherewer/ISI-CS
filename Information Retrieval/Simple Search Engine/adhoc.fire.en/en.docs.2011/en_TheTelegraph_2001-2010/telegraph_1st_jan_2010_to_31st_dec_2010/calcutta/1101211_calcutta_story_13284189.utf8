The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salt Lake rally was a load of rubbish
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Salt Lake rally was a load of rubbish
          OUR BUREAU                                        Garbage being removed from the site in Salt Lake where the Trinamul  Congress held a rally on Thursday. Picture by Tamaghna Banerjee      
	A clean-up operation by 100 conservancy workers over nine hours restored a semblance of normality in rally-ravaged Salt Lake the day after Trinamul Congress protesters dumped 30 quintals of rubbish on a tiny part of the township in barely four hours.        
	Municipality officials admitted that the sheer volume of the waste generated by a gathering of 25,000 spread across an area less than one per cent of Salt Lake was unlike anything they had seen during any previous congregation.        
	We have already sent 10 vans full of waste to the garbage dump. Several more trips will be required to clean up this entire area, conservancy department worker Uttam Mondal, deployed on the road in front of AMRI Hospitals, told Metro around 12.40pm.        
	On an average, Salt Lake generates around 120 quintals of waste every day. So when 25,000-odd people concentrated in a small area (0.0048 per cent of the 33.5sqkm township) produce one-fourth the garbage collected in the whole of Salt Lake in a day, you know that it was one big party in the name of a rally, said a senior official of the Bidhannagar municipality, ironically run by Trinamul.        
	When Metro surveyed the rally zone on Friday morning, the broom brigade was barely halfway through the mammoth task. They had started work on Thursday evening and continued till midnight, taking a break for a few hours before returning to resume work early on Friday.        
	Apart from biryani packets, tea cups, paper plates and leaflets, the workers found the area littered with branches of roadside trees that had been chopped off to ensure that the three-tier dais wasnt out of view from any angle.        
	We used 80 workers supplied by contractors, besides municipal employees, said a civic body official.        
	A part of the accumulated rubbish was dumped on an empty plot beside the AMRI hospital. The rest were taken in vans to the dumping ground of Bidhannagar municipality in Sector V.        
	The dais built on iron poles was dismantled by 8am.         
	 Our men had to work really hard to make this look like Salt Lake again, said Tapan Ballav, one of the three contractors engaged by the municipality to clear the mess.        
	But will Salt Lake be spared more such invasions?         
	Sculptor Bipin Goswami, who lives in neighbouring IB Block, appealed to politicians not to turn Salt Lake into a rally zone.         
	Dhrubanath Aich, a resident of GD Block, said Salt Lakes problems may have just begun. With the Assembly elections a few months away, I fear we will be subjected to more rallies, he added.        
	Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua, who lives in FD Block, said: People here are educated and aware. You dont need boisterous political meetings to drive home a message. What is being said on stage wouldnt influence anyones vote.         
	Returning home from tuition classes, Class VI student Trina Ghosh also had a message for the litter-happy rally brigade. Our teachers have taught us not to litter. But the grown-ups are perhaps unaware of it. Shame!

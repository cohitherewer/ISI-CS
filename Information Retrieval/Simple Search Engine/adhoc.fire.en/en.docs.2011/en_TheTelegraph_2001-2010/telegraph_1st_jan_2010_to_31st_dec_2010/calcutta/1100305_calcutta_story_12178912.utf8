The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Landfill jheel to be fenced
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Landfill jheel to be fenced
          JAYANTA BASU                          Metro report on landfill                                   
	The entire Bikramgarh Jheel, whatever is left of the once sprawling water body off South City, will be fenced to prevent further encroachment.        
	The decision was taken on Friday at a meeting at Writers Buildings, attended by PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and mayoral council member Sushil Sharma.        
	Metro had on February 23 published a report (see picture) highlighting how the jheel had shrunk from 100 bighas to 20 bighas, thanks to indiscriminate and illegal landfill.        
	Work on the fence will start within three weeks. Once it is through, we will revamp the water body and remove encroachments, said Sharma.        
	The CMDA has decided to lay a road to the south of the jheel, parallel to an existing road. Once the CMDA readies the roads alignment, government agencies will make available the required land after clearing encroachments on the banks of the water body, said an official.        
	In May 2006, the PN Roy committee had suggested that the jheel be fenced in an attempt to save it from landsharks. Its good that the proposal will finally be implemented, said an environment expert.

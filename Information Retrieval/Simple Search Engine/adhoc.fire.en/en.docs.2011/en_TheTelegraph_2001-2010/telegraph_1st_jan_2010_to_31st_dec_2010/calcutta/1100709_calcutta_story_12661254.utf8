The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stop-work on pond kill
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stop-work on pond kill
  - Experts warn of flooding on top and depletion below          JAYANTA BASU                                    
	The Calcutta Improvement Trust has stopped work on a pond-fill project on Golf Club Road a day after defending it and denying the existence of a water body in the area.        
	Metro, which had on Wednesday witnessed a green activist being thrashed in daylight in the middle of a road for opposing the project, has seen the Calcutta Municipal Corporation map that confirms the existence of the water body between 14 and 17A Golf Club Road.         
	The CIT wants to resettle residents of an adjoining slum on the filled-up pond.        
	Until we get a formal clearance, there will be no work on the project, its secretary J.K. Sadhukhan said on Thursday. We will soon submit a report to the higher authorities, he added.        
	Green experts have pressed the alarm bell, saying the impact of the fill-up could be disastrous in an area already on the civic map as one of the poorest in terms of ground water level. It could also affect drainage and lead to water logging.        
	There are several other environmental impacts (of a fill-up like this): a huge amount of biodiversity will be lost. Not to mention the relief the space provides amid the concrete jungle, said Mohit Roy of the NGO Basundhara, an expert on water bodies.        
	The pond the CIT stands accused of filling up illegally may be one of the last remaining in an area that had a vast stretch of water body only a decade ago. Ironically, much of the systematic destruction of the wetlands was carried out by government agencies.         
	The CIT has been the leader in the fill-up, alleged Roy. Some of its projects, he added, could well have been avoided. A few hundred metres from the present fill-up site, a road was needlessly built through a water body, almost killing it off.         
	The CIT built houses earlier on what used to be water bodies. Roy sniffs the involvement of vested interests in such official fill-up.        
	In the mid-90s, so much of this area was a water body. It was filled up gradually, rued Sudip Banerjee, a former state pollution control board chairman who lives in the area.        
	CMC records paint a grim picture across the city. Over 1,000 water bodies have been destroyed in the past 10 years. As the authorities sleep  or feign sleep  sharks nibble at the lakes. The Bikramgarh Jheel, spread over 60 acres in 1979, is only about 40 acres now.

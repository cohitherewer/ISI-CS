The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gowda spies a wave
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Gowda spies a wave

	Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda claimed on Friday morning that Jyoti Basu had waved at him when he went to see him at hospital.        
	The comment created confusion about the former chief ministers condition, prompting CPM state secretary Biman Bose to clarify that he had not received any such report from the hospital.        
	Doctors, too, later told Metro that it was clinically impossible for Basu, on ventilator since early Wednesday, to respond to or wave at someone.         
	He was sedated when put on ventilator and is yet to come out of sedation, said a doctor treating Basu. The doctors, however, said that Basu might have felt pain and moved his hand, which Deve Gowda mistook as a wave.        
	Jyotibabus senses are partially active. He is reacting to pain by moving his limbs, said a doctor.         
	Deve Gowda also said he owed his prime ministership to Basu. He sacrificed the post which is why I got the opportunity to serve the country as Prime Minister (in 1996-97).        
	Basu would have taken exception to the comment because it was the party that came in the way of his becoming Prime Minister. The then Bengal chief minister was so annoyed with the partys decision that he later called it a historic blunder.        
	Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and Meghalaya chief minister D.D. Lapang were among those who turned up at the hospital to enquire after Basu.

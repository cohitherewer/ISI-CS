          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Clear skies and low humidity helped lower the minimum temperature by nearly four degrees Celsius on Friday. The weekend is likely to be cool and comfortable, said the weatherman.         
	The movement of an anti-cyclonic circulation  responsible for the cloud cover and rain on Wednesday that almost spoilt Indias chances against South Africa at the Eden Gardens  away from the city cleared the skies and allowed the mercury to drop, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Alipore regional meteorological centre.         
	The minimum temperature, which was three to four degrees above normal for five consecutive days from Sunday, dropped back to the normal level of 17.4 degrees Celsius on Friday. The minimum humidity dropped to 36 per cent.

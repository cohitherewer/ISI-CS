                A CISF jawan died on the airport premises on Tuesday after being hit by a truck. Anil Kumar Gorai, 58, was returning home after duty around 1.15pm on his motorcycle when he was knocked down near Gate No. 4 of the airport, police said. The Purulia resident died on the spot. The truck was seized but the driver fled, said an officer.     A 27-year-old chemist, who worked in a pharmaceutical firm in Salt Lake, was found hanging in his rented flat in Kestopur on the northern fringes on Tuesday. Police said Anja Ailu, who hails from Andhra Pradesh, was living in Calcutta for the past few years. No suicide note was found. An officer said neighbours called the cops after seeing Ailus door locked even at 11am.     A fire broke out at 3am on Tuesday at a polymer factory-cum-godown on Canal East Road. Officials said the fire originated on the ground floor of the three-storeyed building and it took 13 tenders four hours to douse the flames. No injuries were reported. The officials said fire safety rules had not been followed in the building. The cause of fire and the extent of damage are yet to be ascertained.    The parents of a 15-year-old girl, who went missing on January 23 from her Baruipur home, lodged a complaint on Wednesday alleging that their daughter, Meera Mondal, had been kidnapped. Police said the Mondals alleged that Meera, a Class IX student in a nearby school, was kidnapped by a local youth. The family has not received any ransom call.    Three abandoned boxes with Chinese words inscribed on them triggered a bomb scare at the airport on Tuesday evening. CISF personnel called bomb disposal squad officials, who took the boxes away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 10 ages of the ad child
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      10 ages of the ad child
										      AUTUMN FLUSH                        Spoilt brat: Dudley Dursleys parents look at him admiringly in a Harry Potter movie				                           
	At the start of his/her life Dedicated Yuppie Parents think their child is the most intelligent and beautiful baby in the world. S/he learns quickly to say Daddy! and then banana. After an initial raspberry blown in the direction of the DYP s/he even has a shy at saying Czechoslovakia when DYP has decided to be satisfied with banana bola tha!        
	This parrot child might grow up into one of several unlovable kids:         
	1. His adoring mother says he only eats c for chow mien to which she then adds a chemical supplement.         
	2. He listens to his DYPs rowing about whose son he is and claims to be the son of a neighbour who breaks windowpanes with his sixers. With parents like his I would also choose Malhotra Uncle for a parent.        
	3. The same child mischievously manipulates his parents into another row about whose responsibility he is by telling them he only got 2 A pluses when actually (of course) he had got them all.         
	4. A cute girl onstage in army uniform cant remember two lines of a poem (the lyrics of an insurance ad about self-reliance) and has to be prompted by her father from the rear aisle. I think she definitely needs that insurance policy.        
	5. A schoolgoing boy brags about a bua in London while the other claims he has just returned from a holiday there. Neither of them really needs London since the mobile for this kind of snob is a swadeshi product. They are surely the same kind of boys who would hate to share their tomato sauce or their potato wafers or their biscuits with their friends.        
	6. This one swaggers around a car showroom with an obsequious shop attendant in tow while he books cars in advance for his 18th birthday and when I become CEO. Like Sri Ramkrishna one wants to say aage saap hobe na byang hobe tai dekho...         
	7. S/he goes on to a need for fairness creams in adolescence and young adulthood. Fairness cream ads should come with a statutory warning. In their own way they are as pernicious as the ones for cigarettes and booze. They discourage people from living in the skin they were born with.        
	8. Cuteness continues into young adulthood. In a series of mobile phone ads featuring a rising film star, the young man uses talk time on his mobile phone to manipulate people. When his girlfriend catches him fantasising about size zero models he sings koi haseena jab ruth jaati hai toh.. to make her believe she is even more beautiful than they. He pretends to have read cutting edge scientific articles by his principal when all he really wants is permission to organise a fest. He cons his own dad into sending him more money by sulking a wee bit.        
	9. A loving older brother buys a motorbike to show his appreciation of the younger ones brilliant results at an examination. He trills Mere Bhai ke liye while he rides home on it, receiving admiring glances all the way. When face to face with the brother he whips a ball-point pen out of his pocket as the younger brothers reward keeping the bike for himself. Thus (like another ad) he gives his brother power (pronounced paver) to write your own destiny with it.        
	10. By middle age they are frankly unpleasant, greedy and manipulative. One insists his dying father add a flush of zeros to the one lakh willed to him. As the parent cops it he is left with only the flush of zeros because the leaking roof removes the figure 1 before them.... One rejoices at the absence of the sealing adhesive that would have prevented the roof from leaking at that precise moment.        
	I am sure you will agree this is not a very attractive trajectory of growth. How many of the brands advertised in these can you spot? No prizes for the correct answers!       SAJNI MUKHERJI

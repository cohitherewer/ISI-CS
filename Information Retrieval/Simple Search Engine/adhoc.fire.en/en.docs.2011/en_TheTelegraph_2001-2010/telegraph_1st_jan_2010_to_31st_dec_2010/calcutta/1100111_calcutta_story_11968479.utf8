            Indira Bhavan stands locked and lonely with Jyoti Basu in hospital       HOSPITAL
            Koel, second of the three granddaughters of Jyoti Basu, steps out of hospital on Sunday evening.             Mulayam Singh Yadav, who came to the hospital on Sunday morning, said the CPM had committed a blunder by not allowing Basu to become PM in 1996            Lakshmirani Das came from Cooch Behar to meet Basu but was denied entry. ldquo;My elder brother, missing for the past 25 years, was named Jyoti. I regard Jyoti Basu as my elder brother, rdquo; she wept      (Pictures: Bishwarup Dutta, Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya and Amit Datta )
                                
	If home is where the heart is, Jyoti Basus is in Indira Bhavan.        
	The critically ill Marxist leaders medical team may not be keen to try out any such remedy, but Basu is said to have told those close to him last week that he would be fine if they took him back to his adopted home of more than two decades.         
	Jyotibabu is desperate to return to Indira Bhavan (in DE Block of Salt Lake). He is so fond of the place that he cant think of staying anywhere else for even a day, said the former chief ministers shadow, secretary Joykrishna Ghosh.        
	Family sources said Basus son Chandan and daughter-in-law Rakhi had tried convincing him to shift to their FD block home several times but he didnt budge.        
	The white house named after Indira Gandhi  the late Prime Minister had stayed there for over a week during the 1972 All India Congress Committee session in Calcutta  has looked desolate in more ways than one since Basu was hospitalised on New Years Day.        
	 Indira Bhavan has shifted to AMRI Hospitals. You have come to the wrong place, remarked a plainclothes policeman on Sunday afternoon when Metro landed up.        
	He and a few more policemen sat chatting under the shade of a row of deodar trees, while a stray dog slept peacefully next to them. There was no queue of people waiting to get in, and not a single VIP vehicle parked outside the gate. Even the railings outside the boundary wall to keep visitors in line were gone.         
	Six months ago  on July 8  the sprawling lawns of Indira Bhavan had looked too small to accommodate the hundreds who had turned up to wish Basu on his 95th birthday. There were flowers and followers all over as a frail Basu sat on the portico soaking in the adulation, with the late Subhas Chakraborty and Somnath Chatterjee by his side.        
	The silence that has enveloped this place is almost eerie. The gardener still comes in every morning while the other office staff turn up once in a while but nothing is normal. Theres not much for us to do either except guarding the house while the master is away, said a police officer, walking around the iron railings that barricades a portion of the road to talk about his lack of work.         
	On a normal day, the same police officer would be the one standing between the house and any journalist or uninvited visitor trying to enter the large, iron gate.         
	According to a senior official of the intelligence wing, the security detail for Indira Bhavan has been scaled down since Basu was admitted to AMRI.        
	The total security deployment on a normal day would have been close to 37 personnel. These include two command units of seven personnel, two escort units of six, 17 house guards, anti-sabotage unit personnel, emergency medical staff and a driver for the bullet-proof car, he added.        
	Basu, who had first shifted from his Hindustan Park residence to Raj Bhavan so that he would be closer to Writers Buildings, moved into Indira Bhavan in 1989 after doctors advised him to stay in a pollution-free environment.        
	We began scouting for a suitable house for Jyotibabu after doctors said that the section of Raj Bhavan to which he had moved in 1986 lacked sunshine. Indira Bhavan was finally chosen for him because of its pollution-free environment, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.         
	The urban development department, which had built Indira Bhavan as a single-storey bungalow in 1971, expanded it into a two-storeyed house in the mid-eighties.         
	 We carried out further renovation in 1989 before Jyotibabu moved in, minister Bhattacharya recalled.         
	Although Basu has always felt at home in Indira Bhavan, the house also holds some bad memories.         
	The 95-year-old has so far slipped and fallen in the toilet of the house thrice, resulting in various injuries.        
	In 2008, he suffered a head injury after falling. Fortunately, he recovered, recalled one of Basus attendants in Indira Bhavan.        
	This time, the wait in the white house for Basus return is proving agonisingly long.

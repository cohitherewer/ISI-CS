The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heritage stands by accident
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Heritage stands by accident
          A STAFF REPORTER                          An aerial view of BBD Bag, which needs to be conserved                                  
	Mumbai looks like a village compared with Calcuttas built heritage, Shyam Chainani, the honorary secretary of the Bombay Environment Action Group, said at a conservation roundtable.        
	The IIT Kharagpur product, however, qualified his tribute by adding that the buildings in Calcutta stand only by accident.         
	The roundtable was organised jointly by the Calcutta Tercentenary Trust (CTT) and British Council on Saturday morning.        
	Sujata Sen, who heads British Council in Calcutta, said the suggestions and recommendations that had emerged from the five-hour discussions would be forwarded to the state government for possible action and amendment.        
	The roundtable was attended by Anindya Karforma, the director-general (project management unit) in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), and architects from the city, Delhi and Edinburgh.        
	Karforma admitted in his speech that the Premises Tenancy Act was not favourable to heritage properties, while Hirak Ghosh, a CTT trustee, stressed there were still many loopholes in heritage laws.        
	Scottish architect James Simpson emphasised that heritage buildings could be key economic drivers, a realisation that had dawned on the UK 50 years ago. Although heritage is among Indias most valuable assets, legal protection is not meant to save these buildings from change. But necessary changes can be undertaken only after careful consideration and research.        
	Simpson added this cannot be done on a shoestring budget and there was no use of having a distinguished panel of members in a heritage organisation without good professionals to aid them.        
	He regretted that conservation architects in India are undervalued and underpaid.        
	Simpson, CTT trustee Philippa Vaughan and several other speakers stressed the need to conserve heritage precincts such as BBD Bag and some others in north Calcutta.        
	Simpson said even ordinary streetscapes are valuable for a city. Developer Sumit Dabriwala regretted that even things that required the simplest intervention, such as removing ugly cable TV wires embracing city buildings, was impossible here. He, however, admitted that there was more awareness about the value of heritage in Calcutta.

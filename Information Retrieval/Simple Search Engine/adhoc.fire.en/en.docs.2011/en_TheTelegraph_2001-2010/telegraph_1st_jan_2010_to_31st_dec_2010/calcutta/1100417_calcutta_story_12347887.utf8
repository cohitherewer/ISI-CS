The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | April 20 taxi strike deferred
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      April 20 taxi strike deferred
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Taxi operators on Friday deferred their indefinite strike scheduled from April 20 to demand a fare hike in the wake of the rise in fuel prices. They are also protesting the operation of illegal pool cars and shuttle vehicles in the city.        
	Members of taxi associations met transport minister Ranjit Kundu on Friday morning. The transport minister has assured us that he will consider our demand for higher fares, Hence, we have decided to defer the strike, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association. He added that police had assured the taxi operators that they would crack down on illegal pool cars and shuttle cars. We will decide our course of action after the civic polls on May 30, Guha said.        
	Kundu, however, made it clear that his government would not increase taxi or bus fares. At the moment, I see no reason for an upward revision of fares, Kundu said.         
	This was the third time the taxi operators deferred their strike since the Union budget increased the price of diesel.

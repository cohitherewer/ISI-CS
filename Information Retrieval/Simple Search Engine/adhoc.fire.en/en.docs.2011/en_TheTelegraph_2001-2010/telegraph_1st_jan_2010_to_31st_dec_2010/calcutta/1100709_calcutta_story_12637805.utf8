The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ambulance on water
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ambulance on water

	A group of doctors and entrepreneurs from Calcutta has launched a water ambulance for patients in the interiors of the Sunderbans.        
	The water ambulance  a speedboat armed with all facilities to ferry patients  plies between Hingalganj villages such as Kalitala and Dhamakhali.        
	The speedboat reaches Dhamakhali in one-third the time taken to ferry a patient by a conventional motorboat. At Dhamakhali jetty, there is a vehicle-ambulance which carries patients to hospitals, said city-based physician Subrata Maitra, the president of Maa Sarada Swastha Seva Parishad, a voluntary organisation which has launched the water ambulance along with Agarhati Ramakrishna Sarada Seccha Parishad.        
	For the 20,000-odd inhabitants of Kalitala and neighbouring islands, taking a patient to any state-run hospital in Calcutta takes at least eight to 10 hours.        
	A speedboat, on hire round-the-clock, has been converted into an water ambulance. It carries oxygen cylinders and life-saving drugs. Those who hire the ambulance are asked to only pay for the fuel, said Pallab Mukherjee, an entrepreneur who part-financed the project.        
	The water ambulance will also be used for regular visits by doctors to Kalitala and its surrounding villages, said Maitra.         
	A doctor will hold weekly medical camps at Hatkhola, Sluice Gate, Hemnagar, Kumirmari and Gopaler Ghat. Maitra and a team of doctors recently visited Kalitala and conducted a free medical camp.        
	It is of immense help for villagers. Boats hired to ferry patients charge exorbitant rates. Also, it is difficult to get boats at night, said Dipti Mondal, the chief of the Kalitala gram panchayat.

	A gamut of classics, a platform to showcase original efforts, an opportunity to watch and study films  this was what made up the film festival Cinematheque 2010, held in association with t2        
	Held on March 5-, by the Xaverian Film Academy. 6, at the St Xaviers college auditorium, some of the films that were screened included Jon Josts All the Vermeers in New York, Stewart Schills I Hate Musicals and Peter Bessons True Beauty This Night. Indian selections included Satyajit Rays short film Pikoo, Ritwik Ghataks Durbar Gati Padma and Mrinal Sens Moving Perspectives.         
	Inaugurated by actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty and industrialist Harshvardhan Neotia, the well-known films were interspersed with those made by independent and student film-makers, in two categories  documentary and short fiction and selected from 57 entries from across the country. The objective is to expose young people to the best movies made in the country and also to assess oneself, said Gopalan Mullik, head of the film studies department and the president of the Academy.         
	Some of the themes in this competitive category were death, separation, child abuse, sexuality and parental conflict, with participation from the National Institute of Designing, Calcutta Film and Television Institute, Jadavpur University and Roop Kala Kendra.         
	We have judged the students on direction, cinematography, editing, content and treatment, said Rector Fr George Ponodath, judging the film festival with Bengali film-maker Supriyo Sen. We have assessed them on how they have been able to manipulate their logistics and put to use the limited resources, because in real life, they will have to make films with limited resources, said Sen.         
	A special mention award and a first prize were given from each of the two categories. In the documentary category, Sonia Nepram of Jamia Millia Islamia got a special mention for Limited Edition, the journey of a man chasing his dream, and the first prize went to Abhra Aich and Debarati Chakraborty for Ode to the Orion/Kalpurusher Kavya Katha capturing the life of a 33 year old man detected with myelofibrosis (a bone marrow disorder). We wanted to shoot his life over a year but because of a financial crunch, we had to wrap it in five days, explained Abhra Aich of Calcutta Film and Television Institute. Prasun Sarkar of St Xaviers got the first prize for My Special Friend, where he encapsulates within two-and-a-half minutes the difference between friendship, infatuation and love, in the short fiction category.         
	And the special mention for the same category went to Moa Kichu of Educational Multimedia Research Centre for Ice Cream, the story of a boy who goes to a firing spot each day and collects empty bullets to sell them and buy ice-cream. There should have been a little more interaction after each movie, rued Nepram, on her first visit to the city.

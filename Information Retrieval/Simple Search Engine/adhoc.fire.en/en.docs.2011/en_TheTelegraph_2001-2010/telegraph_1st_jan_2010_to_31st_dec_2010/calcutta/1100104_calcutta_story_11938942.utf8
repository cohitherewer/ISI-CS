The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mother dies in Setu mishap 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mother dies in Setu mishap 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 78-year-old woman died after being flung off the pillion of her sons motorcycle on a Vidyasagar Setu ramp on Sunday evening.        
	The son, who apparently lost control of the two-wheeler and rammed into the railing of the AJC Bose Road approach to the Setu, suffered critical face injuries.        
	Prabhabati Mondal, who was returning home to Behala with son Sekhar from a relatives house in Howrah, was flung 30 ft off the ramp and fell on a construction site.        
	Workers took the mother-son duo to Calcutta Medical Research Institute, where Prabhabati was declared dead on arrival.        
	The in-laws of Sekhars daughter had organised a get-together at their Howarh home. Prabhabati and Sekhar had left Behala for the Howrah home in the morning, said a neighbour of the Mondals.        
	Sekhar, in his mid-50s, apparently lost control of the two-wheeler and it rammed into the left guard wall of the ramp, said police.        
	The impact of the accident was such that Pratibha was flung off 30ft and fell on a construction site near the ramp, said an officer of Hastings police station.         
	A regular commuter on the stretch blamed the womans death on the low height of the guard wall  less than 4 feet. Had the wall being a little higher the woman would not have been flung off, said the commuter.        
	A CMRI official said Sekhar, too, needed medical attention but he refused to be admitted after hearing about her mothers death.        
	As the news of the fatal mishap spread, neighbours thronged the Mondal house in the evening.        
	Sekhar told me that he lost control of the bike and hit the wall before passing out. He came to only after reaching the hospital and learnt that his mother had died. Since then he has been inconsolable, said Ajay Adhikari, the local councillor.        
	Sekhar suffers from high blood pressure. Because of that he might have been distressed while riding the motorcycle, Adhikari added.        
	The police examined the motorcycle and ruled out the possibility of speeding as the cause of the accident. Probably the rider suffered a blackout, said Dilip Bandopadhyay, the deputy commissioner of police in charge of the traffic department

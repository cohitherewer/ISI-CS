          A STAFF REPORTER                          Guitarist Alex Machaceks trio plays at Dalhousie Institute this evening                                   
	Friday promises jazz lovers of the city an evening of world-class music as the Alex Machacek Trio takes stage at Dalhousie Institute at 7pm.        
	Featuring Alex Machacek on guitars, Jeff Apt. Q258 Sipe on drums and Neal Fountain on bass, the trios brand of jazz-fusion is an exciting blend of old-world sounds with new-world technique. The event will be presented by Congo Square.        
	Bandleader/guitarist/composer Machacek studied the classical guitar from the age of eight and moved on to study the jazz guitar at the Conservatory of Vienna and later at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. Influenced by guitarist Joe Pass, Machacek was also drawn to the work of Allan Holdsworth and the compositional approach of Frank Zappa.        
	He released his first album, Featuring Ourselves, in 1999. The same year, Machacek began working with drummer Terry Bozzio and reed player Gerald Preinfalk as part of the trio BPM, releasing the record Delete and Roll in 2001. Moving to Los Angeles in 2004, he released [Sic] on the Abstract Logix label.        
	His 2010 album 24 Tales used unusual concept and execution, a collaboration between Machacek and drummer Marco Minneman. Minneman recorded a single continuous drum track over which Machacek dubbed the guitar, keyboards and other instruments. Innovative in production, 24 Tales has been hailed for breaking boundaries even within the resilient genre of jazz-fusion.        
	At the Dalhousie Institute show, Machacek will be supported on drums by Jeff Sipe  to some, better known as Apt. Q258 or just Apartment  and on bass by Neal Fountain.        
	Not just a fine drummer spanning an array of genres, Sipe is a pivotal figure in Atlantas music scene. His semi-annual Zambiland Orchestra  experimental big band featuring members of Phish, Widespread Panic and others  draws almost every musician in Atlanta.        
	Fountain, who hails from Athens, Georgia, started playing professionally when he was 14 and has almost two decades of performance behind him. Best known as a sideman to Colonel Bruce Hampton and the Fiji Mariners and Sipe himself, Fountain is on his way to breaking new boundaries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Noon but not yet time for roll call
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Noon but not yet time for roll call
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          WAIT AND WATCH: An empty room at the Tantia High School centre off Chittaranjan Avenue at 11am on Tuesday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	The roll revision fortnight has been unofficially reduced to 10 days in Calcutta because the babus wouldnt give up their habit of reporting late for work.        
	Metro found out on Tuesday that state and central government employees deployed for the revision of rolls at four centres in town have been turning up at least one-and-a-half hours late on an average every day since the process began on July 9. The total man-day loss works out to 22.5 hours, or almost five 11am-4pm days out of a fortnight.        
	Bhavik Malani, a second-year student of Scottish Church College, was fuming after being forced to visit the St Josephs College centre on BB Ganguly Street twice in as many days to submit his Form 6 application.        
	This is ridiculous. How can these officials come late for such an important, time-bound project and get away with it? he demanded.        
	Bhavik had first gone to the centre at 11am on Monday, only to find the premises empty except for a guard who advised him to come back after half an hour. When he returned at 11.30am, there was still no sign of the officials.         
	I decided to come back around noon the next day instead of missing some important classes. On Tuesday, I went to the polling centre sharp at 12 but there was nobody around except some applicants. Two officials  a man and a woman  walked in together around 12.10pm, by which time there were 18 people in the queue, grumbled Bhavik, 20.        
	Visits to the other three centres chosen for revision of electoral rolls revealed that work doesnt start at any of these locations before noon.        
	You are early. Work starts here around 12.30pm, a teacher at Maheswari Bhawan School in Burrabazar told Metro around 11.20am, pointing towards the empty tables and chairs in the designated portion of the ground floor.        
	On being told that the work hours were 11am till 4pm, the teacher expressed surprise. Really? We were all along given the impression that work is to start only after noon. The officials have been coming after 12.15pm from Day I, he said.              
	Sources at Tantia High School, off Chittaranjan Avenue, and Calcutta Muslim Orphanage School, on New CIT Road, confirmed that late-coming has been the trend since the roll revision got underway across Bengal on July 9. The process is scheduled to continue till July 23.        
	A fortnight is a very short window for addition, deletion and correction of names and other information in the electoral rolls of a state. To waste even an hour in a five-hour working day is criminal, said an official in the State Election Commission.        
	So why isnt action being taken against those guilty of regularly reporting late for duty?        
	The process is being carried out at 60,000 locations in Bengal, which makes it very difficult for us to monitor every official deployed for the revision. However, as and when we receive any complaint against an official, we do contact him or her to issue a warning, Sunil Gupta, the chief electoral officer of West Bengal, told Metro.        
	More than 3 lakh employees from various central and state government departments have been withdrawn from normal duty to revise the electoral rolls for the Assembly elections in 2011.        
	Each centre has an electoral registration officer heading the team.        
	Sources said the poll panel had received reports about officials in some centres creating shifts so that the entire team would not have to report for duty on a given day. But nobody has been penalised for dereliction of duty so far.        
	Chief electoral officer Gupta appealed to citizens to file complaints with the district magistrates if they found electoral officials missing from the roll revision centres during duty hours.        
	A specific complaint with a district magistrate will help us nail any errant official, he said.

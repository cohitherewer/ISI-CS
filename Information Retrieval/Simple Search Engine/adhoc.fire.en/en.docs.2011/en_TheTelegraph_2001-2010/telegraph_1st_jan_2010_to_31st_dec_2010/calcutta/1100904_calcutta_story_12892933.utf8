          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A lawyer on Friday moved a public interest litigation in the high court, seeking a judicial inquiry into the distribution of New Town plots from Hidco chairman and housing minister Gautam Debs quota.        
	The petitioner, Ramaprasad Sarkar, alleged that plots from Debs quota had been distributed in violation of the courts order on the allotment of Salt Lake plots from the chief ministers quota.        
	The petition  likely to be heard by the division bench headed by Chief Justice J.N. Patel on September 10  has made the housing minister a party to the case, along with the chief secretary and the North 24-Parganas district administration.        
	The petitioner alleged that no advertisement had been issued before allotting plots from Debs quota.

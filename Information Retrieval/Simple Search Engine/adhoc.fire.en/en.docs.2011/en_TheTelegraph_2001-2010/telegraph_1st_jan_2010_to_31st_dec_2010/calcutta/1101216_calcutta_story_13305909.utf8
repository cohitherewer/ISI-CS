The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mercury dip as winter arrives 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mercury dip as winter arrives 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Winter arrived in Calcutta on Wednesday with the minimum temperature dropping three notches in 24 hours to 13.6 degrees Celsius.        
	The evenings and nights will steadily become colder, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The maximum on Wednesday was three degrees below normal at 24.2.        
	The free flow of the North Wind was instrumental in ushering in the most cherished season for Calcuttans.        
	The northerlies and northwesterlies have been very active. The strong flow of the North Wind has helped bring the season to the city. The flow is likely to remain strong over the next few days, said Debnath.        
	In the absence of any formation over the Bay, which can trigger flow of moisture into the atmosphere over south Bengal and block the North Wind, the temperatures are likely to drop over the next few days.        
	Winter has been delayed by eight days this year. Only once before in this decade  in 2008  had winter set in later, on December 18. The series of formations over the Bay was the main reason for winter setting in late, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.

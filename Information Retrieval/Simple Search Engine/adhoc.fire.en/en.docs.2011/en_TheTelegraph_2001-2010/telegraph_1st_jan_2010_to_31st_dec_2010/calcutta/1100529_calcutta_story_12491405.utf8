The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Loss is their gain 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Loss is their gain 
          KINSUK BASU                          A poll rally on the last day of campaigning on Friday. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	Name: Sheo Kumar Yadav; Age: 47; Education: Matriculate; Profession: Hawker; Asset(s): Rs 5,000 cash in hand; Political affiliation: Independent; Electoral battlefield: Ward 42         
	Sheo Kumar Yadav may look a misfit in the money-and-muscle sport of poll politics but he is one among a record number of Independent candidates this civic election who stand to gain even from a losing cause.         
	I hope to get at least 200-odd votes, smiles the migrant from Bihar. I am contesting this election not to win but to build a support base for myself. Even 200 people behind you counts in this cauldron called Burrabazar, he adds.        
	What Sheo Kumar wouldnt say is how crucial a role an Independent candidate can play in the victory or defeat of the other contenders, or the price that such a contribution can fetch.         
	In an election where the victory margin could be less than 200 for most, every vote has a price, reveals one of the 546 Independent candidates in the fray in the city, the highest ever.        
	The figure is more than half the total of 1,048 candidates contesting from the 141 wards spread across the city and its added areas. The list of 1,699 Independent candidates in the fray across 16 Bengal districts is also the largest ever, exceeding the individual bench strength of both the CPM and the Trinamul Congress.         
	So can an Independent create a win-win situation for himself simply by filing a nomination? It isnt that simple, explains the poll manager of a CPM contestant. You need to either spend a huge amount of money yourself to start with and build a constituency to be noticed by your rivals. But on some occasions, an Independent candidate can make his presence felt by just ensuring that he has a certain amount of confirmed votes, he adds.        
	According to conservative estimates, a proper civic poll campaign with banners, posters and public meetings costs a candidate Rs 2 to 3 lakh. In the high-profile wards it can shoot up to Rs 7 lakh.         
	One of the best-kept secrets of the civic polls is about Independent candidates being offered up to Rs 9 lakh by nominees of the major parties to either transfer their support base or go slow on their campaign.         
	If you make a strong start to your campaign, agents of different parties will start analysing your prospects and make an offer, depending on whose vote bank you are eating into, says a veteran in the buying game.         
	In several wards the Independent candidates are, of course, dummies of the main contenders. But the equation gets complicated once an Independent who is nobodys dummy joins the fray.         
	For some like Bharati Kharwar, an Independent candidate in ward 22, this election is more about making a point. Her husband Anil Kharwar, who is the vice-president of Intuc, had expected his wife to get the Congress ticket when the seat was reserved for women and supposedly felt insulted when the party chose someone else.         
	So he fielded Bharati as an Independent. Besides trying to prove a point, Kharwar knows that a decent number of votes would define his wifes political future, says an aide.        
	A few among the band of Independents, however, claim to be in the fray only to enhance their social standing through public service. I do social work round the year but you need recognition too, says Kumar Saha, a contender from ward 83.         
	Then there is Somnath Sen, who insists he is contesting from ward 48 for the fun of it until his CV gives him away. This is just a way of rewinding to my involvement in college politics during my days in City College on Amherst Street, he claims.        
	But going by Somnaths election affidavit, he couldnt have gone to college. His educational qualification? Class X.

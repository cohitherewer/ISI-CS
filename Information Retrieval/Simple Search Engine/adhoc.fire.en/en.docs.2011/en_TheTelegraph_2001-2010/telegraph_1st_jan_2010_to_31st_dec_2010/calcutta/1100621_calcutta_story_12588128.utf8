The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Task force norms for new schools in neighbourhood 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Task force norms for new schools in neighbourhood 
          OUR BUREAU                                  THINGS TO DO

	The school education department has taken the first step towards answering the prayers of parents for more quality schools in and around town.        
	A nine-member committee has been set up to recommend policy guidelines for the approval and setting up of unaided private schools. It will focus on creating a faster, more efficient and more transparent process of setting up schools and also ensuring standard quality.        
	Jayanti Neogi, whose daughter studies in Loreto House, sums up the pressure parents are under. We are at the mercy of a few schools because of the limited options. Right from the age of two the pressure keeps mounting for the child to be put into a good school. There is an urgent need for localised schools to send our kids to.        
	That is a goal for the team set up to monitor and fast-track new schools with D. Mukherjee, the director of school education, Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, the president of West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, Mamata Roy, the president of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, Sulapani Bhattacharyya, the president of West Bengal Council of Rabindra Open Schooling, Rathindra Nath De, the director of SCERT, Subir Roy, technical adviser to the department of school education, T.K. Adhikary, the joint secretary of the department, Barry OBrien, a member of the Assembly, and Sister Cyril, the principal of Loreto Day School, Sealdah.        
	Today, the applications for unaided private schools received by the school education department and the directorate of school education are first enquired into and a report is then sent by the district inspector of schools. These reports are processed and examined before the cases are forwarded to the school education department for the no-objection certificates.        
	The entire procedure is time-consuming, said an official of the school education department.        
	The Right to Education Act suggests that the state government set up new schools with private players and this system will encourage that process, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari.        
	The committee will make the procedure more transparent with policy directions on which applications are considered and processed. It will also recommend district or area-wise locations where proposals for new schools will be encouraged. The existing shortage of schools in the area will be taken into consideration.        
	One needs to keep in mind that many of the private schools coming up in the urban areas are set up purely from the commercial point of view and do not even provide the basic infrastructure required, said an official.        
	So the committee must take into account the requirements, especially those of infrastructure and fire-safety measures, as provided under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009.        
	Calcutta desperately needs new schools with requisite infrastructure and standard teachers. Supply far exceeds the demand here, said Esther Rajan, a senior teacher with Calcutta Girls.        
	It is time for neighbourhood schools with requisite infrastructure to meet the proportionate demand, added Nupur Ghosh, a parent.        
	The committee will submit its recommendations by July 15 following which the school education department will issue guidelines for new schools.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dankuni, Oct. 29: Five armed robbers took away Rs 20 lakh this morning from a Hooghly bank that had kept its alarm switched off, lacked a CCTV and had not hired a security guard, police said.        
	The gang entered the United Bank of India branch in Dankuni five minutes after it had opened at 10am, and left with the cash within 10 minutes. The police said the robbers, aged between 25 and 30, carried pistols.        
	After entering the bank, housed in the first floor of a four-storey building, one of the robbers unplugged the telephone in the managers chamber and shouted in Hindi: The bank is under the control of dacoits.        
	They herded the seven employees and five customers present to a spot near the toilet and ordered them to sit on the floor with their heads bowed.        
	A police officer said the robbers entered the chamber of deputy manager Debjyoti Banerjee. One of them held a pistol to Banerjees head and asked him in Hindi to open the vault.        
	The deputy manager told the robbers the vault needed two keys to open, and that he had one of the keys while the head cashier had the other. They ordered him to call the head cashier, the officer said.        
	The gang then forced the two bank officials to open the vault and stuffed the money into a white synthetic sack. They ordered the duo to sit with the others before leaving.        
	Banerjee informed the nearest police station, 300 metres away, about four minutes after the gang left. The police arrived within five minutes.        
	Tanmoy Roy Chowdhury, the district superintendent of police, said: There was negligence on the part of the bank authorities. The main switch of the alarm had not been activated. The bank does not have a closed-circuit TV.        
	The police said the bank did not have a security guard. Tapas Bandyopadhyay, the chief manager in charge of security of the UBI, said it was not possible to hire security guards at all the branches because of a shortage of guards.         
	The officer in charge of Dankuni police station, Subir Roy, said: The tables of the manager and the head cashier have an alarm switch each. However, when we pressed the switches, the alarm did not go off as the main switch had not been switched on.        
	He added: We are investigating whether insiders were involved in the robbery.

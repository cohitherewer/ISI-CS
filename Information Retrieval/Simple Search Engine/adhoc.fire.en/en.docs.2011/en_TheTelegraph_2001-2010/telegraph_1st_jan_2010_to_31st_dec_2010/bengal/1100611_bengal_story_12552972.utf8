The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Left saving grace in civic polls: slight minority shift
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Left saving grace in civic polls: slight minority shift
  Job and budget carrot pay dividends
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                          Bhattacharjee at a Rajabazar rally last month                                   
	Calcutta, June 10: In a small measure, the Left has been able to woo back a section of the minorities in Calcutta in the civic polls, improving upon its performance in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.        
	An examination of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation results show that the Left has won 10 of the 34 wards that have a minority concentration, against the five it had won in the 2009 polls by defeating the Trinamul Congress.         
	The Lefts improvement appears to be significant as it had heavily trailed behind the Opposition in these 10 wards in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The vote percentage in many of these 34 wards had gone down from 75 to 80 per cent in the 2005 CMC polls to 33 to 38 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections. The Left had lost in 15 of these wards in the 2005 CMC polls while the loss went up to 29 in the Lok Sabha elections. However, in the civic polls this time, the Left lost all the five wards  mostly to the Congress  that it had won in the last Lok Sabha elections.        
	CPM leaders had been saying during the run-up to the CMC elections that they were expecting a gradual drift in the citys minority vote bank in the favour of their party.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees announcement in election campaigns that one crore Muslims would be identified for government jobs under the 10 per cent quota scheme was aimed at wooing back a section of the minorities. Raising the minority affairs budget from Rs 180 crore to Rs 300 crore was also a step in that direction.        
	Asked whether the Left was satisfied with the drift in the Muslim votes towards the Left, CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said: Winning wards where we were crushed by the Trinamul Congress 12 months ago is no mean achievement. We have seen a small shift in the minority vote bank in the Calcutta elections. But that is not much of a cause for celebration. We have to keep in mind there was no Opposition alliance (in this years civic polls) and that helped us.        
	However, the anger against the Left over Nandigram and Singur has subsided to a certain extent. Our announcement of a job quota for poor, backward Muslims has got a positive response from certain sections of the minorities. But though the results have improved, we cannot say all is well, Salim said.         
	Unlike in the Lok Sabha elections, the Muslims had a problem of choice in the civic polls as the Opposition was a split house. In Calcutta, the majority of Urdu-speaking Muslims have traditionally been Congress voters. In the Lok Sabha elections, a chunk of them voted for Trinamul in the Calcutta North and the Calcutta South parliamentary seats.        
	But a look at this years CMC poll results show that the Left has been able to cut into Opposition votes in minority belts that had overwhelmingly voted against the Marxists in 2009.        
	The Lefts improvement can be seen in Rajabazar, Kalabagan, Mechhua, Burrabazar, Park Street, Topsia and Metiabruz.        
	Trinamul chief and railway minister Mamata Banerjee had announced before the civic polls that candidates would be allowed to take railway recruitment tests in Urdu. She had also granted train concessions to madrasah students. Even after this, the Lefts gains in some minority pockets have surprised the Trinamul leadership.        
	Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition, said: The Left might have made some effort to regain the support of the minorities in Calcutta. We are a bit surprised. However, in the civic elections, a division of votes (as a result of the failure of Trinamul and the Congress to stitch an alliance) could have led to some Left gains.

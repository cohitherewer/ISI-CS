The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha blames Shilda camp leaders
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha blames Shilda camp leaders
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 18: The chief minister today blamed the top brass at the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in Shilda for the February 15 Maoist attack but refused to pull up senior West Midnapore police officers for setting up the camp in a crowded part of the town.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was replying to questions from Congress Legislature Party leader Manas Bhuniya in the Assembly on the intelligence failure in the Shilda attack that lead to the death of 24 EFR personnel.         
	There was a failure on the part of the leadership at the camp. If they (policemen at the camp) ignored the intelligence inputs, it was a serious mistake, Bhattacharjee told the House.         
	By tacitly admitting that there were intelligence reports about a Maoist build-up near Shilda, the chief minister appeared to have contradicted the claims of director-general of police Bhupinder Singh who had said he had not received any prior information on the attack.        
	Bhattacharjee also said such intelligence inputs were sent directly to the in-charge of security camps and not to top government officials.        
	But a day after the massacre at the camp, home secretary Ardhendu Sen had claimed that the DGP had received prior reports of a Maoist build-up.         
	The chief minister admitted that the Shilda camp had been set up in a populated area but stopped short of blaming the senior officials who had ordered that the camp be set up there under pressure from local CPM leaders.         
	Now the camp is being shifted to a forest beat office, away from a crowded place, Bhattacharjee said, adding that a review of security camps in Maoist-infested districts was being done.        
	The existing camps will be relocated in addition to overhauling the security system there, like enhancing the number of forces and providing them with sophisticated weapons, he said.         
	Bhattacharjee ruled out providing any compensation to the families of political activists killed by Maoists. I consider it sympathetically but it is not possible for the government to do so because any such decision will trigger a controversy, he said.         
	The chief minister also criticised EFR special inspector-general Benoy Chakraborty for holding a news conference in which he blamed West Midnapore police chief Manoj Kumar Verma for the Shilda attack. It was unbecoming of a police officer to hold such a news conference without the governments permission.

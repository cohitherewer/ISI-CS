	Aug. 13: A block development officer from South Dinajpur was arrested in Malda while allegedly escaping with Rs 1 crore embezzled from the showpiece rural job scheme.         
	Suman Majhi, the BDO of Harirampur, was allegedly fleeing in a white car when Malda police, tipped off by their South Dinajpur counterparts, arrested him from NH34 in Malbari.        
	Majhi, who hails from Garia, had allegedly embezzled National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme funds by issuing 20 bearer cheques against false vouchers that showed records of development projects that were never implemented.         
	The BDO is the executive officer of the development schemes in his block. He plans the projects and implements them through the local panchayats, South Dinajpur district magistrate (DM) Ashok Banerjee said.        
	The alleged fraud came to light when Rafiqul Islam, the karmadhyakshya of the Harirampur panchayat samiti, filed a Right to Information application seeking information on the projects.         
	Uday Majumdar, the inspector in charge of Harirampur police station, said the subdivisional officers (SDOs) reply to the RTI application listed several projects that had been implemented and also gave a break-up of the funds utilised.         
	However, Islam complained to the SDO that none of the projects mentioned had been implemented.         
	The BDO, who is in his 30s, had withdrawn money for projects such as road repairs and the digging of tanks. However, none of the projects materialised, DM Banerjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | EC team rules out early polls
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      EC team rules out early polls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      S.Y. Qureshi                           
	Calcutta, July 6: Election commissioner S.Y. Qureshi today ruled out early Assembly polls and said no one has formally approached us, either from the Opposition or any other parties for the elections to be advanced.        
	All we know about it (early polls) is from media reports. But early poll is not on our radar at all at the moment, Qureshi said.         
	The question of holding the elections before time can arise only six months ahead (of the scheduled date). But the elections in Bengal are 10 months away (in May-June 2011), Qureshi added.        
	Qureshi arrived here today along with another election commissioner V.S. Sampath to oversee preparatory work. They will meet district magistrates tomorrow to review the revision of electoral rolls and issue of voter identity cards.        
	However, Trinamul general secretary and Union minister Mukul Roy claimed his party had made a representation to the poll panel demanding early elections.         
	We made the representation a few months back because we believe the ruling CPM has lost its mandate following reverses since the 2008 rural polls. People can give a fresh mandate if the elections are held earlier, he said.         
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee has spoken on the issue several times, more so after the CPMs rout in the May civic polls.        
	Bengal Congress president Manas Bhunia echoed Roy. Early elections are the only option. We should not wait till next May.

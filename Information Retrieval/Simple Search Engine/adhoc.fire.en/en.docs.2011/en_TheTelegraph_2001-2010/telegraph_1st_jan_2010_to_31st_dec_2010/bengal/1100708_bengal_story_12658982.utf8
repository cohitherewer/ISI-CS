          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cooch Behar, July 7: A senior official of an agriculture university in Cooch Behar was locked up for 13 hours yesterday by the Trinamul Congress-led employees union for trying to sell a felled tree on the campus on the sly.        
	Amar Roy, the director of farms at the varsity, was confined without food and water to his office at the Uttar Banga Krishi Visvavidyalaya from 7am to 8pm by members of the newly formed union. The agitators had also locked up Mrigen Ghosh and Parthasarathi Medda, the assistant directors of farms.         
	The union, which was earlier led by Citu, also demanded that the Left Front government fulfil the job promise it had made to the families who had given land for the varsity when it was set up in 1979.        
	The 300 agitators allowed the officials to leave only after they promised in writing that the tree row and the job demand would be discussed in the next meeting of the executive council of the varsity.         
	Afzal Ali, the president of the workers union, alleged that farm authorities tried to sell the shishu tree, which had fallen in a recent storm, for a mere Rs 1,000.         
	The tree was lopped off into logs on June 30. The logs are worth not less than Rs 10,000. The authorities did not take the permission of the forest department before selling the tree, Ali said.        
	The security guards informed us and we stopped the sale, Ali said.        
	Roy claimed that the tree was sold by an official of his department who was ignorant about the rules. It was a mistake, he added.

	Burdwan, Dec. 6: A mob armed with sticks, axes and swords today stormed a private polytechnic college in Burdwan, ransacked rooms, broke equipment, set a hostel on fire and beat up students when they tried to resist.         
	The protesters claimed the guards of the newly formed Sylvan Polytechnic College in Jyotram village had beaten up a local youth yesterday when he had gone there to meet his mother, who works as a cook at the institute.         
	However, the college authorities said the villagers had been demanding jobs there for a long time and attacked the institute because not everybodys demand could be met.         
	A college official was arrested late tonight for firing in the air in an attempt to scare away the mob.         
	Around 1,000 armed villagers descended on the college at 10.30 this morning, minutes after 97 first-year students began taking a test. R. Rahman, the college administrator, said several teaching and non-teaching staff rushed to the gate and requested the crowd to speak to us and sort out the problem.         
	Rahman said the protesters refused to listen and entered the premises. They started hurling bricks and stones at the building and broke windowpanes, he said.         
	The mob allegedly hurled abuses at the college staff before ransacking some rooms on the ground floor of the two-storey building. Rahman said the protesters yanked off the phone lines, cut electric cables with knives and hacked off water pipes with scythes.        
	The protesters then ran towards the hostel and set fire to its thatched roof.         
	The mob allegedly beat up around 20 students with rods and sticks when they tried to resist. The injured were taken to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. Nine have been admitted while an equal number released after being given first aid. Tapas Ghosh, the deputy superintendent of the hospital, said one student was hit on the head while another suffered an injury to his spine.         
	College authorities said several books and clothes belonging to students were destroyed in the fire.        
	Amitava Som, the secretary of the college governing body who was arrested, said before being picked up: I fired a round to scare away the villagers. But they refused to budge and attacked the library and the laboratory instead.         
	The villagers broke over a dozen computers and equipment. They also destroyed several books, Som alleged.         
	Som said he had repeatedly called up the police but the force arrived much later, around 12pm, and drove away the protesters. However, the mob soon regrouped and came back. A bigger police team had to resort to cane-charging to disperse the protesters. Som alleged that by the time the firefighters arrived, the hostel roof had been destroyed.         
	Gautam Roy, a protester, said the guards had beaten up Bablu Biswas, a local resident, when he had gone to the college to meet his mother. The guards accused him of trespassing. We decided to teach the college authorities a lesson.        
	A police picket has been posted at the college.         
	Som, however, said the local people had been demanding jobs for the past several days. We had employed seven villagers as gardeners and cleaners. But they have been demanding more jobs. We cant employ all of them. Todays attack was a fallout of this.        
	The college will remain closed tomorrow.

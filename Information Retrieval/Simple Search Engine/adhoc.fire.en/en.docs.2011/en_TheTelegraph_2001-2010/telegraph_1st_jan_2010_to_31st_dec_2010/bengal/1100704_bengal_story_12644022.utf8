          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, July 3: A group of 12 Maoists dragged a CPM leader out of his house near Jhargram last night and shot him dead in a paddy field 100 metres away.         
	Police said Ganesh Murmu, a CPM branch committee member, had fled his home in Joynagar village six months ago in the face of Maoist threats. But he came back four days ago.        
	With raids by the joint forces intensifying in the area, Ganesh had probably thought it was safe to return home, a police officer said.        
	Last night, the Maoists surrounded Ganeshs house. They knocked on his door. When Ganesh opened the door, the rebels dragged him out and took him to the paddy field. His neighbours saw him being taken away but did not protest out of fear. They also did not inform us, a police officer said.        
	A villager spotted Murmus body around 5.30am today. He informed Ganeshs family members, who told local CPM leaders about the murder. The police reached Joynagar around 10.30am.         
	Murmu has been killed by the Maoists, said Praveen Tripathi, the Jhargram superintendent of police.         
	The Maoists also allegedly abducted a parateacher  those hired on contract  of a school in Jhargrams Birihari village while he was returning home on a motorcycle yesterday.         
	Ajit Giri, 26, who stays in Aguiboni village near Birihari, is also a CPM branch committee member.         
	The family members of Ajit Giri have lodged a complaint at the local police station, a police officer said.         
	Police on alert        
	In Calcutta, inspector-general of police (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha said that after Maoist leader Azads death in an encounter in Andhra Pradesh, the Bengal government had stepped up intelligence gathering. All the police stations in the state have been alerted and senior police officers have been advised to visit their areas more frequently, he said.

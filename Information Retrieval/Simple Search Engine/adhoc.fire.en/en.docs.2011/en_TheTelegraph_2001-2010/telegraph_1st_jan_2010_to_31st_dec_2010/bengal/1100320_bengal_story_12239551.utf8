          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 19: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee skipped the Assembly today, apparently to avoid a fresh clash with Trinamul and Congress MLAs who demanded the chief minister apologise for his indecent and unparliamentary attacks on the Opposition yesterday.        
	He tried and failed to control the damage by requesting the Congress through emissaries not to boycott the discussion on the Presidency autonomy bill in the second half of the day. For the Congress, it meant breaking ranks with ally Trinamul.        
	Left Front chief whip Syed Mohammed Masih, along with senior MLA Rabin Mondol, both from the CPM, went to the Congress office in the Assembly to meet its legislative party leader Manas Bhunia.         
	Bhunia was absent. They requested veteran MLA Gyan Singh Sohanpal to prevail on Bhunia not to join the boycott with Trinamul. Citing Bhunias earlier support to the upgrading of Presidency College to a university, they said the Congress should record its criticism of the bill and suggestions for amendments instead of rushing to the Raj Bhavan with Trinamul.         
	The CPM team, however, failed to break the ice.         
	Bhunia defended his position. We are not against Presidencys elevation. But we are opposed to the bills provisions that reveal the CPMs ulterior design to ensure its political control over the proposed university, he said.        
	The higher education minister forced the bill through despite opposition from the CPM teachers organisation, he added.         
	Congress MLAs said they could not possibly break the Opposition unity after Bhattacharjee called their party and Bhunia spineless and launched a personal attack on Trinamul legislature party chief Partha Chatterjee in his address yesterday.        
	Although the government succeeded in passing the bill, the CPMs problems were clear from party state secretary Biman Boses comments later as well as MLA Srutinath Praharajs speech on the floor.         
	Government college teachers organisations have reservations against the bill on several grounds.The government should redress their grievances, Bose said.         
	Praharaj, a leader of the teachers organisation, asked for priority to be given to teachers of Presidency and their counterparts in other government colleges while selecting staff for the new university. The suggestion was rejected.

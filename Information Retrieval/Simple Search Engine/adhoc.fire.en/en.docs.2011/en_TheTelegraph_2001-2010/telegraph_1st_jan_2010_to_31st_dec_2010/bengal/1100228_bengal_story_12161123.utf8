	Calcutta, Feb. 27: With the rise in fuel prices, taxi operators in Calcutta are demanding a fare hike while bus and minibus owners want the state government to offer relief while retaining the existing fare structure. A bus union leader said they want a reduction in the sales tax on diesel, which is the states prerogative.

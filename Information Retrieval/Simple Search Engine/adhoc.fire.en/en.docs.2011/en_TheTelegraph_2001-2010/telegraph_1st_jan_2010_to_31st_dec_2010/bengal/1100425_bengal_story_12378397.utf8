	Calcutta, April 24: A health department team today began a probe, 11 days after a mob ransacked Peerless Hospital and nearby Apex nursing home after the two allegedly turned away the victims of a crash on EM Bypass.        
	Both hospitals have denied the charge.         
	The team went to the crash spot, the hospital and the local East Jadavpur police station.         
	The committee, which has to submit its report in a month, will hear witnesses and victims relatives on May 6 and 8.

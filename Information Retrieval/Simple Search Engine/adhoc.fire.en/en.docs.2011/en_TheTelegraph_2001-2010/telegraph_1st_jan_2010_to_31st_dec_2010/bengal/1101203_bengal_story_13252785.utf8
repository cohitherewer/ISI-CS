          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Jahanara after her house was allegedly ransacked by Trinamul activists on Thursday. (Krishna Das)      
	Raina (Burdwan), Dec. 2: Trinamul Congress activists today allegedly ransacked the homes of CPM supporters and hurled bombs in a Burdwan pocket where two party supporters were killed during a clash with the Left and subsequent police firing yesterday.         
	Around 300 armed Trinamul supporters descended on Rainas Belsar village and ransacked six houses, including that of a panchayat samiti member. They also plundered the office of the CPM peasants wing, a sweet shop and set ablaze a Left supporters bike.         
	The Trinamul activists blocked all approach roads to Belsar with tree branches to stop the police from intervening. All male CPM supporters in Belsar and neighbouring villages had fled last evening fearing a Trinamul backlash.         
	Yesterday, two Trinamul supporters had allegedly been beaten up by CPM activists, sparking the clash and police firing. Trinamul had claimed the two party supporters had been killed by the CPM with the polices help.         
	Jahanara Begum, the CPM panchayat samiti member whose house was ransacked this morning, said the Trinamul activists chose Belsar because it has a high concentration of people who had left the CPM to join Trinamul only to return to their old party.         
	Jahanara said she was making puffed rice in the courtyard around 9am when Trinamul activists armed with revolvers started hurling bombs at her house. I ran inside with my daughter. Some of the activists followed us, she said.         
	Jahanara said the activists hurled abuses at her and her 15-year-old daughter. They threatened to abduct me and my daughter. They threw stones at us. A stone hit my daughter in the head, she said. The 15-year-old was left with a bleeding head.        
	Jahanara said the Trinamul activists broke our TV and took away jewellery I had kept for my daughters wedding.         
	Before leaving, the attackers slashed the back of the familys pet dog with a knife, Jahanara said. The Trinamul activists then ransacked the houses of five CPM supporters and set a cowshed on fire.         
	A big police team reached a place 1km from Belsar around 10.30am but could not proceed because the road was blocked with chopped trees. Some Trinamul activists hurled bombs at the policemen from a distance.         
	An officer said: We initially hesitated to enter the village on foot because yesterday we had been attacked by Trinamul activists in Jyotsadi (neighbouring Belsar).         
	The police removed the branches and entered Belsar around 11am. But by then, the Trinamul activists had fled.         
	Around 1.30pm today, Trinamul leaders Mukul Roy, Sisir Adhikari and Madan Mitra escorted the bodies of the two Trinamul activists killed in yesterdays clashes to their homes in Jyotsadi. The leaders went to the houses of Kajal Mollah and Hasmat Ali Mullick and met their family members.

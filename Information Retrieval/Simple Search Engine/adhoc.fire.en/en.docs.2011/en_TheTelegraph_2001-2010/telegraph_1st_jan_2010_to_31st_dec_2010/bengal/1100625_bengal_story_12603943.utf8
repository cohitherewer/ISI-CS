          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 24: The Bengal Congress has decided to suspend all six party councillors, including the vice-chairman, of the Suri municipality in Birbhum for preventing the Trinamul Congress from forming the board by backing an Independent for the chairmans post.        
	Left-backed Ujjwal Mukherjee got 11 votes  one more than what he needed. It came from a Trinamul councillor. Of the other 10, six came from the Congress, four from the Left.        
	The Congresss Ujjwal Chatterjee was elected vice-chairman during Tuesdays election.         
	The Trinamuls Pritikona Bhattacharya, who had contested for the chairpersons post, lost.        
	The Birbhum district Congress leadership, which had asked the Congress councillors to help the Trinamul candidate form the board, had earlier slapped show-cause notices on the six.

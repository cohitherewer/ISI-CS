The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Symptom of poll allergy
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Symptom of poll allergy
          BARUN GHOSH                          Mollah                                  
	Calcutta, July 9: Minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today hinted he may not contest the Assembly polls as many in my party do not like me, an allusion to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other senior CPM leaders, including Biman Bose.         
	The land and land reforms minister has had differences on plot acquisition matters with the chief minister, and has been rapped by party bosses like Bose for speaking in public about the CPMs sagging fortunes.        
	Mollah made it clear, however, that he had not yet made up his mind on fighting the polls next year, nor had he informed the leadership. I shall inform my leadership only when I finally make up my mind, the minister told reporters in his Assembly chamber after participating in a debate on his departments budget.        
	Asked later tonight if his apparent reluctance to contest was a fallout of the Vedic Village land scandal in which there were allegations of his involvement, Mollah asserted that was not the case and suggested he was being maligned.        
	I am being falsely accused of giving land to the Vedic promoters. It pains me to learn that some party people are also pointing fingers at me. But I stand by what I had done. The land was given in accordance with the law.        
	CPM insiders spoke of another reason. Mollah, they said, has been sulking after the leadership rapped him for his public outburst against the party following the rout in last years Lok Sabha polls. Going by the results, it is clear that people didnt vote for us because they didnt want us to continue in power, he had said.         
	State CPM secretary Bose had taken serious note of the utterances, and told Mollah he should not have spoken in public against the party. But today, the minister sought to play down the warnings. I have been criticised within the party several times because of my nature to call a spade a spade. I shall continue to tell the truth, come what may.        
	Mollah also appeared hurt at not being inducted into the CPM state secretariat, the partys top decision-making body at the state level.        
	 I have been a member of the CPM since 1969 and have become a party MLA for the eighth consecutive time. But still the leadership does not consider me mature enough to induct me into the state secretariat. To some leaders of my party, I am too politically immature to be taken in the body.        
	Mollah denied suggestions he was backing out fearing reverses in his Assembly seat, Canning East, because of the winds of change blowing across the state. I had won the seat in 2006 by a margin of over 30,000 votes, while in last years Lok Sabha polls, the RSP nominee led by over 20,000 votes in my segment.        
	But CPM insiders said there had been a steady erosion in his vote bank since the Lok Sabha elections.

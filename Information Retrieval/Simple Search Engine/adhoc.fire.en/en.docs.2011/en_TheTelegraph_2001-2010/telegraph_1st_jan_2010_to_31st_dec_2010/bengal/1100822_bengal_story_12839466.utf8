	Burdwan, Aug. 21: The drought-like condition prevailing in 11 districts of Bengal today claimed its first victim with a Burdwan farmer committing suicide hours before the chief minister visited the district to discuss the situation.         
	Yunus Sheikh, 45, a resident of Basantapur village in Ausgram, gulped pesticide last night while his wife Ruby Bibi was busy cooking dinner. Sheikhs family members said he killed himself because of the low paddy yield as a result of scanty rainfall and the paucity of proper irrigation facilities. The farmer was in debt, they said.        
	Sheikh was rushed to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, 40km from his home, but was declared dead on arrival.        
	Asked to comment on Sheikhs death, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: The situation in the state is not so bad that farmers have to commit suicide.        
	Sheikhs family members said the farmer had a four-bigha plot where he used to cultivate paddy. He also worked as a sharecropper on another three-bigha plot.        
	Standing in front of the morgue, which is 3km from the place where the chief minister was discussing the drought-like situation with district officials, Sheikhs brother-in-law Zia-ur-Rahman said: Yunus was worried because of the falling yield of paddy. He had borrowed Rs 50,000 from local moneylenders after suffering losses but failed to repay the money.        
	Another family member said Sheikh had also failed to repay the money he had borrowed last year for his daughters wedding.        
	A member of the Ausgram panchayat said the cost of cultivating a bigha of paddy was around Rs 5,000. A bigha in Burdwan is expected to yield about 10 bags of the crop (a bag contains 50kg of rice).        
	Last year, Yunus had hoped to produce 70 bags of rice. However, he could manage only 50 bags, half of which he had to give to his fellow sharecroppers. He suffered a loss of around Rs 10,000, the panchayat member said.        
	Local residents said that though Burdwan was the rice bowl of the state, Ausgram depended on a small river called Kunur for irrigation water. However, farmers like Sheikh, who cannot afford pumps, have to depend on the rain.         
	Cop on CM duty dies        
	A traffic constable who was on VIP duty for the chief ministers visit to Burdwan was crushed under the wheels of a train when he tried to get down at Burdwan station today. Chedilal Prasad, 45, a resident of Durgapur, slipped and fell when he tried to get off after the Asanasol-Howrah Coalfield Express slowed down near the station.

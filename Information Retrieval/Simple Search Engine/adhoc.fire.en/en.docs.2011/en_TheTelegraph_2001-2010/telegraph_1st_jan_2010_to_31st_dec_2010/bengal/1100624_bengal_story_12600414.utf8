                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul stops work in Haldia
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, June 23: Nearly 300 Trinamul Congress supporters demanding jobs today stopped work at an upcoming logistic hub in Haldia on the first day of its recruitment.        
	They blocked the entrance to the Apeejay project premises, preventing 200-odd workers from joining duty, and drove a spanner into the job hopes of 20 local youths.        
	The company had today called for interview 40 villagers from families that had lost their land to the project to pick 20 security guards. Before they turned up came the Trinamul brigade carrying a banner of the Haldia Construction Workers Union.         
	Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari, who had led the Nandigram land movement two years ago, is the president of the union.        
	The company had distributed photo identity cards among landlosers in December following a Trinamul demand for preference to them during recruitment. Forty people from that group had been called today. But the agitators insisted that those who didnt have cards also be taken in. The recruitment process will remain suspended till we sort out the matter with them, said Sourav Daspatnaik, an Apeejay director.        
	The logistic hub will house godowns, office spaces for transport companies and parking lots for heavy vehicles. Work on roads and construction of godowns was on, added Daspatnaik.         
	The secretary of the Trinamul union, Sheikh Moniruddin, said: All those who are agitating today are landlosers and they should get jobs. Daspatnaik said the company was willing to issue more I-cards provided the agitators could prove that they were genuine landlosers.        
	Factory shut: In another part of Haldia, a pipe maker suspended work because of a Trinamul agitation demanding permanent jobs for 23 people who had been engaged by contractors. The human resource manager of Lalbaba Seamless said the decision was taken after general manager N. Hossains car was stoned.

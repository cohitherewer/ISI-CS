          PRONAB MONDAL                                                
	Shilda, Feb. 16: A whistle and two claps. That was the signal for the Maoists to begin their attack on the Shilda camp last evening.        
	Immediately after this, the combined Belpahari and East Singhbhum squads of the Maoists set off the first explosion, followed by many more and then heavy firing which, about 45 minutes later, ended with 24 Eastern Frontier Rifles personnel lying dead.        
	It was an attack that had been planned immediately after Union home minister P. Chidambarams meeting at Writers Buildings where it was decided that Bengal would launch joint operations with Jharkhand and Orissa.                 
	The task was entrusted to the Belpahari and East Singhbhum squads and we carried out our joint attack with perfect understanding, Maoist military wing chief Kishan said today.        
	The first task of the Maoists was to scrutinise the daily activities of the policemen. That was not difficult as they easily mingled with villagers in the crowded marketplace and made good use of the camps toilet, which the public had access to, to spy on the EFR personnel.        
	And what they saw pleasantly surprised them: once inside the camp, the policemen were a relaxed lot, dumping their weapons in their tents and lounging all over the place.        
	They observed every lapse on the part of EFR personnel at the camp and worked out their strategy accordingly, said an officer of the district intelligence branch.         
	It is a shame that we all were in the dark about it.         
	State police chief Bhupinder Singh admitted the same. We had no clue about the attack or any suspicious movement of Maoists around the camp, he said.         
	According to sources, the Maoists reached the camp from two ends  Jhargram and Belpahari. Two pick-up vans with 30 guerrillas moved towards the camp from Jhargram, along the state highway connecting the town with Bandwan in Purulia, and a convoy of six motorcycles proceeded from Belpahari. Both the groups reached camp at the same time, a source said.         
	The squad that came via Jhargram was apparently the one from East Singhbhum in Jharkhand.         
	None of them was carrying arms. They were hidden in the pick-ups. Since they were unarmed, they quickly mingled with the local crowd. Also, some of the women guerrillas broke up into pairs with the men in the squads and strolled near a lodge in the bazaar often used by couples from nearby places for a few hours for romantic trysts. No one suspected them of being Maoists.        
	Then, of course, at the signal at five in the evening, the attack began.        
	When the resistance from the police was weakening, the Maoists drove into the camp with their pick-ups and motorcycles and completed the rampage. Police chief Singh said 40 rifles were looted and the amount of ammunition taken was still being tabulated.        
	After the attack, the Maoists did not branch off. Instead, they all sped off towards the Jharkhand border, only 10km away. Before crossing into Jharkhand, they burnt the two pick-ups at the edge of the Kushboni forest and disappeared into the wilderness.

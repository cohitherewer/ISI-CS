	Purulia, Oct. 10: Suspected Maoists killed two brothers, both former CPM activists, in a Purulia village last night after accusing them of being police informers though the duo had snapped ties with the party following rebel threats.        
	Kalipada Chakraborty, 56, and Sukumar Chakraborty, 35, were dragged outside their adjacent houses and made to squat by one group of guerrillas, while another looted cash, jewellery and mobiles inside, police said.         
	The plunder over, the trussed-up duo were led to the fringes of their Tilaiya village in Balarampur and shot dead.        
	The deaths highlight the growing attacks in Purulia, where many rebels are suspected to have taken refuge as the joint forces turn the heat on them in neighbouring West Midnapore and CPM cadres reclaim Maoist hotbeds.        
	In last nights raid, the Maoists also beat up Subhas Chakraborty, 53, one of the brothers of Kalipada and Sukumar who stays nearby. Subhas is in hospital with four stitches on his head.        
	Kalipada works in a cloth store in Purulia town, while Sukumar is a labourer with a private company in Orissas Jharsuguda. The brothers had come home only yesterday morning and spent the day shopping for the Pujas.        
	Subhass son Susanta alleged that the rebels had not come only to kill. We had kept Rs 10,000 and some jewellery for my sisters wedding. The Maoists looted everything.         
	Sukumars wife Dolly said the rebels had ignored their pleas to spare the duo. We implored them with folded hands to spare my husband and his brother but they did not listen.        
	Purulia police chief Rajesh Yadav said one of the Maoist squads hiding in the Ayodhya Hills, near Tilaiya, had carried out the strike.

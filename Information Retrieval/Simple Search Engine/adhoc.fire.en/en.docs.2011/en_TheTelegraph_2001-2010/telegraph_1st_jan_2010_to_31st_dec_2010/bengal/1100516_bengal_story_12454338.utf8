                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Morcha damages tourist cars
          OUR BUREAU                           One of the vandalised vehicles at Rangpo, the entry point to Sikkim, on Saturday. (Chinlop Fudong Lepcha)                                  
	May 15: At least 10 vehicles, most of them ferrying tourists, were attacked on the highway that leads from Siliguri to Sikkim as Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters enforced the outfits two-day shutdown in the hills starting today.         
	Although a few drivers were roughed up, no tourists were touched.        
	Despite the Supreme Court asking the state government to ensure that traffic remained uninterrupted on NH31A, Sikkim remained cut off from the rest of the country. No car either moved up from Siliguri or came down from the hills today.        
	Sikkim police said the windscreens of at least five vehicles were smashed at Tarkhola, 8km from Rangpo, the entry point to Sikkim. The tyres of five other vehicles were deflated.        
	Except for a goods-carrying truck, all the other vehicles attacked were cars carrying tourists to the Himalayan state. The tourists were asked to get off the cars before the vehicles were vandalised.        
	The Morchas strike call failed to have any impact in Siliguri, the Terai and most parts of the Dooars.        
	If Bengal police provide security, we will try to send tourists and other passengers from here to Siliguri and bring back those stranded there, said M.S. Tuli, the East Sikkim police chief.        
	D. Anandan, the East Sikkim district collector, said he had urged Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta to act against those responsible for the attack.        
	Uday Saha, secretary of the Darjeeling District Taxi and Private Car Drivers Union, said: No vehicle went to Sikkim today as our drivers feared attacks by bandh supporters. We are yet to decide what to do tomorrow.        
	All establishments in the three hill subdivisions of Kalimpong, Darjeeling and Kurseong remained closed today. The Morcha is observing the strike to pressure the state and the Centre into agreeing to its terms on the territory to be brought under the proposed interim set-up for the hills.        
	The Morcha has announced another 10-day strike from June 12.        
	Several tourists in Sikkim missed their trains today because they failed to reach Siliguri. Darjeeling tourists had already left the hills after the Morchas announcement of the strike.        
	We have no option but to stay back even though we had train reservations from New Jalpaiguri today, said Manohar Karat, a tourist from Madhya Pradesh. He had arrived in Sikkim on May 12 in a group of 14.         
	The helicopter services of the Sikkim Tourism Development Corporation are operational but they are booked till Monday.         
	K.L. Tamta, the inspector-general of north Bengal, said: We have posted police personnel on the highway but this does not appear to be enough. We have asked for four companies of the CRPF.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM to follow Didi to Purulia
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM to follow Didi to Purulia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 3: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will hold a rally in Purulia on November 14, less than a fortnight after Mamata Banerjee addressed one there, reinforcing a recent trend where the two leaders public meetings in the districts have come within days of each other.        
	CPM leaders in Purulia, however, said they had no knowledge of Bhattacharjees rally, prompting the Trinamul Congress to claim that the meeting was planned by the Left leadership in Calcutta after Mamatas programme on October 30 drew a huge crowd.         
	Bilashibala Sahish, the Purulia zilla parishad sabhadhipati, said over the phone tonight: We dont know anything about the chief ministers programme in Purulia.         
	A CPM state committee member, however, said Bhattacharjees rally was planned following a meeting of the partys top leadership in Calcutta, including state secretary Biman Bose.         
	He said the chief ministers itinerary was yet to be conveyed to the party leaders in Purulia.        
	On October 30, Bhattacharjee had held a rally in Bankura, neighbouring Purulia. The next day, Mamata had organised a public meeting only 200 metres from the venue of the chief ministers rally.         
	The Trinamul chiefs rally had drawn a much bigger crowd than the chief ministers meeting.        
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee claimed Bhattacharjees planned rally was an effort to counter Mamatas meeting.        
	Reports about a huge turnout at our leaders Purulia rally must have worried him, Chatterjee said.        
	Chatterjee challenged the chief minister to hold a rally simultaneously with Mamata in any district. We will draw larger crowds everywhere, Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, said.

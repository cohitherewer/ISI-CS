	Kalyani, June 20: Five men, sleeping on the roadside, were mowed down this morning by an oil tanker whose driver had dozed off.        
	The arrested driver has admitted to falling asleep, said a police officer in Nadias Kaly-ani. The accident occurred on the outskirts of the town, about 65km from Calcutta.        
	The victims were porters. Trucks use the place to unload goods meant for Kalyani and neighbouring Halisahar and Kanchrapara. The five must have slept off there after working till late last night. Four of them were from Munger in Bihar. The other one was from Naihati, 20km from Kalyani.        
	The police said the empty tanker was heading to Hooghly district. Local people saw it travelling at great speed, veering off the road and climbing on the men on the grassland off the road.

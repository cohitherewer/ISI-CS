          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Behrampore, Dec. 20: Two officers suspended for allegedly selling seized cough syrup bottles stored at a Murshidabad police station to smugglers have fled after an FIR was lodged against them.        
	Officer-in-charge Pabitra Kumar Mustafi and an assistant sub-inspector Arun Kumar Sarkar have been missing since the FIR was registered yesterday.        
	Murshidabad superintendent of police B.L. Meena ordered the FIR against them for selling the confiscated Phensedyl cough syrup bottles, worth Rs 35 lakh, to smugglers from Bangladesh.        
	The two officers, who were on duty at the Raninagar police station in the Domkol area along the Bangla border, were suspended on December 11 after a smuggler revealed that the duo had sold him cartons of the syrup, often consumed by addicts for a quick high.        
	In the FIR, lodged by Domkol circle inspector Bibek Majumdar at the Raninagar police station, Mustafi and Sarkar have been charged with robbing and hiding government property, Meena said.        
	The police are on the lookout for the two officers who, some of their colleagues said, may have gone to their hometowns. Sarkar, the ASI, hails from nearby Behrampore.        
	The consignment of cough syrup bottles that had been seized while being smuggled to Bangladesh again landed in the hands of a smuggler, who revealed the source of his supply after he was held.         
	Another assistant sub-inspector had been sent back to the police lines for his suspected involvement in the sale.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cops thrashed in hijack mixup
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cops thrashed in hijack mixup
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          A crowd gathers at the spot in Panagarh where the cops were thrashed on Tuesday. Picture by Gour Sharma    
	Durgapur, Dec. 21: Thieves on the run, cops thrashed.        
	A Panagarh trader on the trail of a gang that had snatched his truck posing as policemen thrashed a team of real cops because they were travelling in a Bolero  the car model he wrongly believed some of the hijackers had escaped in.        
	The trader, Arvind Tiwari, and his friends believed they had caught the culprits until a team from a neighbouring police station arrived and discovered the case of mistaken identity.        
	Why have you beaten them up? asked a stunned officer from the other team. Tiwari, swaggering with what he believed was a prized catch, promptly explained that he had a tip-off from the nearby Bud Bud police station saying the hijackers were fleeing in a Bolero and that he had stopped them before the cops could.        
	It took him a while to realise he had barked up the wrong tree. The policemen were taken to a doctor. The missing truck was stopped near Burdwans Memari later, and two persons  this time the original criminals arrested. Ranjan Yadav and Mohammad Shabir confessed they were part of a Bihar car-jacking gang.         
	And then came the penny-dropping moment. Our accomplices fled in a Tata Sumo, not a Bolero, Yadav told the police, unwittingly revealing the main cause of the confusion that set off the bizarre chain of events.        
	It later emerged that the truck driver had confused the two models and told owner Tiwari the getaway vehicle was a Bolero. Both vehicles are SUVs and, to the less auto-savvy, they can sometimes appear similar.        
	The drama began around 1.30am, when the gang in police fatigues stopped the truck and asked for the papers. As the driver and his helper got off with the documents, two others from the gang sped off with the truck. The rest followed in the Sumo.        
	Tiwari, under the impression that it was a Bolero, informed Bud Bud police station, the closest to his home. Barricades were soon set up further down on the National Highway 2, towards Calcutta, and cops kept a vigil.        
	Around 4am, a Bolero with four uniformed cops was spotted and waved down. But the cops in the vehicle, under the illusion that they were being greeted by their colleagues, waved back and sped away.        
	The policemen on the road, thinking the culprits had given them the slip, informed Bud Bud police station as well as truck owner Tiwari. But the trader acted faster than the cops. He marshalled 20 of his friends for the pre-dawn swoop and set up his own barricades.        
	Soon, the Bolero with the four policemen pulled in and, seeing the crowd, stopped. Whats happened? Is it an accident? sub-inspector Mithun Ghosh asked as he got off. His queries were met with blows and kicks. Assistant sub-inspector Soumen Banerjee and two constables, Akul Upadhyay and Abdul Gaffar Khan, were also beaten up.        
	Durgapur additional police chief S.S. Sarkar said he would probe why the highway cops had informed the truck owner when it was not his business to be catching culprits. An FIR will be lodged against Tiwari and others, he said.

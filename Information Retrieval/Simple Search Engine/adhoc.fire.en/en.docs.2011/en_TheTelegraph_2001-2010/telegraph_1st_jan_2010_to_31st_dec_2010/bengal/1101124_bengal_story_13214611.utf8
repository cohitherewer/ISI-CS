	Tamluk/Gadiara, Nov. 23: Two container vessels today collided, apparently after one of them went adrift because of a snag, in a narrow stretch of the Hooghly where tide travails compound the space problem.        
	The 33 sailors of the two ships are safe but both vessels were damaged and started spilling oil after the 11.30am hit at Hooghly Point, around 50km from Calcutta. Neither sank because the silt-choked river is shallow there. Around 15 tonnes of oil spilled out of the ships, a volume experts said posed a localised threat to marine life.        
	The collision occurred sometime after Tiger Spring, which left Calcutta for Colombo at 8.30am with 12 crew members, drifted away from its designated course because of a locked steering wheel.         
	The ship could not move away in time when the other vessel, Green Valley, suddenly emerged in the channel and was hit on one side. Green Valley, with 21 sailors, was bound for Calcutta port from Singapore.        
	The collision spot, Hooghly Point, falls under Noorpur in South 24-Parganas. On the other side is Geonkhali in East Midnapore. The width of the river there is only around 200 metres while the average width (in other stretches of the river) is 350 metres. When Green Valley was emerging from the bend, Tiger Spring came in its way and caused the two to collide. Both were damaged, an official of the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) said.        
	Tiger Spring suffered a hole in its hull and floated away before getting stuck in the shallow riverbed. Water is entering the ship but there is no chance of the ship sinking, the official said. Green Valley was also damaged but to a lesser degree. Tiger Spring is from Gibraltar while Green Valley is a Bahamas-flagged vessel.        
	Arrangements were being made by the ships operators to close the holes and drain out the water. One of the ships (Green Valley) has been taken to (nearby) Diamond Harbour. We are hoping to take the other to Calcutta in two to three days after repairs, CPT chairperson M.L. Meena said.              
	He said a probe to determine the exact cause of the mishap had started. A thorough investigation into why this happened is on. The CPT has zero tolerance for such accidents.        
	Since there was a sharp bend and the vessels were moving slowly, the damage was limited, other officials said, adding dispersing chemicals and absorbing agents are being sent to minimise the impact of the fuel spill.        
	Subrata Ghosh, chief engineer of state pollution control board, said samples of the river water had been collected to determine the extent of the pollution. However, the river water is flowing and the oil will not settle. But there could be some localised impact on the rivers flora and fauna, said Ghosh.        
	Tapan Dolui, 22, a steamer driver, who was passing within a kilometre of the two ships at the time of the collision, said he heard a loud thud. I saw the ships collide and the crew members running around on the decks. There was too much turbulence in the river water as a result of the crash. So I did not go near it.        
	Samiran Samanta, a tea stall owner at Gadiara, on the other side of the river in Howrah district, recalled a commotion but did not know what had happened initially. We did not understand initially what it was all about. Some people came running from the riverside and told us that two ships had collided, he said.        
	As news of the collision spread, officials of the Coast Guard, police from East Midnapore and South 24-Parganas rushed to the spot. We had sent our rescue teams to both ships and requested the crew members to come with us but they refused as they didnt want to abandon their ships, East Midnapore police chief Ashok Biswas said.

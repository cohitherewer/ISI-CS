          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 9: Transport minister Ranjit Kundu today said lal jhanda was creating problems in giving Bengal better services, the flag reference seen as a swipe at the Left trade unions obstructionist ways.        
	Frequent resorting to the flaunting of the lal jhanda is creating problems. Transport bodies need more professionalism, otherwise it will be difficult to introduce new proposals and bring down costs, Kundu, a CPM leader, told reporters in the Assembly lobby after replying to a debate.        
	Kundu said more professionalism would have to be introduced in running the loss-laden state-run transport corporations.         
	Transport secretary Sumantra Choudhury echoed Kundu, saying cost-cutting would have been possible if there was a professional attitude among the employees. He did not specify whether he meant layoffs and pay cuts.        
	Speaking in the House earlier, Kundu was careful to heap some praise. The role of these organisations (corporations) is commendable. They run bus services in locations and routes where the railways cannot reach.

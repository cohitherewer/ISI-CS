	Saltora (Bankura), April 12: Villagers backed by the CPM have stalled the exploration of methane by a company licensed by the government to do so in Bengals coal-rich belt, demanding jobs in case it strikes the gas.        
	Two days ago, a group of villagers landed at the Great Eastern Energy Corporations drilling site at Bamuntore in Bankura and asked its engineers and officials to stop work. The group demanded jobs as labourers and guards.         
	The company lodged an FIR yesterday after the villagers stoned some of the engineers eager to resume work.         
	CPM supporters had stopped drilling work at a site about 4km from Bamuntore last December, demanding jobs, roads and a temple. They had relented in about two weeks after the company promised to repair some roads and construct culverts.        
	The Bamuntore residents vowed not to climb down so easily. They have formed a Bamuntore Anchalik Jiban Jibika Committee, almost on the lines of the Trinamul Congress, which specialises in organising such resistance and has stalled several projects. However, after successive electoral defeats at the hands of Trinamul, some in the CPM possibly think Mamata Banerjees is the way to go.        
	Jiban Mishra, 32, a jobless man and chief of the Bamuntore committee, argued that if Great Eastern found the gas, it would make money. What will we get? We want jobs for at least one member of each family in the village or we will not allow them to work. We wont give up as easily as Bauripara, he said.         
	Another villager, Ajay Maji, 30, said: Villagers across Bengal are demanding jobs wherever a factory is coming up. Why shouldnt we? The company will have to give us jobs, construct a hospital and roads in our village.        
	The assistant general manager of the company, Debashis Mahanta, rejected the conditions set by the villagers. The way work is being stopped repeatedly by villagers is very frustrating. We have received their charter of demands but there is no question of accepting them, he said.        
	It is impossible to promise jobs to villagers because nei- ther gas exploration nor extraction is labour-intensive, said a Great Eastern official. We only need skilled personnel and machines.        
	In a bid to end the impasse, Saltora block development officer Subhabrata Mandal had called a meeting today which the chief of the local CPM-run panchayat was told to attend. But the villagers refused to attend the meeting.         
	Panchayat chief Ujjal Mondal backed the villagers demands. How can we ignore them? They need jobs. The company should engage local youths in unskilled jobs.        
	However, the district CPM leadership distanced itself from the agitation. We dont support such arm-twisting because we want a healthy working condition in Bengal. I have asked our local leaders to speak to the villagers and persuade them to withdraw their agitation, said Bankura CPM secretary Amiya Patra.         
	The Delhi-based Great Eastern is exploring coal-bed methane in Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia to produce compressed natural gas. In Asansol, it has set up 25 wells, and 800 autos run on the green fuel sold through Indian Oil pumps in Asansol, Raniganj and Durgapur towns.

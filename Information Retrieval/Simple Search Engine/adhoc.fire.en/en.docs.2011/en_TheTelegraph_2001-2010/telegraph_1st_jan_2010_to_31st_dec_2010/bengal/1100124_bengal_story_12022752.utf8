          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Jan. 23: The state government has scaled down its Milon Mela rent for the book fair by almost half at the request of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild.        
	The rent that the guild, which organises the fair, had been asked to pay was Rs 62 lakh. It was brought down to Rs 37 lakh.         
	Tridib Chatterjee, the guild secretary, said: We are registered as a social welfare organisation. We told the patrons, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen, that unlike an industrial fair, a book fair is not a buyers and sellers meet. The stall charges are lesser than the ones set up for trade fairs and the entry fee nominal. He said because the guild was registered as a welfare organisation we got a tax relief when a fire razed the book fair at the Maidan a few years back.         
	Some booksellers scoffed at the welfare-organisation argument. The guild runs buses for the fair. You have stalls for entertainment and food. With a footfall of a few lakhs everyday, how can it not be a business? asked an official of a publishing house that has a stall at Milon Mela.         
	The fair opens on Wednesday.         
	Last December, ahead of the Industrial India Trade Fair at Milon Mela, the government raised the rent for the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry from Rs 30 lakh to about Rs 49 lakh.        
	The business chamber has now said it, too, would press the government for a slash in rent.We would also press for the same (cut), said Samir Ghosh, chairman of its fair committee.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha sermon to police
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 6: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee urged police not to distinguish between the rich and the poor and to deal firmly with criminals, on a day he completed 10 years as chief minister.        
	Later today, a relaxed chief minister hummed Aguner poroshmoni chhowao prane at a programme organised by the Missionaries of Charity in Tangra, 4km from Park Circus Maidan where he addressed the police event.         
	At Park Circus, where he inaugurated the southeast division of Calcutta Police, Bhattacharjee said: There is a practice in our society to give a patient hearing to a person who comes to a police station in a car. But when someone wearing a dirty shirt comes to register a complaint, he is not given any attention. I would request my senior officers to ensure that poor people get respect when they come to a police station.         
	Bhattacharjee, who is also the state home minister, asked the law-enforcers to show respect to the poor. Garib manush ke samman diye kotha bolun.         
	A large portion of the new police division, which has six police stations, is inhabited by poor Muslims. The six police stations are at Tangra, Topsia, Ballygunge, Gariahat, Karaya and Lake.         
	The minorities should not develop a perception that they wont receive any help from the administration. They should not hesitate to approach the police, the chief minister said at the event.        
	He urged the police to deal firmly with criminals. Eta chor-police khela noy (this is not a hide-and-seek game between criminals and police). Criminals have no place (in society). They have to be firmly dealt with, come what may, he said, hinting at a nexus between law-breakers and the police.         
	The Trinamul Congress smelt politics in Bhattacharjees sermon to the police.         
	The chief minister is in charge of the home department. He is himself responsible for the state-sponsored terror. His sudden (public) realisation of a police-criminal nexus is aimed at wooing back those who had deserted the CPM in the Lok Sabha elections last year, Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi said.         
	From the police event, the chief minister went to Shanti Daan, a home for destitute women, in Tangra.         
	He hummed to himself as the participants at the programme sang Aguner poroshmoni. However, he stopped as soon as he noticed TV cameras focusing on him.         
	After the song, the master of ceremonies congratulated Bhattacharjee on his completion of 10 years as chief minister. Bhattacharjee stood up, folded his hands and smiled at the audience. He had taken over as chief minister from Jyoti Basu on November 6, 2000.         
	Bhattacharjee inaugurated a new wing of Shanti Daan and promised support to the authorities of the home.

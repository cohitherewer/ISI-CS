The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | City meet on Maoists
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      City meet on Maoists
          Our Bureau                       Security forces in Lalgarh. File picture                                
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The chief ministers of four states rocked by Maoist violence will meet in Calcutta on February 9 to fine-tune plans with the Union home minister for joint security operations.        
	The chief ministers of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand will meet in Writers Buildings. Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen today said the state government would focus on the necessity of joint operations with Jharkhand and stress on better coordination with neighbouring states.        
	We had proposed earlier that the joint operation be launched in Jharkhand too because the Maoists murder here and escape to Jharkhand through dense forests. We want to raise this issue at the meeting. We also need better co-ordination with the neighbouring states. The requirement of additional central forces is also an issue, Sen said.        
	Asked why Chidambaram was coming to Calcutta for the meeting instead of holding it in Delhi, Sen said: The home minister has been visiting various places and holding meetings on the Maoist problem. I cannot recollect exactly when and where he went for such meetings but the Writers meeting was proposed by him.        
	The Prime Minister has called a meeting of all chief ministers to discuss the general law and order situation on February 7 in Delhi, but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may skip it because a CPM rally is scheduled that day at the Brigade Parade ground.        
	Last year, too, Bhattacharjee had skipped a meeting called by the Prime Minister and sent the chief and home secretaries, a gesture that drew flak from Delhi as no minister was sent. We have plans to send a minister to attend the February 7 meeting, said a home department official.        
	In Delhi, Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren met Chidambaram and gave his governments unambiguous commitment to support the operation against the Maoists.        
	After the meeting with Soren, Chidambaram said: He told me that there is no change in the Jharkhand governments policy and that he is on board with other chief ministers of Naxal-affected states on the strategy being worked out.... If they (the Maoists) wish to come for talks after abjuring violence, they are welcome. If there is no response, the anti-Naxal strategy, being formulated, will continue.        
	Rebel arrests        
	The police have arrested 12 persons allegedly involved in Monday nights Maoist encounter at Bankura in which a policeman was killed. Four persons were arrested overnight in Bandwan, Purulia. Eight others were arrested from villages at Barikul in Bankura later. Bankura police chief Vishal Garg said the 12 were either Maoist action squad members or linkmen.

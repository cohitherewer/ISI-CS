The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | To work or not: Rs 67 decides
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      To work or not: Rs 67 decides
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Workers at a tea garden in the Dooars on bandh day. (Biplab Basak)                                  
	Siliguri, July 5: Eighty per cent of tea garden workers in the Dooars reported for work today because they could not afford to forgo the Rs 67 they earn a day.        
	More than 180 of the 227 tea gardens in the Dooars remained open with most of the workers, who earlier owed allegiance to Citu, saying they could not afford to give up their days wages.         
	Except for a few tea estates in the Terai and the Dooars, workers reported for duty in about 80 per cent of the gardens. The strike has failed to impact the industry. The workers have realised that participating in strikes and parting with their wages will not help them, said Shukra Munda, the chairperson of the Progressive Tea Workers Union, the trade union of the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad.         
	The tribal outfit has been making inroads into the Dooars and the Terai, displacing dominant unions like Citu and the Congresss Intuc.         
	Around 80 per cent of the tea gardens in the Dooars and the Terai have Parishad-led workers unions. The Parishad has convinced workers not to support strikes called by the two unions because they had not organised strikes to protest the shutdown of tea gardens in the region.        
	The workers cannot relate to the cause of todays strike (the hike in fuel prices). Their problems are more basic, like the lack of drinking water, low wages, dilapidated quarters, delay in disbursement of ration, non-payment of gratuities and provident fund by a section of employers, and the lack of employment and educational opportunities. As none of the established political parties are addressing these issues, it is natural that the workers and their families will not join the strike, Munda said.         
	Somra Baraik, a worker at one of the tea estates in the Terai, said: If we dont go to work, the management will not pay us. If I dont earn the minimum amount of Rs 67 I get every day, it will be impossible for me to buy essential commodities even if the prices of these items come down, he said.

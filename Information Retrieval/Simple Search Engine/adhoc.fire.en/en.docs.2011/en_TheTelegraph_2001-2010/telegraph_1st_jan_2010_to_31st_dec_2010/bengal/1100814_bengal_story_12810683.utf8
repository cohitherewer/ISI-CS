          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The cars burnt by the Maoists in Jamboni. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, Aug. 13: Maoists and Peoples Committee activists set fire to two cars of a tour operator in West Midnapores Jamboni yesterday for refusing to rent out more than one vehicle to ferry villagers to Mamata Banerjees Lalgarh rally on Monday.         
	Around 35 armed Maoists and 100 committee activists broke into Prabir Suins two-storey house in Kadamdihi village around midnight, shouting the names of Prabir and his two brothers.        
	However, the trio sneaked out through a backdoor and took shelter in a neighbours house, leaving around 15 family members, including their elderly parents, uncles, women and children, behind.        
	Prabirs son Kaushik said the gang threatened to blow up the door with a landmine after he refused to open it. They broke the iron grille and the wooden door with crowbars and pickaxes and stormed into the house, he said.        
	They gave me a thrashing. Then, some of the rebels tied my hands and took me to a nearby jungle where they held a kangaroo court.        
	Kaushik added: I told the rebels we could provide only one vehicle as the others had already been booked. They said that as punishment, I would have to set our four vehicles (two trekkers and two pick-up vans) on fire myself.         
	But by the time the Maoists had brought Kaushik back to the village, the gang members who had stayed back had already set two of the vehicles ablaze. One of them gave me a lighted torch and ordered me to set the remaining vehicles on fire, he said.         
	But suddenly, there was an explosion from one of the vehicles and the gang retreated in fear. Taking the opportunity, I escaped, he added.        
	The police said the Suins had lodged a complaint alleging that the Maoists had also ransacked their house and taken away Rs 80,000 in cash and gold jewellery.

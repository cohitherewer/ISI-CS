The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Left rules out transport fare hike for now
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Left rules out transport fare hike for now
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            (From top) Bhattacharjee and Dasgupta                                
	Calcutta, July 17: The Left Front today ruled out an immediate hike in transport fares and decided to wait till the July 21 meeting of the empowered committee of finance ministers in Delhi that would discuss the increase in fuel prices.         
	The decision was taken at a front meeting in Alimuddin Street that was attended by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	Front chairman Biman Bose said after the meeting: Our transport minister (Ranjit Kundu) explained to us the current situation and the unions demand for a hike in bus, minibus and taxi fares. We discussed the issue and decided that there is no need for an immediate transport fare hike. We will wait for the outcome of the empowered committee meeting in which the Centre-sponsored fuel price hike will be discussed. After that, the Left Front will again review the matter.        
	Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Trinamul Congress-backed Bengal Bus Syndicate, threatened an agitation if the associations demands were not met.         
	The fuel price hike is costing us an additional Rs 9,000 per bus every month. We have two demands: either bus fares be hiked or let the state government reduce sales tax on diesel. If there is no fare hike, we will agitate for a reduction in sales tax. Our association will meet on July 19 to discuss the course of action, which may include a strike, Saha said.         
	Sources said the front partners had agreed on not increasing fares now. A CPI leader said at todays meeting that most transporters associations were dominated by Trinamul, which was only demanding a tax rollback by the state government and not by the Centre.        
	If that is so, politics is definitely playing a role. So why should we dilute our agitation against the Centre on this issue (fuel price hike)? a front leader asked at the meeting.        
	The Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government yesterday reduced the tax on diesel from 20 per cent to 12.5 per cent, raising questions why Bengal wasnt doing so and prompting the Left Front leadership to go into todays emergency huddle.        
	Justifying the fronts decision, Bose said international oil prices might fall in the near future. If they did, he added, it would be difficult to persuade transporters to reduce fares if they were hiked now.        
	Bose said state finance minister Asim Dasgupta had sent a letter to the Union petroleum minister, asking him to state the reasons for the fuel price hike. Dasgupta is the chairman of the empowered committee of finance ministers.        
	The front chairman said Dasgupta had been asked to find out if a reduction in fuel tax and cess on petro products was possible. But first it is necessary to know whether such relief is necessary. I cannot say anything hypothetical now.         
	Bose said that in Delhi, public transport ran on compressed natural gas and not diesel. So, slashing tax on diesel wouldnt mean much for commuters. Delhi cannot be a model for other states, he said. The capital also gets lump sum subsidy from the Centre that other states dont, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata-Sonia date
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata-Sonia date
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 19: Mamata Banerjee has decided to attend UPA IIs first anniversary bash in Delhi on Saturday and observers feel the development will help the Congress and the Trinamul Congress improve relations that have got strained with the collapse of the civic poll alliance in Bengal.         
	Although Mamata was initially said to be reluctant to attend the event, she changed her mind after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chief Sonia Gandhis political secretary spoke to her last night.        
	A Trinamul minister today confirmed Mamata would attend the dinner being hosted by the Prime Minister at his 7 Race Course Road residence.        
	It is Mamatas political compulsion to stay with the UPA and the Congress, though she cannot see eye to eye with state Congress leaders, including chief Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Even after she had announced that her party had no alliance with the Congress anywhere in Bengal following the collapse of the seat-sharing talks for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, she had asserted that it would not result in her split with the UPA. I shall not disturb the (UPA) government as long as I can work for the people with honour.         
	A Trinamul minister now campaigning for the municipal polls in the districts said: The acceptance of the Prime Ministers invite reaffirms Mamatas resolve to continue with the Congress, regardless of what happens in Bengal.        
	He added that the Trinamul chief would take a day off from her busy campaign schedule to visit Delhi. She will return to Calcutta the next day. One or two of us might accompany Mamata as the Prime Minister has invited all six of us (the Union ministers of state from the party), the Trinamul leader said.         
	It would be interesting to see if Mamata speaks to Mukherjee about Bengal politics before or after the dinner. She has not been on talking terms with the finance minister since the alliance fell through earlier this month.         
	Mamata has publicly held Mukherjee responsible for the split, accusing him of giving the go-ahead to state Congress leaders to field candidates against Trinamul nominees in 108 wards in Calcutta. Mamata had offered only 25 to her ally in the 141-seat city civic body.        
	Mukherjee, however, in his effort to rebuild the bridges with Mamata, has time and again told campaign meetings that the absence of the alliance for the civic polls would have no bearing on next years Assembly elections, in which the Congress will tie up with Trinamul to oust the CPM.        
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya is optimistic about a Mamata-Mukherjee one-to-one. That will clear the cloud, he said.         
	CM sees reversal        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the 15 lakh people who had voted against the Left in the Lok Sabha polls had started reposing their faith in us once again.         
	Of the 15 lakh, a large se-ction is poor, backward class and Muslim. But we have not sat idle since the Lok Sabha polls. Instead, we have tried to find out the reason why they went against us. Now, they have started reposing their faith in us, he told a TV channel.

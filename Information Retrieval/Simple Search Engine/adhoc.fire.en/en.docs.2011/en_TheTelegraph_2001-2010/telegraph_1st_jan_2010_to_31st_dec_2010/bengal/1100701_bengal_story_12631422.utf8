The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ex-JU girls on cop radar
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Ex-JU girls on cop radar
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, June 30: The CID today lodged an FIR against two women, both former Jadavpur University students, for their alleged links with Maoists.        
	Debolina Chakraborty and Joyita Sarkar have been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).        
	The names of Debolina and Joyita cropped up while the CID was interrogating the five Maoist leaders who were arrested yesterday from the southern fringes of the city.         
	Of the arrested five, Madhusudan Mandal, a CPI (Maoist) state committee leader, has been accused of being involved in the murder of a Trinamul Congress leader in Nandigrams Sonachura last year.         
	The five have been remanded in 12 days police custody.        
	Anuj Sharma, the deputy inspector-general of the CID, said one of the arrested persons, Rajesh Mandal, was carrying a letter written by Debolina. The letter was signed Debu. We have learnt that this Debu is actually Debolina. She is a resident of Tarak Mitra Lane in Tollygunge and is absconding, Sharma said. CID sources said the five have also said Joyita is linked to them.         
	However, Debolina and Joyita told The Telegraph they had no links with the Maoists. They said they were members of Matangini Mahila Samity (MMS), an organisation that had held rallies in Nandigram, Singur and Lalgarh.        
	They said they had been part of an MMS team that had held meetings with arrested Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities leader Chhatradhar Mahato in Lalgarh.        
	We are not absconding. We are members of the MMS and have participated in several protest rallies in Nandigram and Singur. But that does not mean we are Maoists, said Joyita, a resident of Dum Dum.         
	While Debolina was a student of International relations at Jadavpur University, Joyita studied Bengali in the same batch.         
	Maoists hit cop        
	A police sub-inspector was injured in an encounter with Maoists in Sonamukhi village, around 5km from Ghritakham where a security force jawan was killed on June 26 in a gunfight with the rebels.         
	Ajay Gupta took a bullet in his right leg during the encounter, which took place inside a house where the Maoists were holed up. A CRPF jawan was also injured.

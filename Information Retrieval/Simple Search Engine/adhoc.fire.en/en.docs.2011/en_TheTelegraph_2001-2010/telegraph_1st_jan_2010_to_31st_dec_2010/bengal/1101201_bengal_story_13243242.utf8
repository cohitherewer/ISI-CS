          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Nov. 30: A doe that had been trampling and eating crops was beaten by residents of an East Midnapore village, trussed up and left to die.         
	A farmer last night snared the Sambar with a fishing net at a field on the outskirts of Hamidpur, near the Orissa border. Around 100 villagers then beat up the Sambar, an endangered species, with sticks and canes. The animal, two metres long and weighing 180kg, was then tied to a pole and carried to the village.         
	At the village, the residents trussed up the doe. Writhing in pain, the animal tried to free itself, aggravating its injuries. The doe started tiring around 4am and died a few hours later. The villagers said the animal had been trampling their paddy and eating up brinjals and cucumbers for the past four months.         
	Forest officials said the doe used often strayed into the fields from an Orissa forest nearby.         
	Forest officials had earlier tried to catch the doe but failed.

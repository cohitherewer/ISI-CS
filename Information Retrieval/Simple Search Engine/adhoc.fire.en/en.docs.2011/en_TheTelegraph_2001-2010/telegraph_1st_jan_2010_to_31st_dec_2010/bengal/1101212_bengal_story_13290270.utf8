The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sop for part-time teachers
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Sop for part-time teachers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee at the rally on Saturday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 11: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today announced that temporary teachers in state-aided schools will be in service till the age of 60, moving to retain support among a group that has traditionally backed the ruling Left.        
	A government order has been issued to ensure service protection for para-teachers. Now that you can work till the age of 60 years, we will try and ensure that you get proper financial benefits from time to time, the chief minister told a gathering of nearly 4,000 such teachers at Calcuttas Metro Channel this afternoon.        
	The move will benefit 56,000 para-teachers, hired on a temporary basis to meet the targets of the Centres Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) scheme that began in 1997. The fate of such teachers was tied to the scheme, scheduled to end in 2015, leaving them in a state of uncertainty. Bhattacharjees announcement ends the suspense.        
	Para-teachers in primary schools are paid Rs 5,400 a month and those in secondary schools Rs 7,425. The corresponding minimum salaries for full-time teachers are Rs 13,500 in primary schools and Rs 19,500 in secondary ones. The managing committees of the schools recruit para-teachers, generally from the locality.        
	The Opposition dubbed the announcement a pre-poll sop. Pushed to the wall after losing in successive polls since the 2008 panchayat elections, the chief minister is now desperate to woo para-teachers before the Assembly polls. But we believe para-teachers will not be misguided, Trinamul state chief Subrata Bakshi said.        
	A CPM state committee member admitted that the announcement was aimed at winning over the teaching community. There is no denying that a sizeable section of para-teachers will back us because of the relief.        
	Bhattacharjee blamed the Centre for the job uncertainty, saying it had not agreed to provide funds for such teachers salaries after the completion of the scheme in 2015. It will be difficult arranging the funds. But we cannot terminate your services in the middle of your career because of the whimsical attitude of the Centre, Bhattacharjee said in his speech while inaugurating the first state-level conference of the Nikhin Banga Para-Teachers Association. The newly floated body is affiliated to Citu, the CPMs labour arm.         
	But a teacher at the venue demanded more. The state government should also remove the anomaly in the pay scales (between those of full-fledged and temporary teachers), said a para-teacher from North 24-Parganas.         
	The state had initially rejected the Centres recommendation to appoint para-teachers, when the scheme started in 1997, as it felt it would not be possible to recruit quality teachers from areas around the schools but agreed later.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      80 doctors retch in hotel after conference cocktail and dinner
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Dec. 12: Eighty doctors who had gathered for a conference fell ill this morning in their hotel and pointed to bad food, though the hotel thinks the guests drank one too many at the cocktail and dinner yesterday.         
	Twelve of the 80 otorhinolaryngologists (ENT specialists) had to be taken to a hospital. The doctors complained of nausea, cramps, diahorrea, vomiting and dehydration.         
	It appears that something was wrong with the food that was served last night, said Utpal Jana, attached to the ENT department at NRS Medical College. As many as 80 of the participants suffered from the symptoms. We filed a complaint today with the assistant chief medical officer of health, Durgapur.         
	The doctors had been treated to peas pulao, naan, cauliflower kalia, paneer butter masala, dal, chicken masala, fish curry, salad and pudding on the lawns of Peerless Inn in the city.         
	Whisky and white rum were served with chicken and vegetable pakoras as well as fish fingers. All the items were prepared by the hotel, Jana said.        
	But Peerless Inns food and beverage manager Bhaskar Ray asked: How could most of them have had breakfast this morning at the hotel if they were unwell?         
	He denied that the food had made the doctors ill. This is the first time that such a thing has happened to our guests. We always serve fresh food.        
	He claimed the doctors had too much of alcohol, more than (had been consumed by) any other party at the hotel. This could have led to the sickness, he added.         
	Jana countered the hotels claim, saying doctors knew what happened from excess drinking. On an average, each person had two pegs. Its not because of that  something was wrong with the food, he insisted.        
	Mihir Kumar Nandi, the acting assistant chief medical officer of health, Durgapur, who later visited the hotel, said: I inspected the kitchen and the fridge. I found it contained cooked food that was at least a day old, proving that the hotel did keep old items. He, however, could not collect samples of last nights dinner as he was told that nothing was left of it.         
	Nandi said 12 of the doctors who seemed more ill than the others went to the Durgapur sub-divisional hospital where they were given antibiotics to stop the nausea and vomiting. None had to be admitted, he said.        
	About 250 ENT specialists from across the state had participated in the conference of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India (Bengal chapter), which began on Friday. Seventy doctors were from Calcutta and its suburbs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata emissary to Baroma to stay off Left show
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata emissary to Baroma to stay off Left show
          BARUN GHOSH                          Binapani Debi                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Mamata Banerjee has apparently prevailed on Binapani Debi Thakurani, the chief adviser of the All-India Matua Mahasabha whose 1.2 crore members were often wooed by the Left Front, against attending a government-sponsored event tomorrow where her eldest son would be felicitated.         
	The state backward classes welfare department will confer the Sri Sri Thakur Harichand-Guruchand prize on Kapil Krisha Thakur at Rabindra Sadan. Kapil Krishna, the sanghadhipati of Matua Mahasabha, will be felicitated for his sustained work for the uplift of the Matuas, a Scheduled Caste community.         
	Advertisements were published today in several dailies, including CPM organ Ganashakti, announcing that the chief minister would hand over the prize to Kapil Krishna in the presence of Binapani Debi, whom followers refer to as Baroma.         
	But Mamata, the chief patron of the Matua Mahasabha, reportedly sent Trinamul Congress MLA Jyotipriya Mullick to the 92-year-old Baromas residence in North 24-Parganas Thakurnagar yesterday in an apparent attempt to dissuade her from attending the programme.        
	Baroma has promised me that she wont participate in the programme when I called on her at Mamatadis behest, Mullick said.        
	Baromas youngest son Manjil Krishna Thakur said: Ma will not participate in the event. She has taken strong exception to the manner in which the government published her name as a participant without her consent.         
	Manjil Krishna, the saha sanghadhipati of the Mahasabha, slammed the government for suddenly waking up to the plight of the Matuas.         
	Matuas were traditional Left voters. But we voted for Mamatadi in last years Lok Sabha polls because the CPM has done nothing for us. The CPM is actually trying to win back the Matuas by organising the event, he said.        
	Asked about his elder brothers decision to accept the award, Manjil Krishna said: Dada will be present to take the award since he has been chosen by a five-member expert committee. But the acceptance does not mean that we will vote for the Left in the Assembly polls.         
	Kapil Krishna was not available for comment.        
	Around 1.2 crore Matuas live in 74 Assembly constituencies. in eight districts.         
	Backward classes welfare minister Jogesh Burman said he was not aware that Baromas consent had not been taken for the ad.

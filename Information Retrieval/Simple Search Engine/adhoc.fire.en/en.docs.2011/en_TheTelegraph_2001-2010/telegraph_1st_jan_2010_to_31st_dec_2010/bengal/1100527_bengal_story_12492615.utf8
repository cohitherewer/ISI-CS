                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Grassroots vs grass 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 26: Pranab Mukherjees grass has got Mamata Banerjees goat.        
	 Congress aar BJP holo CPM-er prokalpa. Trinamul holo CPM-er bikalpa (the Congress and the BJP are projects of the CPM. Only the Trinamul Congress is an alternative to the CPM), the Trinamul chief told a rally in south Calcutta, dipping into her quiver of rhyming arrows but not finding a botanical riposte to Mukherjees barb.        
	Tara ki ghas katbe (will they cut grass)? Mukherjee had asked yesterday, indirectly referring to Mamatas repeated assertions that her party was the sole alternative to the Left in Bengal.        
	Mamata, too, did not name Mukherjee but sources said she had taken strong exception to his statement. She was briefed by a party MP last night itself on the state Congress presidents speech at a north Calcutta meeting, the sources added.        
	At the Kasba rally today, the Trinamul chief claimed that had her party not supported the Congress, they would not have been able to form the second UPA government.         
	Trinamul will not take anything lying down. If necessary, Trinamul will go it alone, she said.        
	Without naming the Congress, Mamata said: They left the battlefield midway. They are traitors, out to help the CPM. We will not bow to pressures from a party that acts as a CPM agent.        
	Mamata said the Left would attack the Congress over issues like price rise but during the night, you will find CPM leaders at the houses of Congress bosses.        
	She accused the CPM of falling at the feet of the Congress whenever the Left party is in trouble.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Durgapur, Dec. 16: Relatives of a patient who died at a private hospital in Durgapur today allegedly thrashed a doctor and women staff accusing them of handing over the body to police for post-mortem without informing them.        
	The demonstrators alleged that the patient, an accident victim whose legs had to be amputated after he was admitted almost two weeks back, died because of medical negligence and that the hospital was trying to hush up the matter.         
	An LCD television set and computers were damaged, glass panes smashed and security guards chased away with bamboo sticks in the half-hour rampage by the 50-strong mob at Mission Hospital before police arrived.        
	The hospital denied the charges of negligence in the treatment of Jitendra Sukla, 26,  an employee of a private steel unit in nearby Jamuria  and filed a complaint, following which seven of the attackers were arrested.        
	The hospital authorities had given the body to the police by the time we came. Security guards (of the hospital) beat up my younger son Avishek and my two brothers when they asked for the body. I have paid Rs 4 lakh but the hospital has not provided expense details, said Jitendras father Raj Narayan, a retired schoolteacher.         
	Prabir Mukherjee, chief executive officer of the hospital, denied the claims. We handed over Jitendras body to the police in front of his brother Avishek. We also informed them about the death on time. But the mob, mostly relatives and friends of the deceased, barged in and started beating up our female staff members. Medical superintendent Partha Pal was punched when he tried to intervene. We lodged an FIR.        
	Hospital authorities said that Jitendra, admitted on December 4 after a road accident and had been on ventilator, died of severe infections that worsened his condition and eventually led to a cardiac arrest this morning.        
	The youth was brought to our hospital six hours after the accident. By then gangrene had set in We amputated both legs and put him on antibiotics. But fresh infection could not be stopped and he died, Mukherjee said.         
	Late this evening, Jitendras relatives lodged a complained with sub-divisional officer of Durgapur against the hospital.         
	The officer, Moumita Basu, said she had received the complaint and would ask the police to look into it.

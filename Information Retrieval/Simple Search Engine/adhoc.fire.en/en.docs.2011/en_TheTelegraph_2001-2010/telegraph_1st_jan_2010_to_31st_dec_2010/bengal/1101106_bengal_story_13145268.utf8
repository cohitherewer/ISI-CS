The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | AMU worry for Mamata
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      AMU worry for Mamata
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 5: An invite to the foundation-laying ceremony for an Aligarh Muslim University branch has apparently landed Mamata Banerjee in a fix.        
	Vice-chancellor P.K. Abdul Azis has invited the Trinamul Congress chief to the November 20 event at Murshidabads Jangipur.         
	But what is said to have riled Mamata is that the chief minister has also been invited.         
	Trinamuls avowed stand is that none from the party will share the stage with the chief minister. Of late, Trinamul has boycotted all events attended by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	However, if Mamata chooses to stay away from the event, she risks upsetting the districts large population of Muslim voters, sources in her party said.        
	Trinamul leaders did not completely rule out the chances of Mamata attending the programme, where Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and human resource development minister Kapil Sibal are expected.        
	Nothing is impossible in politics. Let us first receive the invite from the AMU vice-chancellor, a Trinamul vice-president said today.         
	The Trinamul leader said Mamata would take a decision after assessing the possible erosion in our minority vote bank in Murshidabad if she stayed away.        
	Subrata Saha, the chief of the Murshidabad unit of the party, said that if Mamata attended the programme, it would send a positive message to the party rank and file and the minority voters.         
	Saha said Trinamul had performed better than the Congress in the Jangipur municipality in the May civic polls. Didis presence at the event will consolidate our minority vote bank here, Saha said.        
	A Trinamul youth leader said the party had no toehold in Murshidabad even a few months ago because of Congress MP Adhir Chowdhurys sway over all the three parliamentary seats in the district.         
	But after the good show in the civic polls, we have started rebuilding the organisation. Didis presence will enthuse the party workers here, the youth leader said.        
	AMU vice-chancellor Azis said over the phone from Kerala: I am very much expecting Mamataji on the august occasion. I have also invited the chief minister.         
	Azis said the chief minister had agreed to attend the programme.        
	The Murshidabad campus, which will be fully funded by the Centre, will come up on 288 acres, already provided free of cost by the state government.

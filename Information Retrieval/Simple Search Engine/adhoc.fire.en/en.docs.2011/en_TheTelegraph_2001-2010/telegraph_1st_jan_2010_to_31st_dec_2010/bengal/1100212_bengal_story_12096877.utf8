	Calcutta, Feb. 11: Mamata Banerjee today took state Congress leaders into confidence for the first time since last years Lok Sabha polls to work out a strategy to fight the CPM in the elections to 82 municipalities in May and to firm up the Congress-Trinamul alliance.        
	Pradesh Congress Committee working presidents Pradip Bhattacharya and Subrata Mukherjee, and Congress legislature party chief Manas Bhunia met the Trinamul Congress chief at her Kalighat residence for over an hour.         
	Till last month, state Congress leaders were uncertain about a one-on-one with Mamata because of her direct interactions with Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee and AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, K. Keshava Rao.        
	Today, we began a dialogue with state-level Congress leaders to work out a joint strategy against the CPM. Henceforth, we will work together to take forward the alliance to the Assembly polls in 2011, Mamata said after the meeting.         
	Mamata and the Congress leaders today decided that both the parties would oppose any division of Bengal and provide assistance to the state government to resolve the impasse in Darjeeling by undertaking development works in the hills.        
	The parties also decided to mount pressure on the Centre to seize illegal arms from the possession of CPM leaders and ministers.        
	The leaders have come to the conclusion that the joint forces are not being properly used to counter Maoists in the Jungle Mahal area. The Congress leaders urged Mamata to take up the matter with home minister P. Chidambaram.         
	Though Subrata had called on Mamata last Tuesday to discuss joint strategy and campaign for the civic polls, state Congress leaders had claimed they had been kept in the dark about the meeting.        
	Trinamul sources said todays meeting followed requests to Mamata from (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi, Pranabda and Keshavaji to initiate a dialogue with the state Congress leaders.

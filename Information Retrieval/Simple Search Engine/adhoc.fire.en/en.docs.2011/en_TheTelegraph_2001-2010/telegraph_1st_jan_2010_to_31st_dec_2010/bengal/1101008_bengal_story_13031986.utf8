          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Oct. 7: Medicine shop owners in Burdwan town have called an indefinite strike from tomorrow to protest a Citu-affiliated employee unions demand of two months salary as Puja bonus.        
	There are about 3,300 medicine shops in Burdwan town.        
	Ranendra Narayan Roy, the secretary of the Burdwan chapter of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association, said medicine shop employees were usually paid a months salary as Puja bonus.        
	This year, we had even agreed to give the employees an allowance of Rs 400 over and above the bonus. But the Citu union is demanding two months pay, Roy said.         
	The salary of a medicine shop employee in Burdwan town is between Rs 1,200 and Rs 2,500.         
	Shanti Moitra, the secretary of the Burdwan town unit of Citu, said: The medicine shop owners are not willing to pay the bonus amount we are demanding even though other traders in the town have agreed to pay two months bonus to their employees.

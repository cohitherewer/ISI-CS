          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raiganj, Jan. 28: The inspector-general of police of north Bengal today said cops should plan raids well in advance keeping in mind the profile of criminals they were pursuing.        
	K.L. Tamta, the inspector-general of police, was in Malda today to interrogate Sheikh Ansarul, the prime accused in the murder of a police officer on duty. Ansarul was arrested from here yesterday.        
	We have got the name of one more person from him, Tamta said. The IG said there were several inconsistencies in what Ansarul said. We are trying to figure out why there were crude bombs stocked in the house. Were they prepared for the police to arrive on Saturday night? We are also trying to find out whether these men are linked to organised crime of any sort, Tamta said.         
	Referring to Sanat Ghosh, the assistant sub-inspector of Ratua police station who was hacked to death by Ansarul and his sons, he said: The police have to plan more in cases of specific raids. The strength of the raid team should be decided after studying the profile of the criminals. The entire team should be aware of whom they are going to arrest.         
	Ansarul was today remanded in police custody for three days by the chief judicial magistrate of Malda, S.N. Azad.        
	Following Ansaruls arrest and investigation, Ratua police had picked up Jullur Sheikh from Maldas Chandpur village, where Ghosh was killed on January 23. Today, however, they decided to release Jullur.         
	The police had earlier said Jullur was present at the spot at the time of Ghoshs murder. But later it was found out that Jullur was not involved in the crime.         
	Malda superintendent of police Bhuban Mondol said Ansarul has been charged with murder and booked under the Explosives Act as well.        
	Ansaruls 16-year-old daughter, who was abandoned by her family on the night of the officers murder, has been sent to a government home in Malda through a court order, Mondol said.

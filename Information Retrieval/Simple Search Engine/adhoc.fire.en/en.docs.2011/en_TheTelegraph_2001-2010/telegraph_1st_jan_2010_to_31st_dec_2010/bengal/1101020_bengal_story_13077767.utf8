                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Forces to remain in Lalgarh: CRPF chief
          OUR BUREAU                                          K Vijay Kumar. (Samir Mondal)      
	Calcutta/Midnapore, Oct 19: The CRPF will remain in Lalgarh and operations against Maoists will be intensified if necessary, the central forces boss suggested today, the signal coming at a time Mamata Banerjee has stepped her campaign to have the troops withdrawn.        
	Director-general K. Vijay Kumar visited the rebel zone after which he met the forces local commanders and senior Bengal police officers at the Midnapore circuit house this afternoon.         
	The DG told us that operations against the Maoists would continue and the central forces would remain. If necessary, the operations will be intensified, said a CRPF commandant who attended the meeting.         
	Kumar himself refused to reveal tactical plans when asked at Writers Buildings this evening if the joint forces would remain in Jungle Mahal.         
	I am not entitled to comment on the matter. But the situation in Jungle Mahal has not changed, he said after meeting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, chief secretary Samar Ghosh and other senior officials.        
	But Kumar, on his first visit to Bengal after taking charge recently, appeared to suggest the force would stay when he said he wanted to take forward the understanding with Bengal police.         
	I visited Lalgarh and Midnapore to assess the ground-level situation and see how effective the co-ordination was between the CRPF and the state police. The understanding among the forces is good. We looked at ways to take it forward.        
	Chief secretary Ghosh said he had discussed with Kumar plans for CRPF hubs in Bengal. Hours before Kumar met the state top brass at Writers, Mamata warned that she would go to the people to seek justice if the Centre did not withdraw its forces.         
	I have approached everybody, starting with the Prime Minister on the withdrawal of joint forces because they are being misused by the CPM to expand its base in Jungle Mahal. If they (the Centre) dont give me justice, I will have to go to the people for justice, Mamata told reporters at her Kalighat home.

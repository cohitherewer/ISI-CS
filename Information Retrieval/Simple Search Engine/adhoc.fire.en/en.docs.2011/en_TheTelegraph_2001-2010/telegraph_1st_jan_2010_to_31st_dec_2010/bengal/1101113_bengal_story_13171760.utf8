The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | In protest Raj, school on Sunday
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      In protest Raj, school on Sunday

	Burdwan, Nov. 12: Gopalpur Muktakeshi Vidyalaya does not believe in taking a break from an 88-year-old protest, especially if it is a Sunday.         
	The school in Burdwans Jamalpur remains open on Sundays as a mark of protest against the Raj-imposed system of keeping educational institutes and other establishments closed on Sundays. The British have long left but the tradition still continues.        
	Our school is different from the others and I am proud of it, Sheikh Firoz, a Class VI student, said.        
	The government-aided high school, which remains closed on Mondays, was set up in 1922, at the peak of Mahatma Gandhis non-cooperation movement.         
	Two farmers  Abinash Chandra Haldar and Bijoy Krishna Kumar  had donated land for the school. The two had taken the initiative to set up the school as there was no other educational institution within 10km of Jamalpur at that time.        
	Ghulam Nabi Sarkar, the secretary of the school managing committee, said: The idea of setting up the school was conceived by Abinashbabu and Bijoybabu. The two founders decided to dump the concept of keeping the school closed on Sundays to protest British rule. They had consulted the villagers, who had agreed to the unique system.        
	Class X student Ratan Roy said he had become used to the system. I feel proud to attend this school as I know the reason behind the institution remaining open on Sundays. My father had also attended this school, Roy said.        
	The sense of pride is shared by several of the school staff. We realise the historical importance of the school remaining open on Sundays. This is how the school had taken part in the non-cooperation movement against the British, said Sujit Mandal, 43, the schools head clerk        
	I have been working here for 13 years. Initially, I did not enjoy coming to work on Sundays as everyone else in the village has a holiday on that day. But it does not matter now.        
	But 88 years on, the history and the ethos of the freedom struggle are not reason enough for all in the school to agree to let go of a universal holiday. A section of the teachers are grumbling.        
	My family life is being affected because I have to attend school on Sundays. My husband stays at home only on that day. He teaches mathematics at a college in Burdwan town. My college-going daughter and school-going son miss me on Sundays. I have been working in this school for the past 23 years and I am bored with this system, said geography teacher Anita Dan.        
	If the school authorities change the system, we can spend time with our families.         
	The primary section of the school, however, remains closed on Sundays following orders from the Burdwan primary school council five years ago. Recently, district inspector of schools Abdul Hai asked the authorities to keep the entire school closed on Sundays.         
	It (the tradition) is not only unusual but also unauthorised, Hai said.        
	When all schools in the state that are affiliated to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education remain closed on Sundays, how can one particular institution not follow the rule? The authorities of Gopalpur Muktakeshi Vidyalaya are continuing with the system without taking the permission of the board.        
	Headmaster Tapas Ghosh said he was yet to receive any written instruction from Hai. The 88-year-old tradition has been accepted by everyone in our school, Ghosh said.

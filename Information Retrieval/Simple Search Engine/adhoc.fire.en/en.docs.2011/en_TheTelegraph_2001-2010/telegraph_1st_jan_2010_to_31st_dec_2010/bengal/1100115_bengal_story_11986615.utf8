          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Jan. 14: The CID has seized 43 single-barrel guns and licences from security guards of different private agencies in Asansol and Durgapur, alleging that the papers were fake.         
	The sleuths, who carried out raids in the two places in Burdwan district yesterday, seized five single-barrel guns from guards engaged in the state-owned Durgapur Projects Limited. Thirty-eight similar guns were seized from guards at a private colliery in Asansol. The guards were taken to the CID headquarters in Calcutta for interrogation.        
	An officer said the guns may have been procured by the security agencies from racketeers dealing in fake gun licences in neighbouring Jharkhand and Bihar.

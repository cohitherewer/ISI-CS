          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Sept. 23: Around 400 Peoples Committee activists and Maoists today launched a bullet-and-bomb attack on Radhanagar, the first West Midnapore village to have resisted the rebels.        
	The residents of Radhanagar had yesterday set ablaze the houses of 15 Peoples Committee supporters in six villages nearby to protest the murder of a school clerk, allegedly by Maoists.         
	Police said todays strike, in which a teenager was injured, was in retaliation to yesterdays attack by the villagers.         
	At 5pm today, around 2,500 residents of Radhanagar and neighbouring areas had gone to attend the funeral of Srikanta Mondal, who was killed probably for organising villagers to resist Maoists, at a place around half a kilometre from the village.        
	The police said Peoples Committee activists and the Maoists from neighbouring Matihana, Keundi, Jugnikata, Bindukata and Joynagar villages had possibly received information that Radhanagar was almost empty and seized the opportunity to launch an attack.         
	The gang descended on the village, firing shots and hurling bombs. Nidarshan Pal, 17, who was standing near the village market, suffered pellet injuries in his abdomen.        
	Hearing the explosions and gunshots, the villagers attending the funeral rushed back. They threw bricks at the attackers and some of the villagers fired back.        
	The villagers informed the police in Jhargram, 5km away. A team arrived half an hour later. Seeing the security forces, the Peoples Committee activists and the rebels fled, said Praveen Tripathi, the superintendent of police.        
	Nidarshan has been admitted to Jhargram subdivisional hospital. We have removed the pellets, a surgeon said.        
	Villagers claimed that another resident, Sheikh Shabir, too received a pellet injury. However, the police did not confirm it.

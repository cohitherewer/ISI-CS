	Enayetpur, Sept. 21: Lalgarhs recapture is a matter of days, CPM leaders declared today at their first rally in the Maoist-infested zone in almost two years attended by a state minister and a district party chief.        
	It is now a matter of days before we enter Lalgarh (town) and establish our control there again. A day will come when CPM flags will flutter over the entire Jungle Mahal, Dipak Sarkar, the CPMs West Midnapore secretary, told the gathering near the party office in Enayetpur, 35km from Lalgarh.         
	He was accompanied by Susanta Ghosh, the minister for Paschimanchal development affairs and a member of the partys district secretariat.        
	Party leaders claimed 15,000 people attended the event, held to mark the first anniversary of the battle cadres fought with Maoists a year ago in Enayetpur, a former rebel stronghold. This is also the place where the first CPM camp in the rebel zone came up.        
	CPM processions and marches have been held in recent weeks but the numbers in such programmes were not as big as the one at todays rally.         
	Todays event was the first organised by district leaders since the beginning of the tribal movement in Lalgarh in November 2008.        
	The Enayetpur programme is being viewed as part of the efforts by the CPM to boost the morale of party workers who have fled villages in nearby Lalgarh, Salboni, Goaltore and Jhargram because of Maoist threats.         
	A Lalgarh leader suggested the rally would help the homecoming. The CPM will have to establish its control again in Jungle Mahal. Todays rally will encourage the workers.        
	Sarkar dubbed the recent spate of attacks on CPM workers and their retreat a temporary setback and claimed a peoples resistance had been built up against the Maoists in the state. Bengal is perhaps the only Maoist-affected state where people have built up resistance against the rebels. The resistance began from Enayetpur and it was from this place the Maoists retreated exactly a year ago. I urge people to resist the Maoists in every village, said Sarkar.        
	Minister Ghosh claimed the CPM flag had been hoisted in almost all villages of Goaltore and that other rebel pockets would be the next. Our cadres will soon take the red flag to all the villages in Salboni.         
	Both leaders repeated their partys charge of a Trinamul-Maoist nexus. The Maoists and Trinamul are jointly operating everywhere, Sarkar said. Ghosh alleged that Trinamul and the Maoists were working like a joint committee.        
	Among the audience at the rally were family members of 22 CPM men killed by the Maoists.

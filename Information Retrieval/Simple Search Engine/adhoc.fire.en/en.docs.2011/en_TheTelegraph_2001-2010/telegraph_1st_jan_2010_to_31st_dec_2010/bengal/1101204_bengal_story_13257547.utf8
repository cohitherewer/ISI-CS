          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Durgapur, Dec. 3: Four people were killed and 20 injured when the bus they were travelling in rammed into the rear of a stationary truck on a foggy highway near Asansol early today.         
	An hour and a half later, the dense fog claimed another life 2km from the first accident spot when a motorcyclist hit a concrete road divider.        
	Police said the bus driver may have failed to spot the truck, which had broken down in the middle of NH2, because of the dense fog.         
	Most of those killed were fish traders from Salanpur and Chittaranjan. The bus, which was travelling from Chittaranjan to Guskara, was carrying 30 passengers.         
	Prasun Banerjee, the Asansol additional superintendent of police, said: Visibility was very poor this morning because of the fog.         
	Jodupati Dhibar, one of the injured passengers, said the accident happened around 5am. The fog apart, it was still dark then. But despite that the bus was running at a high speed, Dhibar, 42, said.         
	Three persons were killed on the spot while another died at Asansol sub-divisional hospital. The police said the truck driver was absconding. The fate of the bus driver is yet to be known.         
	The motorcyclist who died in the accident around 6.30am was identified as Santanu Sarkar, 32, an Asansol resident.

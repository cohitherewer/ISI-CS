The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mayor today, edge for Sovan
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mayor today, edge for Sovan
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	Calcutta, June 5: Sovan Chatterjee was standing closest to the chair with 24 hours to go before Mamata Banerjee named the 37th mayor of Calcutta.        
	While Mamata often does not follow the script of the night before the morning after, the councillor from Ward 131 in the Behala-Parnasree area was within striking distance of becoming the first mayor from the added areas.         
	The other decision signed but not sealed till late today was that of Subrata Mukherjee being the chairman of the monitoring committee to be set up to oversee the citys civic development.        
	The man standing closest behind Chatterjee in the queue to be mayor was Firhad (Bobby) Hakim for whom, sources said, Mamata has bigger plans.         
	Asked tonight about his prospects, Chatterjee told The Telegraph: We must all wait till Sunday. About his vision for the city, the six-time councillor said: A cleaner and greener Calcutta with adequate supply of filtered surface water to every household.        
	The focus on filtered water is only to be expected from the man they call Jol Sovan at the civic headquarters, a moniker he had earned as the mayoral council member (water supply) in the Trinamul-BJP board from 2000 to 2005. Chatterjee, 47, has been a five-time councillor from Ward 132 since the merger of Behala with the CMC in 1984.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Vacant cop posts in Maoist belt
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Vacant cop posts in Maoist belt
          AMIT UKIL                                            
	Purulia/Bankura, April 8: Several police posts are lying vacant in the Maoist-hit districts of Purulia and Bankura, and equipment sanctioned for the security forces are yet to arrive even after the rebel massacres in Dantewada and Shilda.        
	In the two districts, which are on high alert, additional posts announced in the past two months and those that existed before the insurgency problem intensified are yet to be filled up. Equipment sanctioned weeks ago are yet to reach the police stations.        
	Seven police stations in Purulia and one in Bankura  all located in Maoist-affected areas  had been upgraded in February with inspectors heading them instead of sub-inspectors, in a bid to tackle the rebels more effectively.         
	Over a month has passed since the director-general of police made the announcement in Writers Buildings but officers are yet to be named for these posts.        
	The fact that a gazetted officer of the rank of inspector is in charge of a police station boosts the morale of the other policemen posted there, a sub-inspector of one of the selected police stations said.        
	Additional personnel, funding and a vehicle each for the eight police stations had been sanctioned but are yet to reach them.        
	Deputy inspector-general of police (Midnapore range) Anil Kumar said the process of appointment of inspectors was still under way and the posts would be filled up soon.         
	Kumar said that despite the vacancies, we are well-prepared to face any situation. Our basic infrastructure is in place.        
	Half of the policemen in these two districts do not have bullet-proof jackets.        
	We have ordered for the jackets and they are on the way, a senior officer said. He, however, added that the jackets were heavy and hampered movement. Bullet-proof jackets made from lighter material would be more practical, he said.        
	The intelligence branches of both the districts have their own set of problems to grapple with.         
	A day after the Shilda massacre in West Midnapore, in which 24 Eastern Frontier Rifles personnel were killed by Maoists, the chief minister had said there had been an intelligence failure.        
	We did not have inputs that such a raid was likely, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said.        
	In addition to the several posts that are lying vacant in the intelligence branches, officials do not have vehicles to visit villages. Their cellphone bills have also not been reimbursed.         
	We are not given any risk allowance even though we have to visit trouble-prone areas to gather information. We are not even given any source money (incentives paid to informers), an intelligence official said.                    WITH INPUTS FROM BISWANATH ROY

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 27: Two passengers of a Sealdah-bound train from Jaynagar in Bihar were injured at Pandua station in Hooghly during a clash after some of them tried to forcibly remove banners and flags placed by bandh supporters on the tracks.         
	Shanti Devi, 35, was taken to a local hospital with a head injury, while Abdul Rajak was provided first aid for a black eye at the station.        
	Rajak, a resident of Darbhanga in Bihar who had taken the Ganga Sagar Express on the way to his relatives in Kidderpore, said: We waited for half an hour and then requested the bandh supporters to allow the train to move to a bigger station. But they hurled stones and I was hit.        
	Shanti fell on the tracks while trying to flee the cadres. They beat me up with flags after I fell, she alleged.         
	In Calcutta, inspector-general of police (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha said: There was an altercation between the passengers and bandh supporters and it was settled amicably.

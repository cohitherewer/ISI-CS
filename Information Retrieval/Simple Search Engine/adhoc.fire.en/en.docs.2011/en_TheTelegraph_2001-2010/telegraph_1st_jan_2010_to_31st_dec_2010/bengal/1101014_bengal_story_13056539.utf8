The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rivals play flag-off game
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rivals play flag-off game
  - Govt unveils hub to match Mamata publicity show        ZEESHAN JAWED                                                   
	Calcutta, Oct. 13: The Left Front government today put up a power-packed show to formally announce its plan to set up a financial hub at New Town in an apparent attempt to match Mamata Banerjees flag-off frenzy.         
	Housing minister Gautam Deb, in the presence of Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, announced the plan to create a cluster for banking, finance and technology companies at New Town.         
	This financial hub is going to throw up a plethora of opportunities for the youth of Bengal, Deb said, underlining the development potential of the project.         
	Since Mamata adopted the flag-off route to score over the Left in the development game, such programmes have become the flavour of the season in Bengal. In the past six months, the railway minister has flagged off around 25 pairs of trains and nine new projects.         
	Although the Left had initially criticised the power-packed programmes to unveil railway projects, Deb, who is the Hidco chairman, has off late started an attempt to match the Trinamul Congress chiefs move by regularly organising events to announce projects.        
	CPM leader Mohammad Salim said there was nothing wrong in the attempt as Mamata has been giving an impression that the government is doing nothing.         
	Earlier, we hadnt thought of going on an inauguration spree and publicising our programmes. But now, faced with the railway ministers spate of inaugurations, we have realised that the people ought to be informed about our activities too. We think the time has come to combat her politically as well as administratively, Salim said this evening.         
	The effort at publicising was visible at todays programme. Not just star value  Gangulys presence made an impact  the organisers also managed to line up representatives from public and private sector finance companies besides getting the Union finance minister to unveil the project.         
	In tune with the Look East policy of the Centre, the financial hub will play a catalytic role in the economy, Mukherjee said, giving Deb and Bhattacharjee some reason to smile.         
	Modelled on Mumbais Bandra-Kurla Complex, the proposed hub will be developed as a cluster of banking and finance companies, stock exchanges and hotels, Deb said.         
	The chief minister tried his best to convey the message that the story of resurgent Bengal was far from over.         
	Referring to the exit of the Tata Nano project from Bengal, he said: Let me tell you that Singur is not the end of Bengal. Investments are coming Jindals are setting up a project in Salboni. Videocon is setting up an SEZ in north Bengal. We are getting a new airport. There have been huge investments in the petro-chemical industry, cement, rubber, agriculture and IT.        
	None at the event, however, tried to address the investors concerns about the lack of proper infrastructure at New Town. The detailed project plan and the list of potential investors were also kept under the wraps, raising questions on the viability of the big-ticket announcement.         
	Similar questions can be raised about several railway projects, such as a proposed power plant at Adra and an auto hub at Shalimar, that Mamata announced recently.         
	The elections are just a few months away and so its the time for announcements. No one talks about implementation, said a senior government official.

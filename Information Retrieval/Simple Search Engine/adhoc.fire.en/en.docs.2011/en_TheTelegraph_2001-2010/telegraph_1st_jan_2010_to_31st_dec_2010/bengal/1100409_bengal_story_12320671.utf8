                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Snatched Shilda rifle in haul
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Midnapore, April 8: West Midnapore police have found one of the rifles  an AK-47  snatched by Maoists during the attack on the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in Shilda in February along with a stockpile of arms and ammunition in raids on rebel hideouts in the district in the past seven days.        
	The police said much of the cache was unearthed in the past two days from Binpurs Paluiboni and Shalbonis Mathurapur.        
	This is a major find, district superintendent of police Manoj Verma said this evening. This is the best haul for us in the past one year.        
	He said the police had information about other Maoist hideouts in the district and more raids would be carried out in the coming days.        
	The police said they had found the AK-47 rifle during a raid at Paluiboni yesterday.        
	We have verified that the AK-47 had been looted by the Maoists from the EFR camp, Verma said. We hope to find more of the arms looted from the Shilda camp soon. We have also found some uniforms of EFR personnel that the Maoists had taken from the Shilda camp.        
	He said the hideout in Paluiboni was frequently used by the Maoists.         
	Verma said the police had found two improvised explosive devices in a pond in Paluiboni and two computers from a villagers house in Mathurapur.        
	The police have refused to name the villager. They said he had escaped after he came to know about the raid.        
	Most of the single-barrel and double-barrel rifles that we have found are licensed guns which the Maoists had snatched from the villagers, Verma said.         
	During a raid at Mathurapur two days ago, the police found a large cache of cartridges and came across a makeshift medical centre for the Maoists.        
	The police said they had seized medicines, used to treat the Maoists, from the medical centre.        
	Asit Mahato, the leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, claimed that the medical centre was being run by the outfit to treat poor villagers, a claim the police disputed.        
	This centre was clearly being run to treat the Maoists, a police officer said. We have evidence of this. Some arms and ammunition were recovered near the centre. The Maoists had easy access to the medical centre because the area is surrounded by jungles.        
	Verma said six people had been detained in Paluiboni and Mathurapur.

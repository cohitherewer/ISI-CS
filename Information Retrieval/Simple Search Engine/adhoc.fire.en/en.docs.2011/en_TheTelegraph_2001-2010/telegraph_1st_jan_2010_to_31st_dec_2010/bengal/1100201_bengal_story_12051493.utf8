The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CRPF death with cause riddle
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CRPF death with cause riddle
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Jan. 31: The CRPF has suffered its first unnatural death since moving into Lalgarh but the central force has been unable to establish yet if it was suicide or murder.        
	A jawans decomposed body, which had been nibbled by animals, was found in the jungles of Bhangadhali in West Midnapores Salboni last evening, about a kilometre from his camp.         
	The body is believed to be that of 25-year-old Maruti Waghmore, who had gone missing on January 23. District superintendent of police Manoj Verma said: We believe it is the body of the missing CRPF jawan based on circumstantial evidence. His colleagues identified the undergarments and the rifle found next to the body had been issued to him.        
	Some of the leads police have got suggest suicide.         
	Although Waghmore had left the Bhimpur camp on January 23 wearing his uniform, his body was found with only innerwear. If it were a Maoist strike, his Insas rifle and three magazines would not have been left behind, Verma said.         
	An automatic weapon is what the guerrillas are always looking for.        
	According to the police, Waghmore had left the camp, on the outskirts of the dense Jhitka forest, around 1pm on January 23. But it was apparently not for work. Jawans carry arms whenever they leave camps, even to buy cigarettes or gutkha. A jawan told us he had asked Waghmore where he was going. Waghmore had replied that he would return soon, said an officer of Salboni police station.        
	The CRPF had filed a police complaint a day after Waghmore went missing. Sources said the police had enquired about him in a few villages but no big search operation was launched.         
	The CRPF had told us that he used to appear depressed, said a police officer who did not want to be named.        
	The incident came to light yesterday afternoon when local people spotted a stray dog coming out of the jungle with a mutilated human hand in its jaws. Policemen from Salboni thana searched the area and found the body.        
	Two of the magazines were on the ground and the third was loaded in the rifle. A bullet was missing from the maga- zine fitted to the gun. But the body was highly decomposed and flesh from various parts had been bitten off by dogs and jackals, exposing the bones, an officer said.         
	Although the gun and the magazines were there, his uniform and belt were missing, he added.        
	A forensic report can confirm whether the body had a bullet wound. A CRPF officer said they had started a separate departmental inquiry.        
	Days after the central forces began their area-domination exercise in Lalgarh last June, a CRPF jawan had died of heat stroke during the march from Bhimpur to Lalgarh through the Jhitka forest.

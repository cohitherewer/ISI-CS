   Rahul urges state Cong to   beef up base           OUR BUREAU                          Rahul Gandhi garlands a statue of Thakur Panchanan Burma, a 19th century reformer who fought for the rights of the Rajbangshis and also worked to spread education among them, in Cooch Behar on Wednesday.

	Sept. 15: Rahul Gandhi today gently prodded Congress leaders and workers in north Bengal to strengthen the organisation and referred to some home truths while iterating that the party would not bow its head before the Trinamul Congress for the sake of the alliance.        
	If you want to hold your head high while stitching together the alliance, you will have to do one thing. You will have to strengthen the organisation in the state. You can go for a hard bargain while striking a seat-sharing deal with our alliance partner only when you are able to put yourself on a solid ground, Rahul was quoted as telling a Youth Congress convention in South Dinajpurs Balurghat.        
	The AICC general secretary offered the same organisation pill to stop the steady defection of state Congress leaders to other parties.        
	Although he appeared embarrassed when Tabraj Alam, a Youth Congress activist from Malda, asked him about his opinion on leaders such as Somen Mitra and Subrata Mukherjee who have defected to Trinamul, the MP quickly replied: If you can strengthen the organisation, more people will join us. These people (the leaders who have defected) dont matter. Our party does not lack leaders. You could yourselves become leaders one day.        
	Malda zilla parishad sabhadhipati Sabina Yasmin, 30, one of those who got the chance to ask Rahul a question, said: I felt thrilled when Rahulji smiled and answered my question on the alliance. He told me we would have to strengthen ourselves first, Yasmin said after the meeting.        
	Earlier in the day, Rahul had held a closed-door session with Youth Congress leaders in Jalpaiguri. Participants said the AICC general secretary told them the party would not sacrifice its self-respect and dignity to strike an alliance with Trinamul.        
	We are ready to join hands with the Trinamul Congress. Lekin sar nahin jhukaenge (But we will not bow our head), a Youth Congress leader quoted Rahul as saying at the meeting.         
	Sabita Devi Agarwal, the Congress chairperson of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation, asked Rahul if the partys interests would be sacrificed while striking a deal with Trinamul before the Assembly polls next year, as was the case during last years Lok Sabha elections.         
	But the AICC general secretary is learnt to have assuaged her fears by saying the alliance would be maintained as long as our dignity and self-respect remains intact. Agarwal said those present at the meeting applauded.        
	Mamata meets MK        
	An hour before Rahul returned to Raj Bhavan from his day-long tour in north Bengal, Mamata Banerjee called on governor M.K. Narayanan around 5pm.        
	Trinamul sources said she complained to Narayanan about the killings of two party supporters allegedly by CPM activists in Burdwan yesterday. She is also learnt to have requested the governor to be present at a programme on September 22 when President Pratibha Patil will lay the foundation stone for a Metro stretch.

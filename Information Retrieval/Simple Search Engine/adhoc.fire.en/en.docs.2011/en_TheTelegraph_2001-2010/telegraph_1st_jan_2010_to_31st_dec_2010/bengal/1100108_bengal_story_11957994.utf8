The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Training lair for Cobras in Salboni
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Training lair for Cobras in Salboni
          A STAFF REPORTER                           A Cobra jawan in Lalgarh. File picture                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 7: A centre to train the Cobra force to counter Maoists will be built in Salboni, the government announced today.        
	The centre, the second after the one in Hyderabad, will come up on 141 acres in West Midnapore, a Maoist hotbed.        
	One thousand CRPF personnel will be trained.        
	A second centre to train the Cobra forces will come up at Salboni in West Midnapore on 141 acres. The first such centre in the country was set up in Hyderabad, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said at Writers Buildings.        
	It will take about one and a half years to get the training centre ready, he added.        
	An official in the home department later said the state government had received a communique from the Centre during the day on the construction of the proposed Cobra hub at Salboni.        
	He said Salboni has been chosen since it is located in the Maoist-infested belt of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.         
	The Cobra is a specialised wing of the CRPF to exclusively deal with Maoists in dense forest areas.         
	They were first engaged in the state during the Lalgarh operation last year.        
	The Combat Battalion for Resolute Action  that is what Cobra stands for  trains on the lines of the Greyhounds in Andhra Pradesh, also a Maoist-counter force.        
	The Cobra personnel undergo a vigorous three-month regimen for jungle warfare.        
	Sources in the CRPF said there was a slight delay in the raising of the first battalion of 1,000 because of elections.        
	The plan was to get the first Hyderabad-trained Cobra battalion ready by March 2009. They were deployed a month later in Chhattisgarh.        
	The second battalion, ready by July 2009, was deployed in Lalgarh for the joint security operation.         
	Cobra personnel are trained to survive in forests for at least three weeks. But the forces success rate in combating Maoists is not impressive.

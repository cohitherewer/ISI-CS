The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Clash clogs Didi rally path
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Clash clogs Didi rally path
          DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY                Mamata at the rally in Canning. (Telegraph picture)        
	Canning, Oct. 8: Trinamul Congress and CPM activists clashed with bombs and guns at Canning around an hour before Mamata Banerjees rally there today, holding up the Trinamul Congress chiefs convoy and prompting her to allege the Left had tried to murder her.        
	Mamata and Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee claimed they had to walk 5km to the rally venue and no policeman was in sight.        
	Trouble started around 3pm when some Trinamul supporters walking in a procession to the rally allegedly pulled down a cloth gate and tore some festoons the CPM had hung to decorate the area for a party rally on October 11 at the ground where Mamata held her public meeting today.        
	The CPM had decorated the approach road to the field at Jibantala in South 24-Parganas Canning, a Left bastion, with gates made of red cloth, party flags and festoons.         
	CPM supporters protested when the Trinamul activists tore down the festoons at Netra, 5km from the rally venue. The police said both sides fired shots and hurled bombs.         
	The Trinamul supporters then allegedly set fire to four shops and two houses and ransacked the houses of four CPM supporters.         
	Twelve people were injured in the clash, home secretary G.D. Gautama said at Writers Buildings.         
	Chatterjee arrived at Netra a little after the hour-long clash stopped. However, his car could not proceed towards the rally venue as the road was clogged with CPM protesters, Trinamul supporters and villagers. Chatterjee got off his car and had to walk 5km to the venue.        
	The Trinamul leader alleged at the rally that CPM supporters had hurled bombs at his car and fired shots.        
	Mamatas convoy, which arrived at Netra around 20 minutes after Chatterjee left the place, also got held up. The Trinamul chief had to walk to the rally venue as her security staff and local Trinamul activists pushed through the crowd to make way for her.         
	At the rally, Mamata alleged 200 Trinamul supporters were injured in the clash.         
	They tell me I get Z-category security but there was no security today. They (the CPM) send reports to Delhi saying I dont take any security. This is nothing but an attempt to murder me. I came to you walking 5km. They tried to stop me but could not, Mamata said.        
	Additional superintendent of police R.N. Banerjee, however, said: We had safely escorted the Trinamul leaders to the rally.        
	Mamata alleged the CPM had tried to murder her several times. But they will not be able to stop me. I have been to Lalgarh, Darjeeling and now to Canning. I will go to these places again and again.         
	The Trinamul chief accused Abdur Rezzak Mollah, the CPM MLA from Canning (East), of using cunning means to win polls. But you wont succeed this time, she said.        
	Mamata waited on the dais for 45 minutes after ending her speech as news reached that Trinamul and CPM activists were fighting at Kalitala, 5km away. She left for Calcutta after being informed that nothing major had happened.

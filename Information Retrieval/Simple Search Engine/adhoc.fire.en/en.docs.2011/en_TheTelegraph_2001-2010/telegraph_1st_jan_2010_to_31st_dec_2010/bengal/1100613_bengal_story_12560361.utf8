The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Jadavpur ladys body found in gunny bag
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Jadavpur ladys body found in gunny bag
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Alpana Dutta Chowdhury                          
	Calcutta, June 12: The body of a middle-aged woman from Jadavpur was found dumped in a gunny bag in a roadside ditch 15km from her home, prompting neighbours to allege she was killed by her brother over a property dispute.        
	The body of Alpana Dutta Chowdhury, 52, who was an LIC agent living in a two-storey house in Aswininagar near Jadavpurs Baghajatin, was spotted in the ditch in Sonarpur by some traders on Thursday. She had been trussed up.        
	Alpanas neighbours alleged that she was killed by her brother Biplab, who is also an LIC agent, because he wanted to take possession of their house.         
	Biplab lives with his wife and daughter on the ground floor while Alpana, who had not married, lived with their 94-year-old mother on the first floor.         
	Jadavpur police have registered a murder case and today interrogated Biplab and his wife Malabika, Sunil Kumar Chaudhury, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas, said.        
	Some passers-by informed us after they spotted the womans body stuffed into the gunny bag. Her legs were sticking out. We found strangulation marks on her throat, an officer of Sonarpur police station said.         
	A preliminary medical examination confirmed she had been strangled.        
	Biplab had lodged a diary at Jadavpur police station on Wednesday, saying Alpana had been missing since that afternoon. After her body was found in Sonarpur, the police informed Biplab, who identified it.         
	However, their neighbours said they suspected foul play because neither Biplab nor his wife lodged a complaint after Alpana was found murdered.        
	Shyamoli Bhadra, Alpanas next-door neighbour and schoolmate, said: Biplabs silence has strengthened our suspicion. She (Alpana) was a self-dependent woman. Her brother had threatened her several times, asking her to leave the house. He wanted to take possession of the entire house.         
	Alpanas neighbours told the police that they had seen her the last time at 1pm on Wednesday.         
	Alpana and Biplabs sister Minati Bose, a widow who lives with her in-laws in Behala, said she could not believe her brother had killed her.        
	He cannot kill her. It is impossible. Alpana had gone to a doctors chamber nearby on Wednesday but she did not return home. She had lent money to several people. I suspect she was murdered by someone among them, Minati said.

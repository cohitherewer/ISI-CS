	Calcutta, Dec. 28: Around 30 SFI and Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporters, including some students, were injured when police cane-charged them during a clash over a college election in Burdwan today.         
	The police said the trouble started around 12.30pm when some outsiders owing allegiance to the rival unions started arguing outside Gour Mohan Dutta College in Manteswar.         
	After the voting process got over, an altercation ensued between the supporters outside the college over the electoral prospects of the unions.        
	However, after the results showed both parties had won eight seats each, the arguments snowballed into a clash between the supporters with several students of the college joining in. The rivals were tied on the remaining two seats.        
	An officer of Manteswar police station said the police team that had been stationed at the college since morning failed to control the warring factions as the cops were heavily outnumbered. Several college students joined the SFI and TMCP supporters in the clash, he added.        
	The officer said reinforcements, including RAF personnel, were rushed in. After all attempts to pacify the mob failed, the police resorted to cane-charging, he added.        
	Several in the mob damaged a medicine shop located near the college, said Sadhan Kar, the officer in charge of Manteswar police station. Kar admitted several students were injured in the cane-charging but added that some had suffered injuries in the clash too.        
	The injured were taken to Manteswar block hospital. Later in the day, six of them were shifted to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.         
	Six students of the college were among those injured while the others were SFI and TMCP supporters from outside. Humayun Kabir, the unit secretary of the SFI, suffered a head injury. Kabir alleged from his hospital bed that students owing allegiance to the TMCP had brought outsiders to attack the SFI members.        
	Kabir alleged that TMCP, which had won the election last year, apprehended that they would not be able to retain the board this time and attacked the SFI supporters.         
	However, Nurul Hasan, the district unit president of TMCP, alleged that SFI activists had snatched the identity card of a student and union supporter to stop him from voting.         
	The police said no arrests had been made yet.

	Calcutta, March 5: Bengal will export potato to Southeast Asian countries because of a surplus crop this year, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said today.         
	Bengal has produced 95 lakh tonnes of potatoes this time, about 40 lakh tonnes more than last year when a blight destroyed a large quantity of the tuber.         
	The state government has sought the Centres permission to export the crop. National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India has contacted the state to chalk out a plan for export.

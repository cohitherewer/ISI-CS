The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Resistance stalls village power plan
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Resistance stalls village power plan
  - Nandigram in another protest, land scarce for substations        ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR                                                   
	Tamluk, March 28: Farmers in East Midnapore have refused to give land for power substations needed to electrify about 2,800 villages, demanding more than double the price being offered in some places.        
	Among the seven substations planned in East Midnapore, one is in Nandigram.         
	All the areas are under Trinamul Congress panchayats after Mamata Banerjees party swept the 2008 rural polls and snatched the zilla parishad from the CPM.         
	Officials at the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd said of the 43 substations needed across Bengal for rural electrification, land for nine had already been received from the administration. But farmers who own land identified for seven substations in East Midnapore are refusing to hand over their plots demanding much higher prices, said a senior official of the company.         
	There is a trouble pocket in Murshidabad, too, where the Congress runs the local panchayat. These are the two districts in which the process of land acquisition for the substations has started.        
	The 43 substations  which gradually step down power from high-tension lines to a lower voltage fit for domestic supply  are required to electrify over 10,000 villages across Bengal under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana. The Centres target is to reach power to every rural household in the country by 2012.         
	We had planned to electrify the villages (in East Midnapore) by May 2011. But if the land problem continues, we will miss the target, said an official of the power distribution company.        
	The project manager of the rural electrification programme in East Midnapore, Kallol Kanti Das, said about 1.5 acres were required for each substation. The district needs eight substations. We have got land for only one, said Das.        
	The government has offered between Rs 4.5 lakh an acre and Rs 30 lakh an acre for the land depending on their fertility and location.         
	The highest price has been fixed for Khonchi in Nanda-kumar block where the land is multi-crop and adjacent to National Highway 41, which connects Haldia port with Kolaghat. But the farmers there are demanding Rs 40 lakh an acre.        
	The lowest price  Rs 4.5 lakh an acre  has been offered for land in the remote Barnalgeria village of Egra block. The demand there is for Rs 10 lakh an acre.        
	Subodh Jana, whose 0.15 acres have been identified for the substation at Amtala in Nandigram block I, said: After the Nandigram agitation, we will not part with our land so easily. Things are different now.        
	The government has offered Rs 10 lakh an acre in Nandigram but the landowners want Rs 20 lakh an acre.        
	Although the zilla parishad is one of the implementing agencies of the project, the deputy chief of the districts apex rural body justified the resistance. Mamud Hossain said: The price being offered is inadequate. The administration should immediately revise its offer.        
	In each of the places, a district official said, the offer price is 30 per cent more than market value.        
	Additional district magistrate Sunita Mitra Deb said: We hope talks will solve the problem.        
	In Murshidabad, land for four substations has been obtained without a hitch because in three places it was with the government and in another there was a lone owner who did not have any complaint about the Rs 7 lakh an acre he was given.         
	In the fifth place, the villagers are demanding almost three times the offer of Rs 7 lakh an acre.

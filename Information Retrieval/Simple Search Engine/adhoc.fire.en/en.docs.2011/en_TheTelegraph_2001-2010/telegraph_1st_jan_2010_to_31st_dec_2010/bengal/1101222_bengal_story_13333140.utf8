The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Governor meets rivals on violence
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Governor meets rivals on violence
          OUR BUREAU                                                 
	Calcutta, Dec 21: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today met governor M.K. Narayanan and briefed him on the steps taken to curb the recent violence in educational institutions.         
	During the 45-minute one-to-one at Raj Bhavan, the chief minister apprised Narayanan of the measures initiated by the government to curb flare-ups in colleges.         
	An SFI activist died in Howrah last week while another student was partially blinded after being hit by a brick near Calcuttas Asutosh College last week.        
	The chief minister assured Narayanan that the government has taken firm steps in tackling college flare-ups over student body elections, said an official in the chief ministers secretariat.         
	Before Bhattacharjee met the governor, leader of the Opposition, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee, held talks with Narayanan with a team of MLAs.        
	I urged the governor to ask this government to stop the state-sponsored terror on our partys workers and innocent people. I told him that there is no rule of law in the state, Chatterjee said after the 25-minute meeting.         
	Attacks continue        
	The meetings at Raj Bhavan did little to douse the flames outside. A Congress panchayat pradhan was killed in a Murshidabad village by a gang of thugs allegedly backed by the CPM. One of the killers was chased and lynched.        
	Campuses, too, were hardly trouble-free. In Bankura, at least 15 persons, including a police officer, were injured in clashes during student union elections in colleges.

	Tamluk, Dec. 15: A Class V boy slashed the forearm of a girl for tattling on him over cheating in a test yesterday at an East Midnapore school already facing parents wrath for an attack on a hostel student.        
	The girl was taken to a doctor who treated the wound and sent her home. Today, the guardians confined the headmaster of Boinchberia High School, 10km from Tamluk, for three hours to protest the slashing and the beating of the hostel boy by the father of a girl student for allegedly teasing her earlier this month.        
	The girl was among the 50 students of Class V appearing for the geography test yesterday. Towards the end of the exam, the 11-year-old spotted four boys copying from a guide book and told the teacher, Tanusree Das. The teacher threatened to report the matter to the headmaster and the boys parents.        
	After the school gave over at 3pm, the girl was walking across the playground on her way home when one of the four boys took out a blade from his geometry box and slashed her left forearm. The teachers rushed to her rescue. The boy, along with his three classmates, fled.        
	In the other incident, on December 3, Ali Hussain, a member of the local panchayat, beat up a Class V boy for allegedly teasing his daughter, who is in the same class.        
	Hussain had allegedly taken the boy to the roof of his hostel, beaten him up and kicked him down the stairs. The boy had to be admitted to hospital for three days, and has not returned to school since then.        
	The students father Bhanulal Jhakar lodged a police complaint a few days back against Hussain and said the assault had scared his son so much that he didnt want to attend school.        
	Today, headmaster Gorachand Maity faced the heat over both incidents from the protesting guardians. They accused the school authorities of doing nothing to check incidents of violence on the campus.         
	The students fear attending classes and the guardians are worried, said Tapan Maity, the father of a Class X student.        
	Headmaster Maity said he was very concerned. I have called a meeting with the guardians on December 22 to seek their help in creating a safe environment.

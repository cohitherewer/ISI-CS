The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Warm-up for signoff session
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Warm-up for signoff session
  - Last full Assembly sitting from Friday before state goes to polls         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                
	Calcutta, Dec. 8: Poll-bound Bengal begins this Friday what will effectively be this Assemblys last full session, the legislative ritual assuming significance because it comes at a time the ruling Left is staring at exit signs.        
	The winter session will begin with an obituary reference to Siddhartha Shankar Ray. Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, who held an all-party meeting today to chart a tentative schedule for the session, will move the motion.        
	The Speaker accepted our proposal to hold a special meeting to condole the death of former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray, said leader of the Opposition, the Trinamul Congresss Partha Chatterjee.        
	Regular legislative business will begin only from December 21, when five bills are to be taken up. In the interim, the House will meet on December 16 to pay homage to other prominent persons who have passed away since the last session in July-August.        
	Another break will kick in from December 17 to 20. Bengal Pradesh Congress chief Manas Bhuniya has requested the Speaker to resume the session from December 21 so he and party colleagues can attend the AICC plenary from December 18 to 20 in Delhi. The House will be closed again from December 24 to 26 for Christmas, and reopen on December 27.         
	A meeting of the business advisory committee will be held on December 10 to decide how long the session will continue. It will depend on the motions and demands for discussions that the members place during the session, the Speaker said.        
	Halim, though, was disinclined to describe the session as the last before the elections scheduled for April-May.         
	Once the Election Commission declares the poll dates, possibly in January, a vote on account will be conducted to clear routine government expenses, unlike the full budget session usually held in February-March, the Speaker said.        
	At this mornings meeting, both the Trinamul Congress and ally Congress promised Halim full co-operation in running the session. The gesture comes at a time almost all of Parliaments winter session appears set to be wiped out because the ruling UPA and the Opposition have dig in their heels on how to investigate the 2G spectrum scandal.         
	But leader of Opposition Chatterjee made it clear that the co-operation would not extend to the bills the ruling Left has lined up. We oppose the West Bengal Panchayat (second amendment) Bill. We told the Speaker that the next rural polls will be held in 2013. So there is no need to hurry and place the bill.        
	Trinamul, sources said, is also unlikely to accept the provisions of the New Town, Development Authority (2nd Amendment) Bill, given the campaign of Mamata Banerjee against alleged forcible acquisitions in Rajarhat. The Left has been holding up the township as a trophy.         
	The Congress will focus on two key issues. Deteriorating law and order and the states fiscal problems will be our focus. There are two terrors now  of the Maoists and the Marxists, party chief Bhuniya said.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 19: Calcutta High Court today struck down a state government order fixing the criteria for property valuation in municipal areas.        
	The court today directed the government to employ experts and permanent staff  and not casual workers  to draw up afresh the criteria for fixing property valuation.        
	The fallout of todays judgment could lead to the refixing of valuation of properties. In case the property tax is lowered, the excess amount paid by a person will be adjusted against the tax he has to pay in the future, said lawyer Arunava Ghosh.

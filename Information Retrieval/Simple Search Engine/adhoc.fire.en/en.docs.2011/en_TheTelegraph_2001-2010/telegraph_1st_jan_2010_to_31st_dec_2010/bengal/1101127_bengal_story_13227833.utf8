	Khejuri, Nov. 26: Khejuri residents today said several unknown faces had joined Trinamul Congress activists to guard the area and keep watch on a CPM shelter, prompting Maoists to claim the strangers as their own.         
	Villagers and the East Midnapore administration claimed the young brigade of outsiders and Trinamul activists were manning the approach road to Khejuri from Heria at night.         
	They are also keeping round-the-clock watch on the banks of the Rasulpur river, across which falls Sunia, where retreating CPM cadres are holed up. We are keeping watch so that the CPM cadres do not come back to attack Khejuri, a Trinamul activist said.        
	According to Swapan Das, a grocer, the outsiders take up strategic positions in and around Khejuri after 10pm to keep guard. Although I am a Trinamul supporter, I have not been able to identify these young people, Das said. I dont know who they are or where they have come from.        
	Debu Mondal of Khejuris Kamardah said the unknown faces kept watch on the paddy fields after dark while Trinamul activists guarded the market. I dont know who these people are. But they are definitely not from this area.        
	A policeman patrolling the area said the strangers were possibly Maoists but added he was not sure. Complaints have been raised earlier that CPM cadres brand all opponents Maoists to justify retribution.        
	Maoist sources, however, claimed the rebels had joined hands with Trinamul in East Midnapore to destroy our common enemy (the CPM).         
	Although relations between Trinamul and the Maoists had turned bitter after the Nandigram movement in 2007, both sides decided to mend fences in recent weeks after the CPM threatened to recapture Khejuri, the rebel sources said. We decided to bury the hatchet and work together to thwart the Marxists attempts to make inroads into Khejuri again, a Maoist said.        
	After Trinamul and Maoists had allegedly fought the CPM together in Nandigram, the two sides had drifted apart. The rebels had accused Trinamul of hijacking the movement. The Maoists had allegedly killed Nishikanta Mondal, Trinamuls Sonachura gram panchayat pradhan, in retaliation to the snub.         
	Khejuri residents said today Trinamul activists and the young unknown faces had set up six bamboo-pole check posts on the road that leads to Khejuri from Heria. The CPM cadres had entered Khejuri on Wednesday through that route. The check posts have been set up at Tolla, Mianmore, Kalagechhia, Bansgora, Jaminipur and Kamardah.         
	Local Trinamul leader Debashis Ponda said: We had made a mistake by not keeping guard on the road after 2am on Wednesday. The CPM took advantage of that. We are keeping vigil on the road between 10pm and 6am.         
	The Trinamul block president in Khejuri, Nirmal Patra, has asked one member from every family living in the areas where the check posts have been set up to participate in the vigil.         
	We have asked our workers to check every car at the check posts between 10pm and 6am, Patra said. We are using generators to light up the river banks in Khejuri so that we can keep watch on Sunia.        
	CM meets governor        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met governor M.K. Narayanan at Raj Bhavan this evening and discussed the Khejuri episode among other things, sources said.        
	The sources said Bhattacharjee briefed Narayanan on the current situation in Khejuri.        
	The chief minister, they added, also informed the governor about the law and order situation in other parts of the state. The two are said to have also talked about the financial problems Bengal is facing.        
	The chief minister told the governor political clashes had been occurring in some districts. He also informed the governor about the Maoist menace in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, a source said.        
	He said Bhattacharjee spoke to Narayanan about the need for central funds to tide over the current financial problem.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           A woman plucks tea leaves on Monday with the Adivasi Parishads flag stuck to her basket. (Biplab Basak)                                        
	Siliguri, June 7: The champions of shutdown today learnt that the world had changed as they slept.        
	Over 70 per cent of tea garden workers in the Dooars turned up for work, defying a strike called by outfits that include Citu and Intuc.        
	If that is the happy part, the sad bit is that they may not have been driven by any newfound commitment to work.         
	The Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, which has won over the tribal population of the region with its strident opposition to the hills demand for Gorkhaland and, according to supporters, care for the poor, had opposed the strike.        
	The Co-ordination Committee of Tea Plantation Workers, which includes Citu and Intuc, and the Defence Committee of Plantation Workers Rights that comprises the Hind Mazdoor Sabha among others  the two apex bodies of trade unions in tea plantations  had called the strike demanding an interim wage hike.         
	The last time the Co-ordination Committee had called a strike demanding a wage hike, in 2005, the gardens had shut down for a fortnight.        
	The last agreement, reached in 2008, is valid till 2011 but the unions had stoked the demand for an interim hike.        
	The convener of the Co-ordination Committee, Chitta Dey, admitted that their call had failed to evoke the expected response. But he would not admit an erosion of support.         
	The strike was not total for many reasons, he said.         
	(But) there is no big erosion in our support base. Claims that the Parishad and its trade union have eaten into our popularity are irrational. The Adivasi Parishads community-based stand will not last long.        
	Samir Roy of the Defence Committee went a step ahead with the help of some arithmetic acrobatics. Of the 292 tea estates in north Bengal, as many as 146 were shut. About 75 per cent workers joined the strike, which means we still en- joy a majority, said Roy.         
	Industry watchers said his figures included the 87 gardens in the hills where all of them were shut because of a strike called by the Gorkha Jan- mukti Morcha union.         
	Of the 205 estates in the Dooars and the Terai, only 59 remained shut. It shows that prominent trade unions like Citu and Intuc have their support base intact in less than a third of the gardens, an observer said.         
	The unions have allegedly lost touch with many tea garden workers who find the Adivasi Parishad more appealing because it takes up popular issues like the demand for more Hindi-medium schools and vocational training centres.         
	The wage hike was a popular issue but the response to the strike call suggests the tribal population has deserted the other unions.        
	Most Dooars tea garden workers had also not responded to the Lefts call for a nationwide strike on April 27. An observer said the Parishad had managed to convince the large tribal population of the region that the older unions did not care for them. They harped on the fact that the unions were sitting back when many Dooars gardens were shut.        
	Tezkumar Toppo, a leader of the Adivasi Parishads tea garden union, said: Our plan is to meet state officials and ministers and seek an interim wage hike, besides provident fund and gratuity dues.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Nov. 26: A case of death because of negligence has been started against three persons after a boy was electrocuted in Murshidabad yesterday.         
	Class IV student Saiful Sheikh died after touching a telephone tower fence that had been allegedly connected to a live wire.         
	Saifuls father Tahajul Sheikh had in an FIR lodged yesterday mentioned one Kajem Sheikh, who he and other villagers claimed was the guard of the tower. The FIR also mentions Kajems brother Sherful Haque, who is the owner of the field where the tower is located, and the Vodafone official concerned.         
	Samrat Foni, the officer in charge of Beldanga police station, said that since Tahajul could not name any Vodafone official, a case had been lodged against an unknown person.         
	In an email to The Telegraph today, a Vodafone spokesperson said the tower was managed by Indus Towers and not by the telecom service provider. She said the tower at Dayanagar village was unmanned and no caretaker had been posted by Indus. Also, the fencing was not electrified, the spokesperson said.        
	Srijit Sen, head of Bengal operations of Indus Towers, which provides shared telecom infrastructure services, said: The responsibility of operation and maintenance of the tower had been given to a private agency.         
	Sen said the boys death was unfortunate and we will inquire into it.         
	Saurav Sarkar, the branch manager of Vodafone in Murshidabad, had said yesterday we will take strong action against the security guard.         
	Around 7am yesterday, Saiful, 10, had gone to the field where the tower is located and was electrocuted after touching the barbed wire fence around it. Villagers had alleged Kajem had electrified the fence to keep off intruders in his absence.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 23: The state government today passed a bill that will empower the school service commission to grant teachers and non-teaching staff mutual transfers.         
	At present, school managing committees enjoy the power to grant such transfers. Teachers and non-teaching staff are required to submit transfer applications to the committees of the respective schools.         
	But once the West Bengal School Service Commission (second amendment) Bill, 2010, becomes an act, those seeking mutual transfers will have to submit their applications jointly to the school service commission.         
	After receiving the applications, the commission will decide whether the two can interchange schools.         
	School education minister Partha De today said the West Bengal School Service Commission Act, 1997, needed to be amended to make the process of granting mutual transfers more easy.        
	De added: The commission will maintain a list of joint applications so that it can promptly issue transfer orders.         
	Under the existing system, the process of mutual transfers gets delayed because of lack of coordination between the managing committees of the schools involved.         
	According to the bill, mutual transfers will be granted only if the two teachers seeking a swap hold the same post and seniority and teach the same subject.

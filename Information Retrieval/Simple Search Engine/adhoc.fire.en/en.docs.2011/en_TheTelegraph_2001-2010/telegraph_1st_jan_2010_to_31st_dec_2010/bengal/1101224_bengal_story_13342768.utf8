                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata price-rise jab at Congress, CPM   Trinamul to hold protest rallies

	Dec. 23: Mamata Banerjee today said her party would organise marches and public meetings on December 27 and 28 to protest the price rise as she sought to distance herself from the Centre over the soaring costs of essentials.        
	We are worried about the price rise, the Trinamul Congress chief told a party rally at Metro Channel.        
	She said Trinamul was not consulted when the Centre raised fuel prices. There has to be a coordination committee monitoring (prices) at some level, Mamata added. She said she would speak to the Prime Minister about the rise in onion prices.        
	The railway minister also accused the Left Front government of levying high taxes and fuelling the price rise. She said the state government could not deny its responsibility.        
	Mamatas remarks come at a time the Centre is reeling under an Opposition onslaught over escalating food prices. The CPM, too, will hit the streets to protest the price rise as part of a 40-day programme beginning on January 4.        
	At todays rally, attended by around 10,000 people, the Trinamul chief repeated her accusation that the CPM was misusing the joint forces in Jungle Mahal. Yesterday, she had threatened to quit the UPA government if her allegation was proved wrong.        
	Mamata said the central forces were being forced to kill Trinamul supporters in Jungle Mahal.        
	Our boys are being dragged out of their homes by the central forces and handed over to the CPM. I have no problem with the operation against Maoists, but if the central forces are being misused, they must go back, she said.        
	She rephrased a slogan the Left had coined during the seventies. CPM tumi jotoi maro, meyad tomar 2011 (CPM, however much you assault us, your time will be up in 2011), Mamata said.        
	The original slogan was: Police tumi jotoi maro, mainey tomar eksho-baro (police, however much you assault us, your salary will stay Rs 112).        
	Alleging that Bengal had become the cradle of violence, Mamata said: Every morning, I feel afraid that I shall have to hear about the death of some Trinamul supporter or the other. We are against violence. If we had resorted to tit-for-tat, the chief minister would not have been able to step out of his home.        
	Grouse to PM        
	A Trinamul delegation today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and sought his intervention to advance the Assembly elections in the state. The leader of the Opposition in the Bengal Assembly, Partha Chatterjee, said the Trinamul team submitted a 10-volume, 500-page report to Singh, detailing the CPMs reign of terror and mindless killings.

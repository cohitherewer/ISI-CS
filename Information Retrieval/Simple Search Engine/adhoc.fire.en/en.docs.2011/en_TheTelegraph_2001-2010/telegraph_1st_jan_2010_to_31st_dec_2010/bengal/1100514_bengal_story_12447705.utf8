	Calcutta, May 13: Calcutta High Court today directed Kalyani University to reinstate 39 sacked non-teaching staff members.         
	The university had sacked them, saying it had made a mistake by seeking the names of the candidates from nine employment exchanges instead of three in Nadia, Murshidabad and North 24-Paraganas. However, the court ordered that the 39 be reinstated after it was told that the rule had long been scrapped.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Dec. 14: Two persons were arrested last night in a Nadia town for morphing the face of a friends wife on a nude picture and circulating it through MMS clips on mobiles.        
	Businessman Abhik Das of Ranaghat was stunned when an acquaintance came and told him three days ago that a common friend was circulating his wife Anitas (name changed) nude picture through mobiles.        
	The biscuit trader did not believe it at first. But when his acquaintance, whose identity has not been disclosed, showed the picture to him, he immediately went over to Samir Pal, his friend through whose mobile the picture had been sent.         
	Police officers said Pal had secretly taken a picture of the wife when she had visited a mobile and computer repair shop a few days ago. The shop in Ranaghat is owned by Jiban Ghosh, a friend of Pal. Both he and Ghosh then went about superimposing and morphing Anitas face on a nude picture to make it look like she had posed for the lewd shot. The picture was then sent to friends of the duo through MMS.        
	When Das met Pal and accused him of this indecent act, the latter instead of apologising demanded Rs 20,000 from him. He threatened him that if the money was not handed over, he would upload the picture on the Internet.        
	The trader then confronted his wife and asked her how Pal had got her picture. She explained she had gone to Ghoshs shop a few days back when Pal must have taken the picture. I was not aware that he had taken the picture, she said.        
	Das lodged a complaint last evening, based on which Pal and Ghosh were arrested.        
	Hooch deaths        
	Five day labourers died after consuming illicit liquor in West Midnapores Ghatal this morning. The owner of the hooch shop also died after having the drink.

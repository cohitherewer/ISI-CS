	Behrampore, Oct. 21: A Murshidabad farmer throttled his mother to death, killed his elder brothers wife and severed the left palm of his nephew with a sickle this morning following a quarrel over Rs 100.        
	Sadekul Islam, a resident of Lalgolas Taranagar who owns two bighas, had taken Rs 100 from his mothers piggy bank and was furious at being confronted over it.        
	Villagers caught the 28-year-old and gave him a thrashing before handing him over to police soon after the 10am double-murder.        
	He has been charged with killing his mother Rabinur Bewa, 62, sister-in-law Saleher Bewa, 42, and attempting to murder his nephew, Yusuf Ali, 14. Yusuf has been admitted to Behrampore General Hospital.        
	According to the police, Sadekul had taken the money from Rabinurs savings yesterday without informing her. Sadekul took the money and when his mother accused him of stealing, he quarrelled with her. Then at one point during the heated exchange, he caught hold of his mothers throat and throttled her, said an officer.        
	Alerted by the cries of her mother-in-law, Saleher, the wife of Sadekuls elder brother, rushed to stop him and pushed him to the ground. Rabinur, already gasping for breath after being attacked, also fell down and died in the commotion.        
	Sadekul then picked up a sickle lying in one corner of the room and hacked Saleher to death. When her 14-year-old son came to the rescue, Sadekul hit him on his left hand, severing his left palm, the officer said.        
	My uncle and my grandmother were quarrelling since morning after he took Rs 100 from her savings box. I saw my uncle throttling my grandmother. Then he attacked my mother with a sickle. I rushed to help her but my uncle also hit me with it, Yusuf said from his hospital bed.        
	 An officer said Saleher had lost her husband nine years ago to an illness. Since then, she cultivated the familys two-bigha plot left behind by him. Sadekul own two-bigha plot was carved out from the family property.

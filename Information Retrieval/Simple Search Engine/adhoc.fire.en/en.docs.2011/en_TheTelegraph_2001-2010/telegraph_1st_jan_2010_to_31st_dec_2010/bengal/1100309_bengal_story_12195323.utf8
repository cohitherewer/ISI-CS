          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 8: The state government wants to amend the West Bengal Anti-profiteering Act, 1958, in the budget session to allow more stringent action against hoarders of foodgrain.        
	We are placing the West Bengal Anti-profiteering Amendment Bill, 2010, in the budget session to deal firmly with those accused of hoarding foodgrain for profiteering, government chief whip in the Assembly, Syed Mohammed Masih, said today.        
	The budget session begins tomorrow.         
	If passed in the House, the law will allow imprisonment of offenders for at least three months. According to the existing act, a person charged with hoarding foodgrain can be imprisoned for only a month, said an official of the food department.        
	The Presidency University Bill, 2009, seeking unitary university status for the college would be placed in the House this session too. The bill was tabled in the Assembly last year but sent back to a standing committee attached to the higher education department.              
	Another bill that would be placed is the West Bengal Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Bill, 2009. If passed, it will allow patients and their families quick compensation from private hospitals for medical negligence or inflated bills. The minimum compensation for death from negligence is Rs 5 lakh.

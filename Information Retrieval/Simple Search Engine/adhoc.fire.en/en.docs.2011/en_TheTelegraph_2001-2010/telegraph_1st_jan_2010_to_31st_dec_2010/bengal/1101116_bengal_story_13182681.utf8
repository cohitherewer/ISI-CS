  - Manas debate challenge to Asim        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manas Bhuniya                                        
	Calcutta, Nov. 15: The Bengal Congress has finally started speaking on a subject close to the heart of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh: economics.        
	The state Congress today attacked finance minister Asim Dasgupta for the first time over the current fiscal mess in Bengal and held the 34-year-old Left Front regime responsible for it.         
	Massachusetts Institute of Technology-educated Dasgupta has flopped as finance minister. He is fully responsible for the states financial bankruptcy, state Congress chief Manas Bhuniya told a media conference today.         
	Bhuniya handed copies of a note he has prepared on the poor fiscal health of the state to reporters. He said he planned to submit the note to governor M.K. Narayanan.         
	He invited Dasgupta to a public debate on the states financial health. Let Dasgupta place his viewpoints and I shall do mine. He will be proved a failure, Bhuniya said.         
	The states financial situation is grim as our indebtedness has risen to Rs 2 lakh crore, the Congress leader said.         
	Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee was the first among the Opposition leaders in Bengal to highlight the states indebtedness and the CPMs failure to keep the debt burden to a modest level.         
	On her instructions, party leader Partha Chatterjee had called on Narayanan at Raj Bhavan to inform him about the states fiscal mess and sought his intervention to tackle the problem. On Friday, Narayanan had called over Dasgupta to enquire about the health of the states economy.         
	Although Mamata did not meet reporters today, her aides tore into the CPM over the states fiscal problems. The CPM has made our state financially bankrupt, Subrata Bakshi said.         
	Congress sources said Bhuniya rushed to corner Dasgupta after ally Trinamul appeared to hog the limelight by crying itself hoarse against the rising debt burden.         
	With the Congress today joining the chorus, the CPMs discomfort is likely to increase as Dasgupta is banking on a central bail-out to bridge the gap between the states dwindling revenues and its ballooning expenses. According to Dasgupta, the Centre owes Rs 7,000 crore to the state government under various heads, including coal cess.         
	Sources close to the state finance minister told The Telegraph that Dasgupta was hopeful of an amicable settlement between the Centre and the state and was expecting a staggered pay-out of the dues.         
	Even as the state government has come under attack from all quarters for its poor show on the fiscal front, Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has till now not commented on the issue. In the past, Pranabbabu has helped the state during financial crisis. The state government is hopeful that he will do so this time as well, said a source in the state secretariat.         
	An AICC leader said Mukherjee might dwell on the states financial health when he comes to Calcutta on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Jungle Mahal boss felled in third try
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Jungle Mahal boss felled in third try

	July 26: Sidhu Soren, the secretary of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, was third-time unlucky.        
	Last year, police had zeroed in at least twice on the commander-in-chief of the Gana Militia, who had terrorised CPM supporters and dominated around 150sqkm of the Maoist territory in West Midnapore and adjoining Bankura. However, on both occasions, Soren had managed to elude the police.        
	In June last year, the joint forces had cornered Soren, whose real name was Bhuta Baskey, and his aides after they received information that the rebels were hiding in a forest in Kadashole, 15km from Lalgarh. The forces had killed two of Sorens aides but the rebel leader escaped unhurt.         
	A few days later, the police cordoned off a village deep inside Pingboni forest where Soren was camping but he again escaped.         
	But this time, we managed to shoot him dead in the forests of Metala, a police officer said. This is a big setback for the Maoists.        
	Terming Sorens killing a big achievement, West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said: He used to command the squad in Jungle Mahal and knew the terrain very well. He was involved in the murder of several CPM supporters in the area.        
	An intelligence branch official said Soren had been an action squad member of the Maoists even before the formation of the Peoples Committee.        
	Before turning the Peoples Committee into its frontal organisation in 2008, the Maoists had infiltrated the outfit by planting squad members like Soren there. He had helped the Maoists take control of the committee. Soren went underground after the joint forces entered Lalgarh last year.        
	A Maoist leader admitted that Sorens death was a loss for the rebels. This will help the police enter and dominate the areas where we are in total control, he said.         
	Intelligence officials said Sidhu hailed from Kharkata village near Goaltore. The police claimed Sidhu had trained the new recruits of the Maoists in Lalgarh.

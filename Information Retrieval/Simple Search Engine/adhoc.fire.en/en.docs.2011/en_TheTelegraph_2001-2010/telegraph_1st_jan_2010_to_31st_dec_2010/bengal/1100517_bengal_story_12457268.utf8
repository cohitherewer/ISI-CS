	Calcutta, May 16: The chief minister today again indicated his differences with his party on bandhs and strikes, which, he has often said, were counterproductive and overused.

The discussions are on, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said days after the CPM central committee apparently censured him indirectly for his reservations.         
	The committees document on the partys internal rectification campaign says: There were instances of leaders decrying working-class struggles and strikes. This is a weakening of links with the masses at the different levels of the party.

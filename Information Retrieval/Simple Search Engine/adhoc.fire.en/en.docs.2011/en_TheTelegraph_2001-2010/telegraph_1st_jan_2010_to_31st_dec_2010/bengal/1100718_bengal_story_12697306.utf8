          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bankura, July 17: Clashes broke out today between CPM and Trinamul Congress supporters in Bankuras Patrashayar after armed Left cadres tried to regain turf in a former Red bastion, police said.        
	The CPM activists tried to reopen zonal and party offices that had been closed since 2009 because of Trinamul atrocities, and allegedly ransacked the Trinamul office at Balsi Bank More and the homes of two party workers this morning. Local Trinamul leaders claimed the CPM cadres threw bombs and that six party supporters had been injured.        
	Patrashayar, like the rest of Bankura, had been a CPM citadel for almost three decades. The Opposition, mainly Trinamul, started making inroads since the 2008 rural elections, when Mamata Banerjees party won three of the regions 12 panchayat samitis. In the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, the CPMs victory margins were reduced in several pockets of Bishnupur and in Patrashayar.        
	Patrashayar has been rocked by political clashes since the Lok Sabha polls. Several CPM offices were closed down and many party workers fled their homes, fearing Trinamul atrocities, CPM district secretary Amiya Patra said.        
	Yesterday, Patra had urged CPM supporters at a meeting in Jamkuri village, about 20km from Balsi, to return to Patrashayar and reopen the party offices. This morning, a large number of CPM supporters riding rickshaw vans and other vehicles entered Patrashayar.        
	They allegedly ransacked the Trinamul office at Balsi village. Trinamul supporters retaliated, with both sides hurling bombs and bricks at each other, the police said. Both sides threw stones at the police when they intervened, officers said.        
	Flag-waving CPM supporters ransacked the homes of two Trinamul men, including local leader Naba Pal, Trinamul sources alleged.         
	The asbestos roofs of our party office and the two houses were broken, said Parthapratim Singh, the Trinamul block president.        
	Forces were sent to Balsi and the situation was brought under control. The CPM and Trinamul supporters were initially refusing to allow the police to enter the village, said Bishnupur sub-divisional police officer Debajyoti Das. He said reinforcements had to be brought in. The police have arrested eight CPM activists so far.        
	In Durgapurs Andal, three Trinamul supporters were beaten up, allegedly by CPM activists, last night while campaigning for their partys martyrs day rally in Calcutta on July 21.

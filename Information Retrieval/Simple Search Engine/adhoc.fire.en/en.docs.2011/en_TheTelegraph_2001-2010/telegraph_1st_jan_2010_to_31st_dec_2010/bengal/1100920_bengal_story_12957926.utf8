The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Debt: an unnecessary evil
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Debt: an unnecessary evil

	Ausgram (Burdwan) Sept. 19: Back-breaking debt, a curse that conspired with the drought to claim three lives in Burdwan this year, could have been avoided had farmers borrowed from state-owned cooperative banks and not from moneylenders at much higher interest.        
	While the cooperative banks lend at a yearly interest of 7 per cent, the moneylenders charge 10 to 12 per cent per month.         
	Farmers said most of them avoided banks because of lack of awareness and the paperwork and formalities involved. Many of them are illiterate and several dont have proper land documents.        
	The cooperative banks want undisputed documents. Many of us dont know how to read and write. We feel nervous in front of bank officials. Also, getting loans from these banks takes time whereas local moneylenders lend us cash within a few hours, said Jabbar Sheikh, 45, a debt-ridden farmer in Ausgrams Basantapur.        
	Jabbar has cultivated only five bighas of his seven-bigha land this season. Moreover, his crops have failed because of the scanty rain. The farmer had borrowed Rs 20,000 from a moneylender at a monthly interest of 10 per cent. Now I dont know how I will repay the loan, Jabbar said.        
	Yunus Sheikh, Jitu Bagdi and Gosain Patra, the Ausgram farmers who committed suicide this year, were all neck-deep in debt. Yunus owed Rs 50,000, Jitu Rs 32,000 and Gosain Rs 14,000 to moneylenders.        
	Jitus wife Rupa said: My husband was so depressed because of the failed crops and the debt that he killed himself by drinking pesticide.        
	A majority of the 20 lakh farmers in the district are perpetually in debt because they borrow from moneylenders at a high interest.        
	According to district magistrate .S. Meena, the administration repeatedly advises the farmers to borrow money from local cooperative banks to avoid falling into the debt trap. We have decided to launch awareness programmes to persuade farmers to take loans from banks, Meena said.        
	District agricultural officer Shyamal Dutta blamed illiteracy and lethargy on the part of farmers for their woes.         
	Many of the farmers avoid banks because the moneylenders mislead them. The moneylenders pose as the farmers friends and discourage them from taking loans from banks. They scare the farmers by telling them that it is difficult to get loans from banks, Dutta said.        
	He said the farmers needed to be told how simple it was to get loans from banks. A farmer just needs to apply for a loan on a white sheet of paper and attach a photocopy of his land deed. A sharecropper needs to produce a consent letter from the land owner and a forwarding letter from the local panchayat. The loan is sanctioned after verification, Dutta said.         
	Chittaranjan Banerjee, the chairman of the state-owned Central Cooperative Bank in Burdwan, said the cooperative banks in the district had provided Rs 64 crore in loans to around 2.5 lakh farmers between May and August this year.        
	Sajal Chowdhury, a farmer in Mangalkot, 30km from Ausgram, said he regularly borrowed from cooperative banks. Sharecroppers cultivate my 147-bigha plot. I borrow money from banks at an interest of only 7 per cent. I am under no pressure although most of my crops have failed this year, Chowdhury said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rebels tap city money amp; mates
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rebels tap city money amp; mates
  - Maoist kingpins frequent Calcutta to raise funds and build support        PRONAB MONDAL AND KINSUK BASU                                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 11: Maoist leaders frequent Calcutta more than previously suspected for funds and friends, the interrogation of Kanchan has revealed, turning the spotlight on their sources of support and havens in the city.        
	The interrogation of Kanchan, the rebels state secretary arrested from the city last week along with others, has revealed that guerrilla kingpins have been coming to the city often to tap businessmen with interests in the rebel-affected West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia.         
	Protection money is their main, and easy, source of funding. But in recent times, the Maoists have also wooed sympathisers to their cause, especially on the northern and southern fringes of Calcutta, an officer said.        
	Police estimate that last year, the rebels collected around Rs 3 crore from across the state. Besides, the Bengal unit of the CPI (Maoist) receives Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1 crore from its central committee every year.        
	Subscription from sympathisers, though not substantial, is another cash source. The number of sympathisers, though small, has been growing, the officer said.        
	Estimates gleaned from Kanchan put the number of such sympathisers in Calcutta and its adjoining districts at 600, of whom 200 are said to be card-holding members of the CPI (Maoist). The full-state figure is around 3,000. Among the sympathisers are state government staff and a section of private sector employees.         
	The revelations made by Kanchan are quite startling. He told us that apart from North and South 24-Parganas, the organisation has achieved some success (in winning over friends and raising cash) in Howrah and Hooghly, said Rajeev Kumar, chief of Calcutta polices special task force. The squad had arrested Kanchan.        
	The Calcutta operations are handled by what the cops dubbed the city committee. A former Jadavpur University student, Abhishekh Chatterjee, heads the cell, though he is on the run now.         
	In the past few years, Maoists were consolidating their base in Jungle Mahal. Now, they are trying to move into urban areas, especially Calcutta, as that is where the money is. Also, they realise they need the backing of the intelligentsia, who are mostly city-based, the officer said.        
	Kanchan is said to have held at least three meetings with the city committee between this January and June. In fact, it was at his behest that the Maoists became active in the jute mills in Kanchrapara, Naihati and Barrackpore in North 24-Parganas and in Serampore and Chandernagore in Hooghly.        
	Brothers shot        
	Suspected Maoists shot dead two brothers from a family of CPM supporters near Lalgarh last night believing they were police informers.         
	Around the same time, joint forces arrested four rebels near Jhargram, 35km from Lalgarh. Two of them are said to be members of the action squad led by CPI (Maoist) state committee member Sashadhar Mahato.

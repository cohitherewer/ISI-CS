The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Voters list 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Voters list 
                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 27: The final voters list for the state will be published by the Election Commission of India on January 5 next year.        
	In 2006, when the Assembly polls were last held in Bengal, nearly two months separated the publication of the voters list and the first day of polling.         
	If the panel maintains the gap as in 2006, Assembly elections are unlikely to be held before March next year.        
	However, an election commission official said the publication of electoral rolls had nothing to do with the election schedules.

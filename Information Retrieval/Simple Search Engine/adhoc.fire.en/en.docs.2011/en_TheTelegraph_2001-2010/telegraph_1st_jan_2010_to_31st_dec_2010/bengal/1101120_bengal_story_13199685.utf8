	Darjeeling, Nov. 19: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has said it will take part in municipal elections once the interim set-up for the hills is established, signalling that it will abide by democratic norms.        
	The Morcha has not allowed civic elections since 2009 as part of its non-cooperation movement against the state government.         
	However, the hill party said it would oppose elections to the gram panchayats until the territorial jurisdiction of the set-up was finalised.

	Calcutta, March 20: Police have registered a murder case in the death of two schoolgirls in Bansdroni after the father of one of them accused a classmate of poisoning them.        
	Ajoy Singh, the father of Class IV student Jyoti, one of the two girls who died on Thursday after eating lunch at school, lodged an official complaint against the classmate at Regent Park police station late yesterday.        
	In the complaint, Ajoy has said that while Jyoti was being taken to hospital, she had named a classmate and accused her of mixing rat poison in their food, a police officer said.        
	Uma Devi, Jyotis aunt, told The Telegraph: She was jealous of Jyoti and Payel (Pandey) because they had done better than her in the exams,         
	On the basis of the complaint, we have started a murder case, a senior South 24-Parganas police officer said.         
	However, we will not mention the name of the person against whom the case has been lodged, he added.        
	The police had earlier questioned Devendra Dubey, the principal of Dwivedi Devendra Vidyalaya.         
	The police did not interrogate the accused today though they had spoken to her yesterday. She had denied the murder charge.

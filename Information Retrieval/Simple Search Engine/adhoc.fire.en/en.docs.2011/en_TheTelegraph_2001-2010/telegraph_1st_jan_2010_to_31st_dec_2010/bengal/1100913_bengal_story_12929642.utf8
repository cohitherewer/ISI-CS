	Midnapore, Sept. 12: Suspected Maoists today shot at a CPM functionary in the heart of Lalgarh at a time the CPM is planning to recapture the town by launching attacks from pockets recently reclaimed from the rebels.        
	Tarun Banerjee, 38, a CPM branch committee member, was shot at twice by a youth on a bicycle when he was returning home from a market. Banerjee, who works for the public health engineering department, suffered bullet injuries in his chest and left wrist.         
	Police said the attack, the first on a CPM member in Lalgarh town since the beginning of the Maoist movement there in 2008, was a challenge to the party by the rebels after the Left recaptured neighbouring Dharampur, Ramgarh and Pirakata in recent weeks.         
	CPM sources said Banerjee was the only party leader in Lalgarh who had not fled in the face of Maoist threats.         
	Todays attack happened in front of Banerjees home, barely 300 metres from the school ground where Mamata Banerjee held her rally on August 9.        
	Eyewitness Amit Ghosh (name changed), a schoolteacher, said: I was passing by Taruns house this morning when I saw him coming from the opposite direction. Suddenly, a youth in black shorts and a T-shirt of the same colour approached him from from behind on a bicycle. The youth fired at him but missed.         
	As the youth got down from the cycle and aimed his revolver again at Tarun, he rushed forward and clutched the assailants hand and began shouting for help. But the youth wrenched free and shot at Tarun twice.         
	He then fished out another revolver from his pocket and aimed them at me and the other bystanders. As we retreated, he left his cycle behind and ran towards the neighbouring Bhulagera forest.         
	Banerjee was taken to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital from where he was shifted to a private hospital in Calcutta.        
	Joint forces from a camp on the outskirts of Lalgarh combed the area but drew a blank. West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said: Even though only one Maoist attacked him, we think a group of rebels were hiding nearby. They probably helped him escape.        
	Rebel explosion        
	A group of 30 Maoists set off an explosion at the CPM local committee office at Lodhashuli, 15km from Jhargram town, in the early hours today.        
	The rebels broke open the office door, flung the furniture outside and damaged them. Then they blew up part of the office.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarhs wound
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Lalgarhs wound
          ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR      
	Tamluk, Aug. 1: If you are from Lalgarh, any treatment will be for a bullet injury unless you prove otherwise.        
	A 100-strong joint forces team descended on an East Midnapore nursing home at midnight and grilled a Lalgarh farmer suspecting him to be a rebel undergoing treatment for bullet wounds. The other 19 patients, none of whom were from Lalgarh, were also questioned.        
	The sight of the heavily armed personnel peering into cabins, scanning records and grilling patients triggered panic and immediate political controversy because the nursing home is owned by a Trinamul Congress leader.         
	Lalgarhs Bishnupada Manna, recovering from a July 25 gall bladder operation, was interrogated for over an hour. The cops also spoke to the doctor who had performed the surgery on the 55-year-old. But nothing incriminating was found after the search that began around 11 last night.        
	As information about the raid spread, nearly 5,000 Trinamul supporters descended on the spot a little past midnight. Some of them went from there to demonstrate in front of the local Panskura police station.        
	Subhendu Adhikary, the local Trinamul MP, arrived around 1am. The police raided the nursing home because it belongs to a Trinamul youth leader. It is a conspiracy hatched by the police and the CPM, said Adhikary.        
	East Midnapore police chief Ashok Biswas said: The police (joint forces) raided the nursing home because they had information that injured Maoists were being treated. But nothing was found during the raid.        
	Anisur Rahman, the owner of Idan Nursing Home who is also the working president of the Trinamuls youth wing in East Midnapore, alleged the troops had barged in without reason.        
	This afternoon, Trinamul supporters ransacked the CPM zonal committee office in Panskura, accusing the rival party of hatching a conspiracy with the police and plotting the raid. CPM leaders denied the charges.        
	Patient Bishnupadas son Subhas claimed the grilling was too much for his ailing father. They interrogated my father for over an hour, after which he felt breathless. My father and I were harassed only because we are residents of Lalgarh, said Subhas, 22.         
	Subhas said he had shifted his father to his married sisters house in Golgram from Lalgarhs Balamadha village for treatment two months ago.

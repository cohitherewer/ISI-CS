The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Search for kin with DNA
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Search for kin with DNA
          AMIT UKIL                              
	Midnapore, May 30: Hospital authorities today started drawing blood samples for DNA testing of the relatives of those killed in the Jnaneswari Express disaster as many defaced and decomposed bodies remained unidentified.        
	Of the 150 bodies found so far, only 71 have been identified. Many relatives and close friends could not identify their loved ones even after seeing the bodies or their pictures.        
	We had anticipated this. The impact of the crash was so huge, especially on two of the coaches, that it is impossible to recognise many of the victims from their remains, said Parthapratim Pradhan, the superintendent of the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital.         
	I held a meeting with the district magistrate and superintendent of police this morning and decided to take DNA samples from the kin. Samples from the bodies were taken as soon as they were numbered on arrival at the morgue, he added.        
	The samples are being sent to the Central Forensic Laboratory in Calcutta for DNA processing and matching. Even if these are done on an urgent basis, it will take at least three to four days for the reports to come, a doctor said.         
	By 4.30pm, 23 relatives had given their blood samples. The youngest of them was 15-year-old Abhik Banerjee, who is from Bharuch, Gujarat. His father Amarjyoti was travelling to his in-laws place in Rourkela, where Amit was holidaying with his mother.         
	Coaches scrap        
	The 13 derailed coaches of the Jnaneswari Express, some of which still have a stench of death wrapped around them, will soon be auctioned as scrap.        
	All the 13 coaches are completely damaged. None of them can be put to use in the future and so we have decided to auction them, said senior South Eastern Railway commercial manager Manoj Kumar.         
	It costs the railways around Rs 2 crore to build a coach. Officials said that given the condition of these coaches, they would not fetch more than Rs 10 lakh each in the auction.

	Calcutta: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has said he will try to make police more active but reminded the CPM that the force cannot prop up the party organisation.        
	Responding to criticism that the police were inactive in the face of Opposition violence, the chief minister told the CPM state committee that we cant run the organisation with the help of the police. Instead, he laid stress on building public support for mass resistance.

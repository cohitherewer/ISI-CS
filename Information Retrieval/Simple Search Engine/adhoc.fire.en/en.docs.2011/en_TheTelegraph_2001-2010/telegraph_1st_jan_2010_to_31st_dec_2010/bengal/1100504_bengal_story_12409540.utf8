The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mayor mystery: take your pick
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mayor mystery: take your pick
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          (From left) Javed Khan, Partha Chatterjee, Sovan Chatterjee, Mohammad Salim and Sudhanshu Seal                                  
	Calcutta, May 3: Mamata Banerjee may find it easy to settle scores with the Congress in Calcutta. However, it may not be so easy for her to choose the next mayor if the Trinamul Congress wins the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections despite the breakdown of its alliance with the Congress, political circles believe.        
	The name emerging first in Trinamul circles is that of Javed Khan, and for obvious reasons. He has been the leader of the Opposition in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for the past five years and is known to be close to Mamata.        
	Javed is very close to Mamata and always lies low in party matters, leaving crucial decisions to our leader. He is now being projected unofficially as our candidate for mayor. However, our leader will take the final call after the results are declared, a senior south Calcutta Trinamul MLA said.         
	The other reason for choosing Khan as mayor is just as obvious. The support of Muslims has been key to the Trinamul chiefs recent electoral successes across Bengal. If chosen, Khan would be the first Muslim mayor of Calcutta since Independence and this could help Mamata consolidate her new-found minority vote bank for the 2011 Assembly elections.        
	Asked about his chances, Khan told The Telegraph: As there hasnt been an alliance, it will be a tough fight. So, let me win the election first. The rest is left to Didi, she is the final authority.         
	However, political circles argue that Mamata may not be keen to be seen as one appeasing Muslims after all. The Trinamul chief may have gained the communitys support through the Rizwanur Rahman case and the Nandigram agitation but having won several elections over the past few years, she may not like to overstretch her dependence on Muslim votes, said an observer of Mamatas politics.        
	Given this political context, two other names doing the rounds in Trinamul circles for the mayoral office are incidentally not in the election fray  the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Partha Chatterjee, and South 24-Parganas Trinamul president Sovan Chatterjee.        
	Partha is known to be the second-most important leader in Trinamul and holds the organisational responsibility in the party for the city civic polls. Sovan had an earlier association with the CMC as a mayor-in-council member and also enjoys Mamatas trust.        
	The Muslim vote banks appeal, which makes Khan a possible choice for Trinamul, also applies to the CPMs Mohammad Salim. Like Partha or Sovan, Salim is not a candidate in this months CMC elections but is said to be the CPMs answer to Khan, sources said.        
	Salim has been projected by the party as the face of its new leadership and, as a member of its state secretariat, is known to be close to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the sources added.        
	The other possible CPM choice, Sudhanshu Seal, is a candidate this time. In Seals case, the party has made an exception to its policy of not giving tickets to councillors who have served three terms. A former MP and MLA, he enjoys the trust of the partys Calcutta district committee and its secretary Raghunath Kushari.        
	Seal, however, dismissed reports of him being projected as mayor candidate. Im not aware of that. In our party, individuals dont have a say. The party decides, he said.         
	For the Congress, Subrata Mukherjee would have been the obvious choice if the party had any realistic hope of having its own mayor.        
	But the state Congress faces two big uncertainties. One, how many seats it can win on its own. In 2005, the party had won 21 seats, having fought alone as Trinamul had an alliance with the BJP then.        
	Two, whether Subrata will stay with the Congress or jump the party and join Trinamul yet again.

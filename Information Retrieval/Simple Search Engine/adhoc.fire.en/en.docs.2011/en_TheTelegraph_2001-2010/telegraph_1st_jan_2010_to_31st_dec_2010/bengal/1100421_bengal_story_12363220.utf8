The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Only 3 sides in hill talks
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Only 3 sides in hill talks
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, April 20: The Centre has refused to include any other outfit in the talks on Darjeeling, quashing demands by the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad and the Gorkha National Liberation Front.        
	Lt Gen. (retd) Vijay Madan, who has been appointed interlocutor for the talks, said: The ongoing tripartite talks will only involve the representatives of the state, Centre and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. There should be no ambiguity on this stand.         
	Madans statement comes after the Adivasi Parishad demanded that the National Commission on Schedule Tribes be involved in the talks. It is necessary to include the commission in the process because tribals are in a majority in the Terai and the Dooars, its general secretary, Tezkumar Toppo, had said.         
	GNLF and Adivasi Pari- shad leaders today said the Centres decision to limit the talks to the three existing sides would further complicate the issue.

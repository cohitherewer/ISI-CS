	Shilda (West Midnapore), Feb. 19: The government has finalised a site outside Shilda town with the promise of better defences to relocate the Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) camp attacked by Maoists on Monday.        
	Officials said the new location was perfect: it is on higher ground, has open fields around it and offers a clear view of all approaches. The new camp will have watchtowers and bunkers, none of which the previous camp had. Well get a clear view of anyone approaching the camp. No one can take us by surprise, an official said.        
	The old camp was dismantled after the rebel raid that left 24 EFR policemen dead. It was found to be unsafe and its location in the heart of a crowded market had compromised its security, the officials said.        
	Another advantage at the new site is a video hall lying unused for years, the officials said, adding the brick-and-mortar structure could afford greater protection for the personnel there.        
	However, the CPM, which had virtually forced the authorities to set up the previous EFR camp in the market over two years ago, is resisting the shift to the site chosen by the officials. Instead, local leaders have identified a community hall, in the heart of the town, to house the camp. While the new site is about a kilometre from the local CPM office, the hall is barely 200 metres away.         
	The people of Shilda are feeling unsafe. The new site is nearly 1km from our party office and off the road between Shilda and Belpahari. We are the prime enemies of Maoists. We fear an attack from them at any moment because they will definitely try to wipe out us from this area. We want the camp as close to our party office as possible, said a CPM worker.         
	According to the party worker, the hall lies unused most of the time. If the EFR camp is shifted there (to the hall), we will all feel safe, he said.        
	Amiya Sengupta, secretary of the partys Binpur II zonal committee, echoed the sentiment. Setting up the camp at the community hall is the demand of the local people.         
	But the police have made it clear that there is no question of compromising with security this time. We had to sacrifice 24 lives because of them (the local CPM leaders). Now there is no question of paying heed to their demand. We will relocate the camp to a place we think is better and safe for our personnel, said a senior police officer.        
	Kuldiep Singh, inspector-general (western range), said the camp would be set up soon. Basic work has started.

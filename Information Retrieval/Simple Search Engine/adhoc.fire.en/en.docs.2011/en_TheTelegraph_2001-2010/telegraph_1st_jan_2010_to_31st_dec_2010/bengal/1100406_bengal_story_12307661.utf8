          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk (East Midnapore), April 5: Around Rs 20 lakh was snatched here today from two bank employees travelling in a hired car without security.        
	The money was being transferred from the Tamluk branch of United Bank of India to the one at Radhamoni, about 8km away.         
	On the outskirts of Tamluk town, two motorbikes with four young men forced the car to a stop. Two of them got down and pointed revolvers at bank men Sunil Sarkar and Bishnupada Maity. The car keys were snatched from the driver and he was beaten up, a police officer said. The youths opened the car door and pulled out the steel trunk that contained the cash. One of them took the trunk on his lap and the motorcycles sped away.        
	Neither the robbers nor the motorcycles could be traced till late tonight. We are questioning the bank duo and the driver for a description of the robbers, subdivisional police officer Parijat Biswas said.        
	Sarkar, development officer of the UBIs Radhamoni branch, said they had seen a mo-torcycle trailing the car soon after they left the Tamluk office. But we didnt suspect the man. When we slowed down to climb onto National Highway 41, the two-wheeler overtook us and stopped our car. Another motorcycle, which was ah- ead of us, stopped too. When two men got down from the two bikes, we realised something was wrong, said Sarkar.        
	Sushil Karak, regional manager of the UBI in East Midnapore, said that as a norm, security guards were not deployed if Rs 20 lakh or less had to be transferred.

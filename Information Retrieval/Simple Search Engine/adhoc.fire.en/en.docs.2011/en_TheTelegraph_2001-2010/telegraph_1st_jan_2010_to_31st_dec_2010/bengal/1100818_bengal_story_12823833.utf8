                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hand chopped off for Rs 50
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Aug. 17: A Murshidabad meat-seller chopped off the hand of a villager who owed him Rs 50 and walked home past stunned neighbours clutching the severed portion before flinging it down on the courtyard of his house.        
	The hand was eventually brought to the hospital where Kalu Mondal was admitted this morning, several hours after the attack last night, but the doctors said it was too late. The culprit, Sirazul Sheikh, is on the run.        
	According to police, Kalu had purchased 500 grams of meat from Sirazuls shop at Parashpur in Murshidabads Jalangi, about 255km from Calcutta, a month ago. Kalu had paid Rs 75 and owed another Rs 50.        
	A month ago, I had gone to the village market where Sirazul practically forced me to take the 500 grams of meat. The cost was Rs 125 but I had only Rs 75 with me. I could not pay him the remaining Rs 50 because I have not been getting much work, the 27-year-old day labourer said today from his bed at the Behrampore General Hospital.        
	Last night, Kalu came across Sirazul on the outskirts of the village. Sirazul demanded his money and threatened to cut off his hand if he did not pay. An altercation started and Kalu dared Sirazul to carry out his threat. Sirazul had a sickle in his hand and with one swift stroke, severed Kalus left hand at the wrist, a police officer said.        
	Kalu fell on the ground, writhing in pain, his screams alerting some villagers who wrapped the arm with a piece of cloth and rushed him to the local health centre. He was referred to the Behrampore hospital around midnight.        
	Sirazul, who had walked away from the spot before the villagers came to Kalus rescue, trudged home with the hand.         
	Idris Mondal, a villager from neighbouring Dayarampur, said the meat-seller brought the severed portion home and some women had seen him throw the hand down in his courtyard. We asked Sirazul to return the hand to Kalu immediately. Sirazul went out and possibly sent it to Kalus house through another villager, said Idris.        
	Kalus wife Ajmera Bibi said she had taken the severed hand to the Behrampore hospital. The couple have three daughters, all under ten.        
	However, Ananda Mondal, the superintendent of the hospital, said: The hand reached us this morning but it was useless as it was too late.        
	Additional superintendent of police Deep Narayan Goswami said a hunt was on for Sirazul.

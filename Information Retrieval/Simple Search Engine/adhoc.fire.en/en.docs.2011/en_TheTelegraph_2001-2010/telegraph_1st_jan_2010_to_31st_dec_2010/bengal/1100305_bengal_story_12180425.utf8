The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cop source network clicks in rebel zone
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cop source network clicks in rebel zone
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, March 4: The credit of homing in on Lalmohan Tudu and Telugu Deepak, police say, goes to the source network they built in the recent months.        
	It was extremely difficult to get information on Maoists earlier, a police officer said. But now things seem to be changing as some of the Maoists are becoming disillusioned with the indiscriminate manner in which common people are being killed. The police claimed that many Maoist sympathisers had also become disenchanted with the rebels because of extortion and forcible collection of food grain from villagers as well as the killing of tribals whom they were supposed to protect.        
	Over the past six months, the security forces in West Midnapore also stepped up efforts to help the tribals. The joint forces set up health camps and distributed clothes and blankets among the tribals. The police, the CRPF and the BSF organise such camps once a month.         
	Today, we held a health camp in Lodhashuli where we gave out free medicines to sick people. We have also distributed blankets, woollens and clothes to poor villagers in winter. We can now feel that our relations with the villagers have improved, said a police officer.         
	Earlier, information came to us from CPM sources but this dried up as many were killed (by the Maoists) and others fled. Those who stayed, kept a mile away from the forces, scared of harassment.         
	After we increased our efforts to help them, more people came to us with information on the Maoists. We have also increased the amount we pay for information on the rebels. We pay anywhere between Rs 200 and Rs 10,000 depending on the nature of information provided, another officer said.        
	The police said the information about Tudus presence in Narcha had come to them through the newly established network of sources that they claim has grown since last November.         
	Tudu was gunned down on February 22 in what the police claim was an encounter with the Maoists.        
	We had specific information about Telugu Deepak leaving Jhargram for Calcutta, an officer said. Deepak was caught in Calcutta on March 2.        
	The police claimed that in January and February they were close to catching Maoist leader Kishan in Lalgarh, but he escaped narrowly.

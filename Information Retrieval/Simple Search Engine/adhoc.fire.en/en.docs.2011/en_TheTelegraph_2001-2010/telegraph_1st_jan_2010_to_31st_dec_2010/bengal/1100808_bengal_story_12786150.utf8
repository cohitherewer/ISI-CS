                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Village dilemma before meeting
  - PCPA prod to attend Mamata rally, CPM says skip it        NARESH JANA                           The CPM procession in Pirakata on Saturday. Picture by Samir Mondal                                        
	Midnapore, Aug. 7: Mamata Banerjees Lalgarh rally is just a day away but the residents of Jungle Mahal are caught between the devil and the deep sea.        
	On one hand, the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities is pressuring them to attend the rally, on the other, the CPM is warning them against doing so. The villagers are in a dilemma.        
	We dont know what to do. Two CPM workers came to my house this morning and warned me and my family against joining Mondays rally. But when I was working in the fields at noon, a group of Peoples Committee activists came and told me to attend the rally at any cost, said Madan Maity (name changed), 40, a farmer in Salbonis Pirakata village, 17km from Lalgarh.        
	CPM supporters and workers today held a march in Pirakata. Armed with red flags and banners, the CPM supporters raised slogans against the Trinamul Congress-Maoist nexus .        
	The committee organised out a counter procession in Pirakata and urged villagers to join Mamatas rally.        
	Maity said the committee members who met him in the field also ordered him to join their procession. I refused as I had not finished sowing. But they caught me by the collar and forced me to take part in their procession, he said.        
	However, Maitys ordeal did not end there. The committee members also forced him to promise that he would attend the Trinamul chiefs rally without fail.        
	Residents of several other Maoist-affected villages in Salboni, Lalgarh, Goaltore and Jhargram are facing the same problem. Hundreds of villagers have been facing threats and counter-threats from the CPM and the committee for the past few days.         
	Sanatan Ghosh, 32, resident of a Salboni village, said: Committee members are insisting that we attend the Lalgarh meeting. But CPM activists are regularly threatening us with dire consequences if we follow the committees diktat. We are under tremendous mental stress, Ghosh, who runs a rice shop, said.         
	The same mood of despondency prevails in Pingboni, Patasole, Patharpara and Kadasole villages of Goaltore.        
	I have to go every day to my landowners field to work to put food on the table for my children. But committee members told me two days ago that if I did not attend the rally, they would not let me work from Tuesday. However, CPM activists have warned me against going to the Trinamul meeting, said 52-year-old Rebati Mondal (name changed) of Pingboni.         
	I cant take this any more. I am planning to leave this place and go to a relatives home in Midnapore town for a week, she added.        
	The CPM procession today was organised also to send the message that the party was clawing back after being cornered by the Maoists in Jungle Mahal.         
	The CPM office in Pirakata was opened on August 5 after seven months. In December last year, Maoists had set the office on fire.         
	Subhendu Adhikari, the Trinamul MP from Tamluk, today visited Lalgarh to oversee the preparations for Mondays rally.

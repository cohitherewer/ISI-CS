The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Left throws in the towel on Trinamul turf   Absent in 50% wards
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Left throws in the towel on Trinamul turf
   Absent in 50% wards          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Tamluk, April 28: Practically wiped out from large parts of East Midnapore since the Nandigram episode, the Left Front has been unable to field candidates in 50 per cent of the seats in Tamluk and Contai municipalities.        
	Of the 40 total seats in the two municipalities, the front has fielded candidates in 19. In the 20-seat civic body in Tamluk, the front has candidates in 11. In Contai, it will contest eight of the 20 seats.        
	In 2005, the front had contested 16 wards in Tamluk and all 20 in Contai.        
	The number of CPM candidates in the fray has come down to 10 from 20 in the two municipalities. The nine other seats the front is contesting have been divided among the CPI (5), West Bengal Socialist Party (2), RSP (1) and the Forward Bloc (1).        
	Although the ruling front has lost ground in many parts of the state, particularly in south Bengal, East Midnapore, perhaps, represents the worst-case scenario.        
	This is the first time the front is fielding so few candidates in any municipal poll in the district in the three decades of its rule in Bengal.        
	We had trailed in all the wards in these two (Tamluk and Contai) municipalities during the Lok Sabha polls last May. We had also trailed in all the wards of Contai during the bypoll to the Contai (South) Assembly seat last November. So, this time, we have fiel-ded candidates only in those wards where we have the possibility of winning, said Ashok Guria, a CPM district secretariat member.         
	An East Midnapore CPM leader admitted that they were giving up without a fight. We have no other option. We are being force to give up without a fight because we have lost our support base heavily across the district.        
	The front had trailed heavily in hundreds of municipal wards across the state in the Lok Sabha polls. For instance, in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, front candidates lagged behind Opposition nominees in 119 of the 141 wards.        
	Asked why the alliance cannot contest all the wards in Tamluk when it can do so in Calcutta, the front leaders of East Midnapore were evasive.         
	The decision to field municipal candidates is taken at the local level. We are not con-cerned about what is happening in other places. We have decided to field candidates in 19 wards and we might offer support to some Independent candidates, said Kanu Sahu, district CPM secretary and front convener.        
	Although Contai municipality has been under Trinamul control for the past 10 years, the Left had snatched Tamluk from Mamata Banerjees party in 2005.         
	After Trinamul swept the panchayat polls in 2008, seve- ral Left councillors, including one from the CPM, switched to Trinamul, leading to a collapse of the board. Mamatas party is now running the board after winning a vote of confidence.        
	Tamluks Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari said the people had rejected the front in East Midnapore after the Nandigram movement against land acquisition. This rejection was reflected in the panchayat and Lok Sabha polls. The Left Front will also be rejected in the municipal polls, Adhikari said.

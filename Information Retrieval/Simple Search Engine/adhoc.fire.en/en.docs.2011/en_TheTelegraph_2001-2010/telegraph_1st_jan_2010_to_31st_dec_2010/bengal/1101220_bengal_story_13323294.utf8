The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Didi parley on Cong
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Didi parley on Cong
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 19: Mamata Banerjee has called a meeting of the Trinamul Congress core committee tomorrow to discuss relations with the state Congress, days after Congress leaders stayed away from a railway programme in Murshidabad.        
	While Murshidabad strongman Adhir Chowdhury skipped the Sagardighi event on Wednesday saying he had not been invited, Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee cancelled his trip at the last moment after his helicopter developed a snag.         
	Chowdhury had organised a rail roko at Behrampore the same day.         
	A Mamata aide said that the way Chowdhury chose to play politics with the railway programme had not gone down well with the Trinamul chief.        
	The aide said the invitation card for the event mentioned Chowdhury as one of the guests. He added: Didi believes Chowdhury tried to queer her pitch in Murshidabad.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata had not taken too kindly to Mukherjees absence, either. Sagardighi falls in Pranabbabus Jangipur Lok Sabha constituency. Didi wanted to have him by her side, a party general secretary said.        
	Trinamul insiders said Mamata had an agenda in mind. Didi knows that the peoples mandate in the recent series of elections in the state has been in her favour. She wants to capitalise on that, a leader said.        
	She will not yield any sure seats to the Congress. But at the same time, she would like to retain the alliance. Now it is for the Congress to decide, he added.        
	The issue of seat-sharing may figure at tomorrows meeting. Mamata wants to discuss how to drive a hard bargain with the Congress over north Bengal seats during negotiations, a source said. Mamata is looking to increase her tally in the region, which accounts for 54 Assembly seats.

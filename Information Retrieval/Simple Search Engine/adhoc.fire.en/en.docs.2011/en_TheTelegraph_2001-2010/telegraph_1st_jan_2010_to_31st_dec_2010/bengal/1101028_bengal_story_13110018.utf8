	Oct. 27: Intermittent clashes between Trinamul Congress supporters and CPM cadres rocked Burdwan town and its neighbourhood for the second consecutive day today.        
	The activists of both parties hurled bombs at each other near the railway station and the Tinkunya bus terminus in Burdwan town, sparking panic among passengers, including women and children, and office-goers.         
	The bus service at the terminus, half a kilometre from the station, was suspended for two hours because of the five-hour clashes that began at 10am. Nearly 500 buses ferrying thousands of passengers arrive at and leave the terminus daily.         
	Several people did not dare step out of the railway station for hours after alighting from trains.        
	Todays fight was a continuation of yesterdays torch-and-attack duel between the two parties on the Burdwan University campus and its surroundings over alleged nepotism in the recruitment of Group D staff.        
	I had planned to reach my in-laws home before 2pm today. My train reached Burdwan at 11.45am but I stayed put at the station with my wife and daughter till 3pm as clashes were going on outside. I had tried to go near the rickshaw stand opposite the station, but rushed back when I saw some clashing activists. My wife Keberi is still very scared, said Debabrata Banerjee, 36, clutching his weeping seven-year-old daughter Rini.         
	Banerjee, a resident of Chinsurah, was visiting his in-laws home in Birhata, 5km from the station, with his family.        
	Tarashankar Ghosh, 42, an employee of the Burdwan collectorate, said he was caught in the clash while walking to his office from the station.         
	I took shelter under a shed by the roadside as the mob clashed with bombs. I stood there for about an hour after which RAF personnel arrived and drove the trouble-makers away. Then I walked to office. I had got off my train at 10.30am but reached office, 1km from the station, at 12pm. It normally takes 15 minutes, said Ghosh, a resident of Jaugram, 40km from Burdwan.        
	Subir Patra, 45, a Raina resident who supplies medicines to shops in Burdwan town, said he stumbled and fell down with two boxes of medicines when he tried to run out of the way of activists being chased by baton-wielding policemen outside Tinkunya bus terminus.         
	Local Trinamul leaders claimed CPM supporters set three party offices on fire at Baburbag, Shyamlal and Charkhamba today.         
	District police chief R. Rajshekharan said 50 people had been detained in connection with the violence.         
	Burdwan town wore a deserted look through the day as shops downed shutters.         
	A man, whom the police later described as mentally disturbed, stopped three buses from Katwa near the station and forced the passengers to get off, posing as an activist.

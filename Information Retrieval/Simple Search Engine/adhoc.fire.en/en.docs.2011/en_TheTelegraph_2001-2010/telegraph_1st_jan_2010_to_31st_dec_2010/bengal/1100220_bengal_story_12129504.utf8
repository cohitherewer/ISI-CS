The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM does a Rahul on rail
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM does a Rahul on rail
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A deserted Howrah Bridge on Friday morning as police had blocked its ends for the chief minister to sail through and not stumble along like a commoner. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Feb. 19: The poor mans train appears to have emerged the politicians chosen mode of transport this season.        
	After Rahul Gandhis decision to take a local train to travel through Mumbai during his recent visit, the chief minister today picked a train to reach Bolpur.        
	But unlike the younger Gandhi, who had hopped on to a packed second-class compartment and jostled with other commoners, Bhattacharjee sat quietly by himself in the air-conditioned chair car that had few passengers.        
	No hawkers and bauls, a common feature on a train to Bolpur, were allowed into the compartment.         
	A CPM leader said: The chief minister was away in north Bengal for three days last week. He returned from Siliguri and complained of uneasiness. On the day of the Maoist attack on the Shilda EFR camp, he could not go to Writers because of high fever. For two consecutive days, he was unwell. So he wanted to avoid the strain of a road journey.        
	Having travelled to Bolpur in railway minister Mamata Banerjees train, he told a rally in Illambazar: The menace called Maoist has entered holding the hand of the Trinamul Congress. It is Trinamul which is showing the way to the Maoists. They are coming from Jharkhand where the administration is weak. Where Trinamul fails to enter, it sends the Maoists.        
	Bhattacharjee told the rally that though Maoists claimed that they were working for the poor, in reality they were killing poor people as well as the police. The Maoists talk about poor people but at the same time they are killing the poor and the police. We will not let Maoists rear their heads in Bengal. We are trying our best to check their activities.         
	However, a Writers Buildings official confirmed that the chief minister had liked Rahul Gandhis move to take a local train to mingle with the people.         
	He admitted, though, that he did not know whether that has got anything to do with Buddhababus train trip today.        
	The chief minister has a fancy for train travel, the official said. Buddhababu loves to travel by train. Moreover, he loves to go to Santiniketan by train.        
	According to a source in the chief ministers secretariat, Bhattacharjee didnt want to undertake a long journey by road as the programme at Bolpur was at 4pm today and that would have meant leaving Calcutta a little after noon.        
	Whats the use leaving Calcutta at 12.30 and reaching Bolpur at 3.30pm? Thats why he went by train that took him only two hours to reach Santiniketan. There he had lunch and took rest for a while before addressing the party rally, the source added.

	Purulia, Jan. 31: Ten policemen, including an additional superintendent and a deputy superintendent, were injured when a group of tribals shot arrows and hurled stones at them in Purulias Bandwan.         
	The police claimed that at least two Maoists, who had opened fire from a jungle to scuttle a raid, were killed in retaliatory firing. But no bodies were found. Additional superintendent C. Sudhakar, who was hit by an arrow in his ankle, said: We fired 50-60 rounds at the Maoists and their tribal supporters.

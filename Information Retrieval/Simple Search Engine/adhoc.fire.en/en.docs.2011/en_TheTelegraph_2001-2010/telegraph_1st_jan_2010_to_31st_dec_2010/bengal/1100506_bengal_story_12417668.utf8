The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM folds up office in Haldia hub
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM folds up office in Haldia hub
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, May 5: The CPM today shut down its zonal committee office in Haldias main industrial area citing the fear of Trinamul attacks.        
	Trinamul activists have ransacked the office thrice in the past year.        
	The office at Durgachak, where some of the towns landmark units like Mitsubishi, Haldia Petrochemicals, Tata Chemicals, Hindustan Unilever and Exide are located, will be merged with another zonal office that the party has in a residential part of the town.        
	We had been forced to keep the zonal committee office at Durgachak closed for months because of attacks by Trinamul Congress activists. On more than one occasion in the past year, this office has been ransacked and its furniture set on fire. Our leaders were scared and couldnt attend office. So, we decided to merge the two zonal committees and function from the office at Khudiramnagar, said Kanu Sahu, the CPMs East Midnapore secretary.        
	In the big industries of Durgachak, where CPM labour arm Citus writ had run for years, Trinamul rules now. It controls the union in all the units except Haldia Petro, where the rivals are neck and neck.        
	The slide in the CPMs fortunes had started with Mamata Banerjees stunning success in last years Lok Sabha elections, when her party snatched both seats from the district. One of those defeated was the CPMs Haldia strongman Lakshman Seth, the leader of the partys labour arm who used to have the last word in all industrial disputes.         
	Across the Haldi river, in Nandigram and Khejuri, the CPM had earlier been forced to wind up two of its zonal offices. The one in Nandigram town was merged with the zonal office at Reyapara in Nandigram block II in August. The Khejuri office is now operating from Khudiramnagar in Haldia.        
	After the poll debacle, we started losing ground in parts of the industrial belt. Many of our members crossed over to the Trinamul union and our zonal committee at Durgachak became weak. Moreover, our leaders were shaken after Trinamul activists attacked the office thrice between July and December, said a district CPM leader.        
	Realising that its control over Haldia industries was slipping, Citu had dished out an old medicine called militant trade unionism, enforcing strikes in Haldia Petro and the Tata unit. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had to intervene to end the Haldia Petro strike and Trinamul activists foiled the one at Tata.        
	Driven from the Tata gates in March, Citu supporters had responded with bombs.

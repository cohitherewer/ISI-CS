The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Stolen coal cart crushes boy
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Stolen coal cart crushes boy

	Durgapur, April 28: A bullock cart laden with smuggled coal crushed to death a boy cycling home from school in Asansols Jamuria, triggering a road rage in which tonnes of coal and a police jeep were torched this morning.        
	Stones hurled by villagers left three policemen injured and at least seven protesters were hurt when the cops retaliated with their batons.        
	Illegal mining is rampant in the area and serpentine bullock cart convoys carrying smuggled coal ply through village roads all day after racketeers pay police for looking the other way.         
	The Telegraph had carried a series of articles exposing the rampant looting of coal in this belt. The villagers outburst today was fuelled by the ire against the police for their inaction on the racketeers.        
	Eleven-year-old Mohammad Ershad Rejjak was trying to overtake a convoy of five bullock carts around 11.30am when one of them changed direction and dashed against his cycle. He fell in front of the wheels and was crushed to death instantly by the massive weight of the cart, said Asgar Ali, a resident of Pariharpur who was resting under a tree when the mishap took place. A coal-laden bullock cart weighs up to 1.5 tonnes.         
	As the word spread, people came rushing. The cart drivers fled. The villagers unhitched the animals, toppled the carts and set them afire. Some of them also looted the coal.         
	As the police reached, the mob hurled bricks and coal at them. Outnumbered, the cops ran away, leaving the jeep behind. The villagers overturned the jeep and set it on fire.         
	We are scared to leave our children on roads as the coal-laden carts ply round the clock. Instead of stopping the menace, the police collect bribes from the coal racketeers, said Sheikh Bablu, a day labourer.         
	About 60 lakh tonnes of coal are allegedly mined illegally from the area every year. They feed hundreds of sponge iron and steel mills in Bengal and neighbouring Jharkhand.        
	Riaz Ansari, a day labourer, said Ershad was his only son. I was working in the field when I heard shouts from nearby. I rushed there and saw a crowd surrounding a group of bullock carts. I took a closer look and saw my son lying dead, said the sobbing father.         
	A large force led by Jamuria officer-in-charge Saikat Roy resorted to the lathicharge and allegedly fired in the air to disperse the mob. The police denied the firing and also the charge of supporting the illegal mining.

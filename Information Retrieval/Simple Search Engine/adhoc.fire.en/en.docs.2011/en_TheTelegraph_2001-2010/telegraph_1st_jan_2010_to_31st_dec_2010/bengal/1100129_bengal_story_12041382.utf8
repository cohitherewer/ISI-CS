The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | French firm caught in Haldia port tangle
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      French firm caught in Haldia port tangle
          SAMBIT SAHA AMP; AMIT CHAKRABORTY                          The Haldia port                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 28: A French shipping and logistics company involved in a port upgrade project in Haldia has been unable to start work for the last nine months, caught in a tussle between rival contractors after its own plans to hire workers backfired.        
	Louis Dreyfus Armateurs (LDA) of France and its Indian partner, Mumbai-based ABG Group, won a tender last April to upgrade cargo handling facilities in berth 2 and 8 of Haldia port. But after nine months without getting work done, the consortium could lose its contract with the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT).        
	LDA first decided to hire around 250 workers from outside the port managed by the CPT. But subsequently, the LDA-ABG consortium changed its mind and decided to pick a contractor through a tender.        
	A Citu-backed contractor bid the lowest for providing workers to the consortium while a Trinamul Congress-backed contractor came a close second. Each group wanted its own workers to be employed for cargo handling on both the berths.        
	The consortium tried to work out a truce by telling Citu and Trinamul that the contractors would get a berth each. The Citu contractor was not happy with the proposal as he had won the tender. The Trinamul contractor was ready to match his rivals rate but wanted both the berths in that case.        
	Two political parties are at war and the consortium is caught in the middle, a source in LDA said.        
	Having failed to get a contractor and with its cranes and dumpers lying idle since October-end, the consortium then tried to hire workers on its own  this time from within the port area as some hands were to be removed from the facility after the upgrade.        
	But the first lot of workers from outside the port who had been promised work, the rival CPM and Trinamul unions as well as the two contractors started creating roadblocks.         
	The workers from outside have not allowed the dumpers to be taken to the berths. Alleged union members also roughed up some LDA-ABG officials on several occasions.        
	Haldia has been a turf battle zone since the Lok Sabha elections when the CPMs strongman in the area, Lakshman Seth, lost to Trinamuls Subhendu Adhikari. The political change was followed by flare-ups between the rival unions at various plants in Haldia  Haldia Petrochemicals, Mitsubishi and Exide.         
	LDA is working with ABG in Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Mangalore ports but has not faced such a problem in the past.        
	ABG and LDA have invested close to Rs 150 crore to put up mobile harbour cranes on both berths. It needs about 350 people to unload cargo and transfer them to the stockyard. The consortium has to pay Rs 50,000 to the CPT as damages for each day of non-operation.        
	According to rules, the consortium was to start operations within six months after getting approval from the port. But the October deadline has passed. Under the contract, it was allowed another three months to start work. That period got over yesterday.        
	The port trust can cancel its contract with the consortium if it wants to. The French have pleaded for more time.

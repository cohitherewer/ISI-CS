The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Once manned by Mahi, now manacled in stasis
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Once manned by Mahi, now manacled in stasis
										      RAJARSHI GON      OURTOWNS -KHARAGPUR                        On the worlds longest platform, the wait for the train of development has been getting longer by the day. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya				                                 
	If Mahendra Singh Dhoni gets off a train at Kharagpur today and wants to wander around, he would need no directions.        
	The subdivisional town that is home to a celebrated engineering college which thrives on innovation is trapped in a time warp. It hasnt changed in the seven years since the Team India skipper left his job of manning the gate at the longest platform in the world, as a signboard at the railway station proudly proclaims.        
	Dhoni wouldnt know but on the longest platform, the wait for the train of development has been far longer, residents say.        
	As Mahi steps out of the station, once a jewel in the railways crown before South Eastern Railway was carved up into sections, he will see that public transport is stranded where it was in 2003.        
	The choices are still the same: cycle rickshaws, autos and taxis. Dont want to pay the auto driver Rs 80 for 5km, or the cabbie Rs 100? Hop onto one of the trekkers or giant share autos that ply select routes, but be prepared to join a dozen others in travelling like bats clinging to trees.                  
	For a trip outside town, theres always the bus terminus that doubles as a garbage dump  hardly surprising in a town only 30 per cent of which has a sewerage.        
	Thousands use the bus stand every day since Kharagpur is the nearest railhead from many far-flung places in West Midnapore. But when The Telegraph visited the terminus, there were as many cows and dogs as commuters roaming around or resting on the vast ground littered with rubbish.        
	Yet this is no hick town  it wasnt one even a century ago.        
	Dhoni may be too young to know it but Kharagpur was a symbol of progress when it sprouted out of a forested land, clustering around its newly built railway station in 1898. The railway workshop, set up around 1900, brought in people from everywhere and gave the town its vaunted cosmopolitanism.        
	Half a century later, Indias first IIT pinned a badge of prestige on Kharagpur.        
	In my childhood days, the bungalows in the railway colony were so spick and span, the area looked like a piece of Britain. Kharagpur was unique then but now its another mofussil town, rued IIT alumnus Aniruddha Roy, 62, who had grown up here as a schoolboy.        
	If Mahi visits the railway colony, he will only see rundown old houses surrounded by tall weeds.        
	But the Hijli Co-operative Development Society, the IITs next-door neighbour, will offer a pretty sight: planned, neat rows of houses. Theres one catch, though: the 189-acre settlement of over 5,000 people lacks a single drain or sewer.        
	If you consider the whole town, the majority of the few drains it has are kutcha and uncovered, causing pollution and other health hazards, said Society secretary P.S. Das, a professor at Vinod Gupta School of Management at the IIT.        
	So, where should Dhoni go? Maybe he can expect some quality time outdoors?        
	There are no decent cinemas here, and the eating-out options are too few for a town of 3 lakh, sighed homemaker Sutapa Ghosh.        
	We dont even have a good park where boys and girls can meet or families enjoy an evening out. Its a pity for a town that prides itself on its cosmopolitan culture, said Shyamapada Bhowmik, a retired history professor.        
	The towns once vibrant sports culture, which had made Dhoni a local star long before India knew him, is dying. Especially football.        
	In the past, we got to see the magic of Maidan greats like P.K. Banerjee, Badru Banerjee and Mewalal at the railway stadium, recalled Roy.        
	Seldom are IFA Shield or league matches held here nowadays. The local boys enthusiasm too has ebbed, said Debjit Banerjee, once a popular district cricketer. But cricket has somehow managed to stay alive, thanks to the current craze.        
	And perhaps thanks to the towns links with the Team India captain, to some extent.        
	The only good news seems to be that the IIT has just started preparing a development blueprint for the town on behalf of the Midnapore-Kharagpur Development Authority.        
	So will Dhoni, enrolled as a student in Ranchi, want to drop in at the tech institute? He needs to go with a lot of time in hand, not necessarily because of the fans he is sure to have there but because of the trains.        
	The railway network, still an asset to the town, is also a bane for the IIT campus and adjacent localities like Prembazar, Mayapur and Talbagicha. The narrow road to the station has two level crossings, at each of which one can get stuck for up to an hour.        
	Its a 15-minute drive from my home in Kausalya to the IIT but I leave home an hour early to make sure Im not late for my class, said Pabitra Mitra, assistant professor of computer science and engineering.        
	Work on a flyover has just begun after the thousands of IIT side residents clamoured for one for decades. We badly need the flyover because the two town hospitals that are capable of treating serious illnesses are on the other side of the tracks, a Mayapur resident said.        
	The two waves of development, ushered in by the railways and the IIT, have lost momentum with time. Kharagpur, whose municipality has been in Congress hands for the past 15 years, is waiting for a third.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 20: The state cabinet today cleared a slew of sops for the governments nearly two lakh casual employees in various departments, municipalities and Madhyamik and Sishu Siksha Kendras who have worked for 10 years or more.        
	They will be retained at least till the age of 60, offered increments every three years after a basic salary is fixed and given a gratuity of Rs 1.5 lakh on retirement, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said after the meeting.        
	Todays decision is a step towards fulfilling the commitment I had made in my budget. Although we are unable to make them permanent, they will now a feel a sense of security while working for a longer period, he added.        
	Nearly 10,000 temporary employees in various government departments, over 1.5 lakh para-teachers and aca- demic supervisors and over 6,400 municipal staff stand to benefit from the move, seen by the Trinamul Congress as a lollipop before next months polls to 81 civic bodies, including Calcutta Municipal Corporation.         
	The para-teachers will be allowed to work till the age of 62, Dasgupta said.        
	Soumya Biswas, a leader of the State Government Trinamul Employees Federation, said Dasgupta had timed the announcements keeping the polls in mind.        
	Asked about the charge, Dasgupta said: The government has to go by what I said in my budget speech, whether there are elections or not.        
	The cabinet also okayed recruitment for 623 vacant posts in various departments. Over 300 of the vacancies are in the backward classes welfare department.

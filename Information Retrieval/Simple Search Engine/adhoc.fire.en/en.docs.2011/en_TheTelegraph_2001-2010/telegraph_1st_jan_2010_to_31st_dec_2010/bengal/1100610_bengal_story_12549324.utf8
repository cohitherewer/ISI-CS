The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rout blame on govt
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rout blame on govt
  - Allies allege lack of concern about schemes for poor at Left Front meeting        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, June 9: At the Left Fronts first meeting since its latest poll debacle, the CPMs partners today criticised the government for not finalising the below-poverty-line list, not streamlining the ration system and not speeding up the distribution of Scheduled Caste/Tribe certificates.         
	They alleged that these factors had driven the poor away from the Left and contributed to the miserable poll results.        
	Faced with the flak, sources said, front chairman Biman Bose pleaded with the partners to defer the discussion till the CPM had analysed the results at its state committee meeting on June 26.         
	The CPM wants to discuss the results first. The issue can be taken up at our next meeting, after the CPM has finished its discussions, Bose was quoted as saying.        
	Todays meeting at Alimuddin Street did not have a spelt-out agenda but it was widely believed that the results would be taken up, exactly a week after the Lefts civic poll drubbing. But the CPM may not have expected the government to become the target.        
	A front leader said the RSP was the first to blame the government. They said the incomplete BPL list was creating problems. Similarly, work to identify the bottom 10 per cent of the above-poverty-line list is pending.         
	Some front constituents also pointed out that the pub- lic distribution system was not working properly and the SC/ST certificates were not being distributed. They criticised the government for its administrative lapses and cited these as the reason for the Lefts poor showing in the municipal elections.        
	Yesterday, Samajwadi Party leader and state fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda had said the front had lost the mandate: The front should prepare to sit in the Opposition. We have lost the confidence of the people who are now giving oxygen to the Opposition. The workers and the peasantry have deserted us.        
	 A few days ago, Forward Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh had said the Election Commission could hold early Assembly polls given the political clashes that have been occurring across the state since the municipal polls.        
	Bose today requested the partners not to discuss their grievances or misgivings in public as the media try to extract mileage from it.         
	He told them to raise the issues at front meetings, the appropriate place to do so.        
	After the meeting, Bose told journalists: We have asked the front partners to analyse the civic poll results and submit reports. We will then discuss the civic elections at a front meeting next month. If necessary, an emergency meeting of the front can be convened in June itself.        
	When his government was being slammed, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was at Alimuddin Street but not at the meeting. A CPM leader said the agenda did not warrant his presence.        
	After Bose promised the allies another date to discuss the civic polls, they deliberated on the strategy to be adopted on the civil nuclear liability bill and the Bhopal verdict.        
	The front chief said he did not ask for an explanation from the Bloc leader or the fisheries minister for their remarks. Ill think about that later, he said. Nor did the meeting discuss the possibility of early Assembly polls, he added.        
	Sources said some of the partners expressed fears about the Lefts Assembly poll prospects. Ghosh said it would serve the front better to prepare for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to stage a comeback, a source said.

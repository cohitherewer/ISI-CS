          ALAMGIR HOSSAIN                          The border fencing that divides Fulbari village of Nadia. Telegraph picture                                  
	Fulbari (Nadia), Aug. 8: Riven by the border barbed wire, two Nadia villages have found a new lease of life.        
	Around 100 families living in Fulbari and Gandina are allowing Bangladeshi farmers to cultivate their land because the plots fall on the wrong side of the fence. When the border fencing was erected eight years ago, the homes and agricultural fields of these families fell on either side of the barbed wire.        
	The 100 families, who own about 270 acres of land on the wrong side of the fence, have either unofficially leased out their land to farmers in Bangladeshs Kazipur village or are letting them cultivate their plots on a 50-50 crop-share agreement.         
	After the fence came up, we had to return home after working in our fields, which fell on the other side of the wire, by 5 pm. The cultivated land had to be left unguarded and crops used to be frequently stolen by Bangladeshis at night, said Sanu Sheikh, 50, of Gandina. He has struck a deal with Ajmat Sheikh of Kazipur under which the latter cultivates his land and hands over half of the produce to him.        
	The residents of Gandina and Fulbari said the BSF did not allow them to take their cattle and fertilisers to the other side without permission from the local gram panchayat and the BSF office at Shikarpur, 3km away.        
	Mahananda Roy, 60, of Fulbari, who owns three acres on the other side of the fence, has allowed his land to be cultivated by Sanatan Sheikh, Badal Sheikh and Kabul Sheikh of Kazipur.        
	Whatever crops they cultivate, I get 50 per cent of it. I know it is illegal to give away land which falls in Indian territory for farming to Bangladeshis but this system is convenient for me. We have a verbal agreement and they never fail to give me my share of the crop, Mahananda said.        
	The villagers said it was better to compromise with Bangladeshi farmers than to be harassed by the BSF. The force, however, said strict rules were in place to stop the smuggling of cattle and fertilisers.         
	Fifteen of the 100 families have, however, decided against taking the trouble of a 50-50 crop-share agreement. They have, instead, leased out their land to Bangladeshi farmers against a one-time payment.        
	Rekab Sheikh, 35, leased his half-acre plot two years ago to Sahabuddin Sheikh of Kazipur for Rs 40,000.        
	Rekab Sheikh said the resale value of the portion of his land that fell on the wrong side of the fence was very low.        
	If an acre of land is sold for Rs 3 lakh on the Indian side of the fence, it will not fetch more than Rs 50,000 or Rs 60,000 if it is located on the other side. When I was looking for a buyer for my plot, I did not get offers of more than Rs 30,000 but when I contacted the Bangladeshi farmers, one of them offered me Rs 40,000, he said.        
	BSF officers at Fulbari border outpost said it was difficult to distinguish between Indian and Bangladeshi farmers. We will step up vigil, an officer said.

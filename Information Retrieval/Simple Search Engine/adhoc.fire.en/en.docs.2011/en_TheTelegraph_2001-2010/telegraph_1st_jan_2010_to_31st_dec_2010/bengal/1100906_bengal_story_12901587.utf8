The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM rein-in signal on cadres
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM rein-in signal on cadres
          BARUN GHOSH                      Gautam Deb                          
	Calcutta, Sept. 5: The CPM today said it would discuss this week ways to rein in recalcitrant cadres, a day after admitting its activists were involved in Fridays attack on journalists in a Lalgarh zone recaptured from Maoists.        
	The matter will come up at the partys state secretariat meeting on September 10, housing minister Gautam Deb said.         
	There is no denying that our party mens involvement in the attack showed us in poor light across the country. Against this backdrop, we will have to discuss ways on how to control our recalcitrant cadres at Fridays secretariat meeting. We will have to send a strong message to cadres asking them not to misbehave with media persons, regardless of their critical appraisal of our activities, said Deb, also a member of the secretariat, the CPMs highest decision-making body at the state level.        
	Yesterday, secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty had admitted that those arrested over the assault were our activists.        
	Deb pointed out that the party leadership had condemned the attack but he accepted it was not enough. Mere condemnation will not do. We will have to work out something to ensure such things do not recur.        
	Three CPM activists have been arrested while a hunt is on for two others, members of the partys Pirakata unit, named in the FIR. Asked if the duo on the run would surrender, Deb parried the question but appeared to keep the possibility open by saying district leaders were entitled to take a decision on this score.         
	A CPM source said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had taken a serious view of the incident and had asked police to deal firmly with the culprits. Bhattacharjee had claimed he had no knowledge of the attack when asked about it three hours after the beatings.         
	But another secretariat member claimed today that Bhattacharjee had sought an update soon after he got the word. Buddhada also took an update from Dipak Dasgupta, the secretariat member who looks after the organisation in West Midnapore, and district unit secretary Dipak Sarkar immediately after the incident. Both Dasgupta and Sarkar refused to speak when contacted.         
	Debs cabinet colleague Abdur Rezzak Mollah conceded the attack would hamper the partys efforts to claw back after successive poll debacles. The incident will give the Opposition a chance to isolate us further from the masses who have voted against us since the 2008 rural polls, Mollah said.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 8: Calcutta High Court today transferred the Jnaneswari Express sabotage case from a Jhargram court to another in Midnapore town, accepting the CBIs plea for a shift on security grounds.         
	The case was shifted from the Jhargram additional chief judicial magistrates court to the chief judicial magistrates (CJMs) court in Mindapore town. The investigating agency had pleaded with the court for the case to be transferred to a Calcutta court.        
	Justice Asim Roy said: The CBI has failed to justify its need to shift the venue of the case. However, this court believes that the law and order situation in West Mindapore is grave and it is a hard job for police to bring the accused to the Jhargram court from Midnapore jail, which is far away. So the venue of the case is being transferred to the CJMs court in Midnapore town.        
	The judge said that as the distance between Midnapore jail and the CJMs court was only 3 to 4km, the police should not face any trouble in producing the accused persons there.         
	Todays court order can be termed a partial victory for the CBI, said Rabi Shankar Chatterjee, a Calcutta High Court advocate.        
	The CBI had requested that the hearing be held through video-conferencing. However, Justice Roy said such facilities were not available in West Midnapore courts.

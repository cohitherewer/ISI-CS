	Tamluk, Oct. 27: Kanchan Mal, who was left with a paralysed right hand after suffering seven bullet injuries in the 2007 Nandigram firing, has been forced to beg to feed her family of five.         
	She and most of the other 161 Nandigram residents injured in the March 14 police firing rued the three-year delay in the compensation order, saying they could have opted for better treatment had the dole reached them earlier.         
	The Supreme Court today directed the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to those injured in the police firing, three years after the high court passed the same order. The state government had then appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking a stay on the order.        
	Kanchan, 47, who took four bullets in the abdomen and three in her right hand, said lack of money had forced her to discontinue treatment. I spent three months at SSKM Hospital in Calcutta but had to return because I could not bear the cost of treatment. My husband, who became a heart patient worrying about me, died two years ago without any treatment, she said.        
	My son Susanta is a day labourer and does not have a regular income. He has a wife and two children. So, I have been forced to beg on the streets in order to put food on the table, Kanchan, who had joined other villagers to form a human shield to stop the police from entering Nandigrams Gokulnagar, said.        
	For three years, we have been hearing that we will get compensation. Had I received the money earlier, I could have opted for better treatment. Maybe my husband would not have died worrying about me, she said.         
	Sonachura residents Rashbehari Khara and his wife Anubha, who were part of another human barricade, at Bhangabera, said their injuries still hurt but had no money for treatment.         
	Rashbehari, 48, who took a bullet in his abdomen, said: My wife, who took a bullet in her right leg, and I received treatment at SSKM for five months. I am yet to recover fully. I still have severe cramps in my stomach but what can I do? Doctors at SSKM have told me to go there for regular check-ups but I dont have the money to visit Calcutta so often.        
	Rashbehari, who has two schoolgoing sons, said he had borrowed Rs 2 lakh from relatives and mortgaged his one-bigha plot to the local cooperative bank for Rs 70,000 to pay for his and Anubhas treatment.        
	I am heavily in debt. The Rs 1 lakh compensation would not help me much now. The Supreme Court ruling is nothing more that a moral victory for us, said Rashbehari, a sharecropper.         
	Abhijit Giri, 25, a vegetable seller at Kalicharanpur, cant move his right hand, paralysed after taking a bullet during the firing at Bhangabera. My son spent 18 months at SSKM but still cant move his hand. He had an operation at a private hospital in Calcutta. I borrowed Rs 3 lakh from local people for his treatment. I dont think the late compensation will alleviate our suffering, said Pratap Giri, Abhijits father.        
	Haimabati Haldar, 58, who was also part of the human shield at Bhangabera, said she had undergone two surgeries to remove the bullet she took in her back. I am not as fit as I used to be. Maybe, I could have received better treatment had I got the compensation then. The state government should have given us the compensation on its own, not after being forced by the Supreme Court.

	Bolpur, Jan. 31: A CPM leader and two party supporters who had recently switched loyalties from the Trinamul Congress were killed last night in Labhpur, Birbhum.         
	The local CPM leadership said zonal committee member Fazlur Karim, 51, had become a target since persuading Thandu Sheikh, 41, and Jamal Sheikh, 36, to quit Trinamul.         
	Bombs were hurled at the former Trinamul duo at a tea stall. The attackers then ran towards Karims house, 200 metres away. He had stepped out to see what was happening and became an easy prey.        
	Birbhum district police chief Rabindranath Mukherjee said: We have got some clues and some names and are working on them.        
	Jamal and Thandu, both marginal farmers, had entered the tea stall at eight last night. Suddenly, a group of people arrived and started hurling bombs. People in the bazaar area started running in panic.        
	The district Trinamul leadership denied having anything to do with the murders.

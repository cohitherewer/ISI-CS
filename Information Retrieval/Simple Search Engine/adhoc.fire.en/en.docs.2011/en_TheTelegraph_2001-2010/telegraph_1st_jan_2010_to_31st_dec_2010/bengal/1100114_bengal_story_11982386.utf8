          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The cauliflower. (Ganesh Majumder)				                                 
	Burdwan, Jan. 13: A cauliflower, coiled like a snake and drawing hundreds of onlookers in a Burdwan village, proved fatal today when a truck winding its way through the crowd mowed down a woman.         
	Pushpa Biswas, 42, had taken a bus from Saradanagar in Hooghly, about 3km away, to see what the Kalna residents had dubbed a miracle.        
	We tried to make way for the truck, which was moving slowly and honking. But when it reached a clearing, it picked up speed. The woman tried to move away but couldnt, said Niparani Som, one of the 150-odd people from Pushpas village going to see the flower.        
	The accident occurred on the state highway that connects Katwa in Burdwan with Triveni in Hooghly.        
	Dulal Chandra Ghosh, 65, who has grown the cauliflower at Bandebaj village, said it left him stunned like everyone else. I have cultivated cauliflowers on one bigha. All the others are normal, but this one stands nearly one-and-a-half feet from the ground, he said.         
	A reason behind this kind of abnormal growth in a plant is over-secretion of the growth hormone. However, we have to analyse the cauliflower to find out if there are other reasons as well, said Nandadulal Paria of Calcutta University.        
	Women have started offering puja. People are throwing money at the cauliflower as they do in a temple. They are singing kirtans and advising me to set up a temple, said Dulal.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Sleuths scoff at claim on Kishanji
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 21: Intelligence officers in West Midnapore today refuted polices claim yesterday that they missed catching Maoist leader Kishanji by a whisker.        
	According to the sleuths, a three-tier security ring of 50 Maoists guards Kishanji. They are armed with 9mm pistols, Insas and AK-47 rifles. They generally alert Kishanji on what is happening within a 2km radius from his hiding spot. They are heavily armed and never drop their guard. At the slightest hint of danger, they move several kilometres with Kishanji, one officer said.        
	When security forces come closer, Kishanji, with his three-tier circle, moves seven to 10km away, he added.         
	Outside the ring, there are around 300 armed men constantly co-ordinating with Kishanjis guards. There are men hidden near the camps of the forces who monitor their every move, the officer said.        
	The police yesterday also seized a laptop and a hearing aid, both of which they claimed were Kishanjis. Today, they said they were not fully sure if the laptop was the only one used by Kishanji.        
	State chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the device was being examined.        
	When told that West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma had claimed that the laptop belonged to the Maoist leader, he said: Maybe, Verma has additional information in this regard. But I dont know.        
	The police have not cracked the password of the laptop. It is locked with voice password. It seems, that the experts of the forensic laboratory will face difficulty in decoding the password, said an officer.        
	Inspector general of police (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha said in Calcutta today that the recovery of a shirt and the hearing aid had made the police think that Kishanji may have been using the laptop. We have got hold of documents, a hearing aid and a blue shirt of Kishanji. Thats why we think he was there. We will consult cyber experts and the forensic laboratory.

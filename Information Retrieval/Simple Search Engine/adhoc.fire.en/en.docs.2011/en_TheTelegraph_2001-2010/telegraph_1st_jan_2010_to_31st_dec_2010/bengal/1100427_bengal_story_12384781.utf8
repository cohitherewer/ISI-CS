	Behrampore, April 26: Three villagers were killed in Murshidabad when they were struck by lightning during a thunderstorm this evening.         
	Police said Robiul Sheikh, 37, Jalaluddin Sheikh, 43, and Shahjahan Sheikh, 33, had gone to a cemetery to bury a 12-year-old boy of their village who had died of illness. As the storm started, those who had accompanied the body ran helter-skelter for shade. The trio were huddled under an umbrella when the lightning struck.

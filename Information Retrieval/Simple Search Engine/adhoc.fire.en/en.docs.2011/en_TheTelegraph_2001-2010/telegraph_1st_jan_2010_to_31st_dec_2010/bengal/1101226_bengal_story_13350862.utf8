          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 25: The Agarhati Sri Ramakrishna Ma Sarada Sebashram has set up a 20-bed hospital in the Sunderbans with some Calcutta doctors, businessmen and professionals.        
	The hospital at Agarhati in Sandeskhali will start functioning in three months.        
	The Rangathananda Grameen Swastha Kendra will provide treatment at a highly subsidised rate, authorities said yesterday during the inauguration of the hospital building.        
	Some formal clearances are required, which we hope to get within a couple of months, said critical care expert Subrata Maitra, who is also the president of the Agarhati Sri Ramakrishna Ma Sarada Swastha Seba Parishad.        
	Maitra said cataract, hernia, ENT and other minor surgeries would be done in the hospital. We have nebulizers to treat asthma patients, he added.

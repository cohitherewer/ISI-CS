The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM offers a silent prayer
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM offers a silent prayer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Yechury    
	Calcutta, Sept. 15: The CPM today chose silence to counter Rahul Gandhi in an apparent bid to widen the differences between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress.         
	At a rally of the Students Federation of India (SFI) at Netaji Nagar in south Calcutta today, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury spoke for nearly 45 minutes on the simultaneous existence of a shining India and a suffering India but did not utter a word on Rahul.         
	Asked about the AICC general secretarys CPM bashing while on a trip to the state, Yechury said: I said all that I had to at the SFI rally.        
	A CPM state secretariat member said: Rahul and Mamata Banerjee have been using informal pressure tactics against each other ahead of the Assembly polls next year. The Trinamul Congress chief has said she isnt a seasonal cuckoo, hinting at Rahul. The Congress leader, on the other hand, is urging party activists and leaders not to sacrifice self-respect and saying an alliance with Trinamul should be based on dignity. All these are music to our ears.        
	He added: The more the divide between the two parties increases, the more we benefit. Targeting Rahul would bring him and his party closer to Trinamul.        
	Rahul has been criticising the CPM at closed-door party meetings and predicting a Left defeat in next years Assembly elections during his three-day trip to the state.

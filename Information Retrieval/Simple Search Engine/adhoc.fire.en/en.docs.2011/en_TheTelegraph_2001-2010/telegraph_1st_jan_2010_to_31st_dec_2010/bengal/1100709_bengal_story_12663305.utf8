The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul heckles Halim
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul heckles Halim
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 8: Over a dozen Trinamul Congress MLAs today gheraoed the Speaker in his Assembly chamber for half an hour after snatching his microphone in the House and launching a tirade against him for rejecting a privilege motion against the chief minister.         
	The MLAs, led by leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee, started the ruckus in the House after Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim rejected the privilege motion against Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, which Trinamul had demanded because the chief minister had misled the House over the murder of CPM leader Ananda Das.         
	Bhattacharjee had removed the Birbhum police chief following the murder of Das in Nanoor, saying the cop had failed to handle the situation. But the home secretary had said the SPs transfer was a routine affair.         
	However, Halim rejected the privilege motion, saying the House would give credence to what a member (the chief minister) had said in the House rather than what a bureaucrat had said outside.         
	Following the ruling, Trinamuls Bobby Hakim snatched the Speakers microphone and used it to announce that Halim was behaving in a partisan manner and destroying the parliamentary system. Other Trinamul MLAs joined in.         
	After Halim left the House, asking the CPMs Rabin Mondal to carry on the proceedings, the Trinamul MLAs followed him into his chamber. They barged into the room, ignoring the requests of the security personnel.         
	Speaker sir, you are acting at the behest of the Alimuddin Street. You rejected the motion to save the chief minister from an embarrassing situation. It appears that you are behaving as a leader of a gang of miscreants, Chatterjee told Halim.        
	Dont indulge in rowdyism. You will have to accept the Speakers ruling in the House, Halim shot back, prompting the Trinamul legislators to shout slogans.        
	Sir, you are disrespecting the Speakers chair because you are more a CPM MLA from Entally than an impartial guardian of this august House, a Trinamul MLA said.        
	The MLAs dispersed after half an hour.        
	Later, Halim told reporters the Trinamul legislators were belligerent in nature when they called on me in my Assembly chamber to protest the rejection of the privilege motion. The manner in which they laid siege to my chamber is unheard of.        
	The Speaker could not recount any instance of such rowdyism in the recent past.         
	At a news conference, Chatterjee accused the security personnel at the Speakers chamber of assaulting the MLAs staging a peaceful protest.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A police jeep set on fire by protesters in Shrikrishnapur on Thursday                                  
	Islampur, July 29: A guardian was killed and at least two others suffered bullet injuries after police fired at an Islampur schools teachers and students who had allegedly attacked the cops, locked them up and torched vehicles to protest their efforts to take possession of a land in front of the institute.         
	Trouble started after Ganesh Gayen, a clerk with the refugee rehabilitation department here, reached Srikrishnapur, 7km from Islampur in North Dinajpur, to take possession of the one-acre plot.         
	While Gayen claimed that the land was his and he had a possession order from the additional district magistrate, the authorities of Srikrishnapur High School said the plot had been in our possession for the past 50 years.        
	Gayen arrived at the school at 2pm with the block land reforms officer, five armed policemen and labourers carrying pillars.                   Jyotish Das, one of the guardians injured in the police firing            Protesters argue with the police at the Shrikrishnapur school after the firing. Pictures by Mehedi Hedaytullah      
	As soon as Gayen and the official started measuring the land, a group of teachers and students rushed out of the school and started protesting.         
	Soon, more teachers and students came out and, after a heated argument, the mob dragged land reforms officer Biswajit Banerjee and the policemen into the school and locked them up inside a room. They also beat up Gayen and set ablaze three police vehicles.         
	Eyewitnesses said the police suddenly started firing through a window of the room where they were locked up. Dipak Mirdha, 30, whose nephew studies at the school, died after taking a bullet. His body lay on the verandah for several hours and was taken away by the police only at 8pm. The protesters had said they would not let the body be taken away until the five policemen were booked for murder.        
	The protesters and local people also blocked the busy NH31  the school is located off the highway  and set fire to at least five buses. The Rapid Action Force had to be deployed.        
	The five cops and Banerjee were kept confined till 7.30pm. They were released after the police team that was rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control pleaded with the protesters that the six were injured and needed treatment.         
	They were taken to hospital. They claimed that the protesters had also pelted them with stones.        
	Additional superintendent of police P. Anappa said the cops fired after they were attacked by the mob and their vehicles were set ablaze. But we are not sure whether the person (Mirdha) died in the firing, Anappa said.        
	The five policemen have been suspended and Banerjee has been asked to go on leave, the district administration said.        
	Swapan Pal, the headmaster, claimed the land was the schools property. Gayen has misled the district administration into granting him possession of the land. We wanted to discuss the issue at a meeting with him but before that, he and his men attacked the school today, Pal said.         
	Pal said the police could have used tear gas to disperse the mob instead of opening fire on the campus.         
	Gayen, who is in hospital, claimed that he had sent several notices to the school but the authorities refused to part with the land. I was brutally attacked by the students, teachers and guardians today, he alleged.        
	The police said the two other guardians, Jyotish Das and Deepak Das, were in hospital with bullet injuries in their legs.         
	The SUCI has called a 12-hour bandh in Islampur tomorrow to protest the firing.

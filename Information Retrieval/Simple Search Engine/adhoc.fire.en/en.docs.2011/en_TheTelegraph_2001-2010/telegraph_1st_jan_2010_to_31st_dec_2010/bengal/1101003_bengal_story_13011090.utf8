	Durgapur, Oct. 2: The father of the Sector V techie who went missing yesterday on the way to his parents home in Durgapur said his son had called him last night to say he was fine and safe and asked him not to worry.         
	Srikumar Bhadra, father of Shouvik, 32, said: I received a call from my son on our landline number around 9 last night. He told me he was safe and asked me not to worry. But he sounded a bit nervous.         
	Shouvik, an employee of Nokia Siemens Networks, was going to his parents home in Durgapurs Bidhannagar on his motorbike last night. Srikumar said his son was scheduled to visit Sikkim on his bike with a colleague on Friday.         
	Srikumar said Shouvik had filed for divorce from his wife Payel, whom he had married in January 2004.

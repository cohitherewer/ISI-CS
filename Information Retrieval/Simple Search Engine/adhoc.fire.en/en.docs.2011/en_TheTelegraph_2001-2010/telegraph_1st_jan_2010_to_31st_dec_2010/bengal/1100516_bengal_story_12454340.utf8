          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Howrah, May 15: The three-year-old daughter of a Burrabazar hawker was allegedly kidnapped from her home in Howrah yesterday by a friend of her fathers, who lured her out with the promise of a chocolate.        
	Rakesh Singh, a one-time colleague of hawker Pappu Gupta, has demanded a ransom of Rs 4 lakh for the release of Aman. He is suspected to have fled to Bihar, his home state.        
	Last evening, Rakesh and an associate came to our house and took Aman out for a stroll. I did not object because we knew him well, Pappus wife Anju said at the couples home in Bally.        
	Rakesh had befriended Pappu a few years ago when they were colleagues at a garment shop in Burrabazar. Pappu later left the job and started his own business while Rakesh returned to Bihar.         
	Rakesh had arrived in Bally 15 days ago and had been staying at the home of brother-in-law Jayananda Singh, who has been detained by police. Pappu has told the police Rakesh had called him up and demanded Jayanandas release, besides the ransom.         
	Bally police have got in touch with their Bihar counterparts.

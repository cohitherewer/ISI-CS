The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | VC delay for Maoist fear
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      VC delay for Maoist fear
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sidho and Kanhu were two tribal brothers who masterminded the Santhal Hool, a tribal rebellion against the British in 1855. They mobilised 10,000 Santhals for the struggle against colonial oppression in Sahebganj (in what is now Jharkhand)                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 2: The process of appointing the vice-chancellor for the proposed Sidho-Kanhu-Birsa University has been delayed, apparently because most academics are unwilling to take up the top post in a varsity that will be set up in Maoist-hit Purulia and Bankura.        
	The search committee formed by the state government to shortlist three candidates for the post of vice-chancellor was to submit the names by Friday. However, the three-member search committee today wrote to the government, requesting it to extend the last date for submitting the list till September 15.         
	The proposed varsity will have a campus each in Bankura and Purulia. The process of scouting for land is on.        
	A source in the state higher education department said: Given the Maoist problem in Purulia and Bankura, there is uncertainty whether the people whose names have been suggested for the post of vice-chancellor so far would agree to take up the job.        
	The convener of the search committee, Suranjan Das, however, claimed the selection process was being delayed because the panel wanted to ensure transparency.        
	We have requested the government to extend the last date for submitting the list of candidates so that we can thoroughly examine the credentials of the nominees and select those who are most suitable, said Das, the vice-chancellor of Calcutta University.                  
	The other two members of the search panel are Subrata Pal, the vice-chancellor of Burdwan University, and Swapan Paramanik, the vice-chancellor of Vidyasagar University.         
	After several academics expressed unwillingness to take up the post, the search committee approached over 58 eminent persons, including the vice-chancellors of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University, Banaras Hindu University and other varsities in Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, requesting them to suggest names of candidates. They have so far suggested nearly 15 names to the committee, sources said.         
	After the committee shortlists the candidates, the names will be sent to the governor, who will select the vice-chancellor.

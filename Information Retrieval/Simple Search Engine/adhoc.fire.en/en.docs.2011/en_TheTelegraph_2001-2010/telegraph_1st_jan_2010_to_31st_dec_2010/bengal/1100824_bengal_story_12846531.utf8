          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Aug. 23: Eight people returning from a funeral drowned when their car rolled down a boat and fell into the Bhagirathi while crossing the river today.         
	The dead include five women and a five-year-old girl. Four people are missing.        
	The accident took place in Murshidabads Rejinagar when the driver of the Sumo carrying 16 people failed to stop the car after crossing the jetty and rolling onto on the boat.         
	We suspect that the cars brakes had failed. All occupants except the driver should have got off the car before it was driven onto the boat, said B.L. Meena, the district superintendent of police.        
	Two men and two women swam to safety. The driver also escaped, he added.        
	Police and local people fished out the bodies from the river. The Sumo has also been pulled out.        
	The victims belonged to farmer families and were residents of Gajnipur village in Hariharpara.         
	Meena said an inquiry would be conducted to check if there was any negligence on the part of those operating the boat.

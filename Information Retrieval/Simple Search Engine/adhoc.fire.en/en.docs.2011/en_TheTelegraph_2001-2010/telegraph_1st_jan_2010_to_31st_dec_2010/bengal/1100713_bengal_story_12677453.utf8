	Tamluk, July 12: Trinamul Congress activists today stopped a Youth Congress team heading for Khejuri three times on the road, damaged a car in the convoy and repeatedly shouted go back Congress.         
	The team of 35, lead by Usha Naidu, a general secretary of the Youth Congress, which is headed by Rahul Gandhi, had to return without organising a workers convention in East Midnapores Janka.         
	The seven-car convoy was stopped for the first time at Heria More, around 30km from the venue of the convention. A Trinamul group led by local leader Satya Bera told Naidu the Congress team was not welcome in Khejuri.         
	The CPM had unleashed a reign of terror in Khejuri and adjoining Nandigram during 2006-07. No Congress leader from Delhi had come at that time to inquire about our plight, Bera told Naidu.         
	However, the Trinamul agitators let the convoy go. The district magistrate sent a police jeep to escort the convoy after being informed about the incident by district Congress president Manik Bhowmik.        
	The Congress team was stopped again a kilometre away by a dozen Trinamul supporters armed with sticks. The convoy was held up for 15 minutes as the cops cleared the way.        
	When the convoy reached Kulata village, about 8km from Heria More, nearly 200 Trinamul supporters blocked the road. The agitators, armed with rods and sticks, told the Congress team they would not be allowed to proceed without the permission of Sisir Adhikari, the Trinamul MP from Contai.         
	The activists broke a glass window of Bhowmiks car. They also beat up a local Congress worker. The Congress team then turned back and went to a police outpost at Heria and demonstrated in front of it.        
	Trinamul, which now has a stranglehold on Nandigram and Khejuri, is apparently unwilling to allow any other party to build a support base there. Trinamul is the only party in Khejuri and Nandigram and we want to keep it that way, a Trinamul leader said.

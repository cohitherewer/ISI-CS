          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Islampur, Dec. 12: A labourer has alleged in court that his panchayat pradhan had opened a bank account in his name without informing him and drawn a loan for which he had never applied, the charge exposing how rural scheme beneficiaries are swindled by local leaders.         
	Additional chief judicial magistrate Manoj Rai asked the Islampur subdivisional officer yesterday to probe the complaint filed by Mohammad Baisago, who holds a BPL card and had gone to the Congress panchayat pradhan, Hemlal Hembram, for benefits under the Indira Awas Yojana.         
	Hembram, the chief of Pokhria gram panchayat in North Dinajpurs Goalpokhar, had asked for Baisagos voter ID card and two photographs. Hembram, it seems, used the photographs and the voter card to open the account in the State Bank of Indias Panjipara branch, whose manager then was Saikat Kumar.        
	Baisago also said a Rs 30,000 agricultural loan was deposited in the account. Only when he got a notice from the bank on June 26 this year, asking him why he was not repaying the loan after withdrawing Rs 25,000, did Baisago realise that he had a bank account.        
	The bank manager refused to listen to me. A bank employee told me that the account had my photograph and that the loan had been approved on the recommendation of the pradhan, Baisago said in his complaint.        
	When Baisago confronted Hembram, he admitted to opening the account and told him that the bank manager, too, had taken some of the money.         
	The additional chief judicial magistrate Rai ordered the sub-divisional officer to probe the matter after the police showed laxness in the case.        
	When contacted, Kumar, now posted in Malda, said: I have been falsely implicated.        
	Hembram said: False charges were levelled against me. There is a political conspiracy behind all this.

	Midnapore, July 25: The backlash against Maoist disruption of everyday life appeared to spread in West Midnapore today but it also put police on notice for their refusal or inability to protect villagers.        
	Villagers in Nishchinta had last night chased away armed Maoists who had tried to force them to attend a meeting and caught one of them. But today, they forced the police to release him after the cops said they would not be able to open a security camp there immediately.        
	The village is 25km from Radhanagar, where villagers had chased away Maoists on July 22 and around 8,000 people rallied against the rebels the next day.        
	Baren Patra (name changed), a resident of Nishchinta, said that last night around 9, a group of 14 armed Maoists had come to the village on motorcycles and asked the villagers to take part in a meeting in neighbouring Naharia immediately.         
	We told them that we would not attend any programme at night. When we asked them to hold rallies during the day, they started beating me and some others with a stick, Patra said.         
	Soon, around 300 villagers gathered and started protesting. We chased away the Maoists and Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities activists, Patra said.        
	The rebels scampered to their motorcycles and sped off, leaving behind Sushil Mahato, who was caught by the villagers.         
	Sushil, 34, was trussed up and kept in the veranda of a local school through the night.        
	The villagers guarded Nishchinta at night to stave off a possible retaliation by the Maoists.        
	After the police reached the village this morning to take Sushil away, the villagers demanded that a security camp be set up in the area. When the police said it was not possible to set up a camp immediately, the villagers snatched Sushil from them and released him.         
	It is not possible to set up a police camp at a moments notice. We first have to organise the necessary infrastructure. Moreover, there is a high court order against setting up police camps in schools. We had told the villagers we would step up patrolling but they kept insisting on the police camp. Then they snatched the man (Sushil) and freed him. We did not want to apply force on the villagers because they have done a good job by chasing away the Maoists, said Praveen Tripathi, the superintendent of Jhargram police district.        
	A farmer, Sridhar Mahato (name changed), said he could not afford to dance to the tune of the Maoists.        
	The rains have started and transplantation of the aman crop has begun. I cant afford to waste a single minute by taking part in these stupid processions and meetings. Our day-to-day work is being seriously affected, Sridhar, who owns a two-acre plot, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh out of bounds, says state
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Lalgarh out of bounds, says state

	Calcutta, April 5: The state government asserted that it would not allow political teams in Lalgarh a day after the Union home minister stood in the battle zone and declared that leaders must visit Lal-garh, must go to the villagers, must speak to the people.         
	Writers Buildings cited security concerns while rejecting P. Chidambarams prescription. If everyone wants to vi-sit every place every time, we cannot allow that. The safety of those visiting the troubled areas is the states concern, state home secretary Ardhendu Sen said.         
	The Maoists are not confined to the jungles but are coming to the villages, too. The security angle has to be considered before clearing such visits.        
	Opposition leaders expressed disappointment at the governments response. Wed like to go to Lalgarh as we have a role to play in bringing normality there, said the Trinamul Congresss Mukul Roy.         
	Prohibitory orders are in force in the area.         
	When Trinamul leaders went to Lalgarh earlier, they held public meetings along with leaders of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.         
	The party now alleges that CPM cadres are taking control of the area making use of the political vacuum.        
	Roy today accused the state government of not responding to Trinamul appeals for a political initiative in Lalgarh.        
	The Congresss Pradip Bhattacharya went a step further and said: Since the administration is unable to do much for the poor people of Lalgarh, it should ensure protection to political leaders so that they can talk to the people there.        
	Sen sought to underplay Chidambarams critical remarks on law and order in Bengal and said he had explained to the Union minister in detail how the government was going about restoring normality in the violence-hit areas.        
	The Union home minister did not complain that the law-and-order condition was not satisfactory, Sen said. Why would he complain? Law and order in the state is more or less stable and normal.        
	Chidambaram had yesterday said he was unhappy with what happened in Mangalkot (in Burdwan) and mentioned a string of clash-hit places before adding that the Bengal government should take steps to end inter-party clashes across the state.        
	But Sen appeared unfazed. He didnt mention anything specific about it (law-and-order situation) or make any specific criticism. As for the areas mentioned by the Union home minister, the district superintendents of police have been instructed to take immediate and adequate steps to ensure that incidents of violence and clashes do not recur. They have also been asked to send a message down the line that action will have to be taken strictly and impartially.        
	However, hours after he spoke, suspected CPM supporters in Hooghlys Khanakul  one of the places named by Chidambaram  beat back a police team heading to a village following allegations that a Trinamul supporters house was under attack. Two policemen were injured at Radhanagar, 130km from Calcutta.         
	Sen could not be reached for comment tonight.         
	Earlier in the day, he said 80 more police camps with around 1,000 personnel had been set up in Howrah, Hooghly, Burdwan and Birbhum districts to prevent clashes and people are giving us certificates for the job. We told Chidambaramji all these things.         
	Sen also claimed credit for the states prompt replies whenever Delhi had sought information on the clashes.         
	We explained to him (Chidambaram) in detail how normality was being restored, Sen said. We also told the home minister that more forces were needed as several companies of state personnel were stationed in Lalgarh.        
	According to a state official, 36 companies of central forces and 40 companies of state police are stationed in West Midnapore. Now that he (Chidambaram) has visited Lalgarh, spoken to the state and the CRPF and got a first-hand feel of the situation and our prob- lems, it will be easier for us to ask for more forces, Sen said.

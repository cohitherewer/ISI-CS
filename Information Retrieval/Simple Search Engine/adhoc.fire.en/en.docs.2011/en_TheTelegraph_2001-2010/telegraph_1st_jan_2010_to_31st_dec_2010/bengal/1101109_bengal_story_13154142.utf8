The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Absent doctor served notice
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Absent doctor served notice
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Islampur, Nov. 8: The district health authorities of North Dinajpur today showcaused a doctor of the Islampur subdivisional hospital for staying away from duty since November 1 without informing the administration.        
	The superintendent of the hospital has been asked not to allow A.K. Gupta, a general physician of the hospital, to join duty. He has also been told him to meet the chief medical officer of health (CMOH), Parthasarathi Bhattacharya, instead.        
	Hospital sources said the accused doctor had been asked to reply within three days.        
	The matter came to the notice of the health authorities after Deepali Pal, 60, was admitted to the hospital with stomach ailments on Saturday. Employees at the emergency ward told her that Dr Gupta would examine her. But when the doctor did not respond despite intimation through the hospital call book, the patients relatives became furious.        
	Pal was discharged from the hospital yesterday in deference to the wishes of her relatives.         
	Abhishek Pal, the patients son, later brought the matter to the notice of the minister of state for health, Anarul Haque, an MLA from Chopra.        
	CMOH Bhattacharya, who has issued the order against the doctor, said the allegation against Gupta had been proved. The physician has abstained from duties without informing the authorities. A showcause notice has been sent to the hospital asking the doctor not to join duty.        
	Haque has asked for a report about Guptas absenteeism from the CMOH.         
	The charge against the doctor is serious. I had received reports of dereliction of duty against the doctor even in the past, Haque said. The minister attributed the state of affairs to the lack of governance at the hospital.        
	Benoy Bhusan Bera, the officiating superintendent of the hospital, said Gupta had not gone on any official leave. We have informed the matter to the CMOH.         
	Secretary of the Islampur Nagarik Committee Samar Das said the hospital had virtually become guardian-less. There is no permanent superintendent for more than a year and a section of doctors and nurses are doing duties according to their whims.        
	Contacted on his cellphone, Gupta denied the charges. A conspiracy has been hatched against me. I will issue a statement to the media to clarify my position, the doctor said without elaborating.

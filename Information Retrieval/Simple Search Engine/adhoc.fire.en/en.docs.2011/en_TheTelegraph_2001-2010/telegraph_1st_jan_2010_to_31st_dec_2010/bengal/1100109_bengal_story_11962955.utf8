                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul land-grab duo shot dead
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jhargram, Jan. 8: A Trinamul Congress worker who had allegedly grabbed a plot not knowing that its owner was related to a Maoist action squad member was shot dead last night about 15km from Jhargram town.        
	With Khondakar Mafuz Ali was killed an aide whom he had asked to live on the land.         
	Police said Khondakar, 44, an affluent farmer who had contested the 2007 panchayat polls as a Trinamul-backed Independent, and Nirmal Nayek, 23, were shot twice in their head and chest with 9mm pistols.         
	In 2007, Khondakar, of Shalpatra village, allegedly asked Nirmal Nayek to build a house on Khagen Mahatos land in adjacent Muraboni. But he did not know that one of Khagens distant relatives, Nirmal Mahato, was a Maoist. Khagen sought the intervention of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities to resolve the dispute, said a villager who did not want to be named.        
	Around 8pm yesterday, Nirmal Mahato and his action squad comrade Dhanapati Mahato were with the Peoples Committee activists who called Nirmal Nayek to a meeting with Khagen.        
	Charged with occupying Khagens land, Nirmal Nayek said he did so under Khondakars instructions. He then went to Khondakars house and asked him to join the meeting.        
	When Nayek came around 9, we asked Khondakar not to venture out. But he didnt listen. He took a dozen other villagers with him and I followed him with my daughter Fatema, said Khondakars father-in-law Hasibul Hossain Nazir.        
	When Khondakar reached Muraboni, the Peoples Committee activists beat him up and asked his wife and father-in-law to leave. I fell at their feet and requested them to release him. But the Maoists ordered us to leave, said Hasibul.        
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said preliminary investigations had revealed that the Maoists had recently demanded a big amount from Khondakar.         
	It is not known whether the demand for the big amount was because of the land-grab charge against him. Khondakar, who owned about five acres, had allegedly encouraged Nayek to occupy about a third of an acre.        
	He was killed probably because he refused to pay the big amount to the Maoists. We are investigating why Nirmal Nayek was killed, Verma said.        
	According to a neighbour, the Maoists had sought Rs 5 lakh from Khondakar. Rashid Sheikh (name changed) added that the rich farmer often paid extortion money to the rebels.        
	The murders come days after Maoists pasted posters in Salboni threatening to punish Trinamul leaders after accusing a section of the party of shielding the CPM accused in the Chhoto Angaria massacre.

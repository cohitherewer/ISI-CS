The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Call for industry from parched fields
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Call for industry from parched fields

	Ausgram (Burdwan), Sept. 10: The drought has driven farmers in Burdwan to call for industry on their agricultural land, but the CPM, once bitten, is twice shy.        
	The saplings the farmers of Ausgram Block-I had transplanted have turned yellow because of lack of rain. For the second year in a row, their crops have gone bad. Last year, the crops had withered because of late showers. Now, the debt-ridden farmers have requested the government to set up industry on their land so that they can get jobs.         
	The three farmers who committed suicide in the state this year were all from Ausgram.         
	Asked why no initiative was being taken to set up industries, Azizul Haque, the chief of the CPM-run Ausgram panchayat, said: We dont want to acquire land for industrialisation here as it will provide fodder for the Trinamul Congress to launch an anti-acquisition movement. They will provoke the farmers against us. We had a very bad and costly experience in Singur and Nandigram.        
	Chandan Thakur, 35, a resident of Karoti village, said: It has become impossible for us to carry on farming. As there are no irrigation facilities here, we have to depend wholly on rain. There has hardly been any rainfall in Ausgram this year. Now we dont want to cultivate crops any more. If the government takes initiatives to set up industries, at least the local people will get jobs. We will also get money for the land that will be acquired.        
	Thakur, who has a two-and-a-half-acre plot, said his crops had turned yellow.        
	District agriculture officer Shyamal Dutta said: The district received proper rainfall last year only at the end of August. But by that time, a substantial quantity of saplings had withered. Ausgram was badly affected because of the lack of irrigation facilities. This year, the rainfall in Burdwan has been 50 per cent below normal. As many as 621 mouzas have been severely affected, Dutta said.        
	The lack of irrigation facilities forces farmers to cultivate only one crop every monsoon. Many of them earn their living by working as labourers for the rest of the year.        
	Tapan Mondal of Karoti village, who owns a three-acre plot, said the government should acquire land from Ausgram for industry instead of taking over fertile land in places such as Singur and Nandigram.         
	If factories come up in the area, we will get jobs and also money for our plots. The economic condition here will change, said Mondal, 50, whose land Jitu Bagdi, one of the three farmers who committed suicide, cultivated.         
	The residents of Basantapur and Purbatoti  each of which has witnessed a farmer suicide this year  echoed Mondal.        
	Cultivation is becoming uncertain and we dont want to do farming any longer, said Madhusudan Patra of Purbatoti.        
	The villagers said they would stick to their demand even if there was good and timely rain next year.         
	As rainfall is very uncertain here, we dont want to engage in farming any more. What is the guarantee that there will be normal rain next year? said Sunil Thakur, a farmer in Purbatoti.        
	The area is not far from Ausgram Block-II where farmers had offered 3,000 acres of land to the administration in 2007, requesting that industries be set up there. The Burdwan land and land reforms department had acquired about 500 acres from Ausgram Block-II.        
	But the same year, the CPM burnt its fingers on the forcible acquisition of land in Nandigram, an event that turned the political tide in Bengal in favour of Mamata Banerjee.         
	Now, the administration is going slow after local Trinamul leaders threatened to launch an anti-acquisition agitation in Burdwan.         
	Over the past 10 years in Ausgram Block-I, about 200 acres have been identified for setting up at least three mills and an aluminium factory but nothing has materialised so far.         
	Some companies had proposed to set up a paper mill, a cold storage, a rice mill, a rice bran oil mill and an aluminium factory in Ausgram Block-I. But they did not show further interest after we identified the land. Only one cold storage has been built, panchayat chief Haque said.

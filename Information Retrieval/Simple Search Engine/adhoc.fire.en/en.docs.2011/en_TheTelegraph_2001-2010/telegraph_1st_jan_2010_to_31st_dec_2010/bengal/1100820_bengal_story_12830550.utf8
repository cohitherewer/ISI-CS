The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Smuggling heat on Eastern Coalfields
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Smuggling heat on Eastern Coalfields
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Durgapur, Aug. 19: Around 40 tonnes of coal allegedly smuggled out of an Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL) mine in Jhanjra near Durgapur were found lying in a heap beside a bush near the mine, sparking an agitation by villagers led by trade union leaders.         
	Around 7.30am, residents of Kochdiha spotted the coal and informed the Intuc and Trinamul Congress trade union leaders of the coal mines in the area. When the leaders rushed to the spot with coal miners, around 200 villagers had already gathered there.         
	Some of us have seen ECL trucks dumping the coal early this morning, said Deepak Bauri, a villager of Kochdiha.        
	Goutam Ghosh, the secretary of the Intuc-backed ECL Workers Union, said coal pilfering was a regular affair in the Durgapur-Asansol belt.        
	Coal is smuggled out of the mines in collusion with a section of the ECL staff and supplied to neighbouring Jamuria and Mangalpur for use in sponge iron factories, Ghosh said. The smuggled coal is usually dumped outside the mines before being carried away on bullock carts.        
	The Central Industrial Security Force, which guards ECL coal mines in the area, cordoned off the pilfered coal, whose price is about Rs 1.4 lakh, according to ECL sources.        
	The mob gheraoed the general manager of the Jhanjra coal mine, A.K. Mishra, when he reached the spot an hour after the coal was found.        
	The trade union leaders complained to Mishra that some of his staff and the CISF were hand in glove with coal smugglers. We are aware of the coal pilferage and have repeatedly informed the police. But nothing has been done. The police refuse to take complaints from us, Mishra said.        
	When the protesters told Mishra to take the coal back to the mine, he refused. I cant do that as it was found outside the mine. The police will have to seize the coal, he said.        
	The gherao was withdrawn after Mishra and the CISF officer on duty, S.K. Mondal, promised to take steps to stop smuggling.         
	The police however, said they had not refused to take Mishras complaint. S.S. Sarkar, the additional superintendent of police, Durgapur, said coal mafioso Sheikh Amin and his gang were active in the area.

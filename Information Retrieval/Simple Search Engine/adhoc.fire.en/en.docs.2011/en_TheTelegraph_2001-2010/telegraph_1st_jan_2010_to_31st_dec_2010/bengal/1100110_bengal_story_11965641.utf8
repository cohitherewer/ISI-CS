	Calcutta, Jan. 9: Industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen was in talks with the Tatas for return of the Singur land, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said today.        
	Asked whether any letter has been sent to the Tatas, he said: Its not a question of whether there has been any written communication with the Tatas. The land is not being used for the purpose it was meant for. So, the issue of getting the land back from the Tatas has arisen as the project did not happen. The industries secretary is in touch with the Tatas. I havent spoken to him (Sen). I will try to get information from him on Monday.

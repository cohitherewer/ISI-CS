          OUR BUREAU                          Tukushona. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta/Baidyabati, July 1: A Class VIII girl in Hooghly was taken ill yesterday after her English teacher made her do 180 sit-ups in school for missing a class.         
	The family of Tukushona Roy Chowdhury, a student of Baidyabati Rajarbagan Vidyaniketan High School, today alleged that the lady teacher had punished the 15-year-old and 10 of her friends although they could not attend the class last week only because they were cleaning classrooms in keeping with school rules.        
	Tukushona, a resident of Baidyabati in Hooghly, started having breathing problems and felt giddy after the sit-ups. She was taken to Serampore Walsh Hospital last evening from where she was brought to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital this afternoon. A doctor at the city hospital said Tukushona was stable and had been released this evening.        
	The school authorities have suspended the teacher, who had joined a year back. We will hold a meeting on Saturday where we will decide what action will be taken against her, said Prasad Ray, the school secretary.         
	Tukushonas father Sumanta, who works for a catering service, lodged a police complaint against the teacher today.         
	Headmaster Priya Ranjan Ghatak said workshops were held regularly at the school to educate teachers on why they should not award corporal punishment.        
	I was not present at school yesterday. But I rushed to school after I heard about the incident. I also visited the Serampore hospital and paid for the girls treatment, Ghatak said.        
	The suspended teacher could not be contacted but her brother Manas Das claimed that his sister had handed out the punishment after taking the consent of the headmaster.         
	Tukushonas mother Rina said the headmaster had asked the students to clean classrooms periodically. Last Wednesday, it was Tukushonas turn. The English teacher had written down the name of Tukushona and 10 of her friends after she found they were absent from her class. Yesterday, she asked all of them to do 180 sit-ups, holding their ears. My daughter fell ill after the punishment, Rina said.         
	Tukushona said the teacher did not listen even though we tried to explain that we did not miss the class intentionally.         
	Puja Ojha, one of the punished students, said the English teacher had called a local doctor after Tukushona fell ill. She was given medicines and sent home but when her breathing trouble persisted, she was taken to hospital.

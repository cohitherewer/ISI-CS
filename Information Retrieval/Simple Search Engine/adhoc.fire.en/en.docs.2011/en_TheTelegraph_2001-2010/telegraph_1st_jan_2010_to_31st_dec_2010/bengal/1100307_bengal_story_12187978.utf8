The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Milk worry for a day
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Milk worry for a day
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, March 6: Around three lakh homes in Calcutta and its neighbourhood may not get their Mother Dairy milk pouches tomorrow morning because the companys contract workers, affiliated to Citu, held a 12-hour strike today demanding better wages.        
	Altogether 430 contract workers, who generally fill the pouches with milk at Mother Dairys Dankuni plant and deliver them in trucks, went on strike.         
	The strike began at 6m and continued till 6pm. Since the milk was not flown into the pouches today, supply to the market is likely to be hit tomorrow.        
	We know that the people of Calcutta and its neighbourhood would not get Mother Dairy pouches tomorrow morning because of our 12-hour ceasework, said Pradip Mishra, the vice-president of Citus Mother Dairy unit.        
	But we were left with no option other than holding the token strike to put pressure on the management. Despite several reminders, the management has done nothing to hike the contract workers wages.        
	S.K. Chanda, the chief general manager of the Dankuni plant, said there would be no supply of our pouches to Calcutta, Howrah, and the two 24-Parganas tonight and tomorrow morning.        
	About 2.5 lakh tonnes of milk are supplied daily from the Dankuni plant in pouches of half a litre and one litre.         
	The 70,000 litres of loose milk normally supplied by the plants permanent employees will reach the market, Chanda said.        
	Citus Mishra said Mother Dairy had signed an agreement with the contract workers in 2002 promising that the pact would be reviewed after three years.         
	Although the management increased the wages of its 550 permanent employees last year on the basis of the recommendations of the fifth pay commission, it has so far done nothing for the contract workers, let alone review the agreement, Mishra said.        
	Asked about the striking workers demand for higher wages, Chanda refused comment. We fear that the situation might worsen if the strike continues, he said.

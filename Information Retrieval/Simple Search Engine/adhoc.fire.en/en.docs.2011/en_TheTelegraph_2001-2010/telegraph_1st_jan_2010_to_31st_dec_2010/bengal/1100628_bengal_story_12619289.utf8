The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM sees disconnect with poor
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM sees disconnect with poor
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 27: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today told a CPM state committee meeting a distance had developed between the party and the poor and the immediate political task should be to re-establish the relationship.        
	In the concluding leg of the committees two-day session, the chief minister said: Its not that this disconnect (between the party and the poor) exists across the state. But, in the days to come, our political task would be to re-establish links with the poor and the downtrodden. We should take lessons from the past and be cautious in our steps ahead.        
	The recent civic poll results showed a decimation of the CPM. Of the 81 civic bodies that went to the polls, the CPM-led Left Front won only 17. The alliance had won as many as 60 in 2005. The CPMs main adversary, the Trinamul Congress, on the other hand, posted huge gains with its municipality count going up from three to 27.        
	The CPM was worst hit in North 24-Parganas, Hooghly and Burdwan districts. Of the 39 municipal bodies in these three districts, the party had control over 34 in 2005. This year, the CPM has been able to bag only six civic bodies in these three places.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose echoed Bhattacharjee on the partys social disconnect. Since the Lok Sabha polls, we have lost touch with the people, particularly the poor, and this organisational deficiency should be taken care of.         
	At the state party headqu-arters, Bhattacharjee laid down the priorities for the eight-nine months left before the Assembly elections.         
	Some of them are: distribution of land to the landless, speeding up distribution of SC/ST and OBC certificates and work on including poor and backward Muslims in the OBC category.

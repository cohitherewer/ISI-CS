          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sept. 25: Two Left Front ministers today met the Uttarakhand chief minister to discuss measures to evacuate tourists from Bengal stranded in the hill state by floods and landslides and requested him to locate nine missing travellers.         
	Civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee, who along with sports minister Kanti Ganguly met chief minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, said from Dehra Dun: We requested him to take steps to conduct search operations for the missing persons. We also requested him to ensure that the stranded tourists are safe.        
	He expressed satisfaction at the way the Uttarakhand government was handling the crisis. Mukherjee said army helicopters were searching for nine people from Bengal. Of them, three are from Howrah and six from Chinsurah.         
	However, the relatives and acquaintances of the missing tourists rued the delay in locating them. We have heard that two expert mountaineers have reached a military camp 30km ahead of Gangotri and will conduct search operations from tomorrow. The operations have again been delayed by a day, said Sudipto Mitra, whose fellow trekkers from Howrah, N.P. Rao, Anol Das and Arun Adak, went missing near Vasuki Tal on the Gangotri-Badrinath route earlier this week.        
	Several stranded tourists expressed displeasure at the lackadaisical attitude of the Bengal government in rescuing them.         
	Kasba resident Samudra Bose, who was air-lifted to Dehra Dun yesterday, said: I managed to come down but four of my team members are still stranded at Barkot in Uttarkashi district. The ministers are saying nothing more can be done, he said. Minister Mukherjee said several stranded tourists in Himachal Pradeshs Sangla could not be brought back because of bad weather.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, April 21: Students of a high school in Murshidabad pushed their headmaster around, punched him and locked him up in a room after he told them government money sent for their books over a month ago could still not be given to them.        
	Most students of Sadikhandiar High School in Jalangi, about 250km from Calcutta, come from poor farmer families that work the extra hour to provide education to their children.        
	They lost their patience when headmaster Sampad Biswas told them the third time in a month that the money could not be disbursed as the school managing committee had not had the time to meet and pass a resolution clearing it.        
	Because the headmaster had promised that the money would be distributed today, students from classes VI to VIII assembled outside his office at 11am. But the headmaster stepped out, said not today and the boys erupted in anger.         
	They ransacked the headmasters office, locked up Biswas inside and then targeted the staff room, where some 30 teachers were held hostage.        
	The headmaster called up Jalangi police station. When a jeep arrived with six cops, the students stoned it, smashing the windscreen. Three of the policemen fled. The students surrounded the three others. One of them fired thrice in the air and scared the boys away, said Rafez Mondal, a teacher of the primary section. Rafez and his primary section colleagues had not been locked up.        
	The officer in charge of Jalangi, Debashis Sarkar, denied the police firing. The students did not allow the policemen to go inside the school so they came away, he said.        
	We became so angry because it was the third day this month the headmaster promised to pay us but failed, said Enamul Haque of Class VIII.        
	Biswas said: We could not pay because we had not yet passed the mandatory resolution in this regard at the school managing committee meeting.        
	Jalangi block development officer Sukanta Saha, who went to the school after the police had scooted, said around Rs 2.5 lakh had arrived for books for some 1,000 students on March 3. The money should have been disbursed immediately. I have sought an explanation from the school, Saha said.        
	The BDOs intervention calmed the students. The headmaster and the teachers were released.         
	The money is given under a central scheme called the Sarva Siksha Mission in which 75 per cent of the funds come from Delhi and 25 per cent from Calcutta. Students of classes VI to VIII get Rs 250 every year to buy textbooks.

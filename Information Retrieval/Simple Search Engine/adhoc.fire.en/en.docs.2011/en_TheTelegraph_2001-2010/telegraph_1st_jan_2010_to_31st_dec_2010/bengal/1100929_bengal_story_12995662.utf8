                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Burdwan boy dies in Nagpur
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Anik Dutta                                  
	Burdwan, Sept. 28: A former CPM councillors son allegedly committed suicide in a private hostel near his engineering college in Nagpur yesterday, with the family saying they were clueless about the possible reason.        
	Anik Dutta, 22, was found hanging at the hostel he shared with other students of Priyadarshini College of Engineering in Nagpur last evening.         
	Anik is the only son of Ashok Dutta, a former councillor of the Burdwan municipality and an assistant manager at Durgapur Projects Ltd (DPL). According to the family, Ashok, 55, received a call around 4.30pm yesterday from one of his sons classmates, Kushal, saying Anik is no more. My brother almost collapsed, said Asit, Ashoks brother.        
	Around 10 last night, the head of Aniks department at the college called to say the boy had committed suicide, Asit said.         
	Prasanta, another of Ashoks brothers, has left for Nagpur. We expect him to bring the body back either tonight or tomorrow morning, Asit added.        
	Asit said the family found it difficult to accept that Anik committed suicide. He was mentally very strong. Asked if he suspected murder, he kept silent.         
	Asit also could not say whether the suicide was the fallout of a possible love affair. May be, may be not. I dont know. We are all waiting for our younger brother (Prasanta) to return. Maybe, he will get some information from police or Aniks classmates. The family has informed Burdwan police about the death.

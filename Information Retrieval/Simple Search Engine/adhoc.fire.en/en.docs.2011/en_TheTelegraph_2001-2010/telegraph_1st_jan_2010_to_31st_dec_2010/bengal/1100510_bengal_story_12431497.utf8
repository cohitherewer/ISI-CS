                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Arrest for sit amp; draw murders
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Barasat, May 9: One of the principal accused in a shoot-and-bomb attack that killed two people and left a nine-year-old girl at a drawing competition injured in North 24-Parganas Habra in December has been arrested.        
	Nanigopal Das alias Bhola was picked up from Jamshedpur last night, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Rahul Srivastava said.         
	Nanigopal had allegedly been contracted to hire the killers, who rained bullets and bombs near the drawing contest organised on the sidelines of a blood donation camp.        
	Srivastava said Congress activist Bapi Chowdhury was killed for protesting local gambling rings.         
	Trinamul supporter Ranjit Roy was also killed in the attack. But Bapis mother had named Trinamul supporter Raju Dam as the main accused.        
	Srivastava today said the murders had nothing to do with politics.        
	The shrapnel from one of the bombs hurled had hit little Priyanka Goldar, who was at the sit-and-draw competition with scores of other children.

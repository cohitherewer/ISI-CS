          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bankura, Feb. 1: Two women were killed and four injured in retaliatory police firing in Bankura when a Maoist-backed mob laid siege to a police station and fired some shots at the force.        
	The mob, numbering around 2,000 and with men marching behind women, had ringed the police station to protest stepped-up patrols in the area after a spurt in Maoist attacks.         
	The protest was organised under the banner of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. But, as is the norm in the zone, the protesters were aided by the Maoists in laying siege to the Barikul police station, about 220km from Calcutta.        
	Six women were hit in the police firing. Two died on way to hospital. Six policemen were also injured, though not by bullets. Their injuries were mostly from spears and other sharp weapons that the tribals were carrying.        
	Around 3pm, the mob of tribals and some Maoists with firearms  a police officer said the rebels in the crowd had their faces covered with black cloth  started marching towards the police station.        
	The police knew in advance about the protest  250 men from the joint forces were sent to the station as reinforcements  but were not expecting to be fired upon.        
	 We had thought they would just surround the police station, shout slogans, throw some stones and disperse. We didnt expect they would actually open fire, said an officer.        
	The women were marching in front, followed by the men. Behind them, we could see some hooded people with rifles on their shoulders, the officer said. About 30 Maoists were there. The tribals had bows, arrows and spears.        
	Around 3.30pm, the first shots were fired in the direction of the police station. The joint forces fired back. We had tried to disperse them before by firing tear gas shells and a couple of blank shots in the air. It did not help, an officer said. About 150 rounds were fired by the police and around 50 to 60 by the Maoists, according to the police.         
	Had we not been behind the walls of the police station, we would have taken a few bullets too, another officer said.        
	The committee members hid behind trees and boulders when the firing intensified and kept throwing stones at the personnel. When the women got hit, the tribals began to scatter. Seeing them backtrack, the police started chasing them.         
	Urmila Singh Sardar, a Maoist womens squad leader and wife of rebel leader Rajaram Sardar, was caught after she tripped and fell. Three more Maoists were arrested later.

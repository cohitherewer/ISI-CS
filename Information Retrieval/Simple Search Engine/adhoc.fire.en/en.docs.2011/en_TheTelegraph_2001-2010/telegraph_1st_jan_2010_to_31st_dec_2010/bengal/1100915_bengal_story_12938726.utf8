                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Four die in turf war over football ground
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Sept. 14: Four persons died today after a feud over the control of a Burdwan football field snowballed into a bloody battle between two villages, highlighting the dark side of the frenzy the game evokes in Bengal.        
	The six-bigha playground is sandwiched between Purbasthalis Lakshmipur and Aluni. The villagers had been at loggerheads for sometime over which group of boys should play on the field, the biggest in the area.        
	The Trinamul-dominated Purbasthali is not known for big political clashes unlike other Burdwan trouble zones such as Mangalkot.        
	According to police sources, todays violence, which also left 10 persons injured, possibly traces its roots to the murder of a Lakshmipur man last month, after which no games had been played on the ground.        
	This morning, a group of 100 from Lakshmipur entered Aluni and set fire to a house. Villagers of Aluni retaliated, hurling bombs and firing at the mob in which Meghnad Ghosh, 32, of Lakshmipur was killed, said an officer.        
	As news of the death spread, a larger group of nearly 5,000 villagers  most of them from Lakshmipur but several others drawn from neighbouring Babuidanga and Kamalnagar  stormed Aluni. According to villagers of Aluni, the mob went on the rampage, setting fire to three houses and looting 50 to 60 of them.        
	During the mayhem, Aluni residents Smarajit Saial, 23, Bhola Bagchi, 18, and Kamal Samajpati, 43, were dragged out of their houses and hacked to death. The Aluni villagers tried to put up a resistance but were outnumbered.        
	Rathindranath Mukherjee, the Kalna sub-divisional police officer who oversees the area, said many criminals were part of the second group that overran Aluni. The mob had a lot of criminals, the officer said.         
	The police sources said the tussle between the two villages over the ground started when Lakshmipurs Bifal Ghosh died after being hit by a bomb in a clash on August 7. Tensions had been high since then.        
	Biswajit Saial, elder brother of the slain Smarajit and deputy chief of the Trinamul-run local Majida panchayat, and others alleged that police from Purbasthali, 22km away, arrived more than fours hours after the mayhem.        
	We have heard that the group of about 25 policemen from Purbasthali police station had tea at a stall after reaching Kamalnagar (midway between Purbasthali and Aluni) before carrying on, Biswajit said. But officer Mukherjee claimed information about the clash arrived late and the cops reached Aluni by 12.30pm. The police resorted to a lathicharge. We are carrying out raids to arrest the culprits, the SDPO added.

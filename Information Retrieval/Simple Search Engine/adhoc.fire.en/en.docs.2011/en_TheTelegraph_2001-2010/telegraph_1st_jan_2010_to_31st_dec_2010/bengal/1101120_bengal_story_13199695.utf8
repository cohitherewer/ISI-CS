The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | A school where no VIP can shout from rooftop 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      A school where no VIP can shout from rooftop 
          UTTAM DUTTA                          One of the roofless classrooms of the Hooghly school can be seen through an opening in the wall. Picture by Ananda Das                                  
	Khanakul (Hooghly), Nov. 19: Red tape slams doors on many a deserving beneficiary but in a Hooghly school, it has left the roof open.        
	On hot summer days, the 83 students of the primary school in Hooghlys Atghara village sweat it out over their textbooks, scalded by the sun. A rainy day sends them scurrying for cover to the veranda.         
	The school, funded by the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, is roofless for the past seven years because the building could not be completed for lack of funds.         
	When it rains, the little boys and girls huddle into the veranda, the only place in the school that has a roof  a rickety asbestos cover. It is in this veranda that they are also served their midday meal.         
	Headmistress Jiamun Dargai said only Rs 1 lakh had been sanctioned under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan for the construction of the school.         
	The central funds had been routed through the zilla parishad and the panchayat. But the paltry amount was not enough to complete the construction of the one-storey building, Dargai said.        
	District magistrate Sripriya Rangarajan, the project co-ordinator for the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan in Hooghly, said: For every primary school set up under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, funds to the tune of Rs 3.64 lakh are allotted. I will investigate whether the entire funds were spent.        
	Pradip Saha, the sabhadhipati of the CPM-run zilla parishad, said he had been newly appointed and did not know why the entire funds had not been sanctioned yet. We are trying to sanction funds to the panchayat for the construction of the roof, Saha said.        
	Sahas predecessor Asit Patra had been removed last year following graft charges.        
	District officials alleged the school building could not be completed because of the negligence of the Rammohanpur-II gram panchayat.         
	Sisir Nandi, the secretary of the school managing committee, said he had repeatedly requested the panchayat for funds but nothing was done. They have only given false assurances, Nandi said.        
	A panchayat member said the money would be handed over to the school once the zilla parishad disbursed the funds to them.        
	Students complain it is impossible to concentrate on their studies during the gruelling heat of summer.         
	During the monsoon, the two classrooms are covered with tarpaulins provided by the panchayat. But that temporary cover is supplied only during long spells of rain. The tarpaulins are taken away when the weather improves. So in case of a sudden shower, the children have to take shelter in the veranda.         
	We are exposed to the rain and the sun. It becomes very difficult for us to concentrate, said Akash Midda, a Class I student. His father is a labourer.         
	The guardians also expressed displeasure over the delay in completing the construction of the school building.         
	Uttam Karmakar, whose daughter Susmita is a Class I student at the school, said the institution did not even have drinking water facilities. The students have to ask for water from people living near the school.         
	We are poor people. We have sent our children to the school with great hope. We feel bad when we see our kids suffer like this, Karmakar, the village blacksmith, said

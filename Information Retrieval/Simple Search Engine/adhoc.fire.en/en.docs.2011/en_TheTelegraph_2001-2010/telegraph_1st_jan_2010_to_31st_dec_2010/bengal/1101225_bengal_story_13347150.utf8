The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Didi Haldia skip for Pranab no-show
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Didi Haldia skip for Pranab no-show
          OUR BUREAU                          Mamata Banerjee                                  
	Haldia/Calcutta, Dec. 24: Mamata Banerjee will skip an Indian Oil Corporation programme in Haldia tomorrow where Pranab Mukherjee and Manas Bhuniya are expected to be present, Trinamul Congress sources said today.        
	Didi will not attend tomorrows programme as she has other preoccupations, Subhendu Adhikari, the Trinamul MP from Tamluk, of which Haldia is a part, said. He furnished another reason: CPM MLA Nityananda Bera was on the guest list and Trinamul would not share the stage with Left leaders.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata would stay away from the programme at the Haldia refinery to send a stern message to Union finance minister Mukherjee who skipped a railway event in Murshidabad on December 15 because of a helicopter snag.         
	The sources said Mukherjee had deliberately stayed off to please Adhir Choudhury. The Congresss Murshidabad strongman, who has on numerous occasions publicly criticised Mamata, had organised a rail roko in another part of the district on the same day.         
	A Trinamul youth leader said Mamata had been deeply hurt by Mukherjees absence.         
	The party sources said Bhuniya was another reason why Mamata had decided to stay away. Mamata has taken strong exception to the way in which Manas has been repeatedly criticising her and our party of late, a Trinamul leader said.         
	Union petroleum and natural gas minister Murli Deora is also expected to be present at the Haldia event. Mamata had yesterday sought to distance herself from the Centre over the soaring costs of essentials. She had said her party had not been consulted when the Centre implemented the fuel price hike.

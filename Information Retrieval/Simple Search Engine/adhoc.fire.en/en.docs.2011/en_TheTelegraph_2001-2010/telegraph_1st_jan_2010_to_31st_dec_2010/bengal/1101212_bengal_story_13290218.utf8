	Calcutta, Dec. 11: A Calcutta woman was arrested this afternoon for trying to get a US visa from the American consulate by presenting a forged passport.         
	Jinsu Patel of Taltala had applied for the visa posing as Dimple, wife of one Richard Stephen Spirito, a Bhowanipore resident, police said.         
	The consulate authorities suspected foul play when her signature did not match with the one printed on the passport.         
	Richard had embossed Jinsus photo on his wife Dimples passport, an officer said.         
	Later, three more persons were arrested in connection with the case.

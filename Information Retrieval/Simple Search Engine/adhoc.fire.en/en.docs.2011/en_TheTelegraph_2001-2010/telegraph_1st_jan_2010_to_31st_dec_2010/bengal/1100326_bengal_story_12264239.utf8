	Midnapore, March 25: Suspected Maoists ransacked and blew up a part of the CPM party office in West Midnapores Shilda last night, five weeks after massacring 24 Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans at a camp relocated to protect it.         
	The EFR camp was dismantled after the February 15 attack.        
	Around midnight yesterday, a group of around 60 suspected Maoists, many of them armed with rifles, single-barrel guns and pistols, shot open the lock of the collapsible gate of the office and entered it by breaking the door inside.         
	The group, that included women, then beat up the caretaker, the only person present at the office at the time of the attack, and shoved him out.         
	A CPM leader in Shilda said the Maoists fitted an improvised explosive device to the ceiling fan and triggered a blast from outside.         
	The wooden door and windows at the office were blown up by the explosion. Then the Maoists again entered the office and ransacked it. They threw chairs, tables and other furniture outside and battered them with sticks, said Ananta Mukherjee, a local committee member of the CPM.         
	Before leaving, the Maoists left some wires inside the office, giving the impression that they had planted more explosives. Party supporters, who gathered outside the office after the Maoists left, did not dare enter after they saw the wires.        
	The Maoists also left behind posters in front of the party office, demanding answer for the joint forces atrocities on common people.         
	Police, along with bomb squad officials, reached Shilda this morning. The police did not find any explosives attached to the wires, said Manoj Verma, the district superintendent of police.         
	The EFR camp which was attacked on February 15 was initially located on an irrigation department plot, 2km from the Shilda marketplace, and was surrounded by a boundary wall.         
	It was relocated to the busy marketplace in 2007, following pressure from local CPM leaders who wanted the camp to be shifted near the party office because they had received death threats from the Maoists.         
	After yesterday nights attack on the party office, the Maoists also ransacked a forest beat office in Etela village, 3km away.         
	The Maoists asked the forest beat officer, Khagen Bera, to leave the office and then burnt papers and furniture.         
	Some of the rebels in the group also asked around 20 forest officials and guards living in the adjoining quarters to come out of their houses.        
	The Maoists ordered the employees to come out with their family members. They beat up two guards, Bholanath Shit and Kalipada Singh, for being late in coming out, beat officer Bera said. The Maoists also burnt their furniture.         
	Bera said the Maoists also destroyed an under-construction building inside the beat office compound by hitting it with crowbars, rods and shovels.

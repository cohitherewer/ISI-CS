	Durgapur, July 7: A man who had married by posing as a doctor and swindled his father-in-law into arranging for chambers where he treated patients was arrested in Asansol today.         
	Abhijeet Roy, 36, of North 24-Parganas Noapara, had claimed in a matrimonial ad that he was a paediatric cardiologist. He married the daughter of an Eastern Coalfields executive in March and moved into his in-laws house.         
	But Roys wife and father-in-law began suspecting him when he demanded Rs 3 lakh to buy a flat in Noapara. Roys father-in-law contacted the Indian Medical Association, which made inquiries and found out Roy was a fraud.         
	Roy, who had returned to Noapara a month ago, was caught after his wife lured him to Asansol by saying her father was ready to pay Rs 50,000. Police said Roy had worked as an assistant with doctors.

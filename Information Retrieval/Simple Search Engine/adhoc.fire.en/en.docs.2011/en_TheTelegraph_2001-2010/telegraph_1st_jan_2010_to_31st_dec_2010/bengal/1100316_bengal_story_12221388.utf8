The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Delhi offers more power and a dash

          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Kalimpong, March 15: A central plan the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha claims it has not even glanced through proposes greater autonomy to an authority and promises to put it under the direct control of the governor.        
	The central plan, disclosed by the Morcha today and confirmed off the record by sources in Delhi, was given to the Morcha at the talks in Darjeeling on December 21.        
	 The Morcha claims to have rejected it outright but the plan sheds some light on how the Centre is hoping to find a solution.         
	The Centre has promised financial assistance but thoughtfully left vacant (Rs  crores per annum) the space where the amount was to be mentioned, which is being interpreted as a virtual blank cheque to the Morcha.        
	The executive committee of the council proposed by the Centre  to be called the Gorkhaland Autonomous Authority (GAA)  has been promised the power to make by-laws on the basis of laws already passed in the Bengal Assembly.        
	The GAA will have legislative powers on 54 transferred subjects like theatre and culture, management and maintenance of cremation grounds, minor minerals and mineral development, management of land and markets and town and country planning.         
	All laws made by the GAA in respect to the subjects enumerated in Annexure-II shall be submitted to the governor of West Bengal and on his assent, the same shall come into effect, according to the Centres proposal.        
	The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, the current dispensation that finds few takers now, is under the state government and has executive powers on 45 subjects. The central plan not only seeks to upgrade the executive powers to legislative flexibility, it also expands the list from 45 to 54.        
	A major drawback the Morcha found in the proposal was that only the current DGHC area will be brought under the jurisdiction of the new body. The Morcha has been claiming it cannot afford to leave out areas dominated by Nepali-speaking people.        
	The district magistrate and the superintendent of police will not be under the GAA.         
	Amar Lama, a central committee member of the Morcha, while disclosing the Centres proposal, said: The delegates representing the Centre (G.K. Pillai, Union home secretary) had come with this proposal during the fourth round of tripartite talks (on Decem- ber 21, 2009). We did not allow it to be tabled but the Centre again forwarded to us the proposal through the interlocutor. We had not even glanced through the report but we are disclosing it before the public so that they can compare it with the proposal we had sent to the Centre.         
	Before accepting the GAA  the Centre had said the name could be changed during discussions  the Morcha will have to agree to hold elections to gram panchayats and panchayat samitis.        
	The GAA will have 20 members, of whom 15 were to be nominated by political parties in proportion to the number of seats won by them in the gram panchayat elections. The rest will be nominated by the governor.         
	The governor can recommend that an annual report of the functioning of the GAA be tabled in the Assembly.

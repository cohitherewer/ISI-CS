	Midnapore, Feb. 15: One moment the two sentries at the gate were shooting at the Maoists, the next moment they were on the ground, blood oozing from their injuries and life slowly ebbing away.        
	Standing rooted near a tent pitched on the grounds of the primary health centre at Shilda, policeman and camp cook Rakesh Lepcha watched in horror as cop after cop fell to Maoist bullets, hopelessly outnumbered and taken by surprise.        
	Initially, I simply couldnt move, Lepcha said at night after reinforcements arrived from Binpur and Belpahari.         
	Then I realised that it was a Maoist attack and a very major one at that. My first instinct was to run for cover and that is what I did.        
	Lepcha left his tent where he was cooking dinner for the EFR personnel around five this evening and rushed to the safety of the primary health centre. Secure behind the brick walls, he watched the Maoists quickly gain ground.        
	There were about seven or eight jawans on duty at the gate and around the camp, on the lookout for attackers, Lepcha said.         
	Another 20 had just returned from patrol and were in the process of taking off their uniforms and preparing for the night. The rest were simply relaxing when the attack took place.        
	The Maoists struck by exploding an improvised device, the sound of which brought Lepcha rushing out of the tent. There were just too many of them and their arms were sophisticated. So they were quickly gaining ground, Lepcha said.         
	The way they were advancing really put the fright into me.        
	Although some of the policemen were relaxing, they quickly picked up their guns and started shooting at the Maoists. But they were no match for the guerrillas who had descended in hordes.        
	There was just too much confusion with the sudden attack and the jawans were trying to retaliate in whichever way they could, Lepcha said. I could see in the distance not just men but also women with guns firing at us.        
	As soon as the attack took place, all the shops in the area downed their shutters and villagers scampered away. Some small thatched shops along the outer boundary of the camp caught fire as bombs kept going off one after the other.        
	After about 45 minutes  a lifetime for Lepcha  the policemen still alive realised that the battle had been lost and began to flee.        
	Seeing so many of their fellowmen die in front of their eyes shattered all my colleagues, Lepcha said.         
	They realised that they were in no position to put up a fight and if they tried to, they would all die. They abandoned the fight, jumped the wall and fled.         
	That was what Lepcha did too. He ran into the forest. I did it at the right time, he said. I watched the Maoists enter the camp and set everything on fire.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Demand for job quota
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Demand for job quota
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 25: The Forward Bloc today urged chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to introduce reservation for Muslims in government jobs and education.         
	Citing the Sachar Committee report, which had under- lined the social, educational and economic backwardness of Muslims, and the Justice Ranganath Misra Commission report, which had recommended a sub-quota for minorities, Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh made the demand in a letter to the chief minister.         
	He said the Left Front government should take the initiative to implement the commissions recommendations when the UPA government at the Centre is in a dilemma over it.         
	The commission, appointed by the first UPA government, had asked the Centre to introduce reservation for backward Muslims and Christians on the ground that castes existed irrespective of religion.         
	Left leaders felt the Blocs move was in tune with the CPMs efforts to fathom public opinion on the issue.         
	Although the chief minister had earlier cold-shouldered the demand for reservation for Muslims, the CPM leadership has of late indicated a change in its stand.         
	Observers see in it a desperate desire to win back the support of Muslims, whose desertion is believed to be a key factor that has triggered the slide in the CPMs poll fortunes. Kerala has a 12 per cent quota for Muslims excluding the creamy layer.        
	The CPM central committee, which is meeting in Calcutta next month, will discuss the issue, said party leaders.

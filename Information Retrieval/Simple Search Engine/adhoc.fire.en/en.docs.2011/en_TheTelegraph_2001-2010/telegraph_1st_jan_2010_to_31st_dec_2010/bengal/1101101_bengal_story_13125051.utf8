	Anara (Purulia), Oct. 31: Mamata Banerjee today promised a flood of jobs in Bengal, addressing the exodus of youths from the state and crystallising what looks like a calibrated effort to snatch the Left Fronts key plank.        
	At a railway event, Mamata laid stress on efforts to create employment in her capacity as the head of one department.         
	A few hours later at a rally in Bankura, Mamata put a number to her promise of flood of jobs. If I am given a chance to serve you for five years, I shall provide jobs to 10 lakh youths, she said.        
	Mamata said that as railway minister, she was trying her best to create more jobs by setting up industry.        
	The thrust on job creation comes in the middle of questions by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee if she had been able to create jobs. The CPM has also been repeatedly accusing Mamata of driving away projects such as the Nano that could have otherwise generated jobs.        
	Mamata has been responding to the criticism on industry, yesterday going to the extent of predicting a shilpo biplab (industrial revolution) in Bengal.        
	Today, the Trinamul Congress chief pledged to turn the state into rupashi Bangla (beautiful Bengal) and raised an issue that will strike a chord in countless households in Bengal.        
	Ei rajye kajer bonna boibe (there will be a flood of jobs in the state). The people of the backward districts of Bengal will not have to go to places such as Rajasthan to break stones for a living, the railway minister said after laying the foundation for a coach-rehabilitation plant at Purulias Anara.         
	At the same programme, the railways signed a memorandum of understanding with the NTPC to set up a power plant in Purulia to provide electricity for running trains.        
	Mamata said that as the head of only one department  the railways  she had created more jobs in the one year and four months that she has been in power than what the CPM has done in 34 years.         
	With just one department in hand right now, I have promised railway projects almost all over Bengal. Jobs are not just verbal assurances, they have to be created, she said.        
	She also sought to underscore the failure of the Left to create jobs despite being in power for over three decades. I am not in power in the state but I have started the process of job creation here. The Left Front has failed to do so in the 34 years that it has ruled Bengal.        
	If I could set up two projects in a backward district like Purulia, why could not they (the Left) do it for so long? These two projects will create many jobs for the local people. These are just a few steps in turning Bengal into rupashi Bangla. Railway assets are being utilised for it.        
	She also predicted unnayoner dheu (waves of development) for Purulia.        
	In her signature rhyme, she beat the development drum for Purulia: Bajbe madol, nachbe Chhow, Purulia te ashbe unnayaner dheu.        
	The railway minister accused the CPM of failing to remove poverty in the district. She claimed 1,000 of the 1,400 villages in Purulia languished below the poverty line. Given a chance, we will change this in just five years, she said.

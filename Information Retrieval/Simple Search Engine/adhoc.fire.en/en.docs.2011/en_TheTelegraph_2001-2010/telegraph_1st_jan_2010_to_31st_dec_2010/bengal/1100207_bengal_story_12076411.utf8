The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | GNLF clash with Morcha
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      GNLF clash with Morcha
          OUR BUREAU                          Students at a protest march in Darjeeling on Saturday. (Suman Tamang)                                  
	Darjeeling/Siliguri, Feb. 6: Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters today clashed with GNLF activists at Panighata in Kurseong while tension brewed at Birpara, Jalpaiguri, over an Adivasi threat to prevent a Morcha event tomorrow.         
	At least 10 people were injured in the Panighata violence, sparked by allegations of bias in the distribution of work under the rural job scheme. The clash comes two days after Morcha activists burnt vehicles in Darjeeling and Kalimpong in protest against a police lathi-charge in Siliguri.        
	The Morcha has been demanding permission to hold a public meeting in Siliguri to highlight its statehood demand, but the administration has refused to give the go-ahead.        
	Kurseong had been calm till today despite the outbreak of violence in Kalimpong and Darjeeling.        
	Today, trouble broke out after GNLF supporters said the local administration was providing jobs only to Morcha supporters under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.         
	Heated arguments broke out and soon the supporters of the two organisations came to blows.         
	Rival activists beat each other with sticks and rods till the police arrived after an hour and broke up the mobs.        
	In neighbouring Jalpaiguri district, the Morcha has announced three meetings on three consecutive days in Birpara, starting tomorrow.        
	Birpara has a sizeable Adivasi population which is opposed to Gorkhaland statehood. The Adivasi Vikas Parishad has called a bandh in Birpara tomorrow so that Morcha activists cannot reach the area.        
	The Jalpaiguri district administration has not given permission for the meeting but the Morcha is determined to go ahead with it. A Morcha leader said: We had no option but to have meetings on three days, for few people would be able to come tomorrow because of the bandh.        
	The meetings will be held to observe the death anniversary of Akbar Lama, a Morcha supporter killed in a clash with Adivasis near Birpara in 2008. There will be meetings in Darjeeling, Mirik, Kurseong and Kalimpong too, but only tomorrow.        
	The Adivasi Parishad said it would not allow Morcha supporters to reach the venue of tomorrows meeting. Morcha supporters, though, were trickling into Birpara this evening.

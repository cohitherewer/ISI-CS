The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Eye in sky alerts cops about moving cluster in forest
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Eye in sky alerts cops about moving cluster in forest
          PRONAB MONDAL                                             
	Calcutta, June 18: West Midnapore police had come to know about the possibility of a Maoist camp on the edge of the Ranja forest when satellite pictures provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation showed a cluster next to Duli village in Salboni.         
	Armed with the sky spy inputs, the police activated their source network and got the pinpointed tip-off about a guerrilla camp there.        
	The police said they came to know about Maoist movement in and around Ranja forest after the rebels recently attacked a CPM office in nearby Pirakata. After that strike, the rebels had taken off in the direction of Ranja forest and that is where they were possibly holed up.         
	We then contacted the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) for satellite images of the forest. They had helped us in the past as well, an officer said. The Isro images showed a concentration or cluster off Duli village. The images showed that the cluster was not static. In one image, it was at a particular place, in another it had shifted a bit. This suggested that a group was moving. We knew they must be a group of Maoists.        
	Armed with this information, the police activated their contacts. The feedback that they got was positive. On Tuesday night, the police got the pinpointed tip-off that the Maoists had indeed set up a camp on the fringes of Duli.        
	The police proceeded with the raid that night itself. Eight Maoist squad members were gunned down. This was the security forces biggest success against the Maoists since Operation Lalgarh was launched on June 18 last year.        
	However, a section of police officers said the operation was only partially successful as most of the guerrillas had managed to flee. According to our information, there were about 60 armed guerrillas camping there. They were divided into two groups in their camp. We carried out the assault on one of the groups successfully while the members of the other group managed to escape, the officer said.         
	The police said the Maoists had set up the base to stage an attack on the Indian Reserve Battalion camp at Changshol early today.         
	Officers believe two Maoist commanders were in charge of the group that had planned to attack the IRB camp. While one of the commanders, Arjun, has been killed in our operation, we believe the other, most probably Bikash, escaped, an officer said.         
	It would have been a huge victory for us had we managed to kill both commanders. So, I would say the police operation was only a partial success.         
	The police said they would seek Isros help whenever they needed any information on Maoist movement.        
	The state government filed a report in Calcutta High Court today saying the Maoists had been cornered and Delhi had agreed to send more forces to intensify the offensive.        
	The Maoists in West Bengal have already been cornered. Moreover, the central government has agreed to send more forces so that we can in- tensify raids against the Maoists, advocate-general Balai Ray said in his report.         
	The report followed a PIL demanding a CBI probe into the February 15 Shilda massacre by the Maoists.        
	Trains stuck         
	Over a dozen trains, including the Howrah-bound Samarsatta Express from Mumbai and the Delhi-Puri Purshottam Express were stalled for two to five hours today because of a demonstration on the tracks by a tribal outfit. It was demanding constitutional recognition for their religion, Sarna.

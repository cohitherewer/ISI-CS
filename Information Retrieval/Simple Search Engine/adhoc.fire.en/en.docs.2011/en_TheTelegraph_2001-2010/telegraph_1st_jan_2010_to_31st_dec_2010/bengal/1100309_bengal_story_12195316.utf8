The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoists dead in own explosion
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoists dead in own explosion
  - Womens Day show goes awry, police hunt for injured rebels        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Midnapore, March 8: Five Maoists were killed today in a series of explosions set off by them to mark International Womens Day in West Midnapore, police have claimed.        
	The claim of deaths cannot be verified as the Maoists never leave behind bodies and the security forces did not go to the village of Gadra, where the blasts were supposedly triggered.        
	A senior police officer in West Midnapore district said after enquiries made by the force, there were reports of three explosions in which possibly five rebels were killed.        
	Superintendent of police Manoj Verma confirmed the news of the explosions. A little before noon, three big explosions occurred in Gadra. The sound of the explosions could be heard as far as 10km away. There is possibility of casualties, he said.        
	A villager said he saw some injured men being taken away on motorcycles. Around 3pm, we saw two motorcycles with two injured people on them. The injured men were sitting between the rider and another person riding pillion. They rode towards Gorabari in Goaltore, the villager, who stays in Nadaria that is 4km from Gadra, said.         
	But the police could not confirm if the bodies were lying on the spot or were taken away by the Maoists.        
	A senior police officer said the force had got information that Maoists had organised a meeting of sorts to mark International Womens Day in Gadra, about 15km from Lalgarh. The village, under Salboni police station, is about 170km from Calcutta.        
	For the past five years, the Maoists have been observing International Womens Day in some villages in the junglemahal. They demonstrate how to use explosives and firearms at these meetings. Last year, such demonstrations were held in Narcha in Lalgarh and Gadra, said a police officer.        
	When the police came to know that some Maoists had gathered in Gadra, about 300 CRPF personnel started for the village from Bhimpur, Ramgarh and Khandibandh, all less than 10km from Gadra.         
	When we were about 5km from Gadra, we heard loud explosions and immediately stopped. We were waiting for further instructions when we were told to return to our camps around 1pm. We were told about the explosions and also that there were casualties, said a CRPF officer.        
	West Midnapore police chief Verma said the forces were watching out for people travelling with injuries.         
	Belpahari body        
	The body of a 38-year-old man was found on Monday morning in a crouching position, his hands tied behind his back, in Belpahari, West Midnapore.         
	A police officer said the man had been shot twice  in the head and the back.         
	The man is an outsider and that is why no villager could identify him. We are not ruling out the hand of Maoists in the killing. We have started an investigation, the officer said.

	Purulia, Dec. 18: Four Forward Bloc leaders, including two ministers, today visited Purulia a day after seven party members were killed by suspected Maoists.         
	Ministers Naren De and Paresh Adhikari, the partys all-India general secretary Debabrata Biswas, and state secretary Naren Chatterjee visited the victims homes.        
	They also met district leaders in Purulia town where they said the district units of the Bloc would have to be reorganised and strengthened.        
	The Bloc leaders repeated the Left Fronts claim yesterday that the Congress had colluded with the Maoists to carry out the attacks on the four villages in Jhalda, located at the foot of the Ayodhya Hills.        
	Biswas said a rally and a march would be organised on December 27 at Baghbinda village, where four of the seven victims lived.        
	The Left Front today protested the killings with a 12-hour bandh in Purulia. Offices, schools, colleges and markets remained closed and vehicles stayed off the roads.        
	The inspector-general of police (western range), Zulfikar Hassan, and other senior officers visited the four villages and questioned residents.

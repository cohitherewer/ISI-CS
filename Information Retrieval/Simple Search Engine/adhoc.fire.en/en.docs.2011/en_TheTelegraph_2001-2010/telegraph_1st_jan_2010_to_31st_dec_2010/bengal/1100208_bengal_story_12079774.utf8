The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Citu wants driver pay tripled
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Citu wants driver pay tripled
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Feb. 7: Citu is demanding Rs 38,000 a month for contractor-engaged bus drivers who ferry the employees of three top Haldia companies in a desperate bid to endear itself to workers in the industrial township.        
	The absurd demand has prompted six contractors to threaten to stop services at Haldia Dock Complex, Haldia Refinery and Haldia Petrochemicals after their current contracts expire.        
	They provide the three companies with about 300 drivers, as many vehicles and 50-odd helpers. Contractor-engaged bus drivers now get Rs 12,000 a month and their helpers around Rs 7,000.         
	The demand is for an over 200 per cent hike  Rs 38,000 for the drivers and Rs 21,000 for the helpers.        
	At a news conference, the contractors said it would be impossible to continue supplying vehicles if Citu held its ground. How can we agree to this absurd demand? We will stop our services as soon as our contract ends, said Amit Dey, who supplies vehicles to the dock complex.        
	The contractors have three-year agreements with the companies to supply buses and cars with drivers and helpers. When the companies renew their agreement, there is a revision of wages. But the hikes have always been between 15 and 20 per cent.         
	Ours is a just demand, said Sudarshan Manna, an East Midnapore district secretariat member of the CPMs labour arm. These drivers deserve pay on a par with the permanent drivers of the companies, especially because of the steep in- crease in prices of essentials.        
	A permanent driver at, say, the dock complex draws about Rs 28,000 a month after 15 years of service.        
	Asked why then they were demanding more, the Citu leader said: Permanent drivers work only eight hours a day. Those engaged by contractors work 12 hours.        
	However, the real reason for the activism could be the unions slipping support in the town, where a Trinamul Congress rival has gained a foothold.         
	Citu still holds sway with around 60,000 members, but around 5,000 have allegedly switched sides since a stunning performance by Mamata Banerjees party in last years Lok Sabha polls. Trinamul now holds both the Parliament seats from the district and also the zilla parishad.        
	At the towns showpiece project, Haldia Petrochemicals, the CPM union had enforced a four-day strike in November demanding a 300 per cent increase in wages for contract workers. The strike ended after the management agreed to a 104 per cent hike. Not to be left behind, the Trinamul union blocked the gates of Mitsubishi PTE in December demanding permanent jobs for 150 casual workers and a raise for the rest. None of the companies had witnessed such protests before.        
	The transport contracts of the three companies are ending this year and officials said they would be in trouble if the service providers pulled out. We have some vehicles of our own, but we depend almost entirely on the private vehicles for the transportation of our employees, said Basab Roychowdhury, general manager of Haldia Dock Complex.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, July 2: A Class XI girl in Burdwan hanged herself yesterday after being humiliated by a local youth, whose advances she had protested, and his family.         
	Lakshmi Roy, 18, the daughter of a domestic help, has left a suicide note in which she has blamed Rasu Roy, 22, his mother and sister. A police officer said Lakshmi had written that her soul would not rest in peace until the trio were punished.         
	The police said Rasu, an electrician, had been teasing Lakshmi on her way to school for the past few months.        
	Nilmoni Sarkar, Lakshmis uncle, said she had protested the harassment but to no avail. Even Lakshmis parents had asked the boy not to disturb her but he continued to tease my niece, Nilmoni said.        
	Lakshmi had complained about Rasu to the local Trinamul Congress leaders on Wednesday. On the same day, Lakshmi, her mother Anjali, Rasu and his mother were called to the local Trinamul office.         
	We warned Rasu and told him not to disturb Lakshmi again. We thought the matter would end there. We are shocked to hear about the suicide, said Jalal Sheikh, a Trinamul youth leader.        
	But Nilmoni said that yesterday at 5pm, Rasu, his mother Sabita and sister Rina came to Lakshmis house and abused her. The girl was alone at home. Neighbours told me that the trio shouted at Lakshmi. They called her a jhier meye (daughter of a maidservant), Nilmoni said.         
	Around 7pm, Anjali returned home to find her daughter hanging.         
	Subhashis Chowdhury, the inspector-in-charge of Burdwan police station, said Rasu, his mother and sister were absconding.

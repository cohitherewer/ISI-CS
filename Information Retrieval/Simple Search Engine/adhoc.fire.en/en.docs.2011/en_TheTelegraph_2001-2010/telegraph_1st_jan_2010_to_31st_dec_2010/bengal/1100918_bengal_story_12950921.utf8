The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Centre diesel subsidy for farmers
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Centre diesel subsidy for farmers
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	Sept. 17: The Centre today announced a diesel subsidy of up to Rs 500 per hectare to farmers in drought-hit Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand to help them irrigate their fields.         
	Every farmer will get up to Rs 500 per hectare as diesel subsidy, Union food and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said in Delhi.        
	Although there has been insufficient rain, there is water in many rivers and wells. Probably, the farmers (of the three states) have to spend more (to draw water from these sources). Thats why we have decided to offer the subsidy, Pawar said.        
	Bengal agriculture minister Naren De told The Telegraph this evening: I was unaware of the announcement. I am happy to know of the decision. It will help the farmers.        
	According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gangetic Bengal has received only 673.9mm rainfall till September 15. The average normal rainfall till this period is 1020.3mm.         
	The rainfall deficit in Gangetic Bengal is 34 per cent so far this year. Bankura, Birbhum, Burdwan, Purulia and West Midnapore are the worst-affected districts, an IMD official said. The situation is not likely to improve, he added.        
	The rainfall deficit in the whole state is 16 per cent because of the excess rainfall in sub-Himalayan Bengal.        
	Sub-Himalayan Bengal has received 2,008.9mm rainfall. This is higher than the yearly average of 1,757.6mm. Had that not happened, the overall figure for the state would have been much worse, the official said.        
	The statewide deficit, at best, can come down to around 12 per cent if there is rain in the next three weeks, he added.

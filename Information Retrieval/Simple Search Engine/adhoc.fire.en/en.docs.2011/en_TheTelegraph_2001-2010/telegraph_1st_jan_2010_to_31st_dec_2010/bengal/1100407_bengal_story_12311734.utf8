          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Nazrul Islam                                  
	Calcutta, April 6: The state government is facing a peculiar puzzle: how does it deduct a Re 1 fine, as ordered by the high court, from the pension of a retired employee?         
	There are provisions to cut money from a serving employees salary but none from a re-tired officials pension, the government told the court today in a case filed by IPS officer Nazrul Islam against the administration for bringing false charges of corruption against him and maligning him.         
	The court had dismissed the allegations against the po-lice officer and, last December, directed the government to find out who was responsible for the false charges against him. It also slapped the Re 1 fine on the person found guilty.         
	Responding to the court order, government counsel Pratik Dhar today said former st-ate vigilance commissioner S.K. Dutta, also an IPS officer, had initiated the inquiry against Islam. But Dhar contended that the government did not know how to deduct the fine as Dutta had retired in the meantime and there was no specific rule for deduction of money from pension. The court had asked the government to deduct Re 1 from the salary of the person found guilty of initiating the corruption inquiry against Islam. But Dutta is now a retired person and the government is not aware of a rule that will allow it to deduct the fine from his pension.         
	Justice Dipankar Dutta responded by saying the state should file an affidavit before the court stating the entire matter  from identifying the person who had initiated the inquiry to the difficulties it was facing in deducting the fine  by April 26. He would hear the case again on April 27.        
	In a report placed before the court on behalf of state home secretary Ardhendhu Sen, the government contended that Dutta had not started the inquiry against Islam on the basis of any secret complaint that he had received, but on his own. Placing the report in the court, the governments counsel said: The home secretary had conducted a probe to identify the person who had initiated the vigilance commission inquiry claiming there was a complaint that Islam had amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.         
	Dhar said the home secretarys findings had revealed there was no such complaint.         
	However, the report does not say why the inquiry had been started. The counsel for Islam, Shaktinath Mukherjee, said the court should look into it during the next hearing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul sends ally go-it-alone reminder
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul sends ally go-it-alone reminder
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 20: The Trinamul Congress today said an alliance with the Congress was most welcome but laced the assertion with the warning that it was ready to go alone in the polls otherwise.        
	If there is an alliance with the Congress, it is most welcome. Otherwise, our party is prepared to go alone for the elections whenever they are held, said Trinamul secretary-general Partha Chatterjee, also the leader of the Opposition, after a meeting of the core committee at Trinamul Bhavan here this evening.        
	Although Mamata Banerjee chaired the meeting, convened exclusively to discuss the partys stand on the tie-up with the Congress, she assigned Chatterjee to issue the public warning.         
	The warning comes at a time the Congress has asserted itself in Murshidabad and Union minister Pranab Mukerjee stayed away from a meeting with Mamata on the pretext of a helicopter snag. More such skirmishes are expected as the two allies prepare for hard bargaining for seats when the Assembly elections approach.        
	It also follows the petrol price hike and a sharp spurt in onion prices  issues that are expected to be used by the CPM to target Mamata over her partnership with the Centre. She doesnt want the CPM to be given any opportunity to hit at her for the Centres decision, a Trinamul general secretary said. Another factor is a feeling among a section of Trinamul that some Congress leaders have maintained ties with the CPM.        
	Sources said at the meeting, a number of leaders alleged that the CPM continued to receive tacit support from the Congress, and if things remained that way, there was no point in going ahead with the alliance. We are in favour of the alliance but Siliguri model will not be tolerated. People have faith in our alliance. They are looking at us and we are ready, Chatterjee said.        
	The Congress and Trinamul had jointly defeated the Left in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation last year but the Congress went ahead and formed the board with Lefts support. The deal still haunts alliance advocates.        
	A Trinamul general secretary explained why the Siliguri model still rankles with party leaders. The Siliguri model cast a deep shadow on the future of our alliance. In the run-up to the civic polls in May this year, the Congress and Trinamul had failed to reach an understanding and went their separate ways. So we are apprehensive of Congresss tacit understanding with the CPM before next summers Assembly polls.        
	State Congress leaders, now in Delhi for the AICC plenary that concluded today, appeared upset by Trinamuls doubts over the alliance.         
	Trinamul is our ally at the national level and it had fared well after aligning with us in last years Lok Sabha polls. Its good that some Trinamul members realised the rationale behind aligning with us. But we fail to understand why some of them expressed doubts over aligning with the Congress, which has been consistently fighting CPM tooth and nail in Bengal, said state Congress general secretary Om Prakash Mishra.        
	Bengal Congress chief Manas Bhuniya, also in the national capital, refused comment on Chatterjees remarks.         
	Yesterday, Bhuniya was part of the party delegation that met Sonia Gandhi and told her any deal with Trinamul could not come at the cost of their dignity and self-respect.        
	It was decided at todays meeting that a Trinamul team would meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with detailed documentation of the CPMs atrocities in rural Bengal.         
	On Saturday, Mamata had called up Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and complained about law and order. Adding fuel to her fury were the comments of some Congress leaders in recent weeks.         
	We will continue with our tirade against the CPM for the terror that it has unleashed in the interiors (of Bengal). We will not let down our guard against the CPM-led government, said a senior Trinamul leader.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Dhoni: Breathing easy                                  
	Calcutta, April 21: Calcutta High Court has asked Gameplan Sports not to operate its bank accounts without first keeping aside around Rs 8.18 crore, which Indias cricket captain M.S. Dhoni claims it owes him, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The interim order, issued by Justice Nadira Patherya on April 16 and valid till April 26, follows a petition by Dhoni against the Calcutta-headquartered company alleging that it had breached an advertisement deal and underpaid him.        
	The case will come up for hearing on April 23.        
	Gameplan Sports has accounts in four banks  ABN AMRO, Standard Chartered, Axis Bank and State Bank of India, said Dhonis advocate Rajashree Kajaria. The court has asked the company not to withdraw Rs 8,18,61,718, the sum Dhoni claimed the company had failed to pay him.        
	The interim order says Dhoni and Gameplan had reached an agreement in 2005 where it was decided that the agency would act as Dhonis collecting agent for payments for his endorsements and articles between January 18, 2005, and January 31, 2008. Gameplan would get 30 per cent of the amount as commission.        
	The order says Dhoni has claimed that while Gameplan collected the amount during this period, and even after January 31, 2008, it has not passed on his share to him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Glare on activist body claim
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Glare on activist body claim
  - Slain lalgarh man was PCPA member, says police chief          OUR BUREAU                          Mamata Banerjee before the hearse of Hembram at Trinamul Bhavan in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Midnapore/Calcutta, Dec. 20: The slain Lalgarh activist whom Trinamul claimed as its supporter and whose body it took around Calcutta today was a Jharkhand Party member who later joined the Maoist-backed PCPA, police said.         
	Sanatan Hembram was initially a Jharkhand Party member who later joined the PCPA (the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities) when it was created about two years ago. After that, he was associated with the Gana Militia. He even became a village defence committee member like Bapi Mahato, who was arrested over the Jnaneswari Express sabotage, West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said today. Gana Militia is the PCPAs armed wing.        
	The officer said he had not heard that Hembram had any links with the Trinamul Congress, adding the police were investigating whether there were cases against Hembram for being involved in any attack.        
	At his cremation late this evening in Midnapore town, Hembrams widow Bidisha said her husband did not work for Trinamul or any other party.                
	Hembram, 27, was shot dead at his native Kadamkundi village in Lalgarh yesterday morning.         
	Trinamul leaders marched along with his hearse as it moved around Calcutta today. The move was seen as a way to counter the CPM-organised procession for Swapan Koley  a member of the Left partys student wing, the SFI  killed in a clash with Trinamul Chhatra Parishad activists in Howrah last week.        
	Both Chunibala Hansda of the Jharkhand Party (Naren group) and Ashit Khatua, state general secretary of the Jharkhand Party (Anushilan, formerly Aditya group) have claimed Hembram was with the party before it split into the two outfits. When the Aditya group started breaking up out of fear and pressure from the Maoists, he joined the PCPA, Khatua said.        
	A resident of Hembrams village, also a PCPA member who did not want to disclose his identity, said the slain activist had attended PCPA meetings regularly. We even held meetings at his home till two months ago, he said.        
	But Mrigen Maity, Trinamuls West Midnapore chief, claimed that Hembram had recently become a party worker. He, however, shrugged off questions about his past. What he used to do earlier, I do not know.        
	CPM central committee member and former MP Mohammed Salim accused Trinamul of playing politics over a body and described the plan to take out a procession with Hembrams body as an afterthought.        
	Trinamul had announced a general procession from Shyambazar to Esplanade against political violence. But all of a sudden, Trinamul decided to bring Hembrams body to Calcutta to give its scheduled procession an added edge. It is in bad taste, Salim said after a CPM state committee meeting today.        
	Trinamul state president and MLA Subrata Bakshi denied the body politics charge. Those who walked miles with the body of Swapan Koley, we have some questions for them. We want to know why Sanatan Hembram was killed? What was his fault? he asked.

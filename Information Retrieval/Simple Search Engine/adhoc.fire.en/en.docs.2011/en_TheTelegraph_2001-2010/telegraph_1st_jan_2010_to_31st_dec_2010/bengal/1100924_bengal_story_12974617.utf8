          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Alipurduar, Sept. 23: Yesterdays elephant deaths were killed could have been avoided had the forest department informed the nearest station that a herd was near the tracks, railway officials said today.         
	After a joint inspection by the forest department and the railways in January, it had been agreed upon that the department would inform the railways about elephant movement near the tracks, the divisional railway manager of the Northeast Frontier Railways Alipurduar division, S.N. Singh, said.         
	It is true that the place where the accident happened is not one of the 10 zones where we had jointly agreed with the forest department to reduce the speed of trains. But we have been repeatedly asking the forest department to share information with us. However, that has not been happening, Singh said.        
	Our staff patrol the entire 180km stretch from Siliguri to Alipurduar. This year, trains have been halted on 159 occasions to allow elephants to cross the tracks safely. On Tuesday night, our staff had spotted a herd of elephants at the site where the accident took place and had informed the forest range office at Binnaguri immediately, Singh added.         
	Chief conservator of forests, north Bengal, S.B. Patel, denied the railways allegation that the department did not pass on information. We definitely pass on information to the railways as and when required. Last nights accident happened in the darkness. It is very difficult to monitor the movement of elephant herds in darkness, Patel said.

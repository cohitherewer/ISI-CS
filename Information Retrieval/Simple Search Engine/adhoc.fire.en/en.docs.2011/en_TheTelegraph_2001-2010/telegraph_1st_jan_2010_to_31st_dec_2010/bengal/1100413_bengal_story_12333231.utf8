          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 12: Most of the CPM candidates for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections will be fresh faces, a leader said after a meeting of the Left parties city units today.        
	Well replace the majority of our councillors with new candidates. Performance in the past five years will be the only criterion for renomination, the CPM state secretariat member said.        
	The candidates for the 141-member city civic board were supposed to be named today but it had to be put off till Thursday because of the CPMs inability to finalise its nominees.         
	We shall bring in more efficient and dynamic people, the CPM leader added.         
	The party has 61 councillors on the board now, the RSP has six and the Forward Bloc and the CPI have four each.

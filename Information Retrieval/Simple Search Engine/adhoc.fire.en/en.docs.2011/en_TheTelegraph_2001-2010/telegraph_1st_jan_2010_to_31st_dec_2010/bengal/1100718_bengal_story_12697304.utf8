The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dean quit offer after varsity spat
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Dean quit offer after varsity spat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 17: The dean of education at Kalyani University has offered to resign in protest against the appointment of three lecturers over more qualified candidates.        
	University authorities have not yet accepted the resignation offer of Subalakshmi Nandi, who had also submitted a note of dissent after the selection committee interviewed the three candidates for posts of lecturers in the education department.        
	Vice-chancellor Alok Banerjee said he had received a letter from Nandi last week where she expressed her willingness to resign.         
	In all, 27 candidates had applied for the three posts. It appears that the authorities ignored the candidates who had fared better academically than those selected, said a senior professor at the university.         
	The professor claimed that the selected candidates were close to the CPM.         
	The university had invited applications for the posts and had set a minimum cut-off of 55 per cent marks in BEd and MEd. The advertisement also said the applicants should have graduated with at least one of the following subjects: physics, chemistry, math and Bengali.        
	A section of the university staff had, however, written to the governor, M.K. Narayanan, who is also the chancellor of the varsity, alleging that several candidates who had got first class in both graduation and postgraduation were not considered.         
	They also alleged that none of those selected had got a first class though they met the selection criteria.        
	The universitys policy-making body has been encouraging nepotism in recruiting teachers and senior officers for several years, an official at the institute said.

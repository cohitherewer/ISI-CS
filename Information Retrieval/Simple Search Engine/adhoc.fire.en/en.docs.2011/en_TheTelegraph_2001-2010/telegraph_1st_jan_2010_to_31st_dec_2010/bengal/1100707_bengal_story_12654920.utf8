The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bloc finger at CPM for defeats
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bloc finger at CPM for defeats
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 6: The Forward Bloc leadership today said that the successive election debacles were an indication of the peoples lack of confidence in the Left Front government and that this had happened because of big brother CPM.        
	After a three-day central committee meeting, Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas said: The setback in the civic polls is an outcome of the trend of erosion in the Left vote bank that started with the 2008 panchayat polls and continued in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.         
	The people have expressed their lack of confidence in the Left, mainly because of leading partner CPM and its acts of omission and commission, Biswas said.         
	In the May municipal polls, the Lefts tally of civic bodies went down to 17 from the 60 it had in 2005. The Trinamul Congress, on the other hand, bagged 27 municipalities, up from the three it had five years ago.         
	According to the Bloc general secretary, forcible acquisition of cultivable land for industrial purposes is one of the factors that generated anti-Left feelings among the electorate.        
	It is now clear that acquisition of fertile farmland for setting up industry was not liked by the people of the state. Such a move created a gap between the party and the people. A large section of the electorate moved away because of this. Unfortunately, the Left Front has deviated from its path of movement, Biswas said.        
	According to the Bloc leadership, the mistakes committed by the government cannot be rectified by the chief minister holding meetings at Writers Buildings but that the Left Front needs to be activated in the districts to formulate programmes on the basis of which the administration would work.        
	It will be of no use if the chief minister holds meetings at Writers or goes to the districts and speaks to district magistrates. This will not solve the problems being faced by the Left Front. The solution is to activate the district units of the Front so that they take up programmes, discuss them with ministers and then ask the government to implement those, the Bloc general secretary argued.

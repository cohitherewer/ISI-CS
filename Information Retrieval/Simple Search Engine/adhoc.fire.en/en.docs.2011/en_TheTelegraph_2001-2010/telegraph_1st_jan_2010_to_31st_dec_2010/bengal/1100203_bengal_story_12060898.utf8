          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, Feb. 2: A senior state civil service official went to police in Nadia today accusing his wife and son of murdering his elder brother.        
	Jharna Debnath, 43, and her college student son Biswajit, 21, were arrested this evening and charged with the murder of Jagabandhu Debnath, 63.        
	Radheyshyam Debnath, 57, a deputy magistrate at the North 24-Parganas district magistrates office in Barasat, said his wife had always wanted him to drive away his brother, who was dependent on him. My world has crumbled around me. I have lost my brother, whom I loved very much, and also my wife and son. But I want the guilty to be punished, he said.         
	Radheyshyam also has a 15-year-old daughter.        
	The police claimed that Biswajit, a second-year BSc student of Nabadwip Vidyasagar College, had confessed to the murder. He told us that he had throttled his uncle to death. He also said his mother did not know about it. We are trying to find out if he is lying to save her, said Taraknath Karapi, the inspector in charge of Nabadwip police station.        
	Radheyshyam used to stay at his official quarters in Barasat and visited his home in Nabadwip, about 100km from Calcutta, on weekends.        
	He left home for Barasat around 5am yesterday. Around 5pm, his wife called him up to say his brother was missing. The government officer returned to Nabadwip last night and launched a search with the help of neighbours. But Jagabandhu could not be traced till 2am today.        
	Then Radheyshyam decided to search his brothers bedroom. Jagabandhu was lying dead on the bed, inside a mosquito net. Radheyshyam lodged the murder complaint around 2pm today.        
	My wife always told my son that I spend half my salary on my brother and they will have nothing by the time I retire. It was my wife who brainwashed my son into hating my brother, alleged Radheyshyam. But I was very close to my brother. He was physically weak and couldnt take up any job and I looked after him. But my wife used to torture him mentally as I was away most of the time.

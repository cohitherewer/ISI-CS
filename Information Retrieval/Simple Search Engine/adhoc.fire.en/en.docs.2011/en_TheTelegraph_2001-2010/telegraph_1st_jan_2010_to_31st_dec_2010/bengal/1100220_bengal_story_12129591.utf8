	Jhargram, Feb. 19: Fearing further attacks by Maoists, police have shut down three more unsafe camps in West Midnapore.         
	The Shilda camp, which was attacked by the Maoists on Monday, has already been dismantled.        
	We had to wind up three more police camps at Lodhashuli and Jitushole under Jhargram block and Chandabila in Nayagram because they were not properly protected. We have started hunting for suitable land to relocate them, district superintendent of police Manoj Kumar Verma said.        
	He added that the relocated camps would be fully fortified and secured to combat Maoist attacks.        
	Police sources said the decision to relocate the camps followed a string of meetings over the last few days among senior police officers, including director-general Bhupinder Singh and inspector-general (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha.         
	The camp at Lodhashuli, set up three months ago in a community hall, accommodated 60 personnel from the State Armed Police.         
	The police at the camp, about 45km from Shilda, were tasked to oversee the security of vehicles plying along National Highway 6, which connects Calcutta with Surat, Gujarat.        
	It was set up in December following a spurt in Maoist attacks on vehicles plying to and from Calcutta. The area is also considered vulnerable because it is only 12km from Jharkhand, an officer said.        
	The police yesterday rem-oved the tents and the barbed-wire fencing around the camp compound. Children were today seen playing inside what used to be the camp.        
	The Jitushole camp, only 5km from Lodhashuli, accommodated 20 State Armed Police personnel. It was set up following a Maoist strike on a private sponge iron factory in December.         
	Our factory was set ablaze and over a dozen vehicles and about 22 motorbikes parked in front of it were torched. My own bike was one of the 22, said Ratan Karmakar, 22, who works in the plant.        
	The camp at Chandabila, 8km from the Orissa border, was set up after two CPM men were shot dead by the Maoists in December. Around 50 State Armed Police personnel were housed in two tents there.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Santanu Chatterjee at the Burdwan hospital on Monday. (Mousumi Mukherjee)                                  
	Burdwan, Oct. 4: Two motorcycle-borne men hit a trader on his head with iron rods here this morning, snatched his bag containing Rs 4 lakh as he slumped to the ground bleeding and escaped.        
	Police said Santanu Chatterjee, 41, the owner of a cold storage, had just stepped out of his house at Itlabad at 10.30am when the robbers, believed to be in their 30s, attacked him. Chatterjee was going to Rainas Shyamsundar, about 20km from his home, to deposit the money in a bank.        
	Chatterjee, who has been admitted to the emergency ward of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital with head injuries, said: The youths asked me to hand over my bag to them. When I refused, they hit me on the head with rods. As I fell down, they snatched my bag.        
	Alerted by his cries for help, his 70-year-old mother and his domestic help, Jaya Das, rushed out of the house.         
	Pinaki Das, a local youth, said: We also ran to the spot but could not do anything as the attackers pointed revolvers at us and escaped.        
	Some of Chatterjees neighbours said that though the nearest police outpost  at Birhata  is only 200 metres away, the cops arrived long after the youths escaped.        
	The attackers fled after completing their operation, said Subir Chatterjee, 30, a neighbour.        
	An officer at the outpost said: It appears that the goons were waiting for Chatterjee to step out of his home. He goes to Rainas Natuharipur every day as his cold storage is located there.         
	Another officer said the police failed to get prior information about the attack because of the lack of an intelligence network.         
	Shyamal Das, 40, who owns a stationery shop in the neighbourhood, said the attackers had come to his shop and requested him for water about an hour before the heist.        
	The inspector in charge of Burdwan police station, Subhasish Chowdhury, said: We have already got certain leads on the attack and will arrest those involved soon.

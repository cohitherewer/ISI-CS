                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Leaders keep Didi Lalgarh pot boiling
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Midnapore/Calcutta, Oct. 13: Two Trinamul Congress leaders today took part in a procession in Lalgarh at the behest of Mamata Banerjee who has apparently instructed her party leaders to keep the partys pot boiling there in her absence.         
	Tamluk MP Subhendu Adhikari and the junior Union minister for shipping, Mukul Roy, led the 1,000-strong procession that went around Lalgarh town for half an hour. The march came three days after the CPM reclaimed Lalgarh.        
	A Trinamul source said Mamata had asked party leaders to stand by the tribals and those reeling under the CPMs reign of terror whenever she is preoccupied with railway work. A Trinamul MP said: Didi wants us to stand by the people of Lalgarh who are being targeted by the CPM. The residents fear they might be attacked by the cadres who have re-entered Lalgarh.         
	It is not always possible for her to visit Lalgarh because of ministerial and party work. Over the past week, she has been busy with Durga Puja inaugurations. Thats why she had asked Adhikari and Roy to keep the Lalgarh pot boiling by organising processions and meetings, he added.        
	The MP said Mamata believed that the people of Lalgarh needed moral support from Trinamul.        
	The Trinamul leaders held a meeting outside the Lalgarh Rajbari before the rally. Adhikari alleged at the meeting that the CPMs armed goons had entered Lalgarh on Sunday, escorted by CRPF jawans.        
	The armed cadres will unleash terror here, he said.        
	Roy demanded the immediate withdrawal of the joint forces. The leaders distributed rice and new clothes among poor Trinamul supporters.

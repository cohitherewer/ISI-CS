	Tamluk, Nov. 25: CPM cadres retreating from Khejuri entered a party stronghold nearby, ransacked the houses of Trinamul supporters and allegedly molested three women, including a pregnant lady, whose husbands had fled fearing a Left reprisal today. The pregnant woman has suffered a miscarriage, doctors said.        
	Nearly 200 armed cadres who had been chased out of Khejuri yesterday by Trinamul Congress activists today crossed the Rasulpur river and entered Sunia village, a Left stronghold. Trinamul had yesterday foiled the cadres attempt to recapture Khejuri.         
	District Trinamul leaders alleged the CPM men ransacked the houses of Trinamul supporters in Sunia and neighbouring Kulanjara and Umabatibar this morning. The menfolk had escaped earlier.         
	The cadres allegedly ordered the family members of the Trinamul supporters to join the CPM.         
	A woman and her daughter-in-law in Kulanjara and another woman in Umabatibar were allegedly beaten up and molested by the CPM men.         
	Subhas Chandra Tamali, the husband of one of the tortured women, said: The CPM goons threatened the women with dire consequences if they did not join their party.        
	Kulanjara resident Subhas said he had fled his home last night with son Debashis after coming to know that the retreating cadres were approaching his village.         
	Subhas said the cadres molested his wife and daughter-in-law. My daughter-in-law was seven-months pregnant.         
	The two women were taken to a nursing home in Contai. Subhashis Ponda, a doctor at the nursing home, said the pregnant woman had suffered a miscarriage. She has bruises all over her body, Ponda said.         
	Umabatibar resident Bikram Maity alleged his wife had also been molested. The Trinamul supporter had fled home last night.         
	Bikram said around 50 cadres broke open the door of his house last night and threatened to kill his wife if she did not join the CPM. Then they molested her. They could have done further harm had some neighbours not rushed to her help, Bikram said.        
	All three harassed women were taken to the Contai nursing home and given first aid. Ponda said the women had suffered cuts and bruises. They have been taken to Contai subdivisional hospital.         
	Subhas and Bikram lodged FIRs with Contai police this evening. A police team from Contai went to Kulanjara and Umabatibar after district Trinamul general secretary Mahmud Hossain lodged a complaint.        
	Hossain said Trinamul workers and supporters today surrounded Sunia to prevent further CPM attacks.        
	Trinamul leaders Partha Chatterjee, Subrata Mukherjee, Sisir Adhikari and Subhendu Adhikari visited Khejuri today and held a public rally at Kamarda, the village the cadres had tried to recapture yesterday.        
	Chatterjee alleged the CPM had brought out criminals from jails and attacked Khejuri with their help. We had repeatedly alerted the chief minister about possible attacks in Khejuri but he turned a deaf ear, Chatterjee added.        
	Mukherjee accused the CPM of smuggling guns from Bangladesh and giving them to cadres. He said if CPM used firepower, we will also speak in the same language.         
	Sisir Adhikari said Khejuri was a Trinamul stronghold and if the party wanted, it could demolish the houses of CPM supporters there in 15 minutes.         
	CPM district secretariat member Prasanta Patra, however, said Trinamuls complaints were politically motivated and is aimed at maligning the CPM.        
	Surajit Kar Purakayastha, the additional director-general of police (law and order), said the situation in Khejuri was being closely monitored.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Police beating over posters
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Police beating over posters
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          One of those beaten by police in hospital. (Mita Roy)                                  
	Purulia, May 17: Defying police involves a lesser risk than annoying the Maoists, Gurupada Besra had thought this morning when cops told him to remove posters the rebels had pasted on walls in his village in Purulia.        
	Gurupada would be patting himself despite his injuries in a police baton-charge that has landed 15 villagers, including 11 women, in hospital for protesting.         
	Had he removed the posters, the Maoists would have come at night and killed him, a villager said, nursing his feet, swollen from the baton blows.        
	When 30 joint forces personnel marched into Nalakocha, 305km from Calcutta, picked out Gurupada and ordered him to tear off the posters, he refused. As the jawans tried to coerce the 52-year-old day lab-ourer, 50 villagers, most of them women, protested.         
	We pleaded with the police to spare him but they dragged Gurupada towards the posters, said Haladhar Besra, 62, from his hospital bed in Purulia town.        
	The villagers blocked the polices way, with the women in front. Then the women started pushing the police and CRPF personnel to try and free Gurupada.        
	Additional superintendent of police C. Sudhakar said his men launched the baton-charge after the villagers threw stones, injuring five policemen. He denied the police had tried to force any villager to take the posters off.        
	Sambari Murmu, 38, a housewife who has been hospitalised with injuries in her legs, hands and back, said: We tried to stop the police because we are scared of the Maoists. Can they save us from a Maoist strike?

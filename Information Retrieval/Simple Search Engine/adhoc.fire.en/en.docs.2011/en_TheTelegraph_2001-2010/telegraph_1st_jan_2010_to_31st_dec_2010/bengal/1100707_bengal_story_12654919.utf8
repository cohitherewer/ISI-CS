          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, July 6: A Class XI student of a Durgapur school who left home last evening for private tuition was found dead near his house today with his throat slit and several stab injuries on the face and limbs.        
	A blood-stained pair of scissors was found beside 17-year-old Krishnendu Dass body, the brutality of the murder stoking suspicion it was a revenge crime.         
	The way the boy was assaulted indicates the killers hatred and sense of revenge. We are exploring all angles, including whether there was a love affair. We will also interrogate his classmates, said Haripada Shee, inspector-in-charge of the Borjora police station.        
	Krishnendu, the son of an Eastern Coalfields clerk posted in Raniganj, stayed with his aunt at Gourbera village in neighbouring Bankuras Borjora as it was closer to his school, DPT New Boys School in Durgapur, than his fathers quarters.        
	Neighbours found Krishnendus body, lying face down and in his blood-soaked blue T-shirt and grey trousers, in a bush along the Durgapur-Bankura state highway, police said. The spot is around 1km from his aunts place.        
	When the police came to take the body, locals blocked the highway demanding sniffer dogs be brought to track the murder trail. The dogs were eventually brought from the CISF base in Durgapur after four hours but they could not throw up any clues.         
	Krishnendu told us he would return by 10.30pm so we started looking for him after he didnt come back till 11.30pm, said Krishnendus aunt Tulshi Das. Late last night, she lodged a missing complaint with the police.        
	Krishnendu, who used to cycle around 4km to school daily since being admitted to the institution last month, had left Gorubera around 5.30 last evening to meet a biology teacher near Durgapur railway station from whom he wanted to take tuition, his aunt said. The police said Krishnendu did not go to the teachers house.         
	I cant understand who could kill him so brutally, Tulshi said, breaking down. Krishnendus father Swapan Das could not think of any possible reason for his sons murder. My son was very gentle and innocent and had no enmity with any one. I dont know who killed him but I have lost my only son, he said.

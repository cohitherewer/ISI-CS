	Bena (Burdwan), Oct. 22: Their wealth has crumbled, not their faith in the goddess who is seen to bring it.        
	A ghost town near Asansol that has seen an exodus over lack of basic civic amenities and security comes alive once a year as the families return to the forsaken zone on Lakshmi Puja.        
	Most of the families that have left Bena, around 20km from Asansol town, appear convinced they dont want to come back for good. But on this occasion each year, nothing can keep them away.        
	Even though we dont live here any more, we cant forget the days when we performed Lakshmi puja for three days at the local temple. Come what may, we get together for Lakshmi puja. Nothing stops us, said Pitambar Maji, 55, who retired as a technician from IISCOs Kulti unit nearby and now stays 4km away in Niamatpur.        
	Majis son Parthasarathi makes it a point to join his father. It is a great feeling. I remember as a child I acted in plays during the puja, said the 28-year-old engineer with a cellphone firm in Bongaon, North 24-Parganas.        
	Asked why he had not stayed on, the senior Maji dubbed the place a ghost town. What else could we do? We didnt have power, a metalled road, sewerage or even a ration shop. The place was crawling with criminals stealing coal from passing wagons. Fed up, we left, said Maji, who went away in 2005.        
	The Majis house is now a dilapidated tangle of concrete and the 20-bigha plot where the family once grew paddy and vegetables has become a barren landscape of chest-high shrubs. After Bena came under Kulti municipality  the civic body was formed in 1994  residents thought their condition would improve but their hopes were dashed.         
	There was no road and in monsoon, we were forced to walk through mud and slush. Despite repeated petitions to the Kulti municipality, nothing happened, said Sukhomoy Maji, 60, a farmer who has shifted to Dendua village in Salanpur, 6km away.         
	The exodus began in 2000 and by 2007, all the 40 families had moved out.        
	But this morning, the scene was different. A decorator was sprucing up the Lakshmi temple. A generator hummed close by. Cooks from a local catering agency tossed up luchi, khichdi, cabbage curry, papad and chutney.         
	The authorities admitted there were no amenities but promised improvements. We feel bad. I have placed the demands in the last two meetings, said Badal Putatunda, the local Trinamul councillor of the Kulti municipality that is run by his party and the Congress.

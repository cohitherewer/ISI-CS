	Calcutta, April 2: The West Bengal Minorities Development Finance Corporation almost doubled the amount it had disbursed in loans and scholarships to Rs 129 crore last year.     
	In 2008-09, Rs 70 crore worth of help had been distributed. The amount will be increased further this financial year, commission chairman Mohammad Salim said. Loss of support among minorities is perceived to be a major reason for the Lefts electoral setbacks. The loans could be seen as an attempt to regain the minorities trust.        
	Dankuni: A fire ravaged a plastic goods factory in Dankuni on Friday afternoon. Seventeen fire tenders controlled the blaze in three hours but most of the unit had been gutted by then. A burning bidi stub may have caused the fire, said Pushpajit Jaduka, the owner of Plymac.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rivals play bridge politics
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rivals play bridge politics
          DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY                              
	Bhangar, Sept. 13: The political rivals in Bengal are desperate to bridge the gap with the people ahead of the Assembly elections next year.         
	A bridge over a canal in South 24-Parganas Bhangar has been inaugurated twice  once by the Trinamul Congress yesterday and again today by the CPM. Both parties claimed they had the right to inaugurate the bridge over the Bagjola canal in Sonpur.         
	While Trinamul leaders said the party-run zilla parishad had spent Rs 98 lakh on the construction of the 7.5-metre-long bridge, the CPM said the public works department had planned the bridge and spent Rs 4.65 crore.        
	Yesterday, South 24-Parganas sabhadhipati Shamima Sheikh and Bhangar legislator Arabul Islam, both from Trinamul, inaugurated the bridge. Around 10,000 people attended the programme, its venue decked with Trinamul flags and posters.         
	The construction of the bridge was complete. So we opened it. We are the elected representatives of the region. So we have the right to inaugurate the bridge a day before the CPM, Sheikh said.        
	Today, the same scene repeated itself, only the protagonists were different and CPM flags and banners had replaced those of Trinamuls. A similar number of people attended todays official inauguration.         
	It is strange that a bridge is being inaugurated twice, land and land reforms minister Abdul Rezzak Mollah said at the programme. PWD minister Kshiti Goswami opened the bridge.        
	Mollah began his speech by thanking Trinamul for cooperating in removing some shops so that the bridge could be constructed. Then he launched into a tirade.         
	Trinamul went ahead and opened the bridge. They used improper language during their programme. This is not right. The Trinamul leaders claimed they had not been invited to our inauguration ceremony. But the PWD minister has told me that not only were they invited, the local MLAs name has been inscribed on the inauguration stone of the bridge, Mollah said.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose said in Calcutta: The Trinamul-run zilla parishad should not have inaugurated a bridge that has been constructed by the states public works department. The move smacks of bad taste.

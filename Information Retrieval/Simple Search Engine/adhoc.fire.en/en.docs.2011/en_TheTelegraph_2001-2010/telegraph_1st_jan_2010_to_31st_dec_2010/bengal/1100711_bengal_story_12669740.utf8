          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, July 10: A Class XII student who drowned in the Hooghly while swimming with 17 of his friends near Tokta ghat in South Port yesterday remained untraced for over 12 hours as none of his friends informed his relatives about the incident.         
	The body of Paban Kumar, 18, a Behala resident, was fished out of the river by police this morning.         
	Anil Sharma, Pabans uncle, came to know about his drowning from one of the 17 boys, a neighbour, after he went in search of his nephew.         
	South Port police have registered a case of unnatural death and have sent Pabans body for post-mortem. The relatives of Paban, who lived with his mother and sister, are yet to lodge a police complaint.         
	Paban, a student of D.D. Maheswari School in Burrabazar, had left his home with his friends at 6.15am. His relatives said Paban had gone to Tokta ghat many times. Sharma said he started searching for Paban from yesterday afternoon. He asked several of the boys friends but nobody would give a clear answer. Finally, one of Pabans friends informed Sharma that he had died.

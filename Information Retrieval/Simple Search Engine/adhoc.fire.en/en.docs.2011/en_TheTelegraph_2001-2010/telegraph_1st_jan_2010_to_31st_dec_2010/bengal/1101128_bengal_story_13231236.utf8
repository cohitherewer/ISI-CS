	Calcutta, Nov. 27: A co-owner of Mehta Building, which houses the biggest wholesale medicine market in eastern India, was arrested today on charges of neglecting fire safety.         
	Gautam Rajgharia was picked up after a team of police, fire services, CESC and Calcutta Municipal Corporation officials found during an inspection on November 20 that the western part of the building lacked adequate fire-fighting measures.         
	A police officer said Rajgharia had been booked under provisions of the West Bengal Fire Services Act for negligence in maintaining a high-risk high-rise. He said Rajgharia had also been charged with criminal conspiracy.         
	Sources in the fire department said the charges were non-bailable and, clubbed together, invited imprisonment up to five years and penalty ranging from Rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakh.         
	Fire department officials said the western part of the five-storey Mehta Building on Canning Street was owned jointly by Rajgharia, his grandfather Purushottam and uncle Kashinath.        
	Deepak Sarkar, a senior fire department official, said: In August, we had lodged an FIR against Gautam Rajgharia for negligence (in implementing fire-fighting measures).         
	But during our last visit, we noticed that nothing much had been done except for installing trays to hold the bulk of electrical cables that criss-cross the floors on the western side of the building.         
	A police officer said the Rajgharias had been told that there was only one staircase in their portion of the building and that too was stacked with inflammable goods. There is no alternative escape route in case of a fire. But no action was taken, the officer said.         
	The building, which has two wings, houses over 1,000 legal and illegal shops.

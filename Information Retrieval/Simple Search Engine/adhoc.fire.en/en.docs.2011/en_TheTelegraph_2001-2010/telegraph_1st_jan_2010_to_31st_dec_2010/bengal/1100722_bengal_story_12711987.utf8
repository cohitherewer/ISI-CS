          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, July 21: Around 400 villagers ransacked a food department office and broke computers and furniture to protest a delay in the submission process of applications for ration cards in Behrampore town today.        
	The villagers, who had queued up in front of the office at 9.30pm, alleged that the submission process was slow.         
	There were only four counters for 400 people. Matters became worse when one of the officials left his counter on the pretext of drinking water and did not return for an hour.         
	A group of people barged into the office and threw chairs and tables. Others in the queue joined them and the mob hurled computers on the ground. They also overturned almirahs, a police officer said.        
	Some in the mob entered circle inspector Kalyan Kumar Dass office and tried to hit him with a chair. But I was saved as the legs of the chair got stuck in the iron grille of one of the windows, the food department official said.        
	The villagers escaped when the police arrived. However, the food department officials caught two of the protesters and beat them up with broken parts of the chairs. The duo had to be hospitalised.

	Calcutta, June 25: The police brass today rejected new inspector-general (planning) K.L. Tamtas request to the home secretary to let him continue as IG (north Bengal) or put him in the CID or Calcutta police. Tamta is said to have mentioned his good performance in dealing with the hill unrest as a reason for his continued posting in north Bengal.

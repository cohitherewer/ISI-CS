The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | TMC shares CM stage
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      TMC shares CM stage
          AMRITA GHOSH                              Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee (top); Ambika Banerjee				                                 
	Jagatballavpur, Aug. 28: A Trinamul Congress MP today shared a dais with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Howrah at a time Mamata Banerjees party has been boycotting state government events, especially those attended by the chief minister.        
	Howrah MP Ambika Banerjee, 82, skipped a party rally where Mamata was the chief speaker to be part of the foundation stone-laying ceremony for a string of rolling mills being set up by the state government at Jagatballavpur. Small scale industries minister Manab Mukherjee too attended the event.        
	During his 10-minute speech, Ambika said: Although I belong to a different party, we have never opposed development and will not do so in the future. Politics should not come in the way of development.        
	He said there was a lack of proper roads, electricity and drinking water in Howrah.         
	The chief minister assured Ambika that Howrah would be taken care of and said a slew of industries were coming up in the district. The chief minister praised the Trinamul MP for taking an interest in the development of Howrah and called him a man of action.         
	Taking the cue from Bhattacharjee, Mukherjee said: I must congratulate Ambikababu for not opposing development projects. If others follow him, it would be of great help to the people.         
	Mukherjee was probably trying to send a message to Anita Mukherjee, the Trinamul chairperson of the Bidhannagar municipality, and the office-bearers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, who had boycotted meetings called by urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and environment minister Sailen Sarkar to discuss development projects.         
	Though Ambikas participation in a CPM event raised eyebrows within his party, the MP claimed he had done nothing wrong. Here (in Howrah), land had not been forcibly acquired from farmers to set up industries. Our leader (Mamata) is not opposed to development. So, I was right to attend the chief ministers programme, he said.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said: We are not opposed to development. But we dont like to share a platform with the chief minister, who has unleashed terror on our activists across the state. I must enquire why Ambikada attended todays programme.         
	Trinamul sources said Ambika had not informed Mamata about his decision to participate in the event.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Water scuffle in city
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Water scuffle in city
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 30: A group of Taratala residents led by a Trinamul councillor today got involved in a scuffle with engineers repairing an underground pipe that burst on Wednesday causing acute water shortage in the area.         
	The residents first blocked roads in Garden Reach between 9am and 11am after large parts of Behala, Budge Budge and Pujali went without water this morning. Then they complained to Borough 15 chairman Mohammad Iqbal.        
	Iqbal and the protesters then went to Nature Park in Taratala where the pipe was being repaired. Eyewitnesses said Iqbal asked to meet the two chief engineers from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority but they were not present.        
	The residents then got involved in an argument with the junior engineers and a scuffle broke out.        
	The engineers belong to the CPM and they supply water to wards at their discretion, Iqbal alleged.        
	Large swathes of north and central Calcutta also witnessed water shortage today after a power cut at the water treatment plant in Palta yesterday stopped work there.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 10: The state CPM today launched a website to forge links with the people, particularly the youth, and to rebut the canards and calumny against the party and the Left Front government.        
	After launching the website, www.cpimwb.org.in, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said: This website will primarily focus on the Bengal party, its activities and campaigns. It will also contain the partys views on the current situation in the state. Information on the successes of the Left Front government will also figure in this portal.        
	We will invite views and opinions about our party and the government. We will try to reply to those, he added.        
	The website will also have a column that will counter the lies spread by the Trinamul Congress, Bose added.

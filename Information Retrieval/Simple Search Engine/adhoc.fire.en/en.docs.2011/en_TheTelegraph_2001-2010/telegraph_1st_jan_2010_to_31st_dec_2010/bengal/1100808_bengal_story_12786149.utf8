	Calcutta, Aug. 7: A schoolboy was run over and killed by a speeding bus on Lenin Sarani today, following which a mob damaged eight vehicles, including buses, and blocked the busy road for over an hour.        
	Shahbaz Iqbal, 14, was crossing the street near Chandni Chowk at 1.15pm when an autorickshaw suddenly screeched to a halt in front of him. When he tried to step back, the speeding government bus, which was trying to overtake the three-wheeler, mowed him down.        
	Shahbaz, who was returning home from the Calcutta Madrasah Alia at Taltala, was taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	I saw the boy being mowed down by the bus. He was wearing a white shirt and blue trousers, said Md Aslam Ali, a hawker who was selling his wares near the accident site.         
	A mob went on the rampage after three local youths and a police constable took Shahbaz, one of six children of a worker in a slipper factory, to hospital in a taxi.         
	The mob overturned the autorickshaw. They broke the windowpanes of the bus with sticks. However, both the drivers fled. The mob broke windowpanes of at least eight other buses. They also threw stones at a few buses passing by, breaking the windscreen of a couple of them.         
	The protesters also blocked Lenin Sarani from 1.20pm to 2.45pm, bringing traffic to a halt. The police arrived at 1.45pm and dispersed the mob.         
	Traffic was diverted to Jawaharlal Nehru Road during the blockade. Autorickshaws kept off Lenin Sarani after the accident.         
	The protesters blamed unruly autorickshaw drivers for the frequent accidents on the road. They said the drivers had made it a habit to park their vehicles haphazardly. They also alleged that the drivers did not slow down before taking the turn into Lenin Sarani.         
	Every other day, there is an accident on Lenin Sarani. We never see any traffic police personnel here, a local shop owner said.         
	All the autorickshaws on the Lohapol-Dharmatala route keep standing at the crossing of Grant Street and Lenin Sarani, blocking the thoroughfare, he added.        
	At Shahbazs home near CIT Road, his sister Sana was seen weeping inconsolably. I never imagined that my elder brother would die in such a tragic manner. We were waiting for him but he never came back, Sana said, clutching her mother, who was too shocked to speak.

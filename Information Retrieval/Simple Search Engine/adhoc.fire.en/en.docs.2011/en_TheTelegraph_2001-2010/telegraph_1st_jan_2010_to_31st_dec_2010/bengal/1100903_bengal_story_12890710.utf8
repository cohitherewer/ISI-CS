	Burdwan, Sept. 2: A 14-year-old boy died after being allegedly pushed off a running train by three of his friends in Burdwan yesterday.        
	The body of Rafikul Haque was found beside the tracks, 7km from Burdwan station. He had suffered a head injury.        
	One of his three friends, Sheikh Barkat, 18, has been arrested while Sheikh Paltu, 16, and Sheikh Milan, 17, are absconding.        
	Police said Rafikul had beaten up Barkat on August 24. Yesterday, the trio took Rafikul, the son of a glass trader, for a trip to a Rasulpur park.         
	On their way back, they pushed him off a deserted train compartment, a police officer said.

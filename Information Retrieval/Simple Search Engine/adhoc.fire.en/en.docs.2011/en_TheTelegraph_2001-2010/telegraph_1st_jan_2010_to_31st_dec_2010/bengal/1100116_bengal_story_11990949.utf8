          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 15: Mamata Banerjee is likely to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the Raj Bhavan when he goes there for lunch tomorrow.        
	The railway minister will not go to the airport to receive her boss or attend his two programmes in the city because chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will be with him.        
	From the airport, Singh will go to Science City to lay the foundation stone for a science exploration hall. He will go to the Raj Bhavan at 1pm for lunch and leave for St Xaviers College at 3.50 to inaugurate the closing ceremony of its 150-year celebrations.        
	Didi wont be there at the airport, let alone take part in the other programmes. She does not want to be seen with the chief minister, said a Trinamul general secretary.         
	While Singh lunches at the Raj Bhavan, Mamata will lead a march from Subodh Mullick Square to Esplanade, only about 500 metres away, to protest the spate in political violence in Bengal and the price rise, for which she blames the Centre as much as the state government.        
	Asked about Mamatas possible meeting with the Prime Minister, MLA Madan Mitra said: The meeting will materialise only if the Prime Minister gives her time.        
	A Raj Bhavan official said the meeting could be held sometime between the lunch and Singhs departure for St Xaviers.         
	A state Congress delegation will meet the Prime Minister at the Raj Bhavan soon after his arrival there.

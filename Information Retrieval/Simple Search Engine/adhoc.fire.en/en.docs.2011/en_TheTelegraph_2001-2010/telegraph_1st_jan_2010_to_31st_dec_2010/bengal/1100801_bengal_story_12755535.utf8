          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 31: A youth beat up a friend, tied his hands and threw him off Bali bridge into the Hooghly for failing to supply him with a revolver to kill a relative.        
	Police suspect Saurav Dhar, 20, may be dead as his body has not been found yet. The police have arrested Amritpal Singh, who, they claimed, had confessed to throwing Dhar into the river on Thursday.        
	The cops quoted Singh, 21, as telling them: I wanted to kill my uncle with whom I had a long-standing property dispute. I told Dhar about my plan and he said he would arrange a revolver for me. I had given him Rs 90,000 for this purpose three months back. However, he kept dilly-dallying, giving me silly excuses every time I asked him about the weapon.         
	When he asked for Rs 15,000 more this Thursday, I decided to teach him a lesson.        
	The police said Singh asked Dhar, a resident of Belghoria, to come to his house in Dunlop. He then beat up Dhar, tied his hands, took him to Bali bridge and threw him into the Hooghly.        
	Singh, whose late father had a transport business, is yet to tell the police how he took Dhar to Bali. Dhar had passed his higher secondary last year and was pursuing a course for auto mechanics. Singh and Dhar had been friends for the past five years.        
	The police started probing the incident after Dhars father, a retired CESC official, filed a missing persons diary on Thursday.         
	From the call details of Dhars cellphone, we found out that Singh had called him several times on Wednesday and Thursday. However, there were no more calls from Singh since Thursday evening. Dhar has been missing since that time, an officer said at Belghoria police station.         
	The police arrested Singh today. When we put pressure on him, he confessed to have committed the crime, the officer said.        
	The cops are probing whether anyone else was involved in the incident.

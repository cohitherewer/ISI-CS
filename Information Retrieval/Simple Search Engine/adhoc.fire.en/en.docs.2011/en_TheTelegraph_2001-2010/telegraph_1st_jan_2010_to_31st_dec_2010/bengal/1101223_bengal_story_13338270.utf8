The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hospital blame on Centre
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hospital blame on Centre
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: The state government today said work on two proposed AIIMS-like hospitals in the state was stuck because the Centre was yet to respond to its request for additional funds.         
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra today said that when the proposal for the hospitals in Nadias Kalyani and North Dinajpurs Raigunj was signed several years ago, the cost had been estimated at Rs 100 crore. Mishra said the Centre had agreed to pay Rs 80 crore with the state providing the rest.        
	But since then, costs have gone up. We have revised the estimated cost to Rs 150 crore, the health minister told the House. He said he had told the Union health minister on several occasions that more funds were required as the state government could not pay the additional Rs 50 crore.         
	Mishra said the Centre was still silent on the request. Pranab Mukherjee had laid the foundation for the institute at Kalyani in 2004 but construction is yet to begin. Nor has the Raigunj institute taken off.

	Midnapore, Nov. 1: The signboard of the recently inaugurated Jungle Mahal station in West Midnapore was found smeared with black ink this morning.        
	Mamata Banerjee had christened the station Jungle Mahal, scrapping the name earlier planned  Bhadutala, after a nearby village. Local people had protested the move.

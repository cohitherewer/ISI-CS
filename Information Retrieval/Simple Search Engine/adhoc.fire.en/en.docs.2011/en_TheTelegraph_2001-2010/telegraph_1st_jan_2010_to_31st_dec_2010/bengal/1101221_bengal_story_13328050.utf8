          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Dec. 20: Suspected Maoists killed a schoolteacher near Jhargram last night, apparently over his CPM links, and left behind posters branding him a police informer.        
	Kalicharan Mahato, a father of two and a member of the CPM-affiliated All Bengal Primary Teachers Association, was the sixteenth teacher with party links to have been gunned down over the past two years in the rebel-hit West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia.         
	Several teachers have fled their homes after a series of murders of their colleagues.              
	and are now staying in Jhargram town where they believe the threat from the rebels is less.               
	He had just finished dinner at his home in Barokhankri village, which falls in West Midnapores Nayagram area, when there was a knock at the door around 10pm. His wife Bela opened it and saw 12 persons with arms standing outside.        
	They asked him to hand over his motorcycle. But he refused, saying he needed it for going to work, including his Kadamdiha Primary School, Bela, 46, said today.        
	Kalicharan was then dragged out of his house and shot around 50 metres away.         
	Early this morning, his body was found at the spot. Next to it were two posters saying spies who work for police will be given the ultimate punishment.        
	Several teachers have fled their village homes and are now staying in Jhargram town where they believe the threat from the rebels is less. In some cases, teachers have been gunned down in front of the students. In the last such killing, Dibakar Mahato was shot in his school near Jhargram on September 4.

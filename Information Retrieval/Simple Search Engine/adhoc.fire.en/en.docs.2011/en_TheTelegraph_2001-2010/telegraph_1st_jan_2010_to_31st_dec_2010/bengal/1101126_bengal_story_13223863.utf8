The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM safety guidelines in rebel zone 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM safety guidelines in rebel zone 
          PRONAB MONDAL                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 25: Alimuddin Street today issued safety guidelines for party leaders in Maoist-affected areas of West Midnapore after suffering five casualties at the hands of rebels there last week.         
	The party had issued a similar set of dos and donts to ground-level workers in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia before the panchayat polls in 2008.         
	The earlier guidelines were not for the party activists in Salboni, Goaltore, Sarenga and Lalgarh as they were CPM strongholds at that time, a CPM leader in West Midnapore said. But this time, we have concentrated on the Jungle Mahal areas of the district as Maoists drove out our men from there last year and also killed many of our comrades.        
	In the guidelines issued today, local leaders have been asked not to move alone. We have been told to move in groups so that we can retaliate if Maoists attack us, a CPM leader in Salboni said.        
	Police sources, however, said by groups, the directive suggested that the leaders should take along armed cadres lodged in camps in Jungle Mahal. A source said: The cadres, with pistols and revolvers tucked under their shirts, will form a security ring around the leaders. They will fire back if the rebels attack the leaders.        
	The cadres cannot carry big guns and rifles openly as they belong to a mainstream political party. That is why they will carry small arms.        
	The advisory says the local leaders should not maintain a daily routine. Said a West Midnapore leader: We have been asked not to stay in our homes at night. We have been advised to keep changing the places where we stay at night.        
	Explaining the reason behind this, the leader said Maoists had dragged party activists out of their homes at night and shot them dead.         
	The guidelines also suggest that the leaders should not take the same route while passing through jungles.         
	Another leader said the rebels often waited for their targets as the routes of the CPM leaders had become predictable.         
	The leader added: All the five party leaders slain last week had been waylaid. So we have been asked to avoid frequently taking the shortest routes to our destinations. We will use alternative routes even if it amounts to taking a detour.        
	Maoists sources in Salboni, however, said the CPM guidelines would not be of any help to the leaders. The local people are with us. They will inform us about the CPM leaders whereabouts, a rebel said.

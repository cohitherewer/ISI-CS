	Behrampore, Dec. 15: Passengers on a train from Howrah ransacked a station tonight after it was delayed so that an extra coach could be attached for rail officers returning from Mamata Banerjees event in Sagardighi.        
	The incident occurred at Azimganj station, near Sagardighi, where the 3465 Howrah-Malda Intercity Express rolled in around 8pm. Furniture at the station was damaged and windowpanes smashed.        
	The train, which had left Howrah at 3.15am, was scheduled to stop at the station for only two minutes but was held up there for over an hour as the staff were busy fixing the special coach meant for railway officers.         
	The officials were returning to Malda from where they had come earlier in the day for the programme.        
	The Malda-bound express was delayed further as station staff gave clearance to another train  this one a special one carrying railway officials more senior to those assigned to travel in the coach attached to Intercity  before.        
	The express finally left the station around 10 tonight. It had to travel another two and hours to reach its final destination.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rs 2 lakh dole for capsize 70
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 24: The state cabinet today decided to pay a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to families of the 70 feared dead in the trawler tragedy at Kakdwip last month.        
	Eighty-three bodies have been recovered so far. The government had earlier announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to the families of the dead.         
	The state cabinet today decided to pay a one-time compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the family of each of those missing in the tragedy, said Soumendranath Bera, the minister of state for information and cultural affairs.         
	The trawler carrying 246 people had capsized in the Hooghly near Kakdwip on October 30.         
	An official at Writers Buildings said: The announcement of compensation to the families of those missing has come less than a month after the incident. This is rare in Bengal. He said the declaration was possibly made with an eye on next years Assembly polls.         
	Bera said the families of the five people killed in MiG crashes in north Bengal in the past few months would also be paid Rs 2 lakh in compensation.

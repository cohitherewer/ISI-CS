The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Railways in strike ambit
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Railways in strike ambit
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 4: Maoists have called a two-day bandh starting July 7 but unlike before, have decided not to spare the railways.         
	The nationwide bandh has been called to protest the death of top Maoist leader Azad at the hands of security forces in Andhra Pradesh.         
	A recorded message, purportedly by Maoist leader Kishan, today announced the bandh.         
	We will not spare the railways from our agenda. We apologise to people in advance (for the inconvenience) and advise them not to board trains on these two days, the audio message said.        
	Azad was representing our organisation for the peace talks proposed by the Centre through Swami Agnivesh. He was going to Dandakaranya to discuss the matter with our leaders (when he was shot dead). His killing proves the governments proposal was an eyewash, the audio message added.         
	Following the purported message by Kishan, senior South Eastern Railway officials are reviewing security in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia. Trains bound for western India pass through these stretches, a rebel hotbed.         
	The officials said today that passenger trains would run according to schedule during the daytime.         
	However, the railways have decided to extend the bar on night trains on the Kharagpur-Rourkela and Kharagpur-Adra sections till July 9. The restriction had been imposed after the Jnaneswari Express tragedy in May that killed 150 people.         
	A South Eastern Railway official said security would be beefed up in order to prevent a Jnaneswari-like sabotage. Patrolling of tracks will be intensified, the official added.        
	Police and intelligence branch (IB) officials have been asked to intensify vigil in the villages close to the tracks.        
	We have been asked to conduct raids in all these villages with the help of the central forces. The arterial roads leading to the villages have been brought under the scanner, a police officer in West Midnapore said.

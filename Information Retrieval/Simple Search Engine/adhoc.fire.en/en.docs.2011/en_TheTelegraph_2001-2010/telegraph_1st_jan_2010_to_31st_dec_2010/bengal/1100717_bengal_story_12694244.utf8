	Behrampore, July 16: Members of the Trinamul Congress and Congress-backed unions today clashed at Behrampores Krishnanath College over admissions to BA and BSc courses.         
	The union members fought with iron rods and bamboo sticks, accusing each other of influencing the admission process to let in freshers, bypassing the merit list.         
	The students also smashed chairs. At least five of them were injured. Admission-seekers and their guardians panicked as the 154-year-old college turned into a battlefield.         
	Principal Somesh Das said: Police had to be called to disperse the fighting students. He said the admission process would continue.         
	Todays clash, which came a few days after a Youth Congress team was attacked by Trinamul supporters near Khejuri, could further embarrass the allies.

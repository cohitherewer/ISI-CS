The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | One arrest, many anxieties
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      One arrest, many anxieties
          BISWANATH ROY                                             
	Purulia, April 23: The residents of a cluster of hamlets in Purulia, official witnesses to the sensational arms-drop from an aircraft on December 17, 1995, see a ray of hope as well as despair in the Copenhagen arrest of alleged mastermind Kim Peter Davy and his possible extradition to India.        
	Their hope lies in the belief that Davys arrest could finally bring to an end the case over which they have had to face endless police questioning and appear in courts on countless occasions. They also hope that the extradition of Davy will bring along with it the answers to a host of unanswered questions about an incident that had traumatised their lives, at least for sometime.         
	But there is despair, too, at the possibility of Davys extradition to India. Ever since the release in 2004 of Peter Bleach, the British citizen involved in the arms-drop, they have stopped making the arduous journeys to courts, both in Purulia as well as Calcutta.         
	But now, suddenly for them, the CBI appears set to reopen the case. They fear that they will once again be dragged to court to depose as the official witnesses to the arms-drop.         
	Davy alias Niels Christian Nielsen alias Niels Holck, who has been a fugitive since he and his associates dropped a cache of weapons from a plane over Purulia, was arrested in Copenhagen on April 9.        
	Thirty-three-year-old Subhas Tantubai of Ganudi village was one of the first persons to report the arms-drop to Jhalda police station.         
	Although it was late at ni- ght, he had set off for the police station with Tarit Banerjee of Khatunga village. There, he had narrated how the crates of AK-47 rifles and rocket-propelled grenades had come floating down in parachutes before crashing to the ground.        
	I was inside my hut wh- en the arms started dropping from the sky, said Tantubai, who makes a living giving tuition. When I heard loud thuds, I rushed to see what was happening. Then I saw the arms sticking out from some of the crates. I realised instantly that something was wrong and I knew that I had to rush to the police.        
	Tantubai had hoped that in rushing to inform the police he was doing a service to the nation and that he would be rewarded for it. Instead, what followed was an ordeal, he said, sitting in his mud house.         
	For years, I received summons from the courts to depose before them since I was an official witness, having recorded with the police whatever I had seen. First, I had to go to the Purulia district court and then travel all the way to Calcutta. Thankfully that has stopped now.        
	In nearby Khatunga, 40- year-old Mrityunjay Singh has not heard of Davys arrest. Told about it, the first question he asked was: So will the case start all over again? Do I have to go to the courts again?        
	December 17, 1995, was the saddest day in Singhs life, for that day his son had died in an accident. He was up till late at night and saw the Antonov An26 enter the Purulia sky and approach the village.        
	I could see the aircrafts lights and since it was flying low, the sound was very loud, Singh recounted. Then the crates started dropping. I thought one of them would fall on my hut and destroy it. Luckily, that did not happen.        
	Like Tantubai, Singh reported it to the police and thereafter began his journeys to the courts. I hope Im never called to the courts again, he said. Ive done enough.        
	But for Acharya Muktanand Avadoot, the rector master of the global headquarters of the Ananda Marg, Davys arrest might finally clear the air on the mysterious arms-drop. The police suspect that the consignment may have been meant for the Margis since it fell very close to their headquarters.

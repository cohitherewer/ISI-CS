The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Staple shock: State stares at rice shortfall
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Staple shock: State stares at rice shortfall
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 9: Bengal may appear hungry for political change but if it wants enough rice, the plate looks only half full.        
	Rice production in the state will fall below demand for the first time in five years because of the poor monsoon, the government said today, raising the spectre of soaring prices for millions already reeling from high food costs. Also, the production is likely to be below target for the second consecutive year.        
	A meeting of the agriculture, irrigation and related departments was held at Writers Buildings this afternoon to review the anticipated output fall in the recently concluded aman and the upcoming boro seasons.        
	Production in the 2010 season is likely to be 124 lakh tonnes, down from 138 lakh tonnes in 2009. Against a demand of 133 lakh tonnes, the shortfall in the summer aman crop being harvested now  has been put at 15 lakh tonnes. In the boro crop, heavily dependent on irrigation, the gap is estimated at 9 lakh tonnes.        
	Our annual target in rice production is 148 lakh tonnes. We are likely to fall short of it by 24 lakh tonnes (both seasons), agriculture minister Naren De said.        
	De said that the deficit of the aman season was earlier expected to be partially made up in the boro season, as the yield per hectare of the boro crop is 3.3 tonnes against the 2.5 tonnes of the aman crop. That no longer looks possible. But the minister held out what looks like a silver lining. Its only a preliminary estimate, the actual deficit could be less.        
	Irrigation minister Subhas Naskar, also present at the meeting, said the monsoon misery  which had forced the state to declare drought-like conditions in 11 of its 19 districts  had left its rivers with less water than usual.         
	We will get little or no water from the Mayurakshi and the Kangshabati for the boro crop. The Damodar Valley Corporation will not be able to give us more water, Naskar said. The Damodar flows through Burdwan  dubbed the states rice bowl.        
	The focus is now shifting to alternative crops. We are telling farmers to opt for corn, moong, nuts and maize (which require less water) to minimise losses, said De.

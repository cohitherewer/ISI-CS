	Bolpur, Aug. 5: A Bolpur court today allowed the CBI to stop probing the theft of Tagores Nobel medal from Visva-Bharati in 2004.    
	The investigating agency had said they had failed to make any progress in the case because of lack of clues.        
	Siliguri: A real estate developer in Siliguri was found dead at his office on Thursday with a bullet injury in his head. A pistol was found lying beside the body of Tapan Jha, 42. Jhas family alleged that he had been killed by his business partner Gurdeep Singh. Singh had been allegedly threatening Jha to return the money he owed him. Police have, however, not ruled out suicide.        
	Calcutta: The CPM has urged the chief electoral officer to ensure that the names of fictitious voters are struck off the electoral rolls. More than 56 lakh people have applied to have their names included in the electoral list. We fear that many illegal names might find their way into the voter list, said Rabin Deb, state secretariat member of the CPM who attended an all-party meeting convened by chief electoral officer Sunil Gupta on Thursday.        
	Calcutta: Calcutta High Court on Thursday asked the CBI why it was not willing to have the Jnaneswari Express sabotage case conducted through videoconference. The agency had submitted a petition to the high court requesting that the case be shifted from a Jhargram court to a one in Calcutta for security reasons.         
	Midnapore: A labourer who was shot in the jaw by Maoists at a West Midnapore village walked 15km to a health centre on Thursday.

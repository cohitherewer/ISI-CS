The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Birth in berth for Baby Mamata 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Birth in berth for Baby Mamata 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mithu with her daughter at a Purulia hospital. (Mita Roy)                                  
	Purulia, Nov. 17: Purushottam Express had a ticketless passenger by the time it reached Purulia and she goes by the name Mamata.        
	Before the CPM jumps to its feet with an aha!, spare a thought for Baby Mamata, born at 6.55pm on Tuesday in S9.        
	Mithu Mahato gave birth to the bundle of joy on the train a little after she went into labour as the New Delhi-Puri Purushottam Express chugged into Purulia station yesterday.         
	Co-passengers screened her with saris and bedsheets as a doctor and a nurse supervised the delivery. Mithu and her husband Brindavan named their daughter after the railway minister out of gratefulness to her departments alacrity that ensured the delivery was safe.         
	Mithu, 25, who was in the ninth month of her pregnancy, was returning from Delhi with her husband to give birth in her native Sindri village in Purulias Barabazar. Mithu, who is employed with a private company, lives with Brindavan in Gurgaon.        
	The couple had boarded the train from New Delhi on Monday and were supposed to reach Purulia around 6.40pm yesterday. But when the train reached Koderma around 5pm, Mithu started having pains.        
	Brindavan, a security guard in Gurgaon, said he initially thought Mithu was feeling sick because she did not have a good nights sleep. But when the pain increased, my wife realised she had gone into labour, Brindavan said.        
	I immediately informed the travelling ticket examiner (TTE), Srinivas Rao, he said. Rao advised me to get off with Mithu at Bokaro. He said he would make arrangements for a safe delivery there.        
	But when the pain subsided after some time, Brindavan said he thought it would be better to go to Purulia. I told Rao and he asked the train superintendent to inform the station manager of Purulia, he said.        
	Purulia station manager S.P. Majumdar alerted railway doctors and nurses. He arranged for a car to take the expecting mother to Purulia district hospital, about 3km from the station.         
	However, as the train reached the station, Mithus labour pain relapsed. By the time the medical team rushed into the coach (S9), the woman had already begun to deliver the baby, Majumdar said.        
	The cubicle in which the couple were travelling was turned into a labour room. Two women travelling to Puri and a nurse screened Mithus berth with saris and bedsheets.         
	Congratulations, its a girl, the doctor announced to cheers from other passengers. Mithu was taken to the Purulia district hospital where doctors declared both mother and daughter healthy. The doctors said the baby weighed 3.2kg. The couple have a five-year-old daughter.         
	On October 6 last year, a woman had delivered a child in the toilet of the Tata-Chhapra Express when it was pulling out of Purulia station. The baby had slipped through the hole and fallen on the tracks. Rinku Devi Rai, 30, from Orissa, had leapt out of the train, which was moving slowly, and found her baby without a scratch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM resist pill to fight Trinamul
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM resist pill to fight Trinamul
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 1: Three years ago, Brinda Karat had prescribed Dum Dum Dawai for Opposition politicians in Bengal. Today, her party colleague Biman Bose suggested a similar dose, though not in such strictly physical terms.        
	The Bengal CPM leadership, including state secretary Bose, has apparently decided to ask comrades not only to protest but also resist the onslaught and anarchy of the Trinamul Congress across the state, sources said.        
	The Trinamul Congress and the Maoists are creating anarchy in the state. They are bent on doing so till next years Assembly elections. Our party workers have been protesting such activities over the past few months. But mere protest wont do. We want all our comrades to build a stiff resistance against the Opposition, particularly Trinamul, Biman Bose was quoted as saying at todays state committee meeting.        
	The CPM state secretary is believed to have said at the meeting that our men should be asked to mobilise people in their areas fearlessly.        
	On November 4, 2007, Brinda had suggested Dum Dum Dawai  a slogan of the sixties advocating public thrashing for the corrupt  for Opposition politicians whom she blamed for the continuing trouble in Nandigram. Although she did not name Mamata Banerjee, who had led the anti-land acquisition movement in the state, she left little doubt about who the subject of her diagnosis was.        
	A week later, CPM cadres recaptured Nandigram in a bomb-and-bullet attack.         
	At the state committee meeting today, party officials from various districts told the leadership that their processions and rallies had generated a positive response from the people, particularly in areas rocked by Trinamul terror. A source quoted a delegate as saying: The people are coming out of their homes and spontaneously joining our rallies.        
	A leader of the Burdwan unit said after the meeting that hundreds of people were participating in CPM events to express solidarity with the party. The state committee is of the opinion that the need of the hour is to mobilise the people who are returning to the party fold by making them resist and confront Opposition vandalism.         
	Bose, however, cautioned the leaders that the turnaround, mostly in the villages, should not make them complacent.        
	Our workers should increase their connect with the poor people, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the minorities. They will have to be won over. The ground realities may have started favouring us but theres no room for complacency, a source quoted Bose as saying at the meeting.        
	A section of party leaders believes that it is too premature to talk about revival as a big chunk of the rank and file in many districts has deserted the CPM after the successive poll debacles.         
	The party has lined up a series of protest meetings from November 24 to 30 at the Metro Channel in Esplanade.        
	The party has also planned the following programmes for its comeback:        
	Workers will have to make door-to-door visits and interact with the people to explain the partys stand on issues affecting them.        
	The political situation in the state will have to be highlighted through street-corner meetings.        
	CPM workers and the partys mass organisations will have to actively take part in the campaigns.        
	The CPMs resistance plan drew a sharp response from Trinamul. Party MLA Subrata Bakshi said: The CPM has stooped too low in confronting and resisting our party instead of fighting us politically. If the party plans to confront us, it will be further alienated from the masses.

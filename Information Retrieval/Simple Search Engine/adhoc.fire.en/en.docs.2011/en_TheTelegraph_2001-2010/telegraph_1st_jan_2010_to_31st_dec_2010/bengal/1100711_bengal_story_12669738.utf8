          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Tanmoy Das at his Durgapur home on Saturday. (Gour Sharma)                                  
	Durgapur, July 10: A four-year-old boy bit and injured his tongue out of nervousness after being detained for an hour at his Durgapur school yesterday because his father was 15 minutes late in picking him up.         
	The authorities claimed it was the rule to detain students if their guardians did not come on time.         
	Tanmoy Das, a nursery student, was confined for an hour in an empty classroom at Aurobindo Vidyamandir, run by the Jadavpur University Alumni Association, after his classes ended at 11.45am.        
	When Tanmoys father Goutam Das, who owns a small almirah-manufacturing unit, argued with the school principal that it was not his sons fault that he had arrived late, he was asked to leave the school compound and stand outside.        
	According to our rules, we detain students for at least an hour if their guardians fail to arrive within five minutes of the classes ending. Tanmoys father came at least 15 minutes late. So we detained his son. We inform guardians about this rule at the time of admission, said Suhas Bhattacharya, the secretary of the schools managing committee.         
	Bhattacharya said the rule was made because the school had only one gatekeeper and it was impossible for him to open the gate again and again.         
	We wait for five minutes and close the gate. The guardians should be punctual or it will harm school discipline, the official said.         
	The school, affiliated to the CISCE, opens its gates thrice between 11.45am and 1.25pm. The nursery classes end at 11.45am, the kindergarten classes at 12.50pm and Classes I to X at 1.25pm.         
	Goutam said he usually picked up his son at 11.45am but had been late yesterday as he was tanking up his motorcycle. I got delayed because I had to wait for 10 minutes at the petrol pump, which is around half a kilometre from my home. I tried to explain to principal Aditi Ghosh but she refused to listen, he alleged         
	My son had only a glass of milk and two biscuits before leaving for school around 7.30am yesterday. His classes begin at 8.30am. He takes only a bar of chocolate to school. I told the principal that Tanmoy had not eaten for a long time and pleaded with her to release him. But instead of letting him go, she rapped me for not giving my son a heavy breakfast, Goutam said.         
	Tanmoy was allowed to leave at 12.50pm. He was traumatised and kept silent. He had bitten his tongue and also suffered mouth injuries. We took him to a doctor, Tanmoys mother Moon Moon said.        
	Goutam has lodged a police complaint against the principal. Rezaul Kabir, the officer-in-charge of Durgapur police station, said the police were looking into the matter.        
	P.C. Sarkar, the doctor who treated Tanmoy, said: The child bit his tongue out of nervousness and fear. I have advised rest for three days.        
	A senior state education department official said: We cannot take action unless we receive a formal complaint from the students family because the school is affiliated to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations.

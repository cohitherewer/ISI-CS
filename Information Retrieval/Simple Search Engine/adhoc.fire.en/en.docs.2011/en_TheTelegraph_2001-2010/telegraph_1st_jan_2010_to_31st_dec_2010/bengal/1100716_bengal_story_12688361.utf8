          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 15: Bye-bye took a break and bluster took centre-stage in the Assembly today.        
	A day after industries minister Nirupam Sen joined the CPM band singing the partys dirge, cabinet colleague Asok Bhattacharya announced in the House that his party would bounce back before next years Assembly polls.         
	We will not sit in the Opposition after the Assembly polls. We will once again occupy the treasury benches after 2011. Just wait and see, the municipal and urban affairs minister told the House.         
	There was a message for the Opposition too. You can win the polls once by riding the wave of change but not always, he said. With the Trinamul Congress and the Congress staying away from the House in the second session, there was nobody to contest Bhattacharyas claims.         
	Bhattacharya told the Opposition that people would not forgive them if they did not co-operate with the state government. Let good sense prevail on them. I want the Opposition to collaborate with the state government, rising above politics to carry out development work in civic bodies across Bengal, he said.

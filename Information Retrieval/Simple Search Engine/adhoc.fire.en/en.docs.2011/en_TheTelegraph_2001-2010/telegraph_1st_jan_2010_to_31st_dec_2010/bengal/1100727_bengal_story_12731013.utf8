The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Monthly oil dole in bank
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Monthly oil dole in bank
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, July 26: The state government today announced a Re 1 subsidy on each litre of diesel bought by bus, minibus and taxi operators to give relief to transporters and avoid the unpopular step of increasing fares.        
	The decision follows the Centres move to hike petro prices in June. In Calcutta, the post-hike retail price of diesel comes to Rs 39.94.        
	After introducing the appropriation bill in the Assembly, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta said: People were concerned about a possible increase in transport fares after the Centre raised fuel prices. Therefore, we have decided to offer a subsidy to transporters by depositing Re 1 in their bank accounts for every litre of diesel they buy. This would give them some relief.        
	He added: This has also been done to ensure that bus fares remain unchanged. The new system will take effect from August 1.        
	However, the government has decided to limit the subsidy to 20 litres of diesel bought for a taxi, and 50 litres bought for a bus or a minibus, each day.         
	We have spoken to transporters and unions and found out that the average daily consumption of diesel by a taxi is 20 litres and that by a bus or minibus is 50 litres, Dasgupta said.        
	The governments decision will translate into a monthly dole of Rs 600 for taxi owners and Rs 1,500 for bus and minibus owners.         
	The finance minister said the subsidy would be deposited in the transporters bank accounts at the end of each month by the public vehicles department (PVD) in Calcutta and the regional transport authorities (RTAs) in the districts.         
	Dasgupta said the governments annual bill for running the reimbursement system, unique to Bengal, will be Rs 110 crore.        
	The state government would have earned Rs 68 crore in a year from the central hike in fuel prices. Instead, the subsidy will force it to not only forgo the entire amount but also to contribute an additional Rs 42 crore from its own coffers.        
	Had the state government reduced diesel prices by Re 1 by slashing sales tax, instead of offering the subsidy that is only meant for those in the public transport business, it would have lost Rs 215 crore in revenues.         
	However, the new system will involve bureaucratic hassles as the PVD and the RTAs will have to be separately assigned the task of depositing the subsidy every month in the transporters accounts.         
	There are around 9,000 buses, 1,500 minibuses and 40,000 taxis in Calcutta alone, their sheer numbers indicating the amount of paperwork and account maintenance that would be needed.        
	Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate, said the union was not happy with the subsidy. The price of diesel has gone up by Rs 6 in the past year. So the Re 1 subsidy is clearly inadequate, he said.        
	The taxi operators union, however, refused comment though sources said the general mood was of satisfaction.        
	The state government has also waived the 4 per cent tax on kerosene. A litre of kerosene will now cost 45 to 48 paise less. The relief would cost the state exchequer Rs 50 crore.        
	Asked whether the government had any plans to reduce petrol prices or extend the subsidy to diesel used for irrigation, Dasgupta said: Our plan was to give relief to the transport sector. So, at the moment, we dont have any other plans. The financial impact of a relief has to be calculated before taking any step.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, June 10: The CBI today officially took over the Jnaneswari Express derailment case from the CID with sources in the central investigating agency claiming that there was enough evidence of Maoist involvement in the train sabotage.         
	A four-member CBI team, led by joint-director Keshav Kumar Rao, went to the CID headquarters at Bhawani Bhavan today and collected evidence, CDs and documents.         
	The CDs contain recordings of telephone conversations of Bapi Mahato and Umakanta Mahato, the main accused in the case.        
	The CBI team was also handed over the statements of 25 witnesses, passengers and railway staff as well as physical evidence like Pandrol clips and ballast stones collected from the sabotage site.         
	The CBI also lodged an FIR in a Jhargram court today. The FIR is based on the version of the incident given by B.K. Das, the driver of the derailed Jnaneswari Express. The CBI will also seek the handover of Khagen Mahato and Samir Mahato, who were arrested by the CID for their alleged involvement in the sabotage.

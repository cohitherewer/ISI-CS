          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              (Top) Rajiv Gandhi addresses a rally in Contai on October 31, 1984, the day Indira Gandhi was assassinated. Nilima Sen had seen Rajiv on that day in Midnapore town. Twenty-six years on, her granddaughter Puja (below) scans the skies through a pair of binoculars as she waits to catch a glimpse of Rahul Gandhi, who visited Garbeta in West Midnapore on Thursday.

	Calcutta, Sept. 16: Rahul Gandhi today said the UPA governments allies, including the Trinamul Congress, were one on the land acquisition bill and only the proportion of land to be acquired by the government had to be agreed upon.        
	It is not a matter of changing the land acquisition act. The general view on the land bill is that we are one on it. The difference among us is what percentage (of land) the government will acquire. Its a question of whether 70, 80 or 90 per cent is to be acquired by private companies. As for the rest, theres no difficulty at all, the Congress leader said at a news conference at a city hotel this morning.        
	Citing the Haryana model of land acquisition, Rahul said people losing land would have to be given the opportunity of sharing the benefits that prospective investors would reap from a project.        
	We are trying to get a new bill on the land policy. The Haryana model shows that people can share benefits that a project will give to a potential investor. We cannot allow the transfer of land from the poor to the rich people without giving the benefits to the poor, Rahul said.        
	He said land needed to be acquired for setting up infrastructure but underlined the need for a fair procedure. You need to acquire land for constructing roads and infrastructure. That has to be done. But the benefits have to be given to those losing land. Let us be fair in acquisition. If you make a policy fair, the poor will respond.        
	According to the Haryana model, a farmer whose land is acquired gets an annuity that increases every year for a fixed period in addition to the market price of the land.         
	The amended land reforms bill is yet to see the light of day mainly because of Mamata Banerjees opposition. The Trinamul chief is against a government role in land acquisition if the purchase is for private players.        
	Our leader wants an exit clause to be introduced in the bill to ensure that land is returned to the losers if the intended project doesnt work out. Mamatadi favours a fresh land bill rather than an amended one, a Trinamul MLA said.         
	Asked about his opposition to the Vedanta project in Orissas Niyamgiri, Rahul said land had been taken forcibly and the process was illegal.        
	Its not a question of siding with the tribals of Niyamgiri. Tribals and Dalits have not been given their due by the system. At Niyamgiri, the company had taken land forcibly. When you take land from tribals, you should sign up with the panchayats but that was not done. What happened there was illegal, wrong and criminal, Rahul said.

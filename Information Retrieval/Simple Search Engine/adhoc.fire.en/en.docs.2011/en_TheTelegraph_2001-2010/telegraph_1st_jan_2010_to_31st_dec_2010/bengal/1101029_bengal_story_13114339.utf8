          OUR BUREAU                              
	Siliguri, Oct. 28: An engineering student has committed suicide after her boyfriend purportedly circulated a video clip of their private moments among friends through MMS. The police had allegedly sat tight even after the girl lodged an FIR a month ago.        
	Anindya Garai, who is absconding, had also uploaded the video clip of his intimate moments with the girl, a 21-year-old second-year student of civil engineering at Siliguri Polytechnic Institute, on the Internet.         
	The FIR lodged by the girl, who hanged herself yesterday at her home in Siliguris Pati Colony, claims Anindya, a third-year architecture student at the same college, had earlier threatened to make the video clip public if she ended her relationship with him.         
	The two were in a relationship. Earlier this year, Anindya, who hails from Bankura, had taken the girl to a private hostel in Dabgram where he used to live. Dabgram is near their college. The boy recorded a video clip of the two in a compromising position and is suspected to have circulated it among friends in the college, said Gaurav Sharma, the additional superintendent of police of Siliguri.         
	The clip had been uploaded on some websites. We are trying to remove it in consultation with appropriate authorities.         
	The girls father runs a grocery in Pati Colony. The family declined comment but neighbours and representatives of students unions at the college accused the police of lackadaisical attitude.         
	The girl came to know about the MMS last month. On September 18, she lodged the FIR, said Sheikh Mukhtar Ahmed, secretary of the Chhatra Parishad, the students wing of the Congress.        
	The FIR lodged by the girl reads: When I refused to carry on the relationship, he (Anindya) threatened that he would make the video clip public. Within the next few days, I found that it had been circulated among students in my college. I find it difficult to go on living now and if no steps are taken against him, I will have no option but to commit suicide.

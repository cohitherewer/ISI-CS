The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | No crowd? Minister is only helping
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      No crowd? Minister is only helping
  - How Kanti saved police at marathon        SUBHAJOY ROY                           Arun Bhardwaj (in red) runs at the 24-hour marathon that began on Saturday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Calcutta, Dec. 4: A CPM minister today extended police a favour his rally-happy party has not done: he gave the force respite from crowd management.         
	The unsolicited help from sports minister Kanti Ganguly, though, came at a time the Calcutta police commissioner was ruing the dearth of people at what the organisers claimed was a 24-hour marathon.        
	 I have helped you by not arranging for thousands of participants, Ganguly told Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti before flagging off the run near the Netaji Indoor Stadium this afternoon.        
	The events organisers claimed that Arun Bhardwaj, 41, a central government employee and Indias leading ultra-marathoner, would run non-stop for 24 hours across the city, covering 200km. The other participants could quit whenever they wanted, sources said.        
	But not many joined Bhardwaj today. The 50-odd people who started out with him were mostly policemen.        
	Speaking before the flag-off, Chakrabarti resented the lack of public interest in the event and said the organisers  a private hospital and a realtor  should have ensured that more people ran alongside Arun in this historic event.        
	Ganguly, whose party has organised many a traffic-crippling rally  the latest being a seven-day reach-out programme at the Metro Channel  had an answer for him. There is so much congestion on the roads of the city, so many traffic snarls every day! Thousands of people running through the roads would have made the situation worse.         
	The minister also had words of sympathy for the police, who have the unenviable job of ensuring order during rallies. There is too much pressure on your men to clear the roads and ensure smooth traffic, he told Chakrabarti, who nodded in agreement.         
	Something or the other is always taking place on Calcuttas roads... they never remain free, said Ganguly, who himself organised a rally at Rani Rashmoni Avenue yesterday.        
	This evening, the minister waxed eloquent about the big crowd at yesterdays event, oblivious of the traffic snarls it caused.

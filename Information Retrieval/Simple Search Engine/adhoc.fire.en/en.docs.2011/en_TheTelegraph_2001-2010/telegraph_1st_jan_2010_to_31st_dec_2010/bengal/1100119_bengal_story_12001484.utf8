The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Firing on Puja extortion gang
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Firing on Puja extortion gang
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A bullet found from the clash site. (Gour Sharma)                                  
	Durgapur, Jan. 18: Central Industrial Security Force jawans today allegedly opened fire on villagers who stoned them when asked not to collect money from IISCO Steel Plant-bound trucks at Burnpur.        
	Ramesh Bauri, 23, took a bullet in his stomach. At the Asansol Subdivisional Hospital, his condition was said to be critical.        
	An officer of the force claimed that the jawans had fired in the air but police said Bauri was injured in the CISF firing.        
	A group was stopping trucks about 200 metres from the plants gate and forcibly coll- ecting money, apparently for Saraswati Puja and the renovation of a Shiv temple, when a CISF patrol arrived around noon. Seven jawans stepped out and asked the Barodighri residents to disperse but they refused, arguing that the trucks were being charged only between Rs 10 and Rs 20.         
	An altercation started and the village youths were joined by others armed with stones and sticks.         
	When the CISF jeeps windows were smashed, the jawans sought reinforcements. About 50 of their colleagues rushed out of the plant with rifles and batons but the mob had swelled to a few hundred by then.        
	After a futile baton charge, the jawans opened fire. Quiet descended all of a sudden as Ramesh slumped to the ground and the villagers fled.         
	The jawans left after a team arrived from Hirapur police station, 3km away.        
	The villagers have lodged an FIR against the CISF. They pounced on us without any provocation. We were asking for chanda from truck drivers but we were not collecting money forcibly. They beat us up mercilessly. Even women were not spared, said Arun Bauri, 25, one of those stopping trucks.        
	CISF deputy commandant D.K. Sarkar said the jawans had confronted villagers extorting money from trucks entering our plant. We were attacked with stones when we tried to stop it. We fired in the air after eight of our men were hit.         
	Asansol additional superintendent of police Prasun Banerjee said: The CISF fired six to seven rounds and Ramesh Bauri was injured in the firing. We are looking into the circumstances that led to the firing.

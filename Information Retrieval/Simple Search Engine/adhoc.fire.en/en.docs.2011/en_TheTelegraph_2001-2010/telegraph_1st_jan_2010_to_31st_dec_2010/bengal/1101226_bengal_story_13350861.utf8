          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, Dec. 25: The bodies of two school students who had been missing since December 21 have been fished out of the Hooghly in Serampore since last night with a friend saying the duo, who did not know swimming, drowned while bathing.         
	Fishermen recovered the body of Kakalakshmi Rati Rao, a Class IX student, last night while Class VIII student Gaurav Kumar Singhs body was found this morning.         
	Kakalakshmi, 15, and Gaurav, 14, who used to stay in the same housing complex in Serampore, had gone to a nearby ghat with common friend and neighbour Ranjan Kumar Singh, 16.         
	The trio had left home at 2pm on Tuesday. None of them had told their parents that they were going to Surkhi ghat. While Kakalakshmi, a student of Assembly of Little Bird school, had told his parents he was going for tuition, Gaurav and Ranjan said they were going out with friends.         
	However, when Kakalakshmi and Gaurav, a student of Rishra Vidyapith, did not return till Wednesday morning, their parents informed police.         
	Ranjan, who had returned home on Tuesday afternoon but concealed the incident form his parents, told them on Wednesday morning that his friends had drowned while bathing.         
	He told his parents that Kakalakshmi and Gaurav, who did not know swimming, were swept away by the current while he was saved by fishermen.        
	Ranjan said the three of them often used to go to Surkhi ghat to either bathe in the river or play on the banks.        
	After the police failed to arrange for divers to search for the missing students, their parents requested local fishermen for help.         
	The bloated bodies of Kakalakshmi and Gaurav were found floating near Jagannath ghat and Wellington Jute Mill jetty, respectively, both within a kilometre of Surkhi ghat.         
	Tathagata Pandey, the inspector in charge of Serampore police station, said he did not suspect any foul play.

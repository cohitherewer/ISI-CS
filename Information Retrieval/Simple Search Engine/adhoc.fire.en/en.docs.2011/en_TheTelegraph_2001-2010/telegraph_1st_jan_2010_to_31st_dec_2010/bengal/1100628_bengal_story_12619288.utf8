The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sonia changes skipper in state
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Sonia changes skipper in state
  - Manas at helm for smooth Mamata ties        OUR BUREAU                          Manas Bhuniya                                        
	June 27: Sonia Gandhi today appointed Bengal Congress legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya the state party president in place of Pranab Mukherjee, signalling her intention to keep relations with Mamata Banerjee running smoothly ahead of next years Assembly elections.         
	Insiders at 10 Janpath said Manass loyalty to the Cong- ress and proximity to Pranab, which ensure there are no ruffled feathers, helped him bag the post ahead of state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.         
	According to sources, Mamata had been sounded about the move at a dinner yesterday where Pranab apparently told her he was quitting because of preoccupations in Delhi as the finance minister.        
	Pranab had been the state party president since 2001, when Sonia gave him the job of retaining the partys identity in Bengal. Since May 2004, when the Congress-led UPA formed the government at the Centre, Pranab had repeatedly tried to get himself out of the state unit but Sonia had refused to oblige.         
	On her return to Calcutta today, Mamata refused comment on the change of guard in the state Congress but aides quoted her as saying Manass elevation would help further cement the relations between the two parties.         
	The new state Congress chief said from Delhi he would call on Mamata after reaching Calcutta on Tuesday. I have two priorities  to strengthen the organisation and firm up the alliance with Mamatadi.         
	Manas, 58, had not been in the Trinamul Congress chiefs good books until recently because of his perceived good relations with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Some in Trinamul even called him Buddhadebs manasputra (protg).         
	The Congress leader appears to have succeeded in changing that perception.         
	Before last years Lok Sabha elections, when many Congress leaders dubbed the high commands acceptance of Mamatas 28-14 seat-share formula a surrender, Manas kept stressing the need to strengthen the alliance.         
	After the elections, a CPM attack on a team of MLAs led by Manas in Burdwans Mangalkot endeared the Congress leader to Mamata. The attack disproved the belief in Trinamul that Manas enjoyed the chief ministers blessings, a state Congress leader said.         
	Prompted by Mamata, leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee had joined Congress MLAs in condemning the attack. Trinamul had not opposed a bandh called by Manas to protest the attack.        
	The Trinamul chief would also not have missed Manass silence when many Congress leaders cried humiliation following her decision to give her ally only 25 of the 141 wards in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.         
	Trinamuls Chatterjee today described Manass elevation as really good news. I have known Manas since my days in the Chhatra Parishad in the 70s. These days, we have been working together in the Assembly, he added.        
	If Manas made himself dear to Mamata in the past year, he also kept his good relations with Pranab intact. Congress sources said that whenever the state party chief was in Calcutta, he would ask Manas to brief him.         
	Pranab himself is said to have proposed his successors name.        
	Senior AICC functionaries said that after the civic poll results, Sonia had veered to the view that Pranabs stature could act as an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the alliance.         
	(Besides being acceptable to Mamata) Manas is a tough man, not known to give up easily. He has stayed in the party at a time those like Subrata Mukherjee and Somen Mitra have moved to greener pastures, a senior leader said.         
	According to a CPM leader, Manas was rewarded for his constant criticism of us toeing (Trinamuls) Parthas line.         
	State party working president Bhattacharya, who, Trinamul sources said, was seen to have sided with the anti-Mamata section of the Congress before the civic polls, said: Im glad Manas has been made the state units president. I assure him all co-operation.        
	Moily meets Mamata        
	Senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily called on Mamata at her Kalighat home this evening and discussed the states political situation.        
	After the 30-minute meeting, Moily, the Union law minister, described Mamata as a great leader, fighting for justice for the people of Bengal.         
	We are proud of her, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mayor cloud over civic list
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mayor cloud over civic list
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 15: The CPM today failed to name the Left Front nominees for the upcoming Calcutta civic polls, mainly because of mayor Bikash Bhattacharyyas refusal to contest despite pressure from the party.        
	Asked about the delay, an annoyed Biman Bose, the Left Front chairman, said: We were scheduled to release the list today, but so what? We wont go by the wishes of the media. I have just got the list but Im yet to go through it. It will be released on Saturday.        
	It is not clear if the complete list will be released on Saturday.        
	Another reason for the delay was the reluctance of many sitting mayor-in-council members and councillors to make room for younger, active and locally popular candidates. The party has decided to drop three-timers among councillors but Bose said there would be exceptions.        
	The problem got complicated after some mayor-in-council members and councillors sought new seats because their existing seats had come under reservations for women and the Scheduled Castes.         
	The CPM state secretariat met this evening and discussed, in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, how to persuade Bhattacharyya to contest the polls. But after the meeting, Bhattacharyya met Bose at Alimuddin Street, where he is learnt to have reaffirmed his decision not to contest.        
	I have told Buddhada to spare me this time as I have already played my innings, he reportedly told Bose, who urged him to reconsider his stance and gave him time till noon tomorrow.        
	Sources said the CPM leadership was trying to coax Bhattacharyya into contesting because his departure could further demoralise the party rank and file after the drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Bhattacharyya, who has continued with his practice at Calcutta High Court despite accusations of being a part-time mayor from within the party and outside, has cited professional preoccupation as his main reason for not contesting. His problems with a section of city CPM leaders and his uneasy relations with municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya too are believed to have been factors behind his decision.         
	His critics in the partys city unit, who resent his individualist style of functioning, are now accusing him of having a defeatist mentality. They insist he should not back away at a time the party is cornered.         
	The state leadership feels it will be embarrassing for the party to tout the achievements and pro-poor measures of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in the poll campaign if the mayor himself declines to contest.

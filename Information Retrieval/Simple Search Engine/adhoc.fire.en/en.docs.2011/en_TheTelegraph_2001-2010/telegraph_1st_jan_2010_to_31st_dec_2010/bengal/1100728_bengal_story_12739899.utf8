          OUR STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 27: A 20-year-old MBA aspirant tonight jumped off a speeding shuttle cab in Salt Lake after its driver allegedly molested her.        
	Sayantani Mazumdars journey from her MBA coaching class in Tollygunge to her home in Salt Lakes BJ 345 could have ended in death.        
	It is not clear from where Sayantani boarded the cab. Salt Lake shuttle cars often pick up passengers from Rashbehari Avenue.         
	Sayantani was not alone in the car when she got in but all her co-passengers got off at Karunamoyee around 9.30pm.         
	At Karunamoyee, the driver asked Sayantani which way she was headed and she told him that she was going to Tank No. 8. He then told her that he was headed in the same direction so she stayed in the car, said Krishna Chakraborty, a local councillor to whom Sayantani went for help.        
	 According to what Sayantani told Chakraborty and police, the car had just moved out of Karunamoyee when the driver started misbehaving with her. Sayantani, in the front seat, started screaming.        
	The driver then stepped up the speed. Panicking, Sayantani opened the front door and jumped.        
	She remembered the car number (WB19D2349) and came to me. She then lodged a police complaint, Chakraborty said.        
	Sayantani escaped with a few scratches. She was very shaken, the councillor said.        
	We have recorded a complaint and have got the number of the vehicle. It may have been a car belonging to a shuttle service in Sector V. We will be scanning those vehicles, said an officer of Bidhannagar police station.        
	Fire at courier office        
	A fire broke out in the office of courier company in CD block of Salt Lake on Tuesday night. Four fire tenders brought the blaze under control after almost two hours.

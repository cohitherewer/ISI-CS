The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Death traps in rebel belt
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Death traps in rebel belt
          NARESH JANA                              
	Midnapore, Dec. 14: Maoists have left behind a large number of improvised explosive devices (IED) in West Midnapore villages from where they have gradually withdrawn over the past several months.        
	We fear that there may be at least four to five IEDs near each village. As most of them are buried, mine detectors are not always effective. Over the past seven to eight months, we have recovered about 300 such devices, said district police chief Manoj Verma.        
	Such death traps are believed to be lurking in 250 villages across large swathes of Lalgarh, Salboni, Goaltore and Kotowali. Panchayats in these areas have been put on alert.        
	If the wires connected to these IEDs are visible on the surface or arrested Maoists or members of the rebel-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities tell us about the locations of the devices, we can detect the explosives. But villagers may inadvertently fiddle with such a device, leading to an explosion, Verma said.        
	The chief of Kashijora panchayat, Amulya Singh, said when the villagers had unearthed explosives in May, police had cautioned them against doing so. We have decided not to unearth any more explosives on our own.        
	The danger has parallels with war-ravaged Afghanistan and Angola, where landmines lying undetected for months or years are still claiming lives.

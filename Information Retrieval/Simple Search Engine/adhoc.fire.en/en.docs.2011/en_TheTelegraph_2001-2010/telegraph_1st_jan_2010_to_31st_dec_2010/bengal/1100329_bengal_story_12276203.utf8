The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Citu ire on CPM civic chief
                                                  Citu ire on CPM civic chief
                            
	Chinsurah, March 28: A CPM municipal chairman today bore the brunt of Citu-led autorickshaws when she was on her way to a police station in Hooghly to lodge a complaint against them.        
	Nearly 100 auto drivers surrounded Bina Majumdars car, hurled abuses at her and shouted go back until police arrived and drove them away.         
	The reason for their anger was the Bansberia municipa-litys move to launch 10 Tata Magic vehicles to run as shuttle taxis between Chinsurah and Mogra. An official said they did it for passenger comfort and for more revenue.         
	The fear of losing customers was too much for the smoke-belching autos. When the new vehicles started operating on Friday, the Citu supporters beat up their drivers. When the new vehicles were being stopped again today, Majumdar decided to take one of them and go to the police. The vehicles will do the commuters good. Im against the monopoly of autos, said Majumdar.

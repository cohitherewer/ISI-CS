                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Calcutta far for Taslima
          MOHUA DAS                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 10: Taslima Nasreen still yearns for Calcutta but has reconciled to the fact that she might not be able to make it home very soon.         
	The exiled Bangladeshi author arrived in Delhi on Sunday to renew her visa, which expires on February 17.         
	Aami kolkatay pherar jonyo ar osthir na (Im no longer pining to return to Calcutta. Getting to live in India is all that Im looking forward to. I havent spoken to any government official in Bengal nor have I expressed a fierce desire to return to Calcutta.         
	How can I when they wont even let me stay in Delhi? After trying for two days, I finally got to meet some officials from the home ministry this evening. My only request has been that my residence permit doesnt carry the condition that I have to leave the country immediately, she said.         
	Taslima, who is free to move around in Delhi where she is staying at the house of a former ambassador to Sweden, has been spending time meeting publishers and waiting for some of her old mates to come from Calcutta.         
	I missed being part of Book Fair. I feel sad when I remember earlier days when hundreds of girls would visit me at both book fairs (in Calcutta and Dhaka), hold my hand, cry and confide about their lifes sorrows, she said.        
	The author who has completed her Woodrow Wilson fellowship on secularism and democracy, which kept her busy in New York last year, rued: I took up the fellowship because I had nowhere to go, nothing to do. If they turn me away now, I dont know what Ill do.         
	If not the author, artist Taslima will find expression at an exhibition at Gallery Atelier in Delhi where two of her paintings will be on display from February 15 to 28.         
	Mamata Banerjee may have managed to steer clear from the controversial author but will not be able to escape her company at the gallery where the Trinamul leaders works will also be showcased.         
	I used to paint in Calcutta. They were transported to my Delhi home after I had to let go of my Calcutta house. They are mostly oil and acrylic and my subject usually centres on women, Taslima said.

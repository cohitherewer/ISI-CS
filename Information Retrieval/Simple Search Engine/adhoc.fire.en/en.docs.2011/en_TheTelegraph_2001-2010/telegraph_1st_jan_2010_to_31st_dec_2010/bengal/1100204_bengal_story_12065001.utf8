The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Quota blame on Centre
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Quota blame on Centre
                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 3: The CPM today blamed the UPA government led by the Congress and its ally Mamata Banerjee for sitting tight on the Ranganath Misra commissions recommendations on reservations for Muslims in government jobs and education.         
	It also trained its guns at the Centre for its failure to arrest the food price rise and unemployment.         
	The party, however, underlined its satisfaction with the Centre and the Congress on the fight against Maoists while harping on Trinamuls nexus with the guerrillas.         
	The issues will be the highlights of the CPMs campaign against the Trinamul-Congress alliance in the run-up to the mid-year civic polls, the countdown to which begins with a Brigade rally on Sunday.        
	Mamata had said that the state should implement the quota for Muslims first while promising to do so if she came to power. Reacting to that, the CPMs Mohammad Salim said Mamata was never in favour of the Centres affirmative actions for Muslims but was trying to play vote-bank politics now by promising jobs.

	Midnapore, May 8: Maoist guerrillas stormed a CPM leaders house in Jhargram last night, shot him dead in front of his family and then went on a looting spree.        
	The departure from the rebels usual style of operation left many surprised. Normally, they drag away their targets from their homes and shoot them in a field or a forest clearing. Besides, the guerrillas are normally not known to loot the homes of their victims.        
	About 30 people surrounded CPM local committee member Sudhangshu Maitys house, deep inside Lodhashuli forest, around 11.30pm. They called Maity by his name and when he did not emerge they entered the house and shot him, Jhargram superintendent of police Praveen Tripathi said. The assailants took away cash, jewellery and other valuables.        
	Maity owned two acres of farmland and worked as a librarian in Jhargram. He was also the secretary of a farm produce marketing co-operative.        
	In Midnapore, chief secretary Ardhendu Sen today said the families of those killed by Maoists would get Rs 3.5 lakh as compensation. So far, only slain police personnels families were paid compensation.

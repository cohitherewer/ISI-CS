	New Delhi, Jan. 6: The Centre has appointed a one-member panel to probe allegations of corruption and nepotism against Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray after an earlier three-member panel refused the assignment.         
	Former Rabindra Bharati and Burdwan University vice-chancellor Ramaranjan Mukherji will probe the allegations against Ray that had sparked unrest and forced Visva-Bharati to halt classes late last year, government sources told The Telegraph.         
	Mukherji is now chairman of Birbhum Institute of Engineering Technology in Suri, 40km from Santiniketan. He is said to have been picked by the Prime Ministers Office.

	Calcutta, May 4: The collapse of the Congress-Trinamul tie-up prompted Mamata Banerjees culture clan to put up a rare show of solidarity today and declare that the split would not be able to block the winds of change.         
	Blaming the Congress for strengthening the CPM ahead of the municipal polls, many in the motley group urged voters to help Mamata bring in a political change in Bengal.         
	There was a possibility of an alliance to oust the CPM, but some invisible forces did not let that happen. However, that has not weakened Mamata and we think she is the only person capable of bringing about a change, said painter Suvaprasanna, the Trinamul chiefs main contact with the world of arts.         
	A source in the Trinamul camp told The Telegraph that it required Mamatas intervention to present a united face of her culture clan, which had developed cracks after singer-MP Kabir Suman went public with his discontent.         
	There were some who wouldnt have shared the dais with Suvaprasanna without Mamatas intervention, the source said, adding that she would meet all the representatives of the clan in a day or two to iron out the differences.         
	Although author-activist Mahasweta Devi was conspicuous by her absence  she had also skipped the foundation stone-laying ceremony in January for a railway line between Nandigram and Bajkul, 17km away  she clarified later today that she was busy with some guests.         
	Im always with the change brigade, Mahasweta told another programme in the city later in the evening.         
	Speaker after speaker  like theatre personalities Bibhas Chakraborty and Bratya Basu, poet Joy Goswami, painters Jogen Chowdhury and Samir Aich and academic Sunanda Sanyal  stressed the change agenda this evening.         
	Suvaprasanna said at the outset the participants were apolitical and there was unanimity in their stress on change, but many of them differed on how to bring it.         
	Change is a continuous process and we are here to state the reasons on why we need change. Now, it is up to the people of the state to decide what they want, said Chakraborty.         
	Painter Chowdhury chose a different track. The CPM has to go because they have done nothing for so many years. Now, they are trying a rectification drive in the party and also to do a few things for the people. But they cannot rectify themselves unless they are in the Opposition, he said, echoing a section of CPM insiders.         
	Basu was much more forthcoming. The change we are seeking can take place only through ballots and so we want a change in Bengal with Mamata leading from the front, Basu said, drawing applause.         
	Sanyal and singer Nachiketa endorsed his line.        
	Realising that the speakers were coming up with divergent views, Suvaprasanna tried to strike a balance. We dont belong to any political party and so our words may differ, but all of us agree on change.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Appraisal season in CPM 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Appraisal season in CPM 
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 4: The CPMs top leaders have done a self-appraisal of their performance, a corporate-style exercise that the central committee is expected to follow.         
	The 13 politburo members led by general secretary Prakash Karat (picture on right) today placed a note before the central committee on its collective self-assessment after members introspected on their performance in official and organisational positions as well as their conduct in public life.         
	The discussion on the politburos note is expected tomorrow. The note did not delve into personal aspects of the top leaders self-criticism and focused on the organisational and political lapses. It admitted the lack of collective functioning at the highest level and the failure to stem factional bickering.        
	The central committee members have been asked to do their self-appraisal on the basis of the pro forma circulated by the leadership.         
	Some central committee members said the parameters for the self-appraisal reflected the CPMs worries about its image after growing charges of corruption against leaders and the spread of bourgeoisie vices. The CPMs rectification document named many of the vices  disproportionate financial assets, concealment of actual income, hunger for power and lavish lifestyle.         
	The pro forma focused on asset declaration  the leaders and the familys  and wanted to know whether the CPM member spends lavishly at family events. The CPM also wanted leaders to ask themselves whether they really believed in the partys ideology and followed the partys guidelines in their everyday tasks.        
	Central committee members admitted that most leaders would deny wrongdoing. Unless there is a mechanism for a reality check, it will be difficult to know the truth, a member said.

	Midnapore, Sept. 13: Suspected Maoists gunned down five of a family, including four brothers, in West Midnapores Nayagram a day after they had taken part in a CPM rally to protest rebel atrocities.         
	The Maoists shot dead Rahim Aguan, 40, Samaresh, 34, Swapan, 28, and Prasanta, 23, in front of their elderly parents before killing their uncle Amrita, 46, who lives in the neighbourhood, for refusing to reveal the addresses of local CPM leaders.         
	The attack, the first time the Maoists have killed so many civilians in one strike in Jungle Mahal, took place in Nayagrams Patina village, 15km from the Orissa border.        
	Police said the CPM had taken out the 500-strong procession encouraged by its recapture of turf lost to the Maoists around Lalgarh, 75km away.         
	The Maoist strike was a warning of sorts to the CPM, a senior police officer said.        
	Jhargram superintendent of police Praveen Tripathi said a group of around 20 Maoists had surrounded the Aguans house around 4.30am today.         
	Jatindranath, the 75-year-old father of the brothers, said they were sleeping in their mud-walled two-storey home when they were suddenly woken up by gunshots, followed by loud banging on the door.                  
	Three of my sons were sleeping upstairs. I was sleeping with my wife and our youngest son, Prasanta, downstairs. As soon as Prasanta opened the door, around 20 people rushed in, Jatindranath said.        
	They asked Prasanta to tell them the addresses of the local CPM leaders. When he told them he did not know, one of the Maoists shot him. He slumped to the ground in front of his mothers eyes and mine.        
	Around six of the rebels then rushed upstairs. When Rahim, Samaresh and Swapan said they did not know the addresses, they too were gunned down, Jatindranath said.        
	His wife Sailabala, who climbed upstairs after the Maoists left, said: My sons were lying dead on their beds. What will I live for now?        
	The police said the gang then went to Amritas house. They shot him for refusing to divulge the addresses, an officer said.        
	The police said Rahim did not die immediately after being shot. When the joint forces arrived at the spot, Rahim was still breathing. He was unconscious. The forces took him to the local health centre but he died on the way, a police officer said.        
	The Maoist strike came on the first day of the 48-hour bandh called by the rebels in six states, including Bengal, to demand the withdrawal of the joint forces.        
	The police said the Maoists were trying to consolidate their base in Nayagram and surrounding areas now that Lalgarh was under the close surveillance of the joint forces.         
	The Maoists are also trying to set up a unit of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities in Patina, another police officer said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nadia, Oct. 9: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today slammed Mamata Banerjee for demanding the withdrawal of the joint forces from Jungle Mahal, adding that the state government had learnt from its mistake in Singur and would push for industry.        
	The Trinamul Congress is demanding that the joint forces be withdrawn from Maoist-hit areas. Look how her (Mamatas) heart bleeds for the Maoists. Will not police arrest those involved in murders? Actually, the demand is being made to help the Maoists in Jungle Mahal, the chief minister told a CPM rally in Nadias Krishnagar.        
	On Wednesday, Mamata had told a rally in Midnapore town that her party workers would hit the streets demanding the withdrawal of the joint forces.        
	Though the Centre has made it clear that the joint forces would stay in Jungle Mahal, Bhattacharjees public outburst is being seen as an attempt to send a message to the central government that it should not succumb to the Trinamul chiefs oft-iterated demand.        
	Without naming Mamata during his speech, the chief minister said: The PCPA (Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities) consists of Trinamul leaders. But the lady who is at the helm of the party is consistently lying to people. We will not surrender to Trinamul or the Maoists.         
	Bhattacharjee said the state government had learnt from the Singur episode. We have learnt from the mistake we made there. We have vowed to set up more industries in the state to generate employment for our youth, he said.        
	He had earlier said the state government had made a mistake by forcibly acquiring land for the Tata Nano project.        
	Bhattacharjee said people had made a mistake by voting for Trinamul and pledged to woo them back. He urged people not to abandon the red flag.

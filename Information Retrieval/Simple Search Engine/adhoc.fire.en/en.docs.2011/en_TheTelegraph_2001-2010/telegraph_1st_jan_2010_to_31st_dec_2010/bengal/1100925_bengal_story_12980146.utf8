The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rift over Somnath invite
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rift over Somnath invite
          BARUN GHOSH                            Somnath Chatterjee (top), Gautam Deb                                 
	Calcutta, Sept. 24: An invitation to Somnath Chatterjee, a persona non grata to the CPM these days, to participate in a government programme on October 7 to rename New Town Rajarhat as Jyoti Basu Nagar has not gone down well with party managers in Delhi.         
	State housing minister Gautam Deb has sent an invite to the former Lok Sabha Speaker to be present at the event, which chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM state secretary Biman Bose are expected to attend.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee, her junior minister Saugata Roy and the leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly, Partha Chatterjee, have also been invited.        
	Somnath, expelled from the party for refusing to step down as Speaker before the trust vote against the first UPA government, had come under criticism from CPM leaders for calling party boss Prakash Karat arrogant in his just-published book.        
	Bose had publicly slammed the books contents as rubbish.         
	Asked if he would share the stage with Bose and other CPM leaders on October 7, Somnath told The Telegraph today: Gautam requested me over the phone to participate in the event. I will if I am in good heath  I have not been keeping well these days.        
	Deb, however, appeared optimistic. Somnathda has promised me that he will attend the programme if he is in Calcutta, he said.        
	CPM sources in Delhi said the invite to Somnath had annoyed party managers at the national level.        
	Our Bengal leaders have extended an invitation to Somnathbabu despite the fact that he publicly called our party general secretary arrogant. I have read his book. It is full of untruths. Instead of naming the book Keeping the Faith, it should have been called detracting from the faith because he has all through detracted from communist ideals in his book, politburo member M.K. Pandhe said.        
	Another politburo member, Sitaram Yechury, evaded a question on the invite. You better ask our Bengal leaders, he said. Karat refused comment, saying he was preoccupied with a meeting.        
	When told about the reservations of some senior leaders, Deb appeared undeterred. Somnathda may have been expelled from the CPM but we cannot deny that he was the first Lok Sabha Speaker from Bengal. He has been invited to participate in a government-sponsored programme and not a party event, he said.        
	Some of Somnaths associates said he might give the programme the miss just as he had skipped the event to mark the first death anniversary of Subhas Chakraborty on July 31.

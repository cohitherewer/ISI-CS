                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      8000 rally against Maoists
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Villagers at the rally in Radhanagar. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, July 23: At least 8,000 villagers held a rally in Jhargrams Radhanagar today to protest against Maoist attempts to force them to take part in their processions.         
	The show of unity and defiance came a day after the villagers chased away a group of Maoists and Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities activists who had tried to coerce them into joining a procession at gunpoint.        
	Villagers from neighbouring Shaktinagar, Gaighata and Bachhurdoba joined the residents of Radhanagar at todays rally.        
	Enough is enough. We decided to turn around after the Maoists and Peoples Committee activists tried to force our children to join their rally. We told them we did not want to go and chased them away, said Laxman Majhi, a resident of Radhanagar who took part in the rally.        
	Around 2,000 residents, including women, guarded the village overnight to stave off a possible Maoist strikeback. However, no such attack took place.        
	The residents said they had no clue that so many villagers from neighbouring places would join them. When we were about to start the rally from the school playground where yesterdays showdown took place, we saw several people from neighbouring villages joining in. We had not invited them but they joined spontaneously, a Radhanagar resident said.        
	Several people carried canes, axes, swords and rods to send a message to the Maoists that we also can fight back, another villager said.        
	The residents of Radhanagar, who have also formed a Gram Bachao Committee, did not allow local CPM leaders to join the rally. You have done enough. Now it is our turn, one of them told the leaders sarcastically.

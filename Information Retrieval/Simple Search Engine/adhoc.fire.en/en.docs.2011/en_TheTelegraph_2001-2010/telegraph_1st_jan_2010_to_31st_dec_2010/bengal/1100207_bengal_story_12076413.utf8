	Calcutta, Feb. 6: The first cadaver organ transplant in the state failed with the recipient dying a few hours after the surgery at SSKM hospital today.        
	Jayanti Chatterjee, a 46-year-old homemaker from Behala, underwent the liver transplant at the Institute of Liver Disease at SSKM. She received the liver of Joydeb Paul, a farmer from Birbhum, who had died yesterday.         
	She died because of primary graft failure and rejection by her immune system, said Abhijit Chowdhury, the director of the Institute of Liver Disease. The 10-hour surgery started at 11pm last night and ended at 9am today.         
	Chatterjee died at 4.10 pm.

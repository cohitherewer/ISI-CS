                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Kid schools shut in Malda
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 4: The Malda administration declared a weeks holiday in all government-run primary schools and installed room heaters in the paediatric ward of the district hospital after the minimum temperature dipped to 7 degrees Celsius this morning.        
	Since Christmas, the mercury in the district had been going downward. Dense fog has combined with the cold to disrupt life.        
	This cold is too much for us. It is worse for the children, said district magistrate Sridhar Ghosh.        
	A headmaster said attendance in his school had dropped below 50 per cent. Today, 117 students out of the 400 came, said Moloy Das of Lalit Mohan Primary School at Gangabagh.         
	A woman, Marjina Bibi, 45, was burnt to death by a fire she had lit in her hut at Chanchol to ward off the cold.        
	The superintendent of the district hospital, Ashok Biswas, said six room heaters had been placed in the paediatric ward. We are not taking any risks with the children, he said.        
	The chief agricultural officer of the district, Salil Palit, said the cold could prove a bane for the boro paddy and a boon for vegetables. The paddy is turning red in this weather, but the production of vegetables is likely to increase because of it.        
	In Siliguri, the maximum temperature today was 15.8 degrees Celsius.         
	Subir Sarkar, in charge of North Bengal Universitys weather observation centre, said it was the lowest maximum temperature in the past five years. It is 8 degrees below normal, he added.        
	The sun remained hidden behind a haze through the day and people preferred staying indoors. Flights at Bagdogra airport were delayed by over an hour.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          The mangled Sumo after the accident near Durgapur on Saturday. (Gour Sharma)                                  
	Calcutta/Durgapur, Dec. 18: A 23-year-old call centre employee bled to death on a suburban road after being run over by a minibus this morning while fog caused a crash on G.T. Road killing four picnickers, including an eight-year-old girl.        
	Sujit Pal, 23, a trainee with a call centre off VIP road, was headed home after night shift when he came under the minibus while crossing a road at Kaikhali, North 24-Parganas, around 5.30am.        
	The near-empty bus, plying from BBD Bag to Birati, sped off. A police patrol van spotted a bleeding Pal on the road about 15 minutes later and took him to a local hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.         
	In the other accident, a vehicle rammed into a stationary tanker on a foggy G.T. Road near Durgapur.         
	The victims were part of a group of 20 picnickers, all from Canning and Sonarpur, who were travelling to Maithon in two Tata Sumos.         
	Mohammad Zakir, a passenger in the other car, said: Hardly anything could be seen because of the fog. Suddenly, I heard a loud thud. The Sumo travelling in front of our car had rammed into a stationary tanker. Our driver slammed the brakes just in time and stopped our car from hitting the other Sumo from behind.        
	Bittu Mandal, 40, Indrajit Naskar, 35, and driver Siraj Sheikh, 32, died on the spot. Bittus daughter Trisha died of her injuries at Asansol subdivisional hospital.         
	Siraj was a resident of Canning while the other three were from Sonarpur. Eight people were injured and have been admitted to the Asansol hospital.        
	This was the third accident this year on the Durgapur-Asansol stretch.

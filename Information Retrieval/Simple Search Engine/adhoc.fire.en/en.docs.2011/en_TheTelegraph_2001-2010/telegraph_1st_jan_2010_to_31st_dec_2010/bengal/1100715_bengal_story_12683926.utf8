	Shasan, July 14: Three persons suffered bullet injuries today during a clash between Trinamul Congress and CPM activists over the control of fish farms at Sashan in North 24-Parganas. The clash began when armed CPM activists chased away the security guards of some Trinamul-controlled farms. Police said the Trinamul activists retaliated and 15 rounds were fired.

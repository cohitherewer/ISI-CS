The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ministers denied pay hike
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Ministers denied pay hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 30: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta told the Assembly today he would not raise the salary of ministers, though it was lower than in some other states, as there were people here who earned much less.        
	The assertion was in response to a plea by the RSPs Jane Alam Mian that, like MLAs, the salaries of ministers be increased too.        
	I am sorry to say that I cannot accede to this request. The average monthly salary drawn by the ministers is around Rs 7,500 every month. Im told this is far less than that drawn by ministers of other states. But we will have to keep in mind that there are people in this state who earn much less that Rs 7,500 a month, Dasgupta said during the discussion on the finance and appropriation bills.        
	The salary of legislators was raised from Rs 3,000 a month to Rs 5,000 with effect from December 1, 2009.        
	Asked why the MLAs got the raise while the ministers were denied the benefit, Dasgupta said: At least we ministers get to move around in cars provided by the government.

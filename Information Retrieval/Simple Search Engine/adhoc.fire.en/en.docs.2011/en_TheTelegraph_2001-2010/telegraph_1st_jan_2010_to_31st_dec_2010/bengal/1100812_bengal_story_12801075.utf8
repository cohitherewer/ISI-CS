                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CID to probe truck hit
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Tamluk/Calcutta, Aug. 11: The state government today handed to the CID the charge of probing the truck-hit on Mamata Banerjees convoy on her way back from the Lalgarh rally after Trinamul Congress leader Subhendu Adhikari lodged an FIR alleging it was a conspiracy to murder our leader.        
	Demanding an independent inquiry into Mondays incident, Adhikari, the Trinamul MP from Tamluk, said: It was pre-planned.        
	Trinamul supporters led by Adhikari gheraoed Kolaghat police station around 5pm today. How could the state government say it was an accident when it was clearly a well-planned conspiracy to murder Mamata Banerjee? The government failed to provide her security, Adhikari said.        
	The police (in Kolaghat) were fully aware that the railway ministers convoy would pass through that area (NH6). What were the police doing? Why didnt they stop the truck before it hit the car in her convoy? Adhikari said.        
	Home secretary Samar Ghosh said today at Writers Buildings that the case had been handed over to the CID on the basis of Adhikaris complaint.        
	The truck driver (Gurjar Singh) was re-arrested today on charges of conspiracy and attempt to murder. He will be produced in court tomorrow, said Surajit Kar Purakayastha, the inspector-general of police (law and order).        
	A CID team visited the spot of the incident this evening. They also interrogated Singh.        
	The Tamluk motor vehicles department said the brakes of Singhs truck were not working properly. Singh had claimed yesterday that there was a problem with his vehicles brakes on Monday.        
	Singh had been arrested on Monday night after he flouted traffic rules and rushed into the path of Mamatas convoy. He would have hit the Trinamul chiefs car had an escort jeep not sped forward and stopped between the lorry and her car. The truck hit the escort jeep, which rammed into Mamatas car on impact, flinging her against the dashboard.        
	Singh had been charged with rash and negligent driving and produced in a Tamluk court, which granted him bail.        
	After being released on bail, Singh was taken to Kolaghat police station from a dhaba and interrogated by the deputy inspector-general (Midnapore range), Anil Kumar.         
	Mamata today cancelled her visit to Delhi after being advised rest by her doctor. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee sent Mamata a bouquet of flowers through Congress leader Sukhendu Sekhar Roy.

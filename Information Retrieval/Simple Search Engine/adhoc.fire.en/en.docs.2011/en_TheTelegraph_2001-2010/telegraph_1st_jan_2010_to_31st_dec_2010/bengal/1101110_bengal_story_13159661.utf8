                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM jallad answer to harmad
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 9: Plant a harmad (gang of goons) and reap a jallad (executioner).        
	The CPM today dubbed the Trinamul Congress a gang of jallads, hitting back at Mamata Banerjee and her colleagues who have often described their rival as a party of harmads and opening a new flank in Bengals politics of name calling.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose joined the barb battle today. The Trinamul Congress is a gang of jallads. The Maoist jallads have joined them. People should know what these jallads are doing, Bose said after a Left Front meeting where it was decided to hold campaigns in Calcutta and the districts to highlight Trinamul and Maoist terror.        
	At almost every party rally since the Nandigram flare-up over three years ago, Mamata and others in Trinamul have alleged that the CPM is a party of harmads who believe in wanton killings and destruction.        
	Trinamul MLA and leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee saw in Boses jibe signs of the CPMs frustration after a series of poll debacles since the 2008 rural elections. The CPM has understood that they will be thrown out of power next year. Thats why they have become desperate and using such language after killing our men. We called them harmads because of their wanton killings. Now, they are spreading canards against us.        
	But Bose accused Trinamul and the rebels of killing the innocent and the poor, deliberately clubbing the rival party and Maoists. The CPM has long alleged that the two are in cahoots.         
	These two parties are killing poor and innocent people. Since last years Lok Sabha elections, 316 Left workers, supporters and sympathisers have been killed by these jallads. We will hold programmes in Calcutta and the districts to highlight their terror and to expose their activities, he said.

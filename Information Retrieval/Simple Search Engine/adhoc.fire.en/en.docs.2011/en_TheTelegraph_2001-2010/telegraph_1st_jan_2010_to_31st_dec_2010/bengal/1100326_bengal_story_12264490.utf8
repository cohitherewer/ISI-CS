The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Gariahat flat in I-T auction
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Gariahat flat in I-T auction
                            
	Calcutta, March 25 (PTI): The income-tax department today auctioned a Gariahat flat it had seized in 1992 for illegal undervaluation.         
	The flat was sold for Rs 1.43 crore, department sources said.        
	The three-bedroom property had been acquired under the now-scrapped Section 269UD of the I-T Act which empowered the department to suo-motu take over properties which were illegally undervalued and later conduct a preventive purchase and sale through a public auction.        
	However, the section was abolished in subsequent years.        
	The I-T department was involved (as appellant) in a protracted legal battle over the seized property. Calcutta High Court gave a verdict in favour of the department a few months back and hence the property was sold today, a source in the department said.

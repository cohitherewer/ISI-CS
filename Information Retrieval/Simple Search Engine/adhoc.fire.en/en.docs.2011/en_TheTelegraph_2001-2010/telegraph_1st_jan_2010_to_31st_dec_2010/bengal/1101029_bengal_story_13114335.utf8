          ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR                          Pranab and his wife Saraswati, whose son Subrata is missing since the March 14, 2007, police firing, at their home in Nandigram on Thursday. Telegraph picture                                  
	Nandigram, Oct. 28: Pranab Samanta, 66, wonders how the Supreme Courts award of compensation yesterday for the Nandigram police firing victims will help his family.        
	The families of those killed in the March 14, 2007, police firing have already got compensation. The Supreme Court yesterday paved the way for a Rs 1 lakh compensation for each of the 162 injured.         
	But Pranabs son Subrata is neither officially dead nor injured. He is the only protester missing since the firing.         
	Pranab said he and his son had assembled with other protesters near the Bhangabera bridge on the morning of March 14, responding to a call by the Bhumi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee.        
	The protesters, including my son and I, had formed a human shield when the police suddenly started firing. I saw Subrata, who was standing beside me, collapse to the ground after being hit by bullets. All the protesters started running helter-skelter. I saw my son being dragged away by policemen. He has been missing since then, Pranab, a farm labourer, said.        
	My son took bullets in his chest and legs. Several others were hit. I was lucky to have escaped. Some of my neighbours and I tried to rush towards Subrata but could not reach him because of the heavy firing. I saw two policemen drag my son over the bridge and walk away towards Khejuri, he said.        
	Pranab said he had searched for his son in hospitals in Nandigram, Tamluk and even Calcutta but could not trace him.        
	For three-and-a-half years, I have been searching for my son. I have approached the CBI and the CID but they too have failed to find him. If the government cant pay me any compensation, let them at least trace my son, Pranab said.        
	The Supreme Court verdict does not mention how my family will be compensated. We are extremely poor. I am at a loss how I shall make ends meet, said Pranab, a resident of Jalpai village, about 5km from Bhangabera.        
	Subrata, who was 26 in 2007, was a labourer with a plastic factory in Delhi. He earned Rs 7,000 a month.        
	A few days before the firing, Subrata had returned to Nandigram after getting a job as a security guard in Haldia. The youngest of my three sons had died of a liver disease 10 years ago. Now with no trace of Subrata, I am left with only my eldest son Pabitra, a farm labourer, Pranab said.         
	When Subrata went missing, his son Sasanka was only one-and-a-half-months old. Subratas wife Srimati, 25, said Sasanka has begun asking about his father.        
	I have told him his father has gone to a faraway place to work and will return only after finishing it, Srimati said, choking her tears back.        
	She said she had no money to admit Sasanka to school. If we get some compensation from the government, it will be easier for us to pay for his education, Srimati, who lives with her in-laws, said. She earns Rs 1,500 a month by working as a cook at a centre for the Integrated Child Development Scheme in the village.        
	Subratas mother Saraswati, who makes paper bags for a living, said: Subrata was the chief earner in our family. In his absence, we are finding it difficult to make ends meet.        
	District superintendent of police Ashok Biswas said Subratas family had lodged a missing persons diary at Nandigram police station. We are investigating his disappearance, Biswas said.

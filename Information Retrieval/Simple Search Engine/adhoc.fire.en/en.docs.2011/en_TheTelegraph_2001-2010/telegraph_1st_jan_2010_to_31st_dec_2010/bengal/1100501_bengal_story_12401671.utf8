          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 30: The committee probing the Maoist strike on the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in West Midnapores Shilda today submitted a report to the chief minister, which, sources said, mentions lack of preparedness and alertness and says the jawans were in no position to fight.        
	One of the committees observations is that the camp didnt have ground-level preparedness. There was lack of alertness on the part of the jawans. Many of them were sleeping. Thats why they couldnt retaliate and hence paid with their lives, a source said.         
	Ardhendu Sen, who became chief secretary today, had headed the committee as home secretary. He discussed the report with the chief minister this evening.        
	Asked about the report, Sen said: Its a sensitive issue. There needs to be more talks to decide how to beef up security in the camps and increase the strength of the forces. The committee has made 10-12 recommendations. But the government may not implement all of them. Well talk about the recommendations at an appropriate time.        
	Twenty-four EFR jawans were butchered on February 15 when most personnel were either lazing around in the camp or preparing to join duty.        
	On the day of the strike, Sen had said that he and state police chief Bhupinder Singh had received intelligence about a Maoist mobilisation three hours before the attack.        
	Today, he said: I wouldnt comment on that now.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          One of the posters put up by suspected Maoists. Telegraph picture                                  
	Barasat, Feb. 19: A CPM leader was shot at in North 24-Parganas Habra this evening hours after suspected Maoists put up posters with a list of corrupt leaders who had been given the death sentence.        
	Sagar Roy Chowdhury, a leader of the partys youth wing DYFI, was cycling home from Habra station, about 60km from Calcutta, when a motorbike-borne youth sporting a red golf cap shot at him. The two bullets fired by the pillion rider missed their target.         
	Roy Chowdhury lost balance and fell on the road, bruising his elbows. Local people, many of them CPM supporters, took him to hospital from where he was discharged after first aid.        
	Police said they were not sure if Maoists had attacked Roy Chowdhury. We are investigating all angles, said district police chief Rahul Srivastava.         
	There is no way of telling if the four posters found in different parts of Habra town this morning were indeed put up by the Maoists. One of them was on the door of a CPM office. Two were on trees and the fourth on the wall of a house close to the party office.        
	Written in red, they said: These CPM youth leaders were given the death sentence at a peoples court. The eight names followed and below them was written CPI (Maobadi).         
	A police officer said Maoists generally wrote their posters in red ink or water colour on white paper and signed CPI (Maobadi). But anyone can write with red ink on white paper. So, it is very difficult to differentiate a fake from a genuine threat.         
	The local police consulted the intelligence branch about the posters as Habra, according to them, is not known to have a strong Maoist presence.        
	The names mentioned in the posters were those of Habra municipality councillor Prasenjit Dutta, party local committee member Tuhin Basu, local DYFI (CPM youth wing) secretary Gobinda Chakraborty and party members Tapas Dutta, Kalikrishna Roy, Prabir Dutta, Manoj Biswas and Roy Chowdhury.        
	Several CPM leaders said they suspected a Trinamul Congress hand. There are no Maoists here. The Trinamul workers must have put up the posters, said Dutta.        
	Roy Chowdhury was not available for comment. Habra CPM MLA Pranab Bhattacharya said: We have asked the police to investigate but we are also using our party sources to find out who the miscreants were.         
	The Trinamul MLA who looks after party affairs in North 24-Parganas, Jyotipriya Mullick, said it was the fallout of a feud between two factions of the CPM.        
	The police have asked the leaders named on the list to be alert because it is not possible to provide protection to each of them . Weve asked them to inform us if they travel beyond Habra, an officer said.         
	Although not known to be a rebel den now, Habra and neighbouring Ashoknagar  where Roy Chowdhury lives  and Barasat were Naxalite hotbeds in the 1960s and70s.

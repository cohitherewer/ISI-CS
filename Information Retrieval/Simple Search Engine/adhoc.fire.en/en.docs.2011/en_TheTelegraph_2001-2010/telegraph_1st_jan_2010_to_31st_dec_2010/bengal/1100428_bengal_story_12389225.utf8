	Calcutta, April 27: Congress activists who want an alliance with Mamata Banerjee at any cost unleashed mayhem at their party headquarters three days after another group had done the same to warn the leadership against staking the partys honour for the sake of a deal.        
	Some 50 men from Motijhil near Park Circus stormed into Bidhan Bhavan, empty but for a handful of leaders on a bandh afternoon.        
	They shouted Jot chai, jot chai and went room to room with cricket stumps and bamboo sticks to smash glass panes and snap telephone lines.         
	Congress Seva Dal chief Purna Chandra Ghosh had his left hand fractured by a blow from a stump when he tried to prevent them from entering state party working president Subrata Mukherjees chamber on the second floor.        
	Another working president, Pradip Bhattacharya, was then on the same floor, discussing with the partys four Calcutta district chiefs the Trinamul Congress offer of only 25 of the 141 wards in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.         
	Barun De Sarkar, a leader from Beleghata, called up Entally police station, about 500 metres from Bidhan Bhavan.         
	But the attackers fled before the police came, smashing an aquarium outside the ground-floor lift door, killing dozens of fish, and the windscreens of two cars parked outside.        
	They allegedly owe their allegiance to state Youth Congress president Amitava Chakraborty, who tried to distance himself from the attack, saying he had petitioned the police demanding the arrest of those involved. Youth Congress activists are being falsely blamed for todays violence. I want a proper probe to get at the truth, he added.        
	Working president Bhattacharya has lodged a police complaint blaming unknown persons. The police said five people had been arrested, but refused to name them.        
	We condemn such vandalism. We want the police to arrest all those involved, irrespective of their political affiliations, Bhattacharya said. He has briefed state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee about the development.        
	Asked who could have engineered the violence, Bhattacharya said: I dont know who. But we shall not tolerate this type of hooliganism. The incident has shown us in poor light before the elections to 81 civic bodies.        
	Activists led by a man known to be close to MP Deepa Das Munshi had on Saturday smashed the windscreen of a car and locked up the party offices gates to send a message to the leaders that they should not accept an alliance on Mamatas terms. On Sunday night, Trinamul told its ally it could at best give 25 wards in response to its demand for 51.         
	Some Congress leaders today expressed surprise about the absence of working president Subrata during and after the violence. He did not bother to come despite being in the city, one of them said.        
	Subrata said he had other preoccupations.        
	Congress sources said Subrata and the Youth Congresss Chakraborty were in favour of the alliance at any cost, unlike city leaders Pradip Ghosh, Nirbed Roy, Santosh Pathak and Pranab Basu, who were huddled together at the party office during the attack.        
	The alliance talks had their rumblings in Trinamul too with over 50 party supporters demonstrating in front of Mamatas house this afternoon demanding that Ward 88 not be offered to the Congress. They argued that Mala Roy, who had won the ward on a Trinamul ticket in 2005, should not get nomination because she had betrayed Didi by switching over to the Congress.        
	Late tonight, Trinamul was learnt to have set a condition to its ally over Ward 88  it could not field Roy there even it got to contest the seat.        
	Clarification        
	The Congresss Mahua Moitra today denied the comment attributed to her in Tuesdays paper saying the party would have to accept the raw deal being offered by Trinamul. It is fabricated, she said.

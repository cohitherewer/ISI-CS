The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul to Cong: 25, not an inch more 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul to Cong: 25, not an inch more 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 26: As in last years Lok Sabha elections and the subsequent Assembly bypolls in Bowbazar and Sealdah, the Congress may have to swallow the bitter pill yet again as Mamata Banerjee has brushed aside its logical demand for 51 wards in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief asked her aides last night to convey to the Congress that she would offer no more than 25.         
	After the Congress wrote to her a fortnight ago demanding 51 of Calcuttas 141 wards, Mamata had said she would give them only 21.        
	Last night, Trinamul sec- retary-general Partha Chatterjee called up state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya to say the party would offer four wards in addition to the 21.         
	Chatterjee today said there was no need for another meeting with Congress leaders as he had already conveyed to them the final offer. There is no question of conceding their demand for 51 seats. We have offered them 25.         
	Congress leaders said Mamatas decision could queer her partys pitch in Murshidabad, Nadia and several north Bengal districts where the Congress was a stronger force.        
	Central Calcutta Congress leader Pradip Ghosh suggested an alternative formula to resolve the tangle. We shall not accept the 25 seats Mamata is offering to us because 13 of them are controlled by Left councillors. Instead, she should offer us 25 in which our candidates had either won or emerged second in 2005. If she agrees, we shall give up our demand for 51 seats, Ghosh said.         
	The proposal will soon be sent to state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, he added.         
	However, some state Congress leaders fear that the high command will eventually ask them to accept the seat-sharing deal on Mamatas terms.        
	That the state Congress probably needs the alliance more than Mamata in large parts of the state became evident when Mahua Moitra, chief of its political-organisational cell, said: Despite the grievances over the raw deal, we will have to accept what Mamata is offering. The simple reason is that we cant take the risk of fighting independently taking into account its impact on next years Assembly elections.        
	Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had accepted Mamatas offer of only 14 of the 42 seats in the state. In the Bowbazar and Sealdah bypolls, Mamata had fielded her own candidates and got them elected, though the Congress had won the two seats in 2006.         
	The state Congress working president said he was informed about Trinamuls tough stand last night.        
	The Trinamul leadership, which had offer us only 21 wards despite our demand for 51 a fortnight ago, told us last night we would have to be content with 25, Bhattacharya said.        
	Mamata refrained from making a direct reply when asked about the number today. Discussions are still on, she said before leaving for Delhi this afternoon.        
	 Trinamul sources said Mamata had parried the question because she had decided not to interfere in the talks on the city civic polls. She has assigned the task to Chatterjee, one of them said.        
	Several district Congress leaders today vowed to pay Mamata back in her own coin on their turf. Adhir Chowdhury in Murshidabad, Abdul Mannan in Hooghly and Shankar Singh in Nadia were the most prominent among them.        
	Congress sources said Adhir and Mannan were firm on contesting all the seats in the 18 civic bodies going to the polls in their two districts. Singh ruled out seat adjustments in at least two civic bodies. In West Midnapores Kharagpur municipality, which has been with the Congress for decades, veteran MLA Gyan Singh Sohan Pal wants to call the shots.

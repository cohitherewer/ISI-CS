The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mayor refuses, party rethinks
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mayor refuses, party rethinks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Sudhanshu Sil and Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya                                
	Calcutta, April 16: Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has again told the CPM lead-ership he will not contest the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections, party sources said today.         
	Sources said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had earlier asked the mayor to reconsider his stand, may have repeated his request this evening at a programme off the EM Bypass. But it was not clear how the mayor had responded, or if at all the chief minister had raised the issue.        
	Embarrassed and annoyed by the mayors persistent public refusal, state CPM secretary Biman Bose had summoned him to the party headquarters yesterday and asked him to reconsider his stand by today.         
	Bose is scheduled to release the list of Left candidates in Calcutta tomorrow. It is not clear whether he will leave room for Bhattacharyya by not releasing the complete list.         
	Although Bhattacharyya is a lightweight in the CPM, the leaderships unprecedented efforts to coax him to contest stem from the symbolism that his absence will carry.         
	On a sticky wicket since last years Lok Sabha polls, the CPM fears the mayors deci- sion would be tantamount to conceding defeat before the battle. Also, the partys plan to harp on the achievements of the Bhattacharyya-led board would lose credibility.         
	In the face of Bhattacharyyas stubborn refusal, detractors in the city CPM today accused him of back-stabbing the party in its crisis hour.        
	Some city CPM leaders said later this evening the party was likely to name a new candidate in the mayors ward.         
	When Boses predecessor Anil Biswas had projected Bhattacharyya  then the Tripura advocate-general  as mayor five years ago, the move had surprised many Calcutta leaders and some of them resented it.        
	While Bhattacharyya cited professional preoccupations for not contesting this time, party sources spoke of his differences with city leaders.        
	Also, the partys decision not to project him or any other leader as the mayor this time has frustrated him, those close to Bhattacharyya said.         
	They also linked his decision to the leaderships move to field former Calcutta North West MP, former MLA and city councillor Sudhanshu Sil.         
	Some believe Sil will be the next mayor if the Left retains the board. Bikashbabu is not interested in continuing as a mere councillor, a CPM leader said.         
	Although the party has decided to drop several mayor-in-council members and the majority of its councillors, hectic lobbying is on to retain a balance between the experienced and the young.        
	Bose went into a huddle with South 24-Parganas leaders today. He has another problem at hand, over the renomination of Salt Lake municipality chief Biswajiban Majumdar.         
	The Left is scheduled to name candidates for all 81 civic bodies going to the polls in end-May on Sunday.        
	Mamata meeting        
	Mamata Banerjee has asked all her MPs to attend a parliamentary party meeting in Delhi on Sunday.         
	The MPs have stayed away from Parliament since its budget session resumed yesterday, apparently to protest an alleged attack on two of its ministers. The meeting will decide whether they would go to the House from Monday. MP Sudip Bandopadhyay said: We want to send a message to the Centre that it should act on our complaints about state-sponsored terror let loose by the CPM. (It) does not act despite our repeated complaints.         
	Sources said Mamata had also decided to put pressure on the Congress by avoiding a meeting with her ally to discuss seat-sharing for the civic polls.         
	She was supposed to let the Congress know by tomorrow whether she would concede 51 wards of the 141 in Calcutta.

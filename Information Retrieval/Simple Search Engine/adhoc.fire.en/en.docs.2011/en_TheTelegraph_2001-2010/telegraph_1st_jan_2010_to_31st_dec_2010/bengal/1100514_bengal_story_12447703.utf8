	Calcutta, May 13: Mamata Banerjee today hinted she would renew political contact with the Congress high command, including Sonia Gandhi, after the municipal polls are over in a bid to garner the partys support for her call to advance the Assembly elections in the state.        
	The Trinamul Congresss alliance with the Congress in Bengal has fallen through after disagreements over the seat-sharing formula for the civic polls.        
	After releasing Trinamuls manifesto for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation polls, Mamata said: The people of Bengal know the extent of terror the CPM has unleashed in the state. Clashes have broken out in every nook and corner of the state since the last Lok Sabha elections. There is no democracy here. I have written to the UPA chairperson, (Sonia), informing her about the situation in Bengal. She has enough evidence of the ground realities. I will raise the demand for early Assembly elections in Bengal after the civic polls are over.        
	Sonia had not intervened when the Congress-Trinamul alliance for the municipal polls fell through. She had also left it to state Congress chief and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and leaders Ahmed Patel and K. Keshava Rao to discuss the seat-sharing formula with Mamata.        
	According to a Trinamul MP, Sonia is upset with Mamata over her opposition to some of the UPA governments legislative and administrative decisions in recent months. That is why Mamata wants to get her support ahead of the Assembly polls, the MP said.        
	Mamata today sought to justify her call for early Assembly polls by accusing the Left Front government of not carrying out any development work in the state.         
	There is no governance in the state. No development work is visible. Every day spent by the CPM government is a day wasted. So why should this government stay in power? We feel the Assembly polls should be advanced and held in October. The government can easily hold the polls six months in advance.        
	A Trinamul MLA close to Mamata said she wanted the keep the Congress high command in good humour so that efforts can be made to persuade Sonia to think about early polls in Bengal.         
	Didi (Mamata) is smelling a big victory in the civic polls, the MLA added.         
	Although Mamata claimed that it was constitutionally possible to advance the Assembly elections, it is the state government that has to recommend early elections to the Election Commission.         
	Trinamul sources said Mamata wanted to use her demand for early polls in her campaign against the CPM in the civic elections.         
	The Trinamul chief also said she had spoken to Union home minister P. Chidambaram on the possibility of early polls. I had spoken to the Union home minister a number of times regarding our demand. He knows the ground situation in Bengal, she said.         
	Concerned about the possible impact of the failure to secure an alliance with the Congress for the civic polls, Mamata urged the people of Bengal not to split the anti-Left vote by voting for parties that are bent on helping the CPM.        
	Please vote for Trinamul. Dont split the anti-Left vote as some agents of the CPM want. The CPM would have gone 20 years ago but for these agents,she said.        
	CPM state secretariat member Mohammed Salim today said early polls were the prerogative of the state government and blamed the Trinamul chief for trying to create a constitutional crisis.

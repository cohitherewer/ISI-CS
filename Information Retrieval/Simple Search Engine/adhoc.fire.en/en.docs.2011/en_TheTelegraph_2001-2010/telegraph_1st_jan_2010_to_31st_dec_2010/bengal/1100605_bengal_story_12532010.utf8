	June 4: The CID today got hold of the pick-up van the Maoists had allegedly used while travelling to Rajabandh to sabotage the tracks, leading to the Jnaneswari Express tragedy on May 28.        
	Khagen Mahato, 40, drove his vehicle into the police net at the approach to Kharagpur town and claimed he had no idea that he was wanted.         
	He told the police he was on his way home after delivering goods at Debra, 30km from Kharagpur.        
	The man who had allegedly driven Maoist-trained Bapi Mahato and his men to the sa-botage site lives in a village about 6km from where 150 people were killed in the train disaster.         
	The van had been used to ferry youths recruited by the Maoists to Rajabandh. Khagen was driving the vehicle (WB33A 6238) with one of the prime suspects, Bapi Mahato, seated next to him, said P. Neerajnayan, inspector-general (I) of police, CID.        
	The officer described the seizure of the vehicle as a breakthrough.        
	Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh said: We are investigating Khagen Mahatos Maoist links.        
	Khagen is said to have claimed he was forced to go to Rajabandh. He told the police he had rushed to nearby Indraboni village after getting a call that a patient had to be taken to hospital. The moment I reached there, I found it was a false call. Local youths boarded my vehicle and ordered me to go to Rajabandh, police sources quoted Khagen as saying.        
	Ten youths had allegedly travelled in Khagens van from Indraboni to Rajabandh with hammers, chisels, pickaxes and hacksaws.         
	The others in the gang reached Rajabandh on foot from nearby Burimole village, said a CID officer.        
	The officer scoffed at Khagens claim of innocence. Had he been taken to Rajabandh forcibly, he should have told the police about it after the Maoists released him.        
	However, few villagers would have probably done that given the fear of the guerrillas in the area.         
	It would be strange if Khagen really did not know that the police would be looking for him. It is also surprising that the perpetrators of the crime had not warned him against driving into the town.        
	Khagen was produced in a Jhargram court today and remanded in police custody till June 13.        
	Residents of Rajabandh had told the police they had seen a white pick-up van on the gravelled road that led to the train tracks on the night of the tragedy. The search was not very difficult as few in the area own pick-up vans. We collected the names of all the car owners in the region and zeroed in on the person who owned the pick-up, said an officer.        
	The CID tonight detained a labourer who did track repair jobs under railway contractors. It is suspected that the Maoists had used such labourers to remove the clips that tie the tracks to the sleepers.        
	Chief secretary Ardhendu Sen said in Calcutta the state government had received the CBI notification on its probe into the trains derailment. But we are yet to get the terms of reference, he said.        
	Sen did not say if the CID would conduct a parallel probe. Let me go through the notification. I shall then be able to say whether the CID investigation will continue, he said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, June 5: Five CPM supporters were beaten up by Trinamul Congress activists today after one of them allegedly tried to force shops shut in a Hooghly bazaar to protest an attack on his house during a victory rally by Mamata Banerjees party last night.        
	The clash took place on the outskirts of Tarakeswar where Trinamul has taken control of the municipal board for the first time since it was formed in 1972.         
	Over 200 Trinamul supporters marched through the villages on the fringes of the Tarakeswar municipal area last night to celebrate their victory.         
	Police said they had hurled stones at the house of the CPMs Dhaniakhali local committee member, Saukat Ali.         
	Around 9.30am today, Ali, who also owns a grocery in the bazaar at Dhaniakhali, famous for handloom saris, began pressuring other shopkeepers to down their shutters.         
	Some of them joined him and blocked a road. But several others resisted.         
	As an argument raged, over 100 Trinamul activists armed with swords, sticks and axes pounced on Ali and his supporters.        
	The 42-year-old grocer fractured his right leg and right arm. Another CPM supporter, Manas Ghosal, 34, was injured in the head. Ghosal had to be given 14 stitches on the head.        
	Ali said from his hospital bed: Trinamul goons tried to kill us.         
	Stationery store owner Somnath Chatterjee said people had joined the Trinamul activists in resisting the attempt to enforce a bandh.         
	CPM man killed        
	A CPM local committee member was shot dead in Murshidabads Burwan this afternoon.         
	The murder took the number of CPM activists killed since Wednesdays civic poll results to five.

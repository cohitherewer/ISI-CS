The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha cautious on quota for Muslims
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha cautious on quota for Muslims
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 28: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today told the CPM state secretariat that no hasty decision should be taken on reservation for Muslims in education and government jobs as recommended by the Ranganath Misra commission, sources said.         
	Forward Bloc veteran Asoke Ghosh is said to have earlier urged the chief minister to set an example by introducing the quota in Bengal.        
	Bhattacharjee, however, told the CPM meeting this evening that he would decide after consulting constitutional experts and discussing the pros and cons in entirety in the Left Front.        
	The Bloc and the CPI want the quota introduced on the ground that the community is economically and educationally backward. But the RSP feels such a quota would help only the creamy layer among Muslims and would be seen as an opportunistic ploy to win back the communitys voters who had deserted the front in recent polls.        
	The allies now want front chairman and state CPM secretary Biman Bose to call a front meeting to discuss the matter.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen and Citu state president Shyamal Chakraborty made it clear after this evenings meeting that the CPM was yet to decide on the matter. They said the party would spell out its position after internal deliberations.         
	A three-day session of the partys state committee begins tomorrow. The proposed quota will be on the agenda for discussion at the partys politburo meeting on February 3, which will be followed by a central committee meeting over the next three days in the city.        
	CPM secretariat member Benoy Konar spoke of the dilemma facing the government and the party even though most state and central leaders favoured the quota.         
	No state government can implement reservation for Muslims as a whole as a religious community because this would require a constitutional amendment. We have put pressure on the Centre for it. In the meantime, we need to consult constitutional experts on how Muslims in Bengal can be offered more jobs and educational opportunities, Konar said.        
	Mohammad Salim, convener of the CPMs internal committee on minorities at the central level and a member of the state secretariat, said: We know reservation cant solve all the problems of Muslims. But we had supported the Mandal Commission recommendations as we found that caste and class identities were largely synonymous and overlapping in case of the backward classes.        
	He said the partys decision would not be Bengal-specific and would be enforced in Left-run Kerala and Tripura too.

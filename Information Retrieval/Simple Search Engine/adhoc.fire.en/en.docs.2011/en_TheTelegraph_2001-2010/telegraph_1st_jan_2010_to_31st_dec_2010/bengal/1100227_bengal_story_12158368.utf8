	Calcutta, Feb. 26: The high court today asked all those who had declared themselves insolvent since April 2008 to evade bank loans and credit card dues to appear before it on March 3. One of them was today told to repay his loan.         
	School jobs saved: The court dismissed a petition demanding the sack for about 40,000 primary school teachers who have certificates from training institutions not recognised by the National Council for Technical Education.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, March 13: A superintendent of a Murshidabad hospital was today paraded in a towel by a family that alleged their son had died because of medical negligence, though a relative said they did not admit the boy yesterday despite the hospitals insistence.        
	Police said Sanjoy Sur, 40, and his brother Balai, 35, along with nearly 50 people attacked the quarters of Gautam Ghosh, the superintendent of the Lalbagh sub-divisional hospital, around 7.30am after Sanjoys son Vishal died.        
	The crowd also pushed and kicked child specialist Utpal De.         
	I have never suffered such humiliation. I was kicked, punched and mentally tortured, said Ghosh, who has been the superintendent of the hospital for two years.         
	In his complaint to Murshidabad police, Ghosh said the mob threatened his wife and child first. When told that I was in the bathroom, they dragged me out, kicked and punched me and then made me walk in public in a towel on the hospital premises.         
	Hospital sources said that when Vishal was brought to the hospital yesterday with high temperature, De had advised immediate admission. But the family took him home. When they brought the boy around 5.30am today, we started a saline drip but he died, De said.        
	Asked why the boy was taken home yesterday, a relative said: We thought Vishal would be alright if he was taken care of at home.

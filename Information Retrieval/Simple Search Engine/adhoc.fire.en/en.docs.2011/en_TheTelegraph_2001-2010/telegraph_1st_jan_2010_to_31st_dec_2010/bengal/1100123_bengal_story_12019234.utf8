The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CBI team faces CPM wrath
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CBI team faces CPM wrath
  - Cadres beat back sleuths during raid on leader house           OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Durgapur, Jan. 22: Citu supporters today kicked and slapped CBI sleuths who had swooped down on the house of a leader under the scanner for allegedly running a racket in connivance with a private security agency engaged by Eastern Coalfields Ltd.        
	Fifteen CBI personnel split themselves into groups this morning and simultaneously raided the ECLs offices at Andal and the quarters of Rajen Samanta, a leader of the coal miners union and also the CPM local committee secretary.        
	Samanta opened the door to his ground-floor quarters when four men led by inspector Sumit Dasgupta knocked around 9.30am, armed with a search warrant.        
	But when the CBI personnel told Samanta his house would be searched, he pushed them, hurriedly shut the door and bolted it.         
	He spread the word about the raid over the phone and 30 Citu supporters landed there within minutes.         
	They took the four CBI men by their collars, dragged them out to a lawn and slapped them, pushed them to the ground and kicked them.         
	In about half an hour, about 300 CPM supporters had gathered.        
	The CBI men pleaded in vain that they had merely come to investigate a complaint. The CPM supporters snatched the search warrant and a copy of an FIR against Samanta and tore them up.        
	We told them we had no political motive. We pleaded with them that we were central government employees doing our job. But Rajen Samanta and the others would not listen. They hurled abuses at us, pushed us to the ground and kicked us, said a CBI sleuth.        
	The four of them were forced to squat on the ground for about an hour until police arrived, having been alerted by other ECL employees in the complex at Bankola, around 30km from Durgapur town.        
	The five policemen from the Ukhra police outpost, 2km away, were outnumbered. After futile attempts to persuade the mob, they called Andal police station, some 7km away.        
	Around 11am, a team led by Andal officer-in-charge Sankha Biswas arrived and scuffled with the mob to free the CBI personnel. The police bundled the four into a jeep and took them away.        
	The raid (on Samantas house) had to be discontinued because of the assault. We have lodged an FIR, said CBI inspector-general .P. Galhotra. Samanta is the prime accused.        
	CBI officials, under the supervision of superintendent (anti-corruption) S.R. Majumdar had started the probe following a complaint, whose source they would not reveal.         
	The complaint, CBI personnel said, was being treated as an FIR.        
	The charge against Samanta, a computer operator, was that he had been making payments against false bills furnished by a security agency based in Calcutta.         
	Madan Bauri, an MLA and member of the CPM zonal committee, said: The raid on Samantas house is politically motivated. We condemn it.        
	The other CBI officials on the job raided the accounts and payments sections of the mining offices of the ECL at Bankola and seized files.         
	Some of those papers, too, were snatched by a group of 50 CPM supporters. The CBI team that went into the local office of the security agency was also heckled.        
	The ECL general manager of the Bankola mining area, Narayan Jha, confirmed the raid on its premises, but refused comment because the probe is on.

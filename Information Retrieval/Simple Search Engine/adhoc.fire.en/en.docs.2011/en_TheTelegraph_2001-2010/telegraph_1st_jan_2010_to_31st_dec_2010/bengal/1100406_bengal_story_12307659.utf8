          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rabindranath Tagore                                  
	Calcutta, April 5: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today announced a committee to celebrate Rabindranath Tagores 150th birth anniversary from May 9.        
	The year-long celebrations will begin from Ponchishe Boishakh (May 9). It will be observed across the state in the form of Tagore-related publications, seminars, panel discussions, exhibitions and other events. It will be a prestigious and memorable event. We want people from all walks of life to be part of the celebrations, the chief minister said at Writers Buildings today.        
	Poet Nirendranath Chakraborty will head the committee that has 28 members now but can be expanded later. The committee will have people from the Natya Akademi, Bangla Akademi, Lalitkala Akademi, Jadavpur and Calcutta universities and various government departments.        
	A collection of Tagores works  Rabindra Rachanabali  will be republished. The state will have to fork out over Rs 1 crore for that.         
	We have the money for that. But we have plans to renovate the Jorasanko Thakurbari (Tagores house in Calcutta) and the Nimtolla Ghat (where he had been cremated). For that, we will look for the Centres assistance. I had written to the Prime Minister about it and he has replied in the affirmative. We hope to get the funds from Delhi but Im not spelling out the amount now, the chief minister said.        
	Asked if he would request Trinamul Congress ministers in Delhi to co-operate with the state government in the celebrations, Bhattacharjee said: I have spoken to the Prime Minister. Now, it is for him to decide whether to ask some in his council of ministers.

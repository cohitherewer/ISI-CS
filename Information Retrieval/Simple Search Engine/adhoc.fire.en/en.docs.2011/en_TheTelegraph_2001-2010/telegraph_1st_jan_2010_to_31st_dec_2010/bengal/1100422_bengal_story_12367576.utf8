	Asansol, April 21: Looting of coal has become such a lucrative proposition for villagers in the Durgapur-Asansol coal belt that many of them have stopped taking up jobs under schemes for the poor.         
	Pilfered coal fetches them almost four times the Rs 70 to Rs 100 they would have earned in a day under the national rural employment guarantee scheme.         
	Some villages here said they earned as much as Rs 400 a day from the illegally mined coal.        
	Villagers dig wells or holes in the earth to reach layers of coal which has its buyers in many of the sponge iron factories, steel rolling mills and brick fields dotting the region.        
	An Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) official said: According to our estimates, 5 to 6 per cent of the 300 lakh tonnes of coal mined annually is stolen.         
	That amounts to 15 lakh tonnes a year.         
	Dealers in smuggled coal pooh-poohed the ECL figure. One of them said around 60 lakh tonnes a year would be a decent estimate.        
	The Telegraph has been carrying an expose on how daylight looting of coal from wagons and mines in the state has resulted in below-capacity generation by power plants and long and frequent power cuts.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has blamed scarcity of coal for the states abysmal power situation.         
	The Telegraph found out that this scarcity was largely because of the rampant looting of coal with active support from police.         
	The so-called coal scarcity has not only hit power generation but also many small and medium industries that depend on the legal route for their source of energy.        
	A section of the Burdwan district administration said it was worried about the coal-theft business, thriving with support from some of its own.        
	The villagers prefer smuggling coal to working for schemes under the rural job guarantee scheme. We have gone door-to-door along with gram panchayat functionaries and urged villagers to come to work, but in vain, said Jayanta Chatterjee, joint block development officer (BDO) of Salanpur in Asansol.        
	In Salanpur, Chatterjee said, projects taken up under the job scheme last year had to be cancelled because of lack of labourers. We had taken up three forestation projects, excavation of three new ponds and construction of three village roads. But as we did not get enough labourers, we could only dig one pond and build one road. The rest of the schemes were cancelled. Of the 14,000 job card holders in the block, only 2,800 turned up for work, said Chatterjee.         
	In neighbouring Jamuria, too, less than a fourth of the 14,000 job card holders turned up for work.        
	We pleaded with the villagers to work but none agreed. It will be difficult for us to carry out work under NREGA if the police dont stop coal smuggling, said Jamuria BDO Sandip Tudu.         
	Raniganj BDO Subodh Ghosh echoed Tudu.         
	The situation changes during monsoon, when the coal pits are flooded. Then villagers armed with job cards queue up at the panchayat offices for work, said Shyamal Majumdar, the Congress deputy chief of the Salanpur panchayat samiti.         
	Majumdar said the scene was no different in nearby Barabani, Kulti and Andal blocks. Across the region, villag- ers armed with shovels and buckets crawl into pits and lift coal, braving the possibility of cave-ins.         
	We are aware of the dangers but cant ignore the money we get. The 100-day work scheme fetches us at most Rs 100 a day but digging coal for the mafia earns us about Rs 400 daily. Police dont disturb us as our bosses pay them huge money, said Iqbal Sheikh, 30, a miner at Barabani.         
	Asim Bauri (name changed), who runs a depot of smuggled coal at Satgram in Jamuria, said: I pay Rs 1 lakh a month to the police. At least 1,000 villagers work under me. They want money and I can afford to pay them better than the government. It is an open secret here. Over 60 lakh tonnes of coal are illegally mined here every year, he said.         
	Burdwan police chief R. Rajsekharan denied allegations that the police accept money from coal smugglers.        
	We try to prevent illegal mining. However, we have to respond to other crimes as well. There is also a shortage of policemen and it is not possible for us to maintain vigil on illegal mining round the clock, he said.

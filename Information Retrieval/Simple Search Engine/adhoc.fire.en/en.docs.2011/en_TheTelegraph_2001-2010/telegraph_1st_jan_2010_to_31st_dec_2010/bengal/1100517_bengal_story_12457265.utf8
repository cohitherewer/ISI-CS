The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong explains split cause 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong explains split cause 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 16: The Congress today came out with a written explanation for the collapse of its civic poll alliance with the Trinamul Congress after being greeted by awkward queries from within the party and outside.        
	In its 12-page poll manifesto, three pages deal with the failure to stitch up the alliance.        
	We had to explain the causes of the collapse because we have been facing awkward queries from voters as well as our ranks, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said. He added some party workers had blamed their leaders for the collapse.         
	The manifesto puts the blame on Trinamul. Despite our best efforts its rigid stand and slighting of our party led to the collapse...        
	It does not mention Trinamuls offer of only 25 of the 141 wards in Calcutta. State Congress vice-president Nityanada De, who drafted the manifesto, said: We deliberately avoided the acrimony over our demand for 51 seats to keep the doors ajar for a future alliance. Instead, we have detailed our sacrifices for her since the 2001 Assembly polls.         
	The manifesto says the Congress had not given tickets to 14 MLAs for the sake of Mamata in 2001. But after the polls, Trinamul broke the alliance to be with the NDA in Delhi.        
	The Congress has also claimed credit for helping Trinamul become the states principal Opposition party. The number of its MLAs in the 294-member House was 29, one short of the number needed for the status. The Congress then backed the Trinamul nominee to help him win a bypoll.        
	Pranab joy        
	Even as the manifesto tried to explain the split, state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee admitted at a rally in Burdwans Katwa that there have been unofficial seat adjustments between the Congress and Trinamul in many places.        
	It is a matter of joy. The absence of an official alliance in the municipal polls does not mean there will not be any alliance again. In the Assembly elections next year, this Opposition alliance will come to power, Mukherjee said.

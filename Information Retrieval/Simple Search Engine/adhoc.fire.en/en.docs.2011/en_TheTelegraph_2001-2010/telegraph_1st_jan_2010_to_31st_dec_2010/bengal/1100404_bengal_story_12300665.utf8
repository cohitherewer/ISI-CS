The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Fire lapse in high-rises
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Fire lapse in high-rises
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, April 3: A joint team of the fire services department, police, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the CESC inspected two prominent high-rises in the city today and found fire-fighting measures inadequate.        
	The afternoon inspections at Queens Mansion and Karnani Estate, on Park Street and AJC Bose Road respectively, coincided with a fire that broke out in an office on BB Ganguly Street.         
	Other offices in the building closed down after the fire broke out around 1.30pm and thick smoke engulfed the place. Fire tenders doused the blaze, believed to have been caused by a short circuit in the electrical mains, in 45 minutes.        
	No one was injured but it could have been bad with so many small cubicles cramped into such a small place, a police officer said.        
	Dipak Sarkar, the deputy director of the fire services, said after todays inspection at the two high-rises: Our inspections have thrown up the pathetic state of fire-fighting preparedness in most of the 13 such buildings that we have visited. Even after the Stephen Court fire, people are yet to pull up their socks.        
	At Queens Mansion, adjacent to Stephen Court, the inspection team found there was only one staircase and hardly any arrangement to fight fires.         
	The team found several illegal constructions on the terrace of Karnani Estate.

	Justice Maharaj Sinha of Calcutta High Court passed an interim order on July 12 directing inspection of the documents by the parties on July 26 in relating to the election to the 6th Balurghat parliamentary constituency which took place last year.        
	In this connection, a news item was published on July 13 stating that the judge had directed recounting of the votes in relation to this constituency.         
	Subsequently, on receiving a copy of the order dated July 19, it was found that the judge did not press any direction for recounting. The article published in The Telegraph on July 13 was incorrect and we regret this mistake.

	Calcutta, June 5: Around 150 mobile phones worth Rs 2.5 lakh were stolen from a store opposite Siemens on Rashbehari Connector, possibly early on Saturday morning.        
	Employees of the Nokia outlet discovered the break-in when they came at 10am.        
	Store-in-charge Sudip Barua, the first to arrive, said: I found the shutter pulled down at an odd angle and the left lock broken.         
	Barua called security guard Krishnadeb Jadav, who lives behind the store. He had heard a noise at 2.30am and seen four youths running away. He thought he had been able to foil an attempted heist, said Barua.

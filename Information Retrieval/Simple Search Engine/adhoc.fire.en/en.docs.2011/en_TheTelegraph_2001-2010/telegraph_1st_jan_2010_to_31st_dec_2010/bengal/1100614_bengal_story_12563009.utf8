The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul flag atop, flutter in CPM office
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul flag atop, flutter in CPM office
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Flying again, is it?                                  
	Bankura, June 13: Two Trinamul Congress flags fluttering atop an active CPM office in Bankura town this morning triggered allegations of an overnight takeover and tension.         
	Police arrived a little after 7am and brought Trinamuls flower-and-grass tricolour down. School education minister Partha De, the local CPM MLA, came soon after and a red flag with a hammer and sickle went up again.        
	Local residents spotted the alleged capture of the three-room, single-storey building, which houses the CPMs Bankura West local committee office, early this morning. Word went around immediately that a change of guard had taken place overnight.        
	Local committee secretary Kunal Roy got the first complaint. He made a frantic call to district party secretary Amiya Patra. Minister De got the next call, within minutes.         
	A police officer said they got the complaint over the phone around 7am and sent a team. A fairly large crowd had gathered by then around the office next to the fire station in the heart of Bankura town.         
	When the police team went to the roof, a man in the crowd called the Trinamul tricolour a flag of change.         
	In the May 30 civic polls, the Left Front won only three of the 23 seats in the Bankura municipality. Trinamul got 14, the figure the Left had notched up in the 2005 polls.        
	The (CPM) local committee secretary (Roy) has filed an FIR but not named anyone, an officer said.        
	Minister De hoisted two CPM flags, one on the roof and one from the verandah. Trinamul has done this. Who else could even think of such an uncivilised act, he said later.         
	We have told the police to keep vigil on the area.        
	Trinamul district working president Arup Chakraborty said his party had no hand in it. The CPM has done this to paint itself as a victim and create a sympathy wave among people. They also want to reunite themselves after the drubbing they got in the municipal elections, he alleged.

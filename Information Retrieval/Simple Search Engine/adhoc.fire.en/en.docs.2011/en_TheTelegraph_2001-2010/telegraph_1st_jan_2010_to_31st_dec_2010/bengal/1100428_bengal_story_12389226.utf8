The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cadres force school shut
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cadres force school shut
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          When the rest of Bengal counted the vehicles on their roads on their fingers, Darjeeling was chock-a-block. Schoolchildren stopped cars to give lessons in road safety. (Suman Tamang)                                  
	Burdwan, April 27: Papiya Khatoon had just settled down when a group of people barged into her classroom, stuffed her books inside the bag and asked her to leave for home.        
	That is how spontaneous the bandh was in Burdwans Raina, where the headmaster of Golgram Gulam Imam High School had dared to keep it open.        
	The students had responded to the headmasters gesture equally, with over 550 of the 900 pupils turning up.        
	But some 40 CPM supporters entered classrooms and asked the students why they had come to school when there was a bandh across the country. They took the textbooks of many students, put them back into their schoolbags and asked them to go home. We watched helplessly, said headmaster Qurban Ali Khan.        
	Raina is one of the few Trinamul Congress-dominated pockets in CPM bastion Burdwan. But Khan said Golgram Gulam Imam High School had stayed open even when Mamata Banerjee had called bandhs in the past.         
	Knowing the schools record, CPM workers had warned the headmaster against keeping it open today.        
	The schools start has been brought forward to 7am from 10 because of the heat and classes started as usual today. Most of our teachers stay close by and most of them come to school during bandhs. If the students attendance is satisfactory, we hold the classes, added Khan, in his early 40s, who comes to school on a motorcycle from Shyamsundarpur, 10 km away.        
	Many guardians, who had accompanied the children to school because of the bandh, were still outside when the cadres marched in at 7.30am. The guardians challenged the intruders. They outnumbered the cadres and ultimately chased them out of the school premises, where there was a scuffle between the two sides.         
	We were furious to find the local CPM workers ordering our children out. So we rushed inside, said Tabarak Hossain, whose son Suraj is in Class VIII.        
	However, the spontaneous bandh defiance took on a political colour with some 700 armed Trinamul activists arriving to confront the CPM cadres. A clash followed, in which many bombs were hurled.        
	The school locked its gates from inside as the battle raged outside. When the Rapid Action Force eventually drove the two groups away, Khan decided not to risk students lives and declared the school closed.         
	Both the CPM and Trinamul denied involvement in the clash.

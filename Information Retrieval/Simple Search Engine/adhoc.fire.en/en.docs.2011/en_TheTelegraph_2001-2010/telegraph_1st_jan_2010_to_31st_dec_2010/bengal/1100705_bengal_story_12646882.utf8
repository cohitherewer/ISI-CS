The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | State prefers bandh to offering fuel tax relief   Shutdown costs Bengal Rs 970 crore, double of 5 per cent levy cut
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      State prefers bandh to offering fuel tax relief     -  Shutdown costs Bengal Rs 970 crore, double of 5 per cent levy cut
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                  
	Calcutta, July 4: The Left has two prescriptions for bringing relief to the common man  one for Delhi and a different one for Calcutta.        
	It wants the Centre to sacrifice a part of its revenues by slashing tax on petroleum products to bring down fuel prices. But in Bengal, its own government prefers to inflict a shutdown on the common man instead of providing tax relief on petrol and diesel.        
	If the Bengal government lowers sales tax on the two fuels by five percentage points, it will lose around Rs 460 crore in revenues. The nation-wide 12-hour shutdown the Left has called on July 5 will cost Bengals economy more than double that amount  around Rs 970 crore. (See chart)        
	The general strike is meant to protest the Centres decision to raise the prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene and cooking gas and to deregulate the market. Unlike in most other states, the Left will not find it difficult to enforce a total shutdown in Bengal.        
	The Left parties want the Centre to slash the taxes and duties on petroleum products (but) the Left government in Bengal can do the same and give relief to the people, said an academic who teaches economics at a leading Calcutta college.        
	The Bengal government levies a 25 per cent sales tax on petrol and a 17 per cent sales tax on diesel. Besides, it has been collecting a Re 1 cess from every litre of petrol and diesel sold in the state for the past 15 years to generate the money to build bridges, flyovers and highways.        
	Based on last weeks revised fuel prices, these levies will bring the state Rs 1,950 crore in revenues: Rs 550 crore from the petrol tax, Rs 1,150 crore from the diesel tax and Rs 250 crore from the cess.        
	The price revision, however, has raised petrol and diesel prices in Calcutta by Rs 3.65 and Rs 1.95, respectively.        
	What if the state slashed the fuel sales tax by five percentage points (from 25 to 20 per cent for petrol and from 17 to 12 per cent for diesel)?        
	The retail price of petrol would then fall by more than Rs 2 and the price of diesel by nearly Rs 1.75, state finance department sources told The Telegraph. They added that the Rs 460 crore such a move would cost the state was less than 5 per cent of the Bengal governments total annual sales tax collection of Rs 10,500 crore.        
	How much would the shutdown cost the states economy? The figure can be arrived at by dividing Bengals net state domestic product  the value of goods and services produced in a year  by 365.        
	Measured in current prices, the gross state domestic product of Bengal for 2009-10 was Rs 3,53,967.15 crore. Divided by 365, this comes to Rs 969.77 crore  about Rs 510 crore more than what the state government would have sacrificed by cutting sales tax.        
	A strike could have been avoided had the government decided to forgo Rs 460 crore, a senior state government official said.        
	However, with food inflation at 17 per cent and general inflation entering double digits, the fuel price hike has given the embattled Left an issue to target the Congress in Delhi and its ally Trinamul Congress in Bengal.        
	State finance minister Asim Dasgupta was amazed at the suggestion that the state exchequer take a hit by slashing fuel sales taxes.        
	This is a weird argument. How is it possible that the Centre will increase fuel prices and the state will cushion the impact by reducing sales taxes? That will put a strain on our development expenditure, he said.        
	Dasgupta, who is chairman of the empowered committee of state finance ministers, said the panel had decided that any proposal to reduce sales tax on petrol and diesel at the state level would be adopted only after a consensus among its members.        
	The retail prices of petrol and diesel in Bengal are lower than those in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. So why blame us? Its the Centres duty to provide subsidy on items that are on the Union list. So train your guns at the Union government, Dasgupta said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, March 24: Suspected Maoists last night shot dead a former CPM worker, who had severed ties with the party following Maoist threats, at a village about 25km from Lalgarh.        
	Basir Khan, 53, a meat seller and resident of Joynagar in Jhargram, had quit the CPM in June last year.        
	Police said that around 9.30pm yesterday, a group of about a dozen rebels, armed with guns, called Basir out of his home. The Maoists told us that my brother had been found guilty in a peoples court and dragged him away, said Sheikh Kasem, Basirs younger brother.        
	Kasem said the villagers heard a gun shot around 10.30 pm. We did not dare venture out at night. My brothers body was found in a field on the outskirts of the village this morning. The Maoists did not spare him even though he had severed all ties with the CPM, Kasem said.        
	District superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the Maoists had killed Basir. They are killing people to spread panic.

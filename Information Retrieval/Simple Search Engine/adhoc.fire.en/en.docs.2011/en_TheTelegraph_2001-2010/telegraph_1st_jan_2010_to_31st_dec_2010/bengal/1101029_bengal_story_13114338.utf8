The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | MLA widow forsaken by equal-rights sons 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      MLA widow forsaken by equal-rights sons 
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE AND INDRANIL SARKAR                           Dulalisundari. Dhiman Roy                                  
	Bhatar (Burdwan), Oct. 28: The 76-year-old widow of a former MLA is running from pillar to post to find a place in her own home from where she was driven out by her sons one-and-a-half years ago.        
	Dulalisundari Hazra, who hails from Palar village in Burdwans Bhatar, had sought police help after failing to get any aid from the Congress, the party her husband Shantimoy had represented as an MLA in 1969.        
	Under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2008, a son who inherits the property of his father or mother has to look after them when they are in need and pay for their maintenance. Shantimoy died of a heart attack on January 20, 2008, leaving behind his wife, two sons and four daughters, all of whom are married.         
	Dulalisundari used to live with her younger son Asit, 50, a farmer, after her husbands death. She used to get Rs 3,000, half the amount of her husbands MLA pension.        
	Trouble started one-and-a-half years ago when Asit asked Dulalisundari to hand over the money to him for her upkeep. While dividing his 15-acre land between his two sons, my husband had given five bighas more to Asit on the condition that he would take care of me after his death, Dulalisundari said. When I refused to part with the money, Asit dragged me by the hair and threw me out of our house, she said.        
	Her elder son Asim, 55, who lives in another portion of the house, had told his father that he could not take care of Dulalisundari as he had a 30-year-old unemployed son.         
	I begged my sons for a single room in my husbands house and told them they would not have to provide me food. But my requests fell on deaf ears, she said.         
	After being driven out, Dulalisundari had stayed for a few weeks at a distant relatives house in a nearby village. She then spent a few days at the homes of her daughters in Burdwan, South 24-Parganas and Calcutta. She is now staying with a cousin at Kulsona village in Bhatar.         
	Last week, I urged the police to ask my sons to allow me to return to my home, Dulalisundari said. Sanjay Kundu, the officer in charge of Bhatar police station, said if Dulalisundaris sons did not agree to let her live in her husbands home, a criminal case would be initiated against them.         
	Asim said his father had a soft corner for my younger brother and he himself decided that our mother would live with Asit. Asit, however, asked why he alone should take the responsibility of Dulalisundaris upkeep. Both of us have taken shares of our fathers property. So our duty towards our mother is equal. I am ready to look after my mother for six months a year. Let my brother take care of her for the remaining six months, he said.        
	The Congress MLA from Katwa, Rabindranath Chatterjee, claimed the party had tried to solve the problem but her sons were adamant. Now the police will have to settle the matter, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hope of more rain
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hope of more rain
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: The next 24 to 48 hours hold out hope of more rain because of the formation of a low-pressure trough over the Bay of Bengal near the Bengal coastline, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said today.        
	The low-pressure trough caused todays rainfall, an IMD official said.        
	The lack of low-pressure formations over the Bay of Bengal was the primary reason for the deficient rainfall in the state so far, the official said.         
	Met officials said the low-pressure trough was conducive to the formation of thunderclouds over south Bengal. Thunderclouds bring persistent and heavy showers.         
	Calcutta received 8.7mm rain till 5.30pm on Saturday as a result of which the mercury dipped by about three degrees.        
	Tomorrows minimum temperature is expected to be lower than normal.         
	The low-pressure trough has enough strength to ensure rain for at least another day or two in Calcutta and its outskirts, said .P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.         
	Rainfall is likely in all the coastal districts over the next 24 hours. However, there is no reason yet to issue an alert for fishermen against venturing into the high seas, Sharma told The Telegraph.         
	Flight services at Calcutta airport were disrupted this afternoon because of the rain and rough winds.         
	Drought funds        
	The state government today told the central team that completed its four-day tour of the drought-hit districts that additional funds would be needed from the Centre to cope with the situation. The state had earlier asked for Rs 1,100 crore from the Centre.

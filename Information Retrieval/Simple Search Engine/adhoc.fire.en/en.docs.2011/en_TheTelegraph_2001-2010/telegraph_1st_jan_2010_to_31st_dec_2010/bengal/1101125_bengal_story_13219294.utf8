                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      More teachers in pension plan
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 24: The state government has issued an order saying schoolteachers who retired before April 1981 would be given pension, following a Calcutta High Court directive.        
	The widows of teachers who retired before that period would be eligible for pension with retrospective effect from June 15, 1990. The sum will be half of what their husbands would have got.         
	The pension arrears from the cut-off dates would also be paid.        
	The government order estimates that more than 50,000 retired teachers or their widows would get the benefit.        
	At present, only teachers who retired after April 1, 1981, or their widows are entitled to pension.         
	The high court had ordered the state government on March 9, 2010, to revise the cut-off date to April 1981 on an appeal from the widows of six retired teachers.         
	The state government lawyer will submit the order before Justice D. Kargupta within a couple of days, when the plea of the six widows are scheduled to be heard.         
	The government order says: Since compliance of the order involved important policy decision(s) and additional financial liabilities for the state government, the education department had referred the matter to the finance department. After a lot of deliberations and (a) number of meetings, the finance department on October 2, 2010, finally agreed to extend pension benefits to the teachers who retired before April 1981.        
	The lawyers of the six petitioners had told the court that the state government had in March 1998 declared that the teachers who retired before April 1981 would come under the pension ambit.        
	But after receiving a huge number of applications from retired teachers, the government, in 2002, decided against paying the pension, one of the lawyers had told the court.

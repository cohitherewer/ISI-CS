          OUR BUREAU                          A jawan at the venue of Bhattacharjees rally in Balarampur. (Mita Roy)                                  
	Purulia, Nov. 13: Helicopters are scanning the Ayodhya Hills and more than 3,000 security personnel are manning the ground below as part of security arrangements for the chief ministers rally tomorrow in Purulias Balarampur, which has witnessed 16 Maoist attacks this year on people with CPM ties.         
	The security measures have been stepped up after yesterdays encounter in which the joint forces killed two Maoists at a place 40km from Balarampur.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit is expected to boost the morale of the cadres in Balarampur and its neighbourhood. Maoists have killed 10 CPM leaders in the area so far this year. The Maoists have set ablaze the houses of some party leaders and cadres. Several CPM leaders in Balarampur have fled their homes in the face of Maoist threats.        
	We requested the chief minister to hold the rally in Balarampur so that our men get the moral support they need to fight back against the Maoists, said district CPM leader Manindra Gope.         
	The security arrangements for Bhattacharjee are being supervised by 10 IPS officers above the rank of additional superintendent of police. Around 1,800 assistant sub-inspectors and constables are manning the road from Durgapur to Balarampur.         
	Around 1,200 CRPF personnel today combed the Ayodhya Hills. Two helicopters maintained aerial surveillance over the hills throughout the day. The police said they wanted to stop the Maoists from coming anywhere near the venue of the chief ministers rally.

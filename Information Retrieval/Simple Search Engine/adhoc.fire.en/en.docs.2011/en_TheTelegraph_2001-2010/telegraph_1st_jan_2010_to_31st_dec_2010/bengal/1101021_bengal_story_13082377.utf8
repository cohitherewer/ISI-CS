          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 20: The CPM today seized the chance to get back at Mamata Banerjee, saying the string of trains and stations she has been inaugurating was cheap political gimmick at the cost of passenger safety.        
	Bengals ruling comrades, buffeted by a series of election setbacks, zeroed in on this mornings Metro derailment and said that in the coming days, they would showcase her failures as rail minister.        
	Trinamul Congress leaders and their party chief should hang their heads in shame at the current state of affairs in the railways, CPM central committee member Shyamal Chakraborty said.        
	There is no track maintenance, safety measures do not exist and passengers are now feeling insecure to travel by trains. A series of railway accidents occurred but the minister is not bothered. Todays mishap in the underground Metro is even more serious.        
	Two coaches of a Metro train got derailed near Central station during the morning rush hour, triggering panic among hundreds of office-goers and disrupting services.        
	Referring to the unending launch of new trains and stations, Chakraborty said: Our railway minister believes in cheap politics. We will have to expose that. People have started realising that she is doing all this with an eye on the 2011 Assembly elections. But we will make the people aware that all this is being done at the cost of the safety and security of railway commuters.         
	CPM sources said the party would reach out to every corner of the state with the message that Mamatas handling of the railway portfolio had wreaked havoc in Bengal and it was an indication of how things could be if Trinamul came to power.        
	The series of train mishaps and the number of Metro railway incidents have created fear in the minds of the people, said CPM state secretariat member Rabin Deb. Many people are surprised to find her inaugurating trains or laying foundation stones for railway projects every second day but caring little about safety standards or maintenance after having spent 521 days as railway minister. We will definitely take this to the people.        
	Deb didnt elaborate on the incidents but was obviously alluding to last weeks dark half-hour Metro passengers had to spend inside a tunnel after power supply snapped. Then, delays caused by overcrowding have been a regular affair.        
	Deb said people were realising that Mamata hardly spent any time in Delhi to attend to her ministerial work. People have begun raising their voices. Its for them to realise what will happen if a party like Trinamul comes to power, he added.        
	Mamata has been criticised by the Opposition for her frequent absence from Delhi, but she has defended her stay in Calcutta saying the national capital was not her home.        
	CPM sources said the party was also thinking of bringing out a booklet on the poor show of the railway ministry. The booklet, the sources added, will also highlight how Mamata is trying to award railway contracts to big companies in the US to generate employment there while not carrying out any recruitment drive in the country.

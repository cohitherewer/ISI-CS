          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Durgapur, Sept. 13: The parents of a six-year-old girl who cannot walk because of a nerve disorder have allegedly been asked by the school where she studies to either pay five times the fees for special attention and coaching or withdraw her from the institution.        
	The parents of Sanjibani Das, a KG student, have complained to the subdivisional officer that the authorities of Apex School in Durgapur have asked them to pay Rs 1,200 in addition to the Rs 300 fee.         
	The school authorities have denied the charge, claiming they had merely told the parents, Sunil and Sulekha Das, that their daughter was inattentive in class and cried frequently.         
	Sulekha said that after the couple told the school they could not pay so much money, the teachers and the headmistress started misbehaving with Sanjibani. School staff have even stopped helping her go to the toilet, Sulekha alleged.        
	Subdivisional officer Moumita Das said: I have spoken to Sanjibani and found her behaviour quite normal. I have asked the school to take proper care of her.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | PCPA case
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      PCPA case
                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 21: The bail petitions moved by Chhatradhar Mahato, general secretary of Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA), and alleged Maoist, Sukhshanti Baskey, were rejected in Calcutta High Court today after their lawyer declined to proceed with the hearings.        
	So far Mahato and Baskey are concerned, we do not want to proceed with the hearings, Jaymalya Bagchi, the lawyer appearing for Mahato, told the high court.        
	The lawyer, however, said that he would like to continue with the hearings on bail petitions of Raja Sarkhel and Prasun Chatterjee, who were arrested from Jadavpur on the charges of keeping close contacts with Maoists.         
	The division bench comprising Chief Justice J N Patel and Justice A K Roy , after hearing the submission by Bagchi, adjourned the hearing of the bail pleas by Sarkhel and Chatterjee till January 5.        
	The bail petitions moved by Mahato, Baskey, Sarkhel and Chatterjee came up for hearing before the division bench a month ago.        
	The bench had directed the state authorities to produce the documents it had seized from the possessions of the petitioners during their arrest.         
	 Accordingly, the public prosecutor, Ashimesh Goswami, produced the seized documents before the court.        
	After production of the said documents, the lawyer appearing for Mahato and Baskey felt it better not to press for hearing. As the lawyer declined to proceed, the bail pleas by Mahato and Baskey, were automatically considered as rejected.

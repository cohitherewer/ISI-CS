The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rajan gang cloud after D-war
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rajan gang cloud after D-war
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Calcutta, July 5: Some members of underworld don Chhota Rajans gang who had clashed with Dawood Ibrahims henchmen in a Nepal village close to Bengal may have entered Siliguri and could even slip into Calcutta, an intelligence branch report has said.        
	Two members of Rajans gang were killed and one suffered injuries in the clash at Kakarvitta village in Nepals Jhapa district on Saturday, the report says. The gang members may have come to Siliguri for medical treatment, the report adds.         
	A special task force (STF) has been sent to Siliguri.        
	The report, submitted to the state government yesterday, says the gangsters may come to Calcutta if the injuries suffered by their colleague is serious enough.         
	We are aware of the situation and are keeping a watch. We cannot share any information on the movement of the Rajan gang because the investigation is under way, said STF chief Rajeev Kumar.        
	The report says the clash took place on Saturday afternoon when Sunil Pandey and Manoj Singh, close aides of Rabi Pujari, the Rajan gangs agent in Nepal, were attacked on their way to Kakarvitta.        
	Sunil was going to Kakarvitta with Manoj and some other associates to meet his girlfriend. On the way, their black Scorpio was stopped by a maroon Qualis, carrying three or four gangsters from Dawoods group, the report says.         
	After Sunil, Manoj and their associates got off their car, the rival gang started firing at them. Rajans men were caught unawares.        
	As the duo slumped to the ground after being hit by bullets, their associates opened fire but Dawoods gang was heavily armed and better prepared. Soon the associates left Sunil and Manoj and escaped in their car, an intelligence branch officer said.        
	The attackers then dragged Sunil and Manoj into their Qualis and fled towards Kakarvitta, another intelligence officer said.         
	Sources said Sunil and Manoj died in the clash.         
	We have come to know that Sunil died on the spot while Manoj, who sustained serious injuries, died later, an officer said.         
	Sources said the members of Rajans gang who escaped may have entered Siliguri so that their injured friend could get better treatment.        
	I dont think Rajans men would have taken the risk of staying on in Nepal after the attack because the D-Company has a strong base in that country, which is considered a haven for smuggling and fake currency rackets. They would have found it difficult to take the injured to Kathmandu, an intelligence official said.         
	The STF officers and intelligence personnel have searched all healthcare units in Siliguri but are yet to find anybody admitted with bullet injuries, the sources said.

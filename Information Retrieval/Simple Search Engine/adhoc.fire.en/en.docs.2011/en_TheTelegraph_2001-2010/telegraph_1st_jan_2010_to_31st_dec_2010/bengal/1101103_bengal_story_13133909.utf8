The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Salboni case stuck in two-year limbo
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Salboni case stuck in two-year limbo
  - Blast that still echoes in Bengal          PRONAB MONDAL                            (Top) An escort car accompanying then Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and his deputy Jitin Prasada which bore the brunt of the Salboni blast on November 2, 2008. Both ministers had escaped unhurt and police said the actual target was chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee (above), whose convoy had passed the area, 150km from Calcutta, minutes before                                 
	Calcutta, Nov. 2: Police have failed to submit a chargesheet in the Maoist-triggered Salboni blast aimed at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee because of lack of sufficient evidence till today  exactly two years from the day of the incident.        
	The crackdown that followed the explosion gave birth to the Lalgarh movement and turned the area into a rebel hotbed. But in the two intervening years, the police have not been able to stitch together the story, with precise details, about how exactly the blast was carried out.        
	We know that it was the Maoists who carried out the blast targeting the chief ministers convoy. But we dont know who detonated the device or who exactly among the rebels planted it or when it was placed along the chief ministers route. Unless we can mention all these in the chargesheet, it wont stand scrutiny in a court of law, an officer said.         
	The chargesheet was to be submitted within 90 days of the incident. It can be filed later but courts take a lenient view of charges in such cases.        
	The police say they are still in the dark on who exactly played what part in the blast, which occurred while the chief minister was returning to Midnapore after inaugurating the Jindals steel project in Salboni. The blast missed its target and damaged some police jeeps.        
	The investigators had, however, been able to put together the conspiracy part after interrogating Kobad Ghandy, a politburo member of CPI (Maoist), in Delhis Tihar jail, a few months after his arrest last year.        
	Ghandy confessed the plot against the chief minister was hatched at a high-level meeting of the Maoists in mid-2007. The central committee of the CPI (Maoist) assigned the job to the Bengal state committee. The state committee, in turn, handed over the task to the Bihar-Jharkhand-Orissa regional committee, the officer said.        
	Earlier investigations had revealed that a squad led by Sashadhar Mahato, brother of Chhatradhar, the arrested leader of the rebel-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCPA), carried out the explosion. But thereafter, the probe hit a dead-end and the police were unable to get any clinching information.        
	The police admitted that just after the incident, the cops went berserk, picking up innocent people, including schoolchildren, and putting them behind bars. The police were even accused of beating up pregnant women in their desperation to catch the culprits.        
	Under pressure from local people, who were backed by the Maoists, the schoolchildren were released without charges. But the public backlash that followed the blast derailed the investigation.        
	The officer said the Lalgarh movement sparked by the crackdown threw the probe off track. The movement in Lalgarh, with full backing of the Maoists, spiralled after this (the protests) and the police had to back off to prevent the situation from getting worse. Instead of carrying out a proper investigation, we were suddenly tackling a new problem for which we ourselves were largely to blame.         
	P. Neerajnayan, the CID inspector-general who is heading the probe, could not set any time. Investigations are on. We will submit the chargesheet once it is over, he said.

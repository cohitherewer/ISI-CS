                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong and Trinamul patch up
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Siliguri, March, 30: The Trinamul Congress and the Congress today decided to form the Siliguri Municipal Corporation board together, ending a cold war between them and sending out a signal of unity ahead of the civic polls to be held across the state in May.         
	Leaders of the two parties together announced that the decision was taken under instructions from their high commands to further firm up the bond between them.        
	After the alliances victory in the polls last September, both Trinamul and the Congress had staked claim to the mayors chair. Ultimately, at the behest of Mamata rival and Congress MP Deepa Das Munshi, the Congress formed the board with the backing of the Left and the Congresss Gangotri Datta became the mayor. An angry Trinamul then decided to sit in the opposition.        
	Gangotri told a news conference today she was willing to step down. I will offer my post to Trinamul if it is necessary for the sake of the alliance.        
	However, no decision on the mayor or the composition of the mayors-in-council was announced today.        
	Darjeeling district Congress chief Shankar Malakar said: At a meeting with the Trinamul leadership today we concluded that the board could no longer run with outside support from the CPM.         
	The people of Siliguri had voted for us to see the alliance run the civic body, said local Trinamul leader Gautam Deb.

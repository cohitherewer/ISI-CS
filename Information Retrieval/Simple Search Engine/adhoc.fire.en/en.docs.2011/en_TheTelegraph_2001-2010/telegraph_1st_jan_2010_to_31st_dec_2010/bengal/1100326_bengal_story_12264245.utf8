          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 25: A young man posing as an executive befriended two passengers of the Howrah-bound Rajdhani Express and escaped with a laptop, a digital camera, a cellphone and cash in the early hours today.        
	Police said Mahendra Kumar Choudhury, 61, a businessman, and Satyajit Banerjee, 48, an engineer, lodged a complaint after the train reached Howrah station around 2.30pm today. Police sources said Choudhury, a resident of Jabbalpur, and Delhi-based Banerjee were travelling in separate compartments.         
	Choudhury said in his complaint that the man, who identified himself as J. Kumar, had boarded the train from Allahabad after booking a ticket for Rs 2,700 from the ticket examiners.        
	I was on the upper berth and Kumar was on the lower berth. He told me he was an executive working in a private company and was going to Calcutta on an official tour. He wore a pair of trousers and shirt with a tie on. He was speaking fluently in English and Hindi, Choudhury said.        
	When the train reached Mughalsarai station around 5.30am, Choudhury woke up to find that his bag, containing Rs 10,000 and some documents, was missing. Kumar was nowhere to be seen.         
	Banerjee, travelling three compartments away, said in his complaint that the same man had befriended him. He chatted with me for around 20 minutes after which I went off to sleep, Banerjee said. Around 6 in the morning, he woke up to find that his bag, containing a laptop, a digital camera, a cellphone and Rs 5,000 was also missing.         
	Banerjees bag was later found empty inside a toilet of the train.

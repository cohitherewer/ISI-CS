                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Puja thugs lock up teachers

	Tamluk, Oct. 5: Thirty-five teachers, including 10 women, were locked up in their East Midnapore school for four hours and some of them were beaten up by members of a local club demanding a puja subscription of Rs 12,000.        
	One of the teachers who were under the siege at the Deuli Adarsha Vidyapith in Moynas Deuli last evening was kept confined for over an hour even after he told the club members that his mother had died. The rest were rescued by police around 9pm.        
	Headmaster Amitesh Bera, among those locked up, declared the school closed indefinitely from today till the culprits are arrested and we are assured of security.        
	The headmaster said the 35 teachers had held a meeting on Saturday and decided they could pay at the most Rs 100 each  a total of Rs 3,500 for the Durga puja organised by All Star Club on the school ground for the past 50 years.        
	There was never any pressure earlier on the subscription. A week ago, some youths from the club demanded Rs 12,000. We decided we were ready to pay Rs 100 each, said Bera.        
	But the club members got word of the reluctance. Yesterday morning, some of them beat up teachers Basudeb Das, Swapan Das, Prasanta Chakraborty and Kalipada Bhowmik  among those who had been most vociferous in opposing the demand for Rs 12,000  just as they were about to enter the school for the day.        
	We informed the police and a team arrived in the afternoon. The policemen told us they would settle the matter through discussions. But after the school gave over at 5pm, around 50 club members barged into the staff room and beat up Das again, Bera said.         
	Two other teachers who tried to save Das were also thrashed. Das had to be admitted to the Moyna block hospital.         
	The club members snatched our mobiles and locked us up in the staff room, said Swapan Das, the Bengali teacher.        
	History teacher Sukumar Maity learnt about his mothers death just when the trouble started. I pleaded with them that my mother had died and I wanted to go home. They let me go only around 6pm and returned my mobile, said Maity.

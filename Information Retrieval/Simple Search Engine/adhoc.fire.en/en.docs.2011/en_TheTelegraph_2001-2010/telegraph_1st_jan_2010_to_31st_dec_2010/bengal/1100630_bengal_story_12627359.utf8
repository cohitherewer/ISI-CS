The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist leaders held in city
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoist leaders held in city
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 29: Five Maoists, including a state committee member and a zonal committee leader, were arrested from the southern outskirts of Calcutta in an operation that stretched from late last night to early this morning.        
	Of the five, four were active in and ar-ound Nandigram. The police said their prize catch, 44-year-old state committee member Madhusudan Mandal, was involved in the murder of Trinamuls Sonachura gram panchayat chief Nishikanta Mandal last year.        
	Madhusudan, who is from Haldia, is our biggest catch since the arrest of Telugu Deepak, said CID inspector-general P. Nirajnayan. He is a close associate of Deepak, also a CPI (Maoist) state committee member. The two had been tasked with spreading the Maoist base in Nandigram.        
	Among those arrested was Sachin Ghoshal, 43, from Bagnan, Howrah, who allegedly provided technical and logistical support to the members of the outfit.         
	The police tracked them with the help of telephone intercepts. We came to know Madhusudan and 19-year-old Rajesh Mandal will meet Sachin at Amtala in South 24-Parganas, an officer said.        
	Sachin has been on the polices radar for almost a year. Our officers had rented a house near his Bagnan home, an officer said. A team decided to tail him last night with the hope of closing in on some others as well. He took a local train to Howrah and from there a bus bound for Amtala.         
	When Sachin met two others, the police did not know how to confirm their identities. We did not have Madhusudans photographs but knew he had six fingers on his right hand, an officer said. Count confirmed, we swooped down.        
	The police found out that young Raj- esh actually worked for his father Sanjay. Rajeshs father and Nandigram zonal committee member Siddhartha Mandal stayed in a rented house in Garia.         
	Early this morning, the police picked up Sanjay and Siddhartha from Garia.         
	Sanjay had helped Khejuri resident Siddhartha get a job in a Sonarpur factory, said Nirajnayan.         
	State police chief Bhupinder Singh described them as significant arrests. All five have been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.        
	Bapi Mahato, the prime accused in Jnaneswari Express sabotage case, recorded his statement in front of a magistrate at the CBIs special court today.

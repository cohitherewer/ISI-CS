The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress to follow Mamata to Lalgarh
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Congress to follow Mamata to Lalgarh
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 11: The Congress today announced it would organise a rally in Lalgarh on November 10, apparently taking a cue from Mamata Banerjee who had addressed a public meeting there on August 9.         
	We will organise a rally in Lalgarh on November 10 to protest the terror the CPM has unleashed in the state. All state Congress leaders will participate in the programme, Bengal Congress chief Manas Bhuniya said this afternoon.        
	Bhuniya and some Congress MLAs and councillors today went to Raj Bhavan to appraise governor M.K. Narayanan on how the CPM had set up armed camps in Jungle Mahal with the help of the joint forces, a claim often made by the Trinamul Congress chief.         
	We informed the governor about the deteriorating law-and-order situation in the state and sought his intervention to ensure the rule of law, Bhuniya told reporters.         
	Bhuniya said the Congress team had submitted to Narayanan a memorandum on how the CPM was misusing the joint forces.        
	Bhuniya insisted the Congresss decision to organise a rally in Lalgarh had not been prompted by Mamatas meeting there.

	Midnapore, May 31: Fifty Jnaneswari victims who remain unidentified will be shifted in specially equipped trucks to larger morgues in Calcutta tomorrow morning.        
	The morgue at the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, where the bodies are kept now, has only 12 refrigerated drawers. Most of the bodies have been kept on ice slabs on the floor.        
	With the stench of the decaying bodies spreading outside the hospital compound, we requested the health department for the shift, said Parthapratim Pradhan, superintendent of the Midnapore hospital.        
	In Calcutta, the bodies will kept at the Kantapukur morgue at Mominpur.         
	By this evening, 27 people had given blood samples for DNA testing, to be done in Calcutta to identify the bodies that are beyond recognition.         
	Some of the bodies can be identified. But their relatives may be staying far away or do not know yet that they have died, Pradhan said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha calls off hills strike
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Morcha calls off hills strike
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, Dec. 18: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has withdrawn its scheduled 48-hour hills strike from December 21 after meeting top Congress and BJP leaders in Delhi over the past two days.         
	The decision was announced at a news conference held by Morcha chief Bimal Gurung and the Darjeeling MP, the BJPs Jaswant Singh.        
	Singh said there was no need to do anything hastily as the talks over the interim set-up for the hills had been positive and were going in the right direction.         
	We met L.K. Advani today. He appealed to us to withdraw the strike, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said over the phone from Delhi.        
	Pranab Mukherjee too had made the same request yesterday. Besides, Christmas is round the corner. Taking all these into account, we have decided to withdraw the strike.        
	Gurung had set a December 20 deadline for inking the deal on the interim set-up for the hills. He had said the party would call a two-day strike if the deadline was not met.         
	But the Morcha decided to call off the strike after Mukherjee, the Union finance minister, assured it at a meeting yesterday that he would ask the home ministry about the contentious issues involving the set-up. Rahul Gandhi too was present at the meeting.        
	Morcha sources said Gurung had complained to Mukherjee and Rahul that the state government was dragging its feet on the set-up.        
	Giri said the party would probably hold a public meeting in the hills on January 3 where our future plans and programmes will be announced.         
	The Morcha has stopped work in all government offices in the hills since December 6, except banks, post offices and insurance offices, as part of its non-cooperation movement against the state government.        
	Several issues relating to the interim set-up are yet to be resolved. These include the territorial jurisdiction of the set-up, the mode of selection to the board that will govern the arrangement, and the transfer of the tauzi department, which keeps land records, to the set-up.         
	While the state government wants the board to be formed through an election, the Morcha wants to nominate its members.        
	The Morcha also wants parts of the Gorkha-majority areas in the Dooars and the Terai to be included in the interim arrangement. The state government has not agreed to this.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha rebel jab draws Didi courage rap
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee at the rally in Midnapore. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Midnapore, Oct. 2: Mamata Banerjees October 6 meeting at Midnapore town would be held in collusion with Maoists, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today, provoking her to allege that he did not have the courage to go to Lalgarh.        
	Uncharacteristically, the chief minister named the Trinamul Congress chief as he attacked her at a Left Front rally in Midnapore town.         
	We have a political party called Trinamul, which is hand in glove with Maoists. Why did Mamata Banerjee visit Lalgarh? Why is she now saying she will visit Midnapore town? She will help the Maoists spread their tentacles in West Midnapore, he said.        
	The Trinamul leader will come to this district to hold a meeting in collusion with the Maoists, who were behind the Jnaneswari Express tragedy. Our main task will be to unmask Trinamul and its links with the reactionary forces.        
	The Trinamul chief, who had held a rally in Lalgarh on August 9, had said yesterday that she would address a meeting in Midnapore on October 6.         
	Trinamul sources said Mamatas rally would be an answer to Buddhababus public meeting today.        
	Before leaving for Delhi this evening, the railway minister said: The chief minister does not have the courage to visit Lalgarh. Thats why he held the rally at Midnapore town. He also has the noble purpose of standing by his party goons, who assembled at the rally. The people of Jungle Mahal have deserted the CPM because of its torture, murders and neglect.         
	Mamata repeated her demand for the withdrawal of the joint forces from Jungle Mahal. She said she would speak to the Prime Minister and brief him on the situation in the troubled areas of West Midnapore.        
	I have told the Prime Minister and the Union home minister several times about the need to withdraw the joint forces from Jungle Mahal as they are being used by the CPM to recapture one village after another. I feel that the forces should be taken off. I will again urge the Prime Minister for their withdrawal, she said.        
	The chief minister said our men had begun to resist the Maoists and appealed to the security forces to intensify their anti-rebel operations         
	The people of Midnapore are making a turnaround. The ground situation is changing in Goaltore, Salboni and Jhargram. Our men have begun putting up resistance against the rebels. Our party men will have to keep alive the struggle against the Maoists. For this, the police will also have to do their bit by intensifying their operations.        
	Bhattacharjee said the Maoists must be forced to retreat into Jharkhand and Orissa. However, he urged the police not to arrest or torture innocent people.         
	Be restrained in your moves, he said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Aug. 23: A Tamluk court today denied bail to truck driver Gurjant Singh and remanded him in two days judicial custody.        
	The court also served a show-cause notice on the CID officer investigating the case for failing to produce the case diary, including a report on Mamata Banerjees injury.         
	The court will hear the case again on Wednesday. Investigating officer Tapan Kumar Aditya has been asked to be present on that day.         
	Gurjants truck had rammed into Mamatas convoy when she was returning from her August 9 Lalgarh rally.        
	Aditya informed the court that forensic officers who had examined Gurjants truck were yet to submit their report. He also told the court that Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari, who had filed the complaint against Gurjant, has not given his statement yet.         
	The officer told the court that if Gurjant was granted bail, he might leave the state, or even the country.

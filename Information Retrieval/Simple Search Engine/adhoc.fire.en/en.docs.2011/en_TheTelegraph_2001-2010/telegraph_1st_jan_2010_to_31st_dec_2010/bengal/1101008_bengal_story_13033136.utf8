The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Manas dig at Didi from CPM dais
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Manas dig at Didi from CPM dais
          OUR BUREAU                                          Bhuniya at the New Town event. (Pradip Sanyal)    
	Calcutta, Oct. 7: Bengal Congress chief Manas Bhuniya apparently criticised Mamata Banerjee for staying away from a state government programme today to christen New Town Rajarhat as Jyoti Basu Nagar.        
	However, Bhuniya was careful not to name either Mamata or the Trinamul Congress during his 45-minute speech at the event, where he shared the stage with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjeee, CPM state secretary Biman Bose and housing minister Gautam Deb.         
	Maintaining that his party had ideological differences with the communists, Bhuniya said: In a parliamentary democracy, I cannot stop talking to the elected representatives of the people. I cannot stop seeing their faces, saying I dont like them. I cannot stay away when I am invited to such events. That is not the Congresss political culture.         
	When I was invited to the programme, I was certain I was going to attend. The Congress believes in working together with political parties across the divide for the welfare of the people, he added.        
	Deb iterated his claim that he had sent an invite to Mamata for the programme. However, this could not be independently confirmed. She chose not to come. We keep inviting her (to state government events) and she keeps insisting she wont see our faces, he said.         
	Trinamul sources said it was the partys avowed stand to boycott programmes attended by the chief minister.         
	However, Bhuniya said one had to acknowledge that the communists have participated in parliamentary democracy and ruled the state for over three decades.         
	As the CPM supporters attending the event clapped, party leaders on the dais, including the chief minister, were seen smiling and whispering among themselves.         
	Trinamul leaders said Bhuniyas comments amounted to belittling their party in front of the CPM.        
	Manas openly criticised Mamata Banerjees stand only to please his CPM friends. But he should not forget that he has criticised the person who is being projected as the spearhead of the Congress-Trinamul alliance in the run-up to next years Assembly polls, a Trinamul vice-president said.        
	However, he said Bhuniyas comments would not affect the alliance. By striking the alliance with the Congress, Mamata has responded to the peoples wishes. We will keep the alliance, come what may.         
	Congress sources said Bhuniyas outburst was apparently prompted by the Trinamul chiefs repeated digs at Rahul Gandhi during the Congress general secretarys visit to the state last month. Mamata had compared Rahul with a seasonal koel (cuckoo) that arrives in spring and disappears when the season is over.

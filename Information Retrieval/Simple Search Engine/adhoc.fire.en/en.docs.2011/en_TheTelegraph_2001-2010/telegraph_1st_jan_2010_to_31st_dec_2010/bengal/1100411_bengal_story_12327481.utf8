          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, April 10: Maoists chopped the fingers of a man who worked for the state power utility and shot him dead apparently because he had defied a bandh call.        
	With Kaushik Dutta, 35, was killed his friend Pawan Mahato, 34, who was accom-panying him yesterday when he was visiting houses on the outskirts of Jhargram town to record meter readings.         
	None of the victims was involved in politics. They had no history of involvement in any sort of political activity, said western range inspector-general Zulfiquar Hassan.        
	Villagers this morning spotted the bodies on the road in front of a deer park, barely 3km from the additional superintendents office in Jhargram town where home secretary Ardhendu Sen met district police chief Manoj Verma and other senior officials later in the day.        
	A Maoist-sponsored indefinite bandh started in the region yesterday and a police officer said it was most likely that the duo paid the price for ignoring the call.        
	Sen said the probe into the Shilda massacre in which 24 EFR personnel had been killed in February was over.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 27: The driver of a Panskura-bound local train from Howrah suffered a heart attack and died after the train reached the destination today.         
	D.N. Moitra, 56, started sweating profusely after the train arrived at Panskura at 7.35am. He was taken to a nursing home where he was declared dead on arrival.         
	A railway source claimed Moitra was fine when the train left Howrah, and a senior South Eastern Railway official said the driver may have fallen ill on the way.         
	Railway officials praised the Howrah resident for his exemplary devotion to duty.

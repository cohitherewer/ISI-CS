          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mondals mother Sabita at a Jhargram hospital on Wednesday. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, Sept. 22: Suspected Maoists today killed a man and injured his elderly parents near West Midnapores Radhanagar, whose residents had resisted rebel coercion for the first time.        
	Srikanta Mondal, a clerk at a girls school in Sebayatan village, was shot dead by three youths. Police said Mondal had organised people from Radhanagar and its neighbouring villages to resist Maoists in the past few months.        
	The police said Mondal became suspicious after he noticed the three youths loitering outside Sebayatan Balika Vidyalaya today as they were not residents of the village.         
	He informed the headmistress and also called up some villagers. The villagers informed his parents who rushed to the school, a police officer said.        
	The headmistress advised Mondal to return home. But when Mondal came out of the school around 2pm and hopped onto his motorcycle, the youths surrounded him and demanded why he had torn Maoist posters, shopkeepers who witnessed the incident said.        
	Mondal denied the charge and an argument ensued. The youths whipped out revolvers and fired at him, the eyewitnesses said. Mondal, who took bullets in his head and arms, died on the spot.         
	His father Helu and mother Sabita tried to resist but the youths fired at them before escaping. While a bullet grazed Sabitas head, another brushed past Helus right ear. They have been hospitalised.        
	After the attack, around 1,500 Radhanagar residents armed with swords raided neighbouring villages. They set ablaze the houses of 15 Peoples Committee supporters.

          NARESH JANA                              
	Kharagpur, May 31: The commissioner of railway safety today interviewed at least 20 railway employees but none of them spoke of any explosion on the Jnaneswaris tracks on Friday morning, sources here said.        
	The trains driver, B.K. Das, had lodged an FIR on Friday saying he had heard an explosion, saw smoke under the engine and felt a jerk.         
	However, railway officials in Kharagpur said even the guard, S.C. Ghosh, who was in the compartment next to the engine, had not mentioned any explosion. The guard told the commissioner he felt a jerk and the compartments derailed and dragged themselves over the sleepers, gravels and stone chips before stopping. We were inside the compartment, scared to get off in the darkness, when there was loud crash and a goods train hit the compartments that had encroached on the parallel tracks, a senior railway official quoted the guard as saying.         
	The travelling ticket examiners said the same before S.K. Nayak, South Eastern Railways commissioner of safety, who started an inquiry into the tragedy today.         
	Nayak is expected to quiz around 36 railway employees who were on the train that night or had visited the site after the disaster.         
	He will submit his report to the chief commissioner of railway safety in Lucknow within a month.

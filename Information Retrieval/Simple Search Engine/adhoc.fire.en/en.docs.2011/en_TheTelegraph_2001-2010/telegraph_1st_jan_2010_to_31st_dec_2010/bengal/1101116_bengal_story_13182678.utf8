          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 15: State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya today initiated alliance talks with two leaders who had stood by Mamata Banerjee during the Nandigram movement but later parted ways with her.        
	Bhuniya met Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind leader Siddiqullah Chowdhury and Samir Putatunda, the state secretary of the Party for Democratic Socialism, and discussed the possibilities of a Congress alliance with them for the Assembly polls next year.         
	We are in an alliance with the Trinamul Congress. If some more like-minded parties join us, our anti-CPM front will turn into a grand alliance, Bhuniya said after the meeting.        
	The sources said the central leaders believed that if the Congress succeeded in striking an alliance with Chowdhury and Putatunda, it would increase the partys bargaining power during seat-sharing talks with Mamata for the Assembly elections.         
	The Congress, the sources said, is eyeing the considerable number of minority votes Siddiqullah controls in at least 60 Assembly segments across the state.         
	Chowdhury and Putatunda had fought unsuccessfully against Mamatas nominees during last years Lok Sabha elections.        
	Trinamul leaders, however, did not attach too much importance to the Congresss initiative. Before every elections, the Congress starts the practice of striking alliances with insignificant parties that have no political consolidation in the districts. Such moves matters little to us, state Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi said.

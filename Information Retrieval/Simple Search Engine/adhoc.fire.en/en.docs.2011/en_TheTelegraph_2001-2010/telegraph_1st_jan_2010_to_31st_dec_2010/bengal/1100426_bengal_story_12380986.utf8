  - Lawyer says police trying to frame doctor and help        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The seized car at Asansol police station. (Gour Sharma)                                        
	Durgapur, April 25: The car in which an Asansol doctor with alleged Maoist links was said to have fled has been found right behind his house.        
	The silver Maruti Alto was in a tin shed that the doctor used as his garage.        
	Burdwan superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said it was not there during the polices three earlier searches of the single-storey house and its premises on the outskirts of Asansol town.        
	We went there again last night after hearing about the car. We searched it and found in its boot four gelatine sticks, eight detonators, Rs 59,000 in cash, the doctors passport and a sketch map of the Asansol police lines. The car keys were in the ignition.         
	The police could not explain how the car came there.         
	They claim they have specific evidence of Maoist links against Dr Samir Biswas. They had searched the house thrice since April 19. So, they must have had it under watch. But, strangely, they do not know how the car came there. We suspect the police are trying to frame the doctor, said Debjyoti Basu, the lawyer who is def-ending the doctors help of 17 years, Susanta Pal, who was arrested on April 19 after the police failed to find Biswas.        
	Basu placed these arguments before the Asansol court, where Susanta was produced today and remanded in three more days of police custody.        
	Asked about the lawyers argument, the district police chief said: There are so many doctors in Asansol. Why should we single him out if we do not have strong evidence against him?         
	What is the sketch map of the police lines doing with the doctor? We suspect the police lines are a Maoist target, he added.        
	The police entered the house, in an Eastern Coalfields Ltd colony for supervisors, executives and managers, for the third time in five days last evening and claimed to have seized the doctors bank passbooks and life insurance policy. Two days ago, they had apparently found from the attic CDs containing scenes from guerrilla training camps.         
	Asked why the police could not find them during the first search, Rajsekharan said: Conducting searches is a continuous process. The house has four-five rooms. During the first search, we had found Maoist literature, photographs of guerrilla training camps in Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, a book on guns and bus and train tickets to Lalgarh and Chhattisgarh. We are carrying out searches following the information we are getting from Susanta Pal. We will conduct more searches if necessary.         
	Fingerprints from the car keys will be matched with those found in the retired ECL hospital superintendents house, an officer said.        
	The police also claimed to have found gelatine sticks and detonators in Susantas house in Galsi last night.        
	Susantas lawyer told the court he visited his house only once every year, during Kali Puja. How can he keep the explosives in a box at home? Basu asked.

  - Atrocity slur on farmer after torture complaint        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Behrampore, Oct. 26: A young Nadia woman, a mother of one, was allegedly gang-raped and tonsured by her husband and his accomplices after she filed cases of torture against him and demanded maintenance.        
	The 28-year-old woman was found unconscious in a bush not far from the home of her husband in Tehattas Maniknagar over a fortnight back. Mentally unstable from shock and trauma, she is now undergoing psychiatric treatment.        
	The womans father, a resident of neighbouring Dangapara, approached the district police chief today alleging that cops at Tehatta had not acted on his complaint filed a day after the assault. I have asked the Tehatta officers to take immediate action against the accused. I will also inquire why the police did not take action earlier, Nadia superintendent of police Champak Bhattacharya said.        
	The womans father Nilkamal Roy said his son-in-law Puranjit Biswas, a 32-year-old farmer, started torturing his daughter over a year ago, six years after the marriage.        
	 Puranjit started beating up my daughter on the slightest pretext and tortured her continuously. Then she came to stay with me. I suspect he wanted to get rid of my daughter for someone else, Nilkamal, a tea stall owner, said.        
	The woman, who came to her fathers house along with her six-year-old daughter, lodged the torture case against her husband five months ago under Section 498A of the IPC and demanded maintenance. Then, around a month back, Puranjit came to his in-laws house and forcibly took away his daughter, Nilkamal alleged.        
	On October 9 evening, an acquaintance of Puranjit, Mouri Sarkar, called up the victim saying her daughter was very ill and was admitted to a nearby health centre.        
	The caller told my daughter that if she did not come quickly, the child would be taken to Shaktinagar Hospital in Krishnagar town. My daughter was desperate to see her kid and left immediately, said Nilkamal.        
	When the woman did not return home at night, Nilkamal and his two sons, accompanied by some villagers, went out looking for her but the search proved futile. When I did not find my daughter at my relatives homes, I thought she may have gone with her daughter to the hospital in Krishnagar, said Nilkamal.        
	Next morning, on October 10, villagers stumbled on the woman lying in a bush, half a kilometre from her husbands Maniknagar home.        
	My daughter had injuries all over her body and she had been tonsured. We took her to the Tehatta hospital. After regaining consciousness, she lodged the complaint at Tehatta police station saying she was gang-raped by her husband and four others, who had their faces covered. She has also listed Mouri, the woman who had called her the previous night and lied to her that her daughter was ill, in the FIR, said Nilkamal.        
	A psychiatrist in Behrampore, in neighbouring Murshidabad district, has been treating the victim since the assault.

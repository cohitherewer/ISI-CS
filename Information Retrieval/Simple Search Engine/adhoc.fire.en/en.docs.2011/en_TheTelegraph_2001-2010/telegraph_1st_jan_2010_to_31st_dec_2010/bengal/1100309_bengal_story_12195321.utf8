          AMIT UKIL                          Dipak speaks to Soren on the phone. (Amit Ukil)                                  
	Sarenga, March 8: Ranjit Duley, the Bankura headmaster abducted by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, was released late tonight after his sons condemned a security raid  a condition set by his captors.         
	He was on his way back home in Saluka, accompanied by two journalists.        
	Earlier, obeying the Maoist backers instructions, Golok, Duleys the second son, read out a statement before several journalists gathered outside their home.        
	Last evening, Sidhu Soren, the leader of the Peoples Committee, had called Dipak, the teachers eldest son, and told him that his family would have to condemn raids by joint security forces on villages yesterday morning if they wanted Duleys freedom.         
	The forces were search- ing for the headmaster and had tracked Sorens cell- phone to the Bhalukbasa forest where there was a seven-hour encounter with the rebels.        
	The familys statement said: The operation by the police at Kesia, Kadambandhi, Habra and Teliajat villages without any thought is an extremely condemnable act. The killing of Sadhuram Hembram of Kesia as well as the firing on Bablu Ahir, Anil Ahir, Adhir Ahir and Moloy Ahir is extremely shameful.        
	Soren had placed some more conditions. He said the Duleys must condemn the police attack in Kesia and Teliajat villages in West Midnapores Goaltore after which 37 innocent villagers were detained. The statement mentioned the police operations in these villages and condemned them too.         
	Soren also said the loss to property during yesterdays search  some cycles and farming equipment were damaged  must be compensated and that the statement should mention that. Also, a copy of the statement must be submitted to the Sarenga police station in front of the media.        
	While Golok read out the statement, Dipak stood by.         
	Forty minutes later, Dipak received a call from an unknown number to his cellph- one. It was Soren, he said. Soren asked whether his instructions had been followed.         
	Dipak answered: Yes, all the media, including the national press will be carrying the statement. We have read it out in front of them. They are broadcasting it live. By noon, they will be broadcasting it. He then asked how his father was, to which the reply was: Fine.         
	However, Soren said the last condition would have to be fulfilled before Duley is released.         
	Golok and Dipak, along with the journalists, then went to the Sarenga police station where they met the officer on duty, assistant sub- inspector P.K. Mullick, and submitted the statement to him. Let us hope that now my father will be released, Dipak said in the afternoon.         
	We have fulfilled all the conditions.        
	Sen at Deepak quiz        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen went to the CIDs headquarters in Bhavani Bhavan to oversee the interrogation of Maoist leader Telugu Deepak.         
	He entered the interrogation room on the fourth floor for a few minutes.         
	He then held a meeting with senior CID officers and praised the force for arresting Deepak.         
	Sen went through the video clips of Deepaks interrogation.

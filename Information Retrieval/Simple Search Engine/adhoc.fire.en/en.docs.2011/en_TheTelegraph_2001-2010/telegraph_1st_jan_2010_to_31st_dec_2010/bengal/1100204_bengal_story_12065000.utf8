  - State and central leader differ on party probe panel        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Feb. 3: CPM top guns today appeared divided on the proposal to set up an internal commission to probe corruption and other charges against party leaders from insiders as well as people outside.         
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen said after the first half of the politburo meeting in the city today that the proposal was being discussed and it would be placed before the central committee tomorrow.         
	But another politburo member from the central leadership said hours later that the issue had not been discussed and the party brass had yet to take a final call on it.         
	However, the proposal got support from a large section of the central committee members in Bengal which felt the body was needed to speed up investigation, trial and punishment of wrong-doers in the party, refurbish its image and arrest alienation from voters.         
	This is one of the major prescriptions for the internal rectification that the party has been planning in the wake of its worst-ever poll debacle in Bengal and Kerala.         
	The politburo fine-tuned the guidelines for the rectification campaign today before placing it in the three-day central committee meeting beginning tomorrow.        
	We are discussing the proposal to set up a disciplinary commission under the central committee to look into the serious charges against our leaders, including those at the highest level. It will probe char-ges if the lower committees have not taken the initiative to redress complaints lying with them and recommend penal action if necessary, Sen said in the afternoon.        
	After the meeting ended this evening, a politburo member who wished not to be named said: This is a proposal only and the politburo neither discussed nor decided it. I dont think it will be part of our final recommendations to the central committee tomorrow. However, it may come up in the CCs deliberations.         
	Earlier, Sen explained that the proposed body would be different from the partys internal control commission, an appellate body for those party members who are aggrieved at the punishment ordered by the party committee he belongs to or approved by the immediate higher leadership.         
	Both Sen and fellow politburo member M.K. Pandhe admitted that the constitution of the new body as well as the renewed rectification campaign had become a pressing need in view of corruption and other non-communist vices among the partys rank and file after enjoying power for 33 years.        
	Central committee members said that unlike the control commission, supporters as well as people at large would be able to access the proposed body to redress their grievances against party functionaries as well as its elected members.         
	The common man is often scared to complain against leaders or elected members, a central committee member said. Even if he or she dares to do so, party committees hush up the complaints or belittle the charges. The same charges have been heard from party insiders who felt victimised in factional or personal feuds.         
	General secretary Prakash Karat has promised the rectification will begin from the top after lower-rung leaders resented being blamed for all the wrongdoings.

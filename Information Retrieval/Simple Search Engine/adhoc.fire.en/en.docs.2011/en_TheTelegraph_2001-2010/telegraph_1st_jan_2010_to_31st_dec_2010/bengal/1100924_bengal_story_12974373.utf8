	Calcutta, Sept. 23: Mamata Banerjee will visit London on October 25 to deliver a lecture at Cambridge University.         
	She will deliver the lecture on the occasion of the inauguration of a political science wing of the institute.        
	I will deliver the lecture at Cambridge University on October 25 following a request from the varsity authorities, the Trinamul Congress chief told reporters this afternoon.        
	Mamatas itinerary also includes a visit to the banks of the Thames river. She has been invited by the British government to see the riverfront in London.         
	I will visit London Bridge and have a discussion with the British transport minister on the beautification projects being implemented in the city, she said. Mamata had vowed to make Calcutta like London in the run-up to the civic polls in May.        
	The railway minister said she would visit the house where Rabindranath Tagore had stayed in London. I have requested the Centre to take over the house, she added.

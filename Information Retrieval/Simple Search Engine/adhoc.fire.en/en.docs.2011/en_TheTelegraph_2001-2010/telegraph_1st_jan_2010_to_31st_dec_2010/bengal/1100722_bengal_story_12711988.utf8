          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, July 21: A childless Eastern Coalfields driver who resented his wifes adoption wish allegedly killed her with a stone pestle before ransacking his own almirah and hiding in a well to pass of the crime as a heist.         
	Deepak Chakraborty, 37, a resident of Burdwans Andal who allegedly killed his wife Annapurna last night, climbed down the well and shouted for help from there this morning.        
	He managed to fool his neighbours but police found discrepancies in his statements and arrested him. Chakraborty, who the police said had confessed to the murder, initially told the cops that robbers had beaten him up after killing his wife and pushed him down the well. But there were no injury marks on his body and his spectacles were intact.         
	He had also said the robbers had snatched the almirah keys from him and taken away cash and ornaments. But the almirah keys were found in his pocket. A police officer said Chakraborty had told them that the robbers had pointed a revolver at him through the window. He could have called up the police before opening the door as he had the time, the officer said.         
	Another officer said Annapurna wanted to adopt a girl.         
	Annapurnas nephew Debashish alleged that Chakraborty used to beat her up. Other than domestic strife, the police are also probing if Chakraborty had an extra-marital affair.

	Midnapore, May 5: Maoists shot dead three people in West Midnapore last night  two of them were branded police informers and the third, a trader, paid the price for refusing to pay extortion money.         
	A group of six went to Jhargram block Congress president Bikash Mahatos house around 4pm. When he refused to go with them to a village 3km away, they took out their guns, his wife Jyotsna said.        
	Bikash, 42, was found dead this morning amid posters that said he was an agent of the police and the CPM.         
	In Binpur, former CPM supporter Haripada Singh, 42, was found dead with similar posters strewn around.        
	Fertiliser trader Shankar Pal, 48, was killed in a Lalgarh village. The Maoists used to take money from him. But he had refused to pay in the last two months because business had not been good, said a relative who requested anonymity.

	Two other Maoists, Ashok Singh and Uttam Mandi, were arrested from Hooghly and West Midnapore.        
	Siliguri: The death of a doctor at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday spurred authorities to restart the Intensive Coronary Care Unit on Wednesday, a week ahead of schedule. It was shut down three years ago over lack of staff. Members of the Junior Doctors Council had mountied pressure on the authorities to immediately start the unit.        
	Calcutta: The state government has given an undertaking to the Union home ministry promising that there would be no rights violation or torture on Danish national Kim Davy, wanted in the Purulia arms drop case, if he is extradited. State home secretary G.D. Gautama, however, said the process could take time despite an extradition treaty between India and Denmark.

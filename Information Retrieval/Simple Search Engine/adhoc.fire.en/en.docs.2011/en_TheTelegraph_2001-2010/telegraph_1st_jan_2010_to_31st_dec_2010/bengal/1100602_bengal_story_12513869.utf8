	Bankura, June 1: A getaway vehicle of highway robbers crashed through barricades and rammed into a truck as one police team chased them and another engaged them in a shootout, killing a goon and leading to the capture of three.        
	The robbers used the cars doors as shields and shot at the police after the crash killed the driver and the vehicle got stuck under the stationary truck.        
	The gang of eight was fleeing after robbing a petrol pump off the Durgapur-Bankura highway. A police patrol started tailing them after Borjora police station responded to a call from a dhaba adjoining the pump, 275km from Calcutta. A second police team set up the barricades.        
	The encounter lasted around 10 minutes. As the goons ran out of bullets, the police closed in, but three men bolted in the darkness.         
	The arrested dacoits, Sheikh Azharuddin and Sheikh Moinuddin, were remanded in police custody today, said Bankura police chief Vishal Garg. The injured Momin Ali Khan has been admitted to SSKM Hospital in Calcutta. The driver was identified as Dhruba Dey, 28, and the dead dacoit, Ajmer Ali Mondal, 22.        
	They had guns and daggers. Their faces were covered, said Gautam Chatterjee, manager of Ma Tara Filling Station. They took Rs 60,000 from the pumps cash box and phones and rings from two customers and the staff.

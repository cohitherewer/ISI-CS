                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM promises hill murder arrests
          OUR BUREAU                          Madan Tamangs widow Bharati with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. (Amit Datta)                                  
	June 23: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today assured Bharati Tamang her husband Madan Tamangs killers would be arrested very soon and, if the CID failed to do so, he would consider handing over the case to the CBI.         
	A team of the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL), headed by Bharati since her husbands death, came to Writers Buildings today.         
	We demanded the immediate arrest of the main accused in our leaders assassination. Most of those named in the FIR have not been held yet. Hence, we are asking for the CBIs intervention, said their adviser S.B. Zimba.         
	Tamang was murdered in Darjeeling on May 21. The ABGL had named 11 Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders in the FIR. Zimba said the chief minister had promised immediate arrest of the main accused. We trust him and are willing to wait.        
	Although the visiting team returned satisfied with the chief ministers assurances, leaders of the other Morcha rivals in the hills expressed their doubts about the governments sincerity in acting against alleged Morcha activists. Dawa Sherpa, the convener of the Democratic Front, of which the ABGL is a partner, had recently said: The killers are moving around but no one is doing anything.        
	Several other hill leaders also feel the government does not want to provoke the situation by arresting them.        
	The police, who have made some arrests, say most of those named in the FIR as being directly involved in the crime have fled to Nepal. India does not have an extradition treaty with the kingdom and the Bengal police have not got in touch with Interpol to locate them.        
	The ABGL also complained to the chief minister about the Morchas terror tactics. We requested the chief minister to put an end to the torture and anarchy of the Gorkhaland Personnel (the lathi-wielding Morcha volunteers), Zimba said. The chief minister said work on that had begun.        
	Morcha tough talk        
	The Morcha vowed to enforce its bandh more vigorously once it resumed on Friday, striking a firm note after easing the shutdown for 48 hours.         
	Not to be seen as buckling under pressure after pulling out its volunteers from five government buildings and relaxing the strike, Morcha assistant secretary Binay Tamang said: We have decided to strictly enforce the strike from Friday. We expect all tourists to leave the hills by tomorrow evening and we will no longer keep the helplines open.         
	The helplines had been opened for stranded tourists. Tamang said: We will only allow people with emergency work to move.

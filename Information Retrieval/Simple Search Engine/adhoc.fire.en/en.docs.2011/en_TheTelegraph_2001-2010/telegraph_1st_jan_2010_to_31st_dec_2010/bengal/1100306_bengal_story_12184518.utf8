The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Civic shock to Trinamul
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Civic shock to Trinamul
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 5: The Trinamul Congress chairman of Midnapore municipality today lost the confidence vote when at least five councillors of the Congress-Trinamul alliance voted with the Left.         
	The setback for the Trinamul has come when the party is gearing up for elections to 82 civic bodies.        
	In June 2008, Trinamul formed the civic board in Midnapore having won nine seats and the support of an Independent. Ally Congress bagged four seats. In the 24-member board, the Left was the Opposition with nine seats. There was another Independent who backed neither the Trinamul-Congress combine nor the Left.        
	During todays no-confidence motion brought by the Left, Trinamul chairman Pranab Bose got only 10 votes and the Left 14.        
	It appears that five ruling councillors voted with the Left.         
	This is most unfortunate. Those councillors who have grievances against me could have raised it at the party forum instead of publicly humiliating me. I lost the confidence vote because of back-stabbing by my own men, said Bose.        
	Mamata Banerjee was informed of the development immediately after she landed in Calcutta tonight.         
	Mamata took strong exception to the manner in which some party councillors had voted along with the Left against our chairman. We shall order a probe, said a senior Trinamul leader.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Durgapur, Sept. 29: A coal thief was killed and a police officer seriously injured during a clash in Burdwans Jamuria this morning.        
	While the coal pilferers alleged that Purna Baura, 48, was beaten to death by Tapas Ghosh, an assistant subinspector of police, for refusing to give him a bribe of Rs 15, the cops claimed Baura fell into a pit and died during the clash.         
	Ghosh, 42, was given eight stitches on the head after being allegedly stoned and beaten by the thieves.         
	A police team had gone to the Bengal Emta-owned mine after the guards there informed them about the thieves at 5.30am.         
	Burdwan superintendent of police R. Rajshekharan said the coal thieves started hurling stones as soon as the team reached the spot.        
	The pilferers severely beat up Tapas Ghosh and a security guard of the mine.         
	Guard Sujit Fouzdar suffered a head injury.         
	However, some coal thieves alleged that Ghosh killed Baura by hitting him on the head with a baton and then threw his body into a pit.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raiganj, March 4: A group of 150 lathi-wielding supporters of the Lok Janshakti Party hijacked four buses in Bihars Kishanganj yesterday, dragging 120 passengers off the vehicles with their luggage because the buses were needed at a rally by their chief Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	The LJP admitted that its activists had hijacked the buses and said there was no need to panic.        
	All the four private buses had started from the terminus in Raiganj and were on their way to Siliguri on NH 31 that passes through Kishanganj in Bihar.         
	Around 25 buses from the Raiganj depot carry 30-40 passengers on an average to Siliguri everyday.         
	Chuki Das, a dealer in medicine in Raiganj, said: As the bus was approaching the Kishanganj flyover, a large number of men surrounded it. About eight to ten of them boarded with lathis and told us to get off. When we protested, they dragged us out and threw out some of the luggage.

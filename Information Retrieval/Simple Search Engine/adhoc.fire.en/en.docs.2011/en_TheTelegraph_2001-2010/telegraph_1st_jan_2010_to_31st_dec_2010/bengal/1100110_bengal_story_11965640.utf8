	Howrah, Jan. 9: Five children of the same family were charred to death in the early hours today when their hut in a Howrah village caught fire from a kerosene lamp.        
	Ataur Mullick, the 40-year-old father of seven who suffered minor burns, said the family of nine was asleep on the floor of their single-room brick-walled hut in Rabibhag village in Bagnan, when the fire engulfed it.        
	Between sobs, Ataur, who paints houses for a living, recounted that he woke up suddenly feeling intense heat on his face. My house was in flames. I tried to save my children but could not save all of them. I somehow escaped with my wife, my eldest son Sariul Mullick and my youngest daughter Saira Banu, he said.        
	Ataur said he first panicked when he saw the flames.         
	As I was reaching towards the kids to wake them up, the tiled roof came crashing down on them. I did not know what to do. I rushed out of the house and shouted for help. Neighbours rushed in. By that time Sariul had come out with his mother who had Saira in her arms. The heat was so intense it was not possible to go inside, said Ataur.        
	His wife Sahanbara Begum, 35, and Sariul, 14, were taken to SSKM Hospital with severe burns. Two-year-old Saira escaped without injury.        
	The police have recovered the charred bodies of Samirul, 11, Ansura, 9, Mansura, 7, Sarika, 5, and Saiful, 4  two sons and three daughters.        
	Sariul later said he had woken up around 3am to relieve himself and had lit an oil lamp but forgotten to put it out.        
	It appears the lamp overturned and some straw stacked in a corner of the house caught fire, said Alfa Kazi, Ataurs uncle who lives in the same village.         
	Local Congress leader Kazi Abdul Rezzak said fire engines did not come from Uluberia despite villagers calls. The firefighters would have taken at least an hour to reach the spot from Uluberia, about 25km away. But the blaze gutted Ataurs house in half an hour.        
	A police officer said Ataur had stuffed straw and plastic sheets in the gaps of the tiled roof to keep the hut warm but that had made the structure highly inflammable. Straw and plastic had been stuffed in the cracks of the brick wall too, the officer said.        
	When Ataur woke up and raised the alarm, villagers rushed to the house with buckets of water from a nearby pond. But by the time the fire was brought under control, the house was gone, said Kazi.         
	Mrinal Majumdar, the sub-divisional police officer of Uluberia, about 70km from Calcutta, said that the bodies had been sent for post-mortem.

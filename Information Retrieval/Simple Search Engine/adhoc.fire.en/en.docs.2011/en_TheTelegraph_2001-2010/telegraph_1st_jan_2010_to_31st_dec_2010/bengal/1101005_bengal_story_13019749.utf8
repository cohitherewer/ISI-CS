The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | At hospital, doctors, nurses and Narayan
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      At hospital, doctors, nurses and Narayan
          ALAMGIR HOSSAIN                          Narayan Mondal at the Nadia hospital. (Pintu Biswas)                                  
	Karimpur (Nadia), Oct. 4: For the patients admitted to the rural hospital in Nadias Karimpur, there are doctors and nurses, and there is Narayan Mondal.         
	Narayan, whose right leg was crippled by polio in childhood, had been admitted to the hospital with high fever in 1983, when he was 25. But he stayed back after recovering and did not return home to his elder brother. Since then, the 52-year-old has been looking after the patients  nursing them, helping them with hospital formalities and even paying for their treatment and medicines.        
	Narayan receives Rs 750 a month as pension under a central scheme for the physically challenged. He spends most of the money on medicines and fruits for poor patients.        
	Chahatan Bibi, 65, a patient, said Narayan had been looking after her since she was admitted to the hospital a few days back with typhoid. I live in Teinpur village, around 20km from the hospital. My husband admitted me to the hospital. Our son does not look after us, Chahatan said.         
	Narayan comes to me every day and enquires about my health. Although my husband cant visit me every day, I dont feel lonely as Narayan is there. One day, the doctors told me one of my medicines had to be bought from outside. Narayan not only bought the medicine but also helps me take it every day, the elderly woman said.         
	Narayan puts wet cloth on my forehead whenever I have fever, Chahatan said.         
	Two months ago, a visually challenged girl was admitted to the hospital with severe stomach pain. Ward master Arun Mondal said the family members of Rakhi Malakar, 22, a resident of Muktadaha, about 8km away, did not come to see her after getting her admitted. They did not pay for the treatment either.        
	Doctors had prescribed ultrasonography (USG) for her abdomen but she did not have the money for the test. Narayan borrowed money from local traders and paid for the USG, Mondal said.         
	After Rakhi was detected with an ulcer, Narayan paid for her entire treatment, the ward master said.         
	When her parents refused to take her home fearing they would have to pay for the treatment, Narayan took Rakhi, whose father is a labourer, home and assured her parents that he had already cleared the hospital bills. Rakhi now addresses Narayan as father, ward master Mondal said.         
	Ratna Mondal, a 42-year-old divorcee who lives alone in Natidanga nearby, came to the hospital last week, complaining of stomach cramps. As she did not have anybody to sign the admission form, Narayan completed the formalities.        
	Narayan explained his reason for staying back at the hospital after his treatment.        
	My brother took no initiative to take me home after I recovered. So I decided to stay back at the hospital. I feel comfortable here. I sleep in the veranda. I am grateful to the doctors that they did not drive me away. The hospital is my home and thankfully, the people of the locality love me and provide me food.        
	Bhabani Paswan, a nurse, said that having Narayan around had made the hospital staffs job easy. Narayan is always willing to help patients who dont have their family members beside them. Not only does he clean the patients when they soil themselves, he also washes the hospital toilets, Paswan said.        
	The chief medical officer of Murshidabad, Amit Haldar, said: Although it is illegal to stay in a hospital so long after recovery, Narayan is an exception. He is of immense help to the hospital.

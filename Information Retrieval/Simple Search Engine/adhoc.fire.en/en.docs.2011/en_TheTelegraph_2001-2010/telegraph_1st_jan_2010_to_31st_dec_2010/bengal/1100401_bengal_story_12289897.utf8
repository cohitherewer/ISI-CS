                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      On Kishan turf, an injury trail 
  - He was on shoulders of armed men: Villagers          PRONAB MONDAL                          Telugu Deepak alias Venkateswar Reddy, the alleged chief of the Maoist guerrilla wing in Bengal, was produced in Alipore Court on Wednesday and remanded in jail custody till April 13.

	Chhotopukuria (West Midnapore), March 31: A resident of Chhotopukuria village, where injured Maoist leader Kishan was said to have undergone treatment, today said he had seen some 30 armed men carry an injured man on their shoulders around 1am on Saturday.         
	Another villager who had stepped out of his home to relieve himself around the same time claimed to have seen a four-wheeler and motorbikes in the area all of sudden in the dead of night.        
	A group of 30 men, armed with guns, were walking down the road from Chuashole (near Lakshmanpur). Some of them were carrying an injured man on their shoulder. They were trying their best to ensure his comfort, Ratan (name changed) said.        
	Kishan is believed to have been hit by police bullets during an encounter at Lakshmanpur, on the outskirts of Lalgarh, on Thursday.        
	Chuashole is 30km from Jharkhand, where the police suspect Kishan to have escaped.        
	Through a crack in a window, I heard one of the armed men tell the others to be careful with the injured man. Lift his hand, the man instructed, Ratan said.         
	The police had claimed that Kishan had been brought to Chhotopukuria for treatment after being hit by two bullets. Ratan said he did not know if the injured man was Kishan.        
	Please, do not mention my name. They (the Maoists) will kill me. I just told you what I have seen, Ratan, who sells sal leaves for a living, said        
	Ratan said he did not know where the injured man was being taken. I have never seen such armed men in our village before. I do not even know whether the injured man was being brought to our village or was being taken away.        
	Intercepts of telephone conversations of some Maoists apparently revealed that Kishan was badly injured and needed immediate medical attention. He was not in a position to walk on his own.        
	Security forces had tried to enter Chhotopukuria on Saturday night but had to stop after the rebels fired at them.        
	Next morning, the police entered the area but could not find Kishan, an Intelligence Bureau officer said.         
	The villager who had gone to relieve himself said: I saw a few motorcycles and a four-wheeler parked on the road. No one from our village owns a four-wheeler and we hardly see so many motorcycles together here.        
	A resident of Lakshmanpur, where Kishan is said to have organised several public meetings earlier, said he had seen the Maoist leader on a number of occasions. He said Kishan and around 60 of his aides had fought with the security forces on Thursday.        
	He was leading from the front, firing from a semi-automatic weapon, he said. I saw him taking shelter in a house. But I dont know what happened to him after that.

	Union home minister P. Chidambaram will come to Calcutta on Saturday, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said today. Mamata Banerjee had met the minister in Delhi earlier in the day.        
	The chief secretary said Chidambaram would meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and probably discuss Lalgarh.        
	As of now there is no information of Chidambaram visiting Lalgarh. But the Union home ministry has enquired whether there is place to land a helicopter in Lalgarh, an official at Writers Buildings said.

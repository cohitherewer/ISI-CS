                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cheque to CM from smuggler
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Oct. 10: A man arrested in connection with coal smuggling and possessing illegal arms was seen on a dais gifting a cheque of Rs 1.11 lakh to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today for a college in Burdwan.         
	Jaswant Singh Upal, better known as Kale Singh, was arrested in May and is now out on bail after spending a month in jail.         
	The cheque was signed in the name of Jaswant Singh Upal and he was one of the 16 people, including former state law minister Nisith Adhikary, who went to the dais to make the donation.         
	District superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan confirmed that Jaswant and Kale were the same person. Initially I was not aware of it but later I found out that Jaswant and Kale are the same person. If I had known then, I would have stopped him, the SP said.        
	Rajsekharan said when the members of the committee tasked with building the government-aided Sir Rashbehari Ghosh College in Khandaghosh approached him saying 16 people would go up to the dais to donate money, he told them they would be checked for security.        
	State Trinamul Congress president Subrata Bakshi said this was ample proof of the CPMs hobnobbing with criminals. We have time and again said the CPM is in league with criminals. Now the chief minister himself is found to be taking cheques from someone with a criminal background.

  - Biman says party will react if the Centre proposes posthumous honour for Basu        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Biman, Mamata				                                             
	Calcutta, Jan. 21: The CPM today desisted from ruling out accepting a posthumous Bharat Ratna for Jyoti Basu if the Centre made such a proposal  the open-ended response standing out against the outright rejection when the patriarch was alive.        
	Jyotibabu is a real Bharat ratna, irrespective of such formal decorations. However, we will react if there is any such proposal for conferring the award on him posthumously. How can I comment on it now? CPM state secretary Biman Bose asked today after the weekly meeting of the party state secretariat.         
	He pointed out, though, that Basu himself had declined to accept the honour when the proposal came from the Centre few years back. Jyotibabu refused the proposal when the Centre sought his consent. He said he didnt want ketabi (formal) certificates, Bose said.        
	A section of CPM leaders has already raised questions about the leaderships earlier objections to such awards after the top brass accepted state honours for Basus last journey.         
	According to party sources, the first proposal for conferring Bharat Ratna on Basu came from the NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Brajesh Mishra, then the national security adviser, had communicated this to Somnath Chatterjee, who was then with the party.         
	Basu declined the honour from the BJP-led regime, which he had earlier described as a government of barbarians  alluding to the Sangh parivars role the Babri demolition.         
	The next proposal came from first UPA government. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi apparently wanted to recognise Basus role as the architect who got the Left to support the government from outside. Basu declined again. Some party leaders such as former Barrackpore MP Tarit Topdar felt that Basu declined this time because he knew that the party leadership would object.         
	Eight leaders, among them Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Rajiv Gandhi , were posthumously awarded the countrys highest civilian honour. Other recipients were Congress leader K. Kamaraj, Vinoba Bhave, former Tamil Nadu chief minister M.G. Ramachandran, Bhim Rao Ambedkar, Vallabbhai Patel and freedom fighter Aruna Asaf Ali.         
	Party purists earlier refused such recognition from the Centre, saying that though the communists had joined parliamentary politics, they would always maintain a distance from the bourgeoisie landlord of the Indian State.         
	However, Boses comments today indicated the leaderships changing position as the party was trying to exploit Basus charisma, evident from the massive turnout on his last journey, to recharge the party and recover ground lost in successive polls.        
	Mamata refusal        
	Mamata Banerjee today said she would not attend Sundays condolence meeting at the Shahid Minar ground even if the CPM sent her a letter. Why should I go? We have done our bit by paying homage to Jyotibabu. What did they (the CPM) do when Prafulla Chandra Sen and Ajoy Mukherjee, both former chief ministers, died? None of them were found then.        
	Biman, however, said letters would be sent to all political parties, including the Congress, BJP, Trinamul, the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (S) and Janata Dal (U). He clarified that no leader would be invited individually.        
	Bose today insisted that it was the Centre that had sent the proposal for Basus state funeral. We do not want any controversy around our dead leader. But the proposal came from the Centre first and the state government accepted it. A section of media has only carried the Centres official letter but not the states communication to the Centre earlier, Bose said.        
	At Writers, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakraborti said: A rumour has been circulated that we had given the proposal. But it was the Centre which initiated the move.

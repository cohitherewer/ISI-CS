The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Fatal flaws in strike
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Fatal flaws in strike
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, June 27: The first encounter death of a cop since Operation Lalgarh began last June has raised questions about the planning and execution of the strike last night.         
	Preliminary investigations into the death of Mohammad Etaharul Islam suggested at least two major deviations from the standard operating protocol on jungle warfare  an unnecessary shout and a reckless march.         
	A senior district police officer told The Telegraph the state police constable was shot at after the Maoists were alerted by his kaun hai (whos there)? cry.         
	Etaharul was in the front row of a semicircular formation that was closing in on the guerrillas camping on the fringes of a forest.         
	The team went out on the raid only after getting specific information about the Maoists. So, the shout was not needed, the officer said.        
	The slain cops wound confirmed he was fired at from only around 20 metres. It is clear that he had shown guts while moving forward. But valour alone is not enough. The tragedy also raises the question whether the personnel had been properly briefed about the operation, the officer added.         
	Nor did the constable, posted in Jungle Mahal for around three years, take proper cover, a must while accosting an armed enemy. Instead, he was standing on his feet in an open field, which made him an easy target.         
	He should have been on his belly after spotting the suspected Maoists, said an officer.         
	Jhargram superintendent of police Praveen Tripathi said: Etaharul was hit by a bullet in his waist when he was retreating and trying to hide behind a mud wall in the field.         
	Etaharul had crossed the wall while advancing towards a bamboo grove behind which the Maoists were sleeping. Three of the guerrillas were on guard in front of the grove.         
	It could not be ascertained whether the first bullet fired by the Maoist sentries had hit Etaharul but, a senior officer said, he should have been crawling for cover after being spotted by his adversaries. The bullet hit him in the waist only because he was running away instead of crawling for cover, said the officer.         
	The Specially Trained Armed Company  Straco  to which Etaharul belonged was raised to combat Maoists. Over 800 personnel from the force have been in Jungle Mahal since 2006. According to a senior CRPF officer, taking cover before an attack and crawling back to safety are operational basics for forces operating in terrains like Jungle Mahals.         
	Etaharuls death has kicked up questions on whether Straco personnel were properly trained before being sent to the battlefield.         
	The planning of the strike is also under the scanner. The nearest village was over 500 metres away and the jawans should have known that villagers could not be there at 3am. A proper briefing and knowledge of the topography could have saved his life, an officer said.

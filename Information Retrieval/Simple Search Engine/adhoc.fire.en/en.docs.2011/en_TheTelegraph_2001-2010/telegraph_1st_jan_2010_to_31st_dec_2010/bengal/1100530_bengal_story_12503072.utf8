	Calcutta, May 29: The collapse of Strand Warehouse would have killed more people had it not been raining in the evening peak hour.        
	Fewer people were in the bus stand in front of the warehouse than usual because of the rain. Had it not been so, the death count and the number of injured would have been higher, said a witness.        
	Huge chunks of concrete, iron beams and rods fell on two buses  a private bus on the Esplanade-Howrah route and a Howrah Maidan-Sakherbazar minibus  and a taxi carrying four passengers, the witness added.        
	Subhas Chandra Roy, 52, the guard who died, was a Habra resident. Roy worked for a private security agency and had been posted in the warehouse for the past one and a half years, said a friend.        
	Seven of the injured, including a 10-year-old boy, are in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital and one has been admitted to Marwari Relief Society Hospital.         
	Liluah resident Sanjay Prasad, who works for a Burrabazar IT consultancy firm, was walking past the warehouse when a concrete chunk fell on his head. Abhijit Kundu, 21, was waiting for a bus when he got trapped under the debris. I was unconscious for a couple of minutes. When I came to I realised I was being taken to hospital, said Kundu, who works in a Burrabazar office.        
	Ten-year-old Ezaz Ansari was about to board a bus with his parents on their way home to Tikiapara in Howrah when the warehouse faade collapsed. The boy suffered multiple fractures. Father Hafiz Ansari, a porter in Burrabazar, was injured in both legs while his wife suffered cuts. My wife and daughter had come to Calcutta for shopping, said Ansari.

	Calcutta, March 27: Showers brought relief to Calcutta this evening.         
	Weathermen said such showers were common this time of the year, but this was not a Norwester. There should have been at least three-four Norwesters by now. The city has not had any, said an official of the India Meteorological Department, Delhi. The weather office in Calcutta has forecast the possibility of more rain in the next few days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party test for ministers
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Party test for ministers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 18: CPM state secretary Biman Bose has convened a meeting of party ministers tomorrow to get a feel of the state governments shortcomings and find ways to address them so that the issues can be discussed at the two-day state committee meeting beginning June 26.        
	The meeting has been called to understand what sort of work our ministers have done in the first half of this year and the areas where they are facing problems. There is a need to make this assessment now as the course of action for the remaining part of the year has to be decided. This (urgency) is because the elections will soon be knocking on the door, CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said when asked about the meeting.         
	CPM sources said the party leadership was considering asking the ministers to fix a six-month target to complete pending work ahead of the May 2011 elections. A sermon may be given on the need to change lifestyle and avoid touring the districts in expensive cars.        
	Some of the areas where, according to the party, the government has been found wanting are in revamping the public distribution system, revising the below-poverty-line list, speeding up distribution of SC/ST certificates, providing irrigation and functioning of primary health centres.        
	After the Lok Sabha poll rout, it was decided that stress would be laid on work for the rural poor. The election results had revealed our partys social disconnect. But not much has moved. Laxity in the administration in the districts was also visible, a CPM minister said.         
	Among the 81 civic bodies that went to the polls this May, the Left won only 17. It had 60 out of 81 the last time. The Trinamul Congress tally went up from three civic bodies in 2005 to 27.        
	The CPMs worst results came from North 24-Parganas and Hooghly, where the party lost 29 of the 33 municipalities.        
	The debacle prompted the CPM state secretary to personally visit the party units in the two districts. Bimanda has turned a hard task master these days. Tomorrow, he is likely to ask us about our performance in the past six months and also whether we attend office regularly, a junior minister said.

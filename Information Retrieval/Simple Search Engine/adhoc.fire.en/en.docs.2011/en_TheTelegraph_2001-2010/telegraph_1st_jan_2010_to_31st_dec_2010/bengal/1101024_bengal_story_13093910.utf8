The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | JEE format to stay the same
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      JEE format to stay the same
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 23: The state joint entrance examinations (JEE) slated for April 17 next year will be structured the way it has been the past few years, with the organisers ruling out changes suggested by some teachers.        
	Students appearing for the exams  for admission to engineering and medical colleges in Bengal  will have to answer 80 per cent multiple choice questions (MCQ), and 20 per cent short-answer questions in two to three sentences.         
	The 80:20 ratio was introduced in the 2005 exam. Last year, 1.10 lakh students took the JEE.        
	 While MCQs test the depth of the candidates knowledge, short-answer questions gauge the ability to apply the knowledge.        
	A section of teachers had demanded that the number of MCQs be decreased as they feel it is more important for aspiring engineers and doctors to have the ability to have application skills.        
	The decision to continue with the old 80:20 ratio was finalised by the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examinations Board at a meeting before Puja. The board felt it was too late to make changes for the forthcoming exam and that more discussions are needed.        
	There were demands from a section of teachers that the ratio should be 50:50. Others wanted a ratio 60:40. After discussing the suggestions, the board has decided to continue with the old ratio, said board chairman Siddhartha Dutta.        
	According to Dutta, discussions on the suggestions to increase the number of MCQs will continue.        
	The board will start distributing forms for the 2011 JEE from next month, but with changes in the format.        
	For the first time, the JEE examination forms will contain instructions in Bengali.        
	According to Dutta, the decision has been taken to ensure that students studying in Bengali medium schools understand the instructions better and do not end up giving wrong information.        
	We had been noticing that many students did not understand the instructions in English well and gave wrong data, said Dutta.        
	For the first time, the forms will have a separate column on the mothers name. So far, only the fathers name was required.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bapi shunned by his own band
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bapi shunned by his own band
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 21: Members of Bapis own village defence squad had dissociated themselves from him after their Maoist bosses disowned him, forcing him to seek refuge with a relative in Jamshedpur.        
	Bapi is said to have told po-lice how he had planned the sabotage with the squad members, assigning duties and guiding them on how to remove the Pandrol clips. Bapi plotted the derailment and they executed it. But when he sought refuge with them, they turned their backs on him.        
	He has confessed to his involvement (in the sabotage). He has also said he was extremely surprised to see his own men refusing to provide him a safe house, said a CBI officer working on the case.        
	Bapi apparently provided the police elaborate details of when and how he had chalked out the sabotage plan. He said there was a plan to carry out strikes on government property during the Black Week that the Maoists started observing from May 21. Bapi started chalking out plans to execute this decision with his men who live in areas around his village, Rasua, 6km from the sabotage spot, said an officer.        
	Bapi claimed that the decision to target the railway tracks was taken on May 26, following alleged atrocities by security forces in nearby Manikpara. The Jnaneswari was derailed on May 28.        
	According to sources, Bapi was holding a meeting at Murabani on May 26 when the police raided the village.         
	The raid drew a blank. Bapi and his men had been tipped off about our movement, an officer said.        
	However, according to Bapi, the police tortured villagers and ransacked homes after the failed raid. An emergency meeting headed by Bapi and his accomplice Umakanta Mahato finalised the decision to target the tracks on the morning of May 27, the officer said.        
	Bapi apparently selected 20 youths for the operation. He assigned Bholanath Mahato and Hiralal Mahato, who were arrested a few days ago, the task of removing the clips. Samir Mahato, who is also in custody now, was among those standing guard with their arms. The entire operation was masterminded by Bapi, said another CBI officer.         
	The police explained why the Maoist leaders, who had taken Bapi away to seek an explanation why he targeted a passenger train keeping them in the dark, disowned him.        
	They were not happy as the operation had led to a backlash even among their sympathisers. But they did not kill him because he was a foot soldier. The Maoists have spread their organisation with the help of these men. Had they killed Bapi, it would have sent a wrong message to their ground-level fighters, an officer said. They simply let him fend for himself.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Syndicates cool to Deb Rajarhat sops 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Syndicates cool to Deb Rajarhat sops 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Calcutta, Dec. 5: Gautam Deb today unwrapped incentives aimed at rejuvenating an undeclared syndicate model that once bought peace with land-losers from all camps but the housing ministers latest initiative appears to have failed to strike a chord in Rajarhat.        
	Only 600 of the over 7,000 members from syndicates  groups of local suppliers of building materials and other real estate services  in the showpiece township turned up today at a meeting called by the housing minister.        
	The meeting, coming four days before the Trinamul Congresss planned siege of the Deb-headed developer Hidco demanding return of land allegedly acquired forcibly, was seen as his attempt to bolster local support.        
	This is a very low turnout. This shows that a lot of people have turned their backs on us, said Mohammad Yaqub, a CPM supporter who had come from Hatiara, 5km away.        
	According to figures reeled off by Deb and his officers, 218 syndicates and 56 co-operatives operate in Rajarhat. Deb was present with cabinet colleague, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, who had in the past criticised the way in which Hidco acquired land. His presence was meant to signal party unity.        
	Deb announced the sops (see box) to win the support of Rajarhat syndicates.         
	Calcutta had its first experiment with such syndicates  a zero-friction tool used by investors in Chennai in the early eighties to ensure smooth execution of projects by keeping all parties happy  when Hidco took over land for Rajarhat Megacity. The model involved giving some Opposition leaders in Rajarhat key posts in land procurement committees and allowing them to appoint hands in the suppliers syndicates.        
	Meetings of the kind Deb organised in Rajarhat today are crucial in the land politics of Rajarhat, especially ahead of Trinamuls planned gherao of the Hidco office on December 9. Most senior leaders connected with Rajarhat have attended the meetings. Before the gherao by Trinamul, we wanted to test our base, which has gradually eroded after the panchayat polls (in 2008 following the Nandigram and Singur land protests) and the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, said a CPM leader.

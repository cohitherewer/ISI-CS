The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM skirts street protest
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM skirts street protest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 23: The CPM is ready to hit the streets in states where it is in the Opposition but keen to play a responsible ruling party in Bengal.         
	Leaders and supporters of the CPM and its allies will court arrest by violating prohibitory orders in front of central offices across the country to protest price rise, privatisation attempts in the railway budget and other anti-people policies of the Centre on April 8, but not in Bengal.         
	Left Front chief and CPM state secretary Biman Bose today made it clear they would not go for the jail bharo in Bengal. The agitation here will be restricted to blockades and picketing in front of central government offices, particularly those of the railways.         
	The allies today wanted to go by the agitation programme chalked out by the Left parties at the national level. We should stick to a uniform agitation across the country, the Forward Blocs Ashok Ghosh told a front meeting.         
	The CPIs Swapan Banerjee and the RSPs Manoj Bhattacharya supported him.         
	But a CPM leader opposed it citing none other than Jyoti Basus example. You should remember how Jyotibabu opposed jail bharo programmes here. It goes against our government, state secretariat member Benoy Konar said.        
	Not convinced, Ghosh cited his partys law-violation during Basus tenure while the other allies stressed the need to keep up the Lefts fighting spirit. But another CPM leader, Madan Ghosh, indicated the Bengal CPMs wish to keep the agitation against the Congress-led Centre at a low key in the state and avoid traffic disruptions during the exam season.        
	The Bengal CPM has not resorted to a strike like its Kerala and Tripura counterparts after the fuel price hike.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee skipped the meeting, though he was at the venue, the state CPM office. He possibly wanted to stay away from the Lefts anti-Congress campaign when the state CPM and the government were trying to be soft on the party and drive a wedge into the Congress-Trinamul alliance.

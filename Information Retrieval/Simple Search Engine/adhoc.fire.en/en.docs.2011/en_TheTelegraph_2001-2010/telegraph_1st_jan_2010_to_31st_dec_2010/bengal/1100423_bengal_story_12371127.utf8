	April 22: Robbers last night stopped Debasree Roys car on a highway in Jhargram and snatched mobile phones and money from her driver and her brother but did not cause further harm, apparently after recognising the actress.        
	Debasree was returning to Calcutta after attending a school event in Gopiballavpur when the robbers stopped her car around 11pm by placing boulders on the road.        
	It seems the robbers wanted to take away (all) our belongings but when I told them I was Debasree Roy they probably recognised me and moved back. They did not harm us any further, Debasree said.        
	The actress and those accompanying her spent the night at Gopiballavpur police station before returning to Calcutta today.

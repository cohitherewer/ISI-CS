          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Jan. 22: A teenager from a family of CPM supporters has allegedly been raped and murdered in Nandigram.        
	The body of Dipanwita Jana, a first-year geography (honours) student at the local Sitananda College, was found floating on the Haldi river this afternoon.        
	The resident of Balarampur, 7km from Nandigram town, had been missing since leaving home for private tuition on Monday morning.        
	Her uncle Purna Chandra Jana, who had contested for a seat in the Nandigram II panchayat samiti in 2008 and lost, lodged a police complaint this evening alleging that the girl had been raped and murdered. There is a deep cons-piracy behind the rape and murder of my niece. I will not say anything more, Purna Chandra said.        
	A police officer said the decomposed body had multiple injuries. Preliminary investigations suggest rape and murder. But we cant say anything for sure now.        
	During the land war in Nandigram in 2007, the girls father Pratap and uncles Purna Chandra and Phanibhusan had had to flee homes following threats from the Trinamul Congress-led Save Farmland Committee. They returned home only after the Lok Sabha polls last year.        
	The CPMs East Midnapore district secretariat member, Ashok Guria, alleged Trinamuls hand in the murder. Trinamul leader Abu Taher, a key leader in the land war, called the charge baseless.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: Eight youths were arrested for allegedly beating up volunteers at a puja pandal in Kasbas Talbagan today.         
	The youths, all local residents, allegedly tried to enter the pandal through the gate meant for outsiders and refused to use the entrance meant for the people of Talbagan. When the volunteers at the pandal of Bosepukur-Talbagan Sarbojonin tried to stop them, the youths beat them up.        
	The organisers did not allow anybody to enter the pandal for four hours after the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Didi sees far-reaching effect
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Didi sees far-reaching effect
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 10: Mamata Banerjee today welcomed the Nanoor verdict and said it would have a far-reaching effect while the CPM claimed dedicated party workers and sympathisers had been framed.        
	Hats off to the judiciary for pronouncing 44 CPM men guilty of killing 11 innocent farmers. The CPM had repeatedly tried to establish that those murdered were robbers. They also tried to threaten witnesses and tamper with evidence. But we are grateful to the judiciary for ultimately punishing the CPM men, Mamata said this evening over phone from Delhi.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief evaded questions whether the verdict would impact the Assembly polls next year. Todays verdict is in favour of the poor and the minorities. It would have a far-reaching effect. The judgment will help us at a time the winds of change are blowing across Bengal, she said.         
	A section of people in the administration and police, who are acting at the CPMs behest, should take a lesson from the Nanoor verdict. If they act impartially, the crime rate will fall, Mamata added.        
	She accused chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of allowing the police to act in a partisan manner. Buddhababu cannot shirk his responsibilities as police minister. His narrow politics is encouraging policemen to be partisan, Mamata said.         
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said the party would use the verdict to campaign against the CPM in the run-up to the Assembly elections. We will highlight the verdict in our public meetings and rallies to expose the communists, he said.         
	CPM state secretariat member Rabin Deb claimed miscreants had attacked poor farmers when they were working in the fields.         
	However, charges have been framed against our dedicated party men and sympathisers. In the past, several cases had been filed against the communists. Even Jyoti Basu was a victim of that. Our struggle has continued amid such legal battles, Deb said.         
	He said the CPM would move Calcutta High Court after going through the verdict.        
	The state Congress welcomed the verdict and said the CPMs involvement in the murder of 11 farmers came to light only because of the judiciary.         
	The involvement of CPM harmads (goons) in the Nannor massacre has come to light thanks to the judiciary, state Congress president Manas Bhuniya said in Lalgarh, where he had gone today to lead a peace rally.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM arrogant: Partha
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM arrogant: Partha
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Partha Chatterjee                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 29: Partha Chatterjee today branded the chief minister arrogant and hot-headed a day after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had blamed the hotheads in the CPM for the partys alienation from the people.         
	The chief minister had said yesterday that there was no room for hotheads in his party. What about his own behaviour? the Trinamul Congress leader told reporters at the party headquarters in Topsia.         
	Chatterjee recalled how the chief minister had described the CPMs recapture of Nandigram in November 2007.        
	He had said Trinamul supporters had been paid back in the same coin. Buddhababu himself is arrogant, the Trinamul leader said.        
	Buddhababu had said, If they throw bricks at us, we will respond with bricks. If this is not an example of hot-headedness, what is?        
	Chatterjee said that since Bhattacharjee had owned up his party has made mistakes, he should resign.        
	The leader of the Opposition alleged: Three generations have been crippled by the policies and attitude of the CPM and its members.        
	He said the Left Fronts losses in the recent elections in the state were a pointer to the fact that it had lost the moral right to remain in power.

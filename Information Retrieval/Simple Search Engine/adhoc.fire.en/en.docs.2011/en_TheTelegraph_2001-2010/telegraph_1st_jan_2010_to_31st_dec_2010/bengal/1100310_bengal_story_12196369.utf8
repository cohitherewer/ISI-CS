          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, March 9: Police today said the seven cars stolen from a travel agent in Dankuni yesterday were last seen at a toll plaza on the Durgapur Expressway in Burdwan.        
	The police have traced the address of Ajay Gupta, the supposed filmmaker who stole the cars from travel agent Unnikrishnan Nair, to Navi Mumbai. We have contacted Maharashtra police and given them the details, said Satyajit Bandopadhyay, the Hooghly superintendent of police.        
	The police have also found some registration certificates of the Regional Transport Authority of Basti, Uttar Pradesh. Basti is close to Nepal. So there is possibility that the cars might be sold in Nepal after obtaining fake registrations in Basti, said a police officer.         
	Bandopadhyay said Guptas address was found after checking his PAN card, a photocopy of which had been submitted to the guesthouse. At 5.30pm yesterday, the cars passed the toll plaza at Palsit in Burdwan on the Durgapur Expressway, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bankura, Nov. 25: A suspected Maoist who is the prime accused in the murder of an officer in charge of Sarenga police station earlier this year was arrested from a Bankura forest last night.         
	Babulal Tudu, accused of murdering Rabilochan Mitra in an ambush at Sarenga on February 25, was picked up from the Boragori forest after police received information that he was holed up there. Mitra was returning after an encounter when he was led into a trap and shot dead.         
	A police team surrounded the forest and closed in on Tudus hideout. The Maoist surrendered without offering resistance.        
	Bankura police chief Pranab Kumar said Tudu was the only person accused in the case who had not been arrested.         
	Kumar said Tudu, 25, was a close associate of slain Peoples Committee leader Sidhu Soren.         
	The officer added: Tudu was a Maoist squad member. We had lost track of him since he fled after the encounter in West Midnapores Metala forest in which Soren was killed.         
	Last night, we raided the Boragori forest and arrested Tudu.        
	Kumar said detonators and explosives had been seized from Tudu.        
	The rebel was produced in Khatra subdivisional court this morning and remanded in 10 days police custody.         
	The police said Tudu was involved in seven other cases, including murder, extortion and arson.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Burdwan, May 20: Weeping villagers bid farewell to Biswalochan Santra and a gun salute boomed as the slain CRPF jawan was cremated in his native Burdwan village today.        
	Santra, from Burdwans Jubila village, was one of the five CRPF personnel killed in the Maoist blast yesterday.        
	He, along with three other slain jawans, was given a guard of honour by the central police force in Midnapore before he was taken to his village in Burdwan.        
	Nearly 200 villagers had gathered in front of his mud-walled house when Santras body reached Jubila around 5pm. Many, like his younger brother Paresh, were weeping. Santras body, draped in the Tricolour, was gently brought down from the truck by the CRPF personnel and kept in the courtyard.        
	Our mother has been fainting repeatedly since she heard about his death. His wife has been weeping since last evening, Paresh said. Biswas daughter and son held on to their uncle and wept.

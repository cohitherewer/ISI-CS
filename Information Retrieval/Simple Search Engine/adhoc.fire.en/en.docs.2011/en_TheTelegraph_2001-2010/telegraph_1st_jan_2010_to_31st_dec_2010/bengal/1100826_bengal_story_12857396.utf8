	Tamluk, Aug. 25: Gurjant Singh was today granted interim bail by a Tamluk court which asked the truck driver not to leave the state till the next hearing on September 8.        
	Gurjants lawyer Manjit Singh said Gopal Kumar Dalmia, the additional chief judicial magistrate, granted the bail after the CID failed to provide enough evidence in support of the charges of conspiracy and attempt to murder against the truck driver.         
	Gurjant was brought to the court lock-up from Tamluk subjail at 10.30am and taken to the courtroom at 2pm. The truck driver, accused of conspiring to murder Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, stood with folded hands in the court. After his bail, Gurjant said: I am very tense and will remain so till the end of the case.        
	Tapan Kumar Aditya, the CID officer investigating the case, submitted a 120-page case diary to the court.        
	Manjit said: The report of the motor vehicles department in Tamluk has said the trucks brakes had failed. But the lawyer did not explain why his client chose to drive the vehicle in such a condition and endanger the lives of others.        
	Also, the injury caused to Utpal Das Mahapatra (the driver of an escort car in Mamatas convoy into which Gurjant had rammed his truck on August 9) was minor. So Gurjant was granted bail, Manjit said. It was nothing but an accident, he added.        
	The judge has asked the truck driver to meet the investigating officer once a week.        
	Seeking judicial custody of Gurjant, public prosecutor Safiul Ali Khan argued that the driver had not cooperated with the CID to trace the khalashi (helper) of his truck.         
	He also said the court was yet to receive the forensic report on the truck and its brake system. So it is difficult to ascertain whether the brakes were (actually) faulty or there was a sabotage, he added.         
	The driver was brought to the gurdwara at Calcuttas Rashbehari Avenue after the hearing. We will put him up at the house of one of our members (of the Sikh community in Calcutta), said Satnam Singh, who accompanied Gurjant to Calcutta from Tamluk.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 29: A Visva-Bharati student was arrested this evening for allegedly stealing a juniors bicycle, with the varsity authorities claiming this was the first time a student of the institute had been picked up on the charge of theft.         
	Bikas Pathak, a fourth-year student of painting at Shantiniketans Kalabhavan, had allegedly stolen Jitul Khaklekars cycle earlier this month. Jitul, a first-year student of painting, had lodged a police complaint after the theft.        
	Police said Jitul today saw Bikas speaking to a local youth, Mithu Sheikh, on the campus with a cycle similar to his parked by their side.        
	When Jitul asked Mithu about the cycle, he said he had bought it from Bikas for Rs 1,500. Mithu said he had paid Rs 1,200 and was supposed to pay the remaining amount later, a police officer said.        
	Jitul informed some of his friends who were passing by and the duo were taken to the office of the security supervisor of the varsity, the officer said.        
	Mithu admitted at the office that he had bought the cycle from Bikas despite knowing that it had been stolen. Varsity officials then handed the duo over to the police.        
	This is the first time a Visva-Bharati student has been arrested for stealing. This is shameful. We handed over the duo to the police so that others learn a lesson, a senior official said.        
	Varsity sources said at least 17 cycles and a laptop had been stolen from the campus in the past six months.

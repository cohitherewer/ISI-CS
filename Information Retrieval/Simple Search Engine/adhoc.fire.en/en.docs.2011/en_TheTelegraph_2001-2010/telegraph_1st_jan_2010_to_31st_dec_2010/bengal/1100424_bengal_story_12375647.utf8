The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Varsity shifts exams out of Maoist turf
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Varsity shifts exams out of Maoist turf
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, April 23: Vidyasagar University in Midnapore has decided to shift its BA, BSc and BCom Part III examinations from colleges in Maoist-hit areas.        
	The move means around 1,500 students from five colleges in the troubled zone will have to travel between 50km and 100km to reach their exam centres in Midnapore town.        
	The university cited the disruption of normal life in the region to justify the move. Normal life in the Maoist-affected areas of West Midnapore has been seriously affected by bandhs, roadblocks and violent incidents. So, we dont want to take a risk during the exams. The students will be no doubt inconvenienced but we have no other option. The students will have to come and stay in Midnapore town for the exams, said Niranjan Mondal, the varsitys controller of examinations.        
	An official explained that the decision was taken to ensure that a sudden bandh or roadblock did not derail the exams, beginning April 28.         
	But the students were left wondering how to cope with exams far from their homes.        
	Third-year English (honours) student Subrata Nath said he could not afford to rent an accommodation on his own in Midnapore town. The BA exam will continue for 17 days from April 28.         
	In Midnapore town, a two-room accommodation costs at least Rs 2,500 a month. It is difficult to get such accommodation for only a few days. Moreover, landlords dont want to rent rooms to young people from Jungle Mahal, said Subrata, a farmers son who stu-dies at Sevabharati College at Kapgari village in Jamboni, around 50km from Midnapore town.        
	Chandranath Biswas, whose family income is less than Rs 4,000 a month, said: How will it be possible for us to rent accommodation?         
	The institutions from where the exams have been shifted are Raj College in Jhargram town, Chandrasekhar College in Shilda, Subarnarekha College in Gopiballavpur, Sevabharati College and Vivekananda Satabarshiki College.        
	Mondal said Raj College in Jhargram town and Viveka- nanda Satabarshiki College, which is 15km away, had earlier been thought fit for the exams. But we reviewed the situation and decided otherwise.        
	Students from Kapgari had submitted a memorandum to subdivisional officer C. Murgan on April 12, requesting the government to arrange for vehicles to ferry them every day.         
	District magistrate N.S. Nigam today said the administration had taken up the problem with the university.         
	The principals of the five colleges also want the government to take care of the students stay in Midnapore town. Otherwise, it will be difficult for our poor students, said Sevabharati principal Chittaranjan Mondal.         
	Travelling to Midnapore every day would be almost impossible for, say, the students of Gopiballavpur, 100km from the town.

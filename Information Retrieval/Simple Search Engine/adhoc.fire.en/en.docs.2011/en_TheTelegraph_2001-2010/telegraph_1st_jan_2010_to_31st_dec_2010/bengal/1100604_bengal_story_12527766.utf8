	Chandernagore, June 3: Chilli has given police the chills.         
	Three undertrials today escaped from a court compound in Chandernagore with the help of three of their bike-borne friends who threw chilli powder into the eyes of the police.         
	As the constables cried out in pain, undertrials Amit Rabidas, Satyendra Rabidas and Rajesh Rabidas hopped on to the motorcycle of one of the accomplices and sped away.        
	The motorcycle-borne youths also fired at the police but nobody was injured.        
	Another undertrial, Amarendra Rabidas, was caught by a policewoman. One of their saviours was captured by local shopkeepers, beaten up and handed over to the police.         
	One of the accomplices of the four, all from Bihar, also managed to give the police the slip.        
	The undertrials had been arrested by Jharkhand police and handed over to their counterparts in Chandernagore, where the four were involved in two bank robberies.

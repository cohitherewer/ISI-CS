          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 26: The Devi Shetty-led Narayana Hrudayalaya Group is planning to set up health facilities in the state, including a hospital in Salt Lake and a health city in Siliguri, the cardiac specialist said today.        
	The group, which runs the RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences in Calcutta, will set up an 800-bed multi-speciality hospital in Salt Lakes Sector V and the 3,000-bed health city in Siliguri. Shetty also announced plans for setting up a training college for nurses and paramedical staff in Sonarpur on the southern fringes of the city.        
	The Salt Lake unit is being set up in collaboration with Rotary Club, which has provided the land, said Shetty, who was in the city to sign a memorandum of understanding with Westbank Hospital. Narayana Hrudayalaya will set up a cardio-thoracic unit at Westbanks new hospital in Howrahs Andul.        
	Narayana Hrudayalaya authorities said that though the Salt Lake unit would have multi-speciality facilities, cardiac treatment would be the main focus. It should be operational within one-and-a-half years, an official said.        
	The health city in Siliguri will be spread over three acres, said Kunal Sarkar, cardiac surgeon and vice-president of the RN Tagore Institute. In the health city, different speciality units will be located in separate buildings.         
	Shettys group has acquired 14 acres for the training college in Sonarpur.

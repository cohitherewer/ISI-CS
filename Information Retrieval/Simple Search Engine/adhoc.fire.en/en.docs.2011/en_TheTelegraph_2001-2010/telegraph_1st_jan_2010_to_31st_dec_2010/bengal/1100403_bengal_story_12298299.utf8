          INDRANIL SARKAR                              
	Mangalkot (Burdwan), April 2: Nadira Bibi hopes to place a mothers prayer before P. Chidambaram when he visits Burdwan tomorrow.        
	On March 22, goons had entered 65-year-old Nadiras home and dragged away her son Hasmat even as she desperately tried to cling on to him.         
	Nadira believes Hasmat, 25, was shot dead because he was a Trinamul Congress worker. I dont know if ever Ill be able to meet such an important man, but if I do, my prayer to him will be to ensure that no son is dragged away from his mother and killed in front of her, the resident of Mullickpur village in Mangalkot said. I will plead with him and beg him to see that such a fate doesnt befall another mother.        
	Chidambarams office has said he will visit Burdwan. (But) it is still not known whether the Union home minister will visit other areas in Burdwan district like Mangalkot or restrict his visit to Burdwan town, state home secretary Ardhendu Sen said in Calcutta this evening.         
	Railway minister and Trinamul leader Mamata Banerjee has been insisting that Chidambaram visit Mangalkot, 60km from Burdwan town, to see the terror unleashed there by the CPM.         
	Mangalkot has repeatedly witnessed violence since the murder of a CPM leader last June. A Congress team led by MLA Manas Bhuniya was attacked and chased away through paddy fields.        
	Chidambaram will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on his return from Burdwan tomorrow evening. On Sunday, he will visit Lalgarh before leaving for Delhi.        
	But many residents of Mangalkot are hoping he will find time to visit the area where many Opposition supporters have been rendered homeless.        
	One such person is Deb Kumar Dhara, who has been away from home since the day CPM leader Falguni Mukherjee was found dead in a paddy field in his village, Kherua.        
	Dhara, 36, a local Trinamul leader, alleged that CPM activists had set fire to his two-storey house hours after Mukherjee was found dead on June 15 last year. They came in droves after that and stoned my house, blaming Trinamul for the death, Dhara said. I fled with my aged parents, wife and eight-month-old daughter. Then they set my house on fire.        
	He would definitely like to show the home minister my burnt house.        
	CPM district president (rural) Rabindranath Chatterjee said he had no interest in Chidambarams visit. But Trinamuls allegations are a pack of lies, Chatterjee said.         
	They are getting goons from Nanur to attack us.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Communal complaint on Mamata from CPM
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Communal complaint on Mamata from CPM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 18: The CPM today lodged a complaint with the state election commission, accusing Mamata Banerjee of fomenting communal tension with her speeches during her partys civic poll campaign.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had made the charge during a news conference on Sunday, but state CPM secretary Biman Bose today lodged a formal complaint with the commission demanding action against the Trinamul Congress chief.         
	In rallies on May 14 and 17, Bose said Mamata had claimed to have secret reports that the CPM and police had plans to trigger communal clashes in the Muslim-dominated areas of the city.         
	The speeches about communal clashes are meant to create terror among the people. These divisive efforts to stoke tension and hatred among different communities are being made in violation of the model code of conduct as well as the Representation of the People Act, his letter said.        
	CPM leaders claimed Mamatas alleged bid to create a sense of insecurity among the citys Muslims would be counterproductive. It has not gone down well with the citys minority community as Left-ruled Bengal has been free of communal trouble for long, said a leader of the city unit.         
	The CPM leaders also hoped that the RSSs public approval of Mamata as a possible future chief minister would help the Left remind Muslims about her tacit RSS connection.         
	As the Left tries to win back Muslims, who have deserted it since the 2008 panchayat polls, the chief minister as well as Bose will address rallies in the minority-dominated areas of Calcutta this week. If Bhattacharjee will be at Rajabazar and Tangra on Sunday, Bose will be at Garden Reach and Kidderpore. Politburo member and Rajya Sabha MP from Bengal, Sitaram Yechury, will go to Cossipore and Belgachhia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Chased from plains, Morcha strikes in hills 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Chased from plains, Morcha strikes in hills 
          OUR BUREAU                      Burnt buses in Kalimpong. (Chinlop Fudong Lepcha)                          
	Feb. 4: A backlash on vehicles and police erupted tonight in the Darjeeling hills after the administration used force to defuse a menacing stand-off in Siliguri between residents of the plains and young supporters of Gorkhaland.        
	A police jeep was set on fire in Darjeeling. In Kalimpong, a constable and a night guard were assaulted by arsonists who set fire to two government buses and a private bus.        
	Gorkha Janmukti Morcha vice-president Pradip Pradhan said no government vehicles, not even those of the police, would be allowed to ply in the hills from tomorrow till a probe had been conducted into the lathi-charge in the plains. Later, Morcha supporters laid siege to police stations in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong and Bijanbari.         
	The vandalism broke out a few hours after the police wielded batons to disperse members of the Gorkha Janmukti Vidyarthi Morcha, the youth wing of the Morcha that is spearheading the campaign for a separate state. The youths were on a fast in Siliguri demanding permission for a public meeting there on February 6.         
	A parallel protest was taking root in Darjeeling also at the same time. Protesters gheraoed the district magistrate as he refused permission to hold the rally in Siliguri. The gherao was continuing well past midnight.        
	The administration did not give permission for the meeting in Siliguri fearing it would foment ethnic tension between the plains residents who are against the statehood demand and those from the hills.        
	The administrations fears appeared to come true as some residents in the plains, grouped under an outfit called Bangla O Bangla Bhasha Banchao Committee, started converging near Siliguris Darjeeling More, the site of the hunger strike by the youths, in the evening.        
	Policemen and members of the district commando force threw a cordon around the Bhasha Banchao group near the statue of Tenzing Norgay, 50 metres from where around 60 Vidyarthi Morcha supporters were sitting with the seven fasting members.        
	The Morcha is spreading tension in the plains. Those on hunger strike should be stopped or we will continue our protest, shouted Mukunda Majumdar, the president of the Siliguri outfit.        
	The Vidyarthi Morcha refused to withdraw the hunger strike, following which the police chased the youths with batons. The police arrested 22 Morcha supporters and eight members of the Bhasha Banchao Committee.

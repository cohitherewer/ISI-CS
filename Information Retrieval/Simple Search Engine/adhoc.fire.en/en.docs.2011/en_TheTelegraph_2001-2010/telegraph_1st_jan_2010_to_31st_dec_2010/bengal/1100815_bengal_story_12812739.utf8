	Midnapore, Aug. 14: Suspected Maoists blew up a forest beat office, set a wooden bridge on fire and killed a CPM supporter in a series of attacks over the past 24 hours in West Midnapore, days after Mamata Banerjee implored them to give up arms and come to the talks table.         
	Fifteen armed rebels blew up the Bhaudi forest beat office in Jhargram yesterday and kept the four staff members and the wife and daughter of one of them hostage deep inside the forest for some time. They also asked the staff, who live in quarters on the premises, to leave the place within two days.         
	Bijli, the wife of one of the staff members, said the Maoists blew up the office on the suspicion that the CPM was planning to set up a camp for armed cadres there.         
	Jhargram beat officer Amiyo Dey said the staff members would be removed from the office because staying there would be a major threat to their lives.        
	A group of suspected Maoists also set fire to a wooden bridge in Nayagram near the Orissa border.         
	The bullet-riddled body of a CPM supporter was found in Kotwali today. Police said Chotu Mahato, 35, had been killed by Maoists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Fear drives CPM leaders from rival den
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Fear drives CPM leaders from rival den
          ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR                          Two CPM panchayat members from Khejuri who now live in Haldia, about 40km from their homes. (Jahangir Badsa)                                   
	Tamluk, April 5: The fear of the Trinamul Congress has kept nearly 150 elected CPM members of panchayat samitis and gram panchayats away from their offices for the past 10 months in East Midnapores Khejuri.        
	There has been no development work and the Rs 30 crore allotted for various schemes during the last financial year has remained unspent.        
	The two panchayat samitis in Khejuri havent held a single meeting to carry out development work in the past year. The elected members are not coming to office citing security reasons, district magistrate Archana Meena said.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram had yesterday mentioned Khejuri among the five places in Bengal where inter-party clashes had not been checked. But unlike in the other trouble spots  Nanoor, Khanakul, Mangalkot and Canning  where the CPM faces allegations of being the aggressor, the party appears the victim in Khejuri.        
	Khejuri had continued to be a CPM bastion even after Trinamul swept the 2008 rural polls: Trinamul snatched the zilla parishad from the Left party but the CPM retained both the panchayat samitis and nine of the 11 gram panchayats. But Trinamul took control of Khejuri after it won both the Lok Sabha seats in East Midnapore  Tamluk and Contai  in May last year.        
	In the first week of June last year, alleged Trinamul activists started ransacking and torching CPM offices across Khejuri. In Nandigram, four CPM panchayat members have not taken oath for fear of Trinamul even two years after the rural polls, prompting officials to mull a repoll.        
	Possibly because of Chidambarams reference to Khejuri yesterday, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee was not entirely happy with his comments on the states law and order. He should have said more, she said.        
	A leader of the CPMs East Midnapore district committee said: Nearly 1,500 party leaders and workers fled Khejuri after being targeted by the Trinamul Congress.         
	There were apparently 150 elected rural body members among the 1,500 who fled. Trinamul men asked the CPM members of the two panchayat samitis and the gram panchayats to give in writing that they were quitting their offices. Around 84 of them submitted letters of resignation to the block development officers of Khejuri I and Khejuri II, alleged Himangshu Das, a CPM zilla parishad member elected from Khejuri.        
	Das, too, was among those compelled to flee home with his family last June. Alleged Trinamul activists ransacked his house after he fled.        
	He said the 84 members were allowed to return to their homes after they submitted the resignation letters.        
	After last years Durga Puja, the then district magistrate had called a meeting of the elected members in hiding. Sixty-two of them turned up. Some of them told me they had been forced to resign. I had referred the matter to the panchayat department, former DM C.D. Lama said.        
	Das alleged that threats following the meeting had forced these 62 to flee their homes again.        
	Trinamul leaders denied having threatened any elected CPM member or forced them to resign. We have not forced any elected member to resign. The CPM members who fled are scared of public fury as the villagers are no longer prepared to accept the CPMs diktat, said Ranajit Mondal, the chief of the Trinamul-led zilla parishad.

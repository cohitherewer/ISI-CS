          PRONAB MONDAL                      Manoj Mahato rides a motorbike in Lalgarh on Monday. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                      
	Lalgarh, Aug. 9: Several wanted leaders of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities today led processions of the outfits supporters and members to Mamata Banerjees Lalgarh rally with the police claiming they spotted and arrested only one.         
	Committee chief Manoj Mahato and spokesperson Asit Mahato led a procession of 3,000 people from villages located deep inside Maoist strongholds.         
	However, the duo did not attend the rally. While Asit, wanted in the Jnaneswari Express sabotage case, spent an hour at Lalgarh bazaar before disappearing, Manoj, charged with murder and arson, vanished into the Jhitka forest  teeming with security forces  on his bike, 2km from the rally venue.        
	I am a leader of the deprived people. It is my duty to lead them from the front. If police arrest me, I am ready to face it, said Asit, standing in front of the Lalgarh BDO office, barely 300 metres from the rally ground.        
	Manoj echoed Asit. I was prepared to face any sort of situation. If police arrest me, our supporters will fight back. The PCPAs strength is enough to arrest a number of policemen, he said.        
	When asked what he expected from Mamata, Asit said: I want the demands of local people to be met. She should ask the government to withdraw the joint forces from Lalgarh and save the people from state-sponsored terrorism.         
	Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh had said wanted Peoples Committee leaders would be arrested if they were seen at the rally.         
	Singh today claimed at Writers Buildings that Manoj was never seen anywhere near the rally. We arrested Sushil Mahato from Lodhashuli, which is near the rally venue, he said.         
	The rally ground, which can accommodate 10,000 people, was packed to capacity.        
	Sources said many Trinamul Congress supporters had come from distant places but could not catch a glimpse of their leader because the ground was already filled up by committee supporters.         
	Manoj claimed the committee had marshalled around 40,000 supporters to Lalgarh. Today, we have proved our strength, he said.

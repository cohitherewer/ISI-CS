                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Left lash and Didi balm
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 30: A family of four that had been allegedly hounded out of its West Midnapore home by CPM goons today met Mamata Banerjee at her Kalighat residence, prompting her to accuse the Left Front government of trying to create a Kashmir-like situation in the state.        
	Kalpana Sinha Mahapatra alleged that she had fled her home with husband Tushar and children Buddha, 14, and Bappa, 12, after CPM goons threw bombs and fired at their house because they were Trinamul Congress supporters.         
	Kalpana alleged that she and her husband had been threatened by CPM activists who had ordered them not to attend the Trinamul chiefs August 9 Lalgarh rally. The threats increased after we attended the rally. We decided to escape after armed CPM cadres came to our house on Saturday and asked us to leave Trinamul, Kalpana said.        
	Mamata said: The state government has no right to remain in power. Such incidents are regularly happening in Jungle Mahal. No administration exists there. She accused the government of buying arms for CPM cadres from the tribal development fund.         
	The family has been put up at the house of a Trinamul worker in Calcutta. Trinamul sources said Mamata was planning to take the family to Union home minister P. Chidambaram. Does it (the state government) want to create a Kashmir-like situation in Bengal? It is doing whatever it wants, violating the norms of democracy, Mamata said.        
	Buddha, a Class VIII student, said: If we stay in Calcutta, my brother and I will not be able to go to school. We want to return home as soon as possible.

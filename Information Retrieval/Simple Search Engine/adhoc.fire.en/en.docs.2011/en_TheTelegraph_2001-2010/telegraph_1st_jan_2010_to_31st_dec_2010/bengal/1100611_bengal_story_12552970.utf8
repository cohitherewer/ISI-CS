          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mithipur (Murshidabad), June 10: A Class X girl whose family tried to marry her off forcibly has managed to persuade them to let her study  but with a little help from police.        
	Fatema Khatun (name changed), a 15-year-old from Murshidabads Mithipur village, boarded a cycle van and travelled 6km to Raghunathganj police station after her brother-in-law Shafiq-ul Sheikh brought a marriage proposal from Chandpur, near Jangipur, last Friday. She lodged a complaint against her mother, brother and Sheikh.        
	When my mother, elder brother and brother-in-law started discussing the proposal, I told them I did not want to marry now. They tried to put pressure on me, saying the would-be groom was a good choice. They refused to listen to me, Fatema said.        
	Fatema said her family told her that her elder sister too had got married when she was 15. But Fatema told the police her sister had not shown any interest in carrying on with her studies and had apparently not objected to the early marriage.         
	Sudharanjan Sarkar, the inspector-in-charge of Raghunathganj police station, heard Fatema out and asked her to lodge a complaint.         
	He also instructed a constable to accompany her to the nearby block office, where Fatema spoke to Abhisek Mitra, the joint block-development officer.        
	On Mitras request, Mujibur Rehman, the headmaster of Fatemas school, and the chief of Giria gram panchayat, Samiruddin Biswas, visited her house and convinced her family that marrying before the age of 18 was illegal. They also told Fatemas mother Amina Bibi (name changed) and brother Naimuddin Sheikh (name changed) that the young girl wanted to continue with her studies and should be allowed to choose her groom.        
	We had thought she would agree to marry now. Since the boy was from a good family and was well placed, we thought Fatema would agree, Amina said.         
	It was after her family agreed to call off the marriage that Fatema returned home in the evening from the joint BDOs office. However, she is yet to withdraw the FIR.        
	Murshidabad police chief B.L. Meena said: Our officers had started an investigation based on the girls complaint. But now her mother has said that Fatema can continue with her studies as long as she wants to.         
	Fatema has told the police she wants to be a graduate and become a teacher.

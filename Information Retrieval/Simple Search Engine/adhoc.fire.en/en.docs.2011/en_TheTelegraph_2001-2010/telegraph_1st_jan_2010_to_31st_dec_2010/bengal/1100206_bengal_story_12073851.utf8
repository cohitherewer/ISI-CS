The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM quota call for backward Muslims
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM quota call for backward Muslims
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 5: The CPM central committee supports reservation for backward classes among Muslims in government jobs and education but is unlikely to accept the community as a whole as backward.        
	We are not going to accept the (Ranganath) Misra commissions recommendations in toto. We support the first part of it, which has asked (the Centre) to treat backwards among (the) majority community and minorities on a par, said a party politburo member.        
	This means we stand for more quotas for Dalits, OBCs and other poor and weaker people among Muslims, he added.         
	Certain Muslim OBCs now come under job quotas recommended by the Mandal commission. But a section of the party wants the list of Muslim OBCs to be expanded.         
	However, some in the party feel such a move would deprive many poor and backward Muslims who cannot be categorised among OBCs.         
	The Misra panel had asked for a 15 per cent reservation in government jobs and education for minorities, including 10 per cent for Muslims. However, it wanted the entire community to be regarded as backward as it was very much under-represented, sometimes wholly unrepresented, in government employment.        
	Over the past two days, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and Bengal party secretary Biman Bose have stressed that the party will accept the recommendation for Muslims and other minorities, but not their creamy layers.         
	Karat will clarify the party central committees final decision tomorrow after its deliberations in Calcutta end.        
	The committee will also conclude tomorrow its discussion on organisational rectification. It is also to discuss whether the party congress, due in April-May next year, should be brought forward or put off to avoid a clash with the polls in Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.         
	We will discuss it (the dates) tomorrow, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said after todays session. Another member, M.K. Pandhe, said the politburo had not made up its mind. The party congress needs huge preparations. So do the Assembly polls. But all the states need to be consulted before we decide.        
	The Bengal leadership is not in favour of advancing the congress. Its hands are already full with the elections to 82 civic bodies across the state in May-June this year as well as the Assembly polls around the same time next year.         
	Price war        
	The politburo went into a huddle this morning to decide how Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his Kerala and Tripura counterparts would attack the Congress-led Centre on price rise at the chief ministers conclave in Delhi tomorrow. Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee could attend the meeting.

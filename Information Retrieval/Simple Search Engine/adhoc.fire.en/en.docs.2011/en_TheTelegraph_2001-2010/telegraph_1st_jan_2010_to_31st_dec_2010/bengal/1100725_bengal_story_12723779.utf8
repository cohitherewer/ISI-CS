                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul assault on Bhuniya
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Khejuri/Calcutta, July 24: Trinamul Congress supporters today allegedly abused and pushed state Congress president Manas Bhuniya and threw stones at his car while he was returning from a rally in Khejuri.        
	The rally was organised by the East Midnapore district Congress to protest the alleged attack by Trinamul activists on a Youth Congress team on July 12. The team, lead by Youth Congress leader Usha Naidu, was stopped from holding a rally in Khejuri by Trinamul supporters.         
	Naidu had accompanied me today to Khejuri, Bhuniya said. When I was returning to Calcutta after wrapping up the meeting, I came to know that Trinamul activists were beating up boys from my party. While I was rushing back, Trinamul activists stopped my car and abused me. They even pushed me and threw stones at my car.        
	He added: I want to ask my Trinamul friends why they are allowing criminals to infiltrate their party.        
	I consider it a serious matter. If the PCC president is attacked, then imagine what would happen to our ordinary party workers in my absence. Khejuri is no more a CPM stronghold. So, I cannot blame the CPM for todays incident.         
	District Congress president Manik Bhowmik said he had lodged an FIR at the local Heria police station.

	Calcutta, Oct. 29: A portion of a Bengal tigers tail had to be amputated after it was injured while being trapped by forest officials in the Sunderbans, throwing up questions on the accepted method of snaring the big cat.         
	Forest officials said the full-grown male tiger had been trapped in a cage on October 23 in Cannings Sajnekhali after residents complained that the animal had been straying into the village.         
	After the tiger was trapped, doctors noticed a deep cut in its tail. We think the iron door of the cage had come crashing down on its tail while it was walking into the trap. It is evident that the people concerned had not prepared the trap properly, a forest official said.        
	An official at the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (STR) in Sajnekhali, where the animal was taken, said doctors stitched up the cut and gave the tiger antibiotics.        
	However, after four days, during an examination of the wound, STR officials found it was bleeding. Doctors said the tiger probably could not bear the persistent irritation in the tail because of the injury and had chewed up the stitches. A vertebra (a bone of the spinal column) in its tail had snapped, P. Vyas, the director of the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve, said.        
	The tiger was brought to Alipore zoo yesterday and a portion of the tail was amputated as the injury had become irreparable. About 10 inches had to be cut off, Vyas said.        
	Experts said the tiger could be released into the wild only after three weeks.        
	Explaining how a tiger is trapped, a forest official said: The cage door, which is fitted with a lever, is kept open. A goat is kept inside the cage as a bait. When a tiger walks into the cage, there is a jerk and the lever becomes loose, bringing the door down.         
	We are reviewing the process of trapping tigers in iron cages. We are trying to find ways to prevent tigers from getting hurt in the future, he added.        
	Another official said this was the first time in Bengal in two-and-a-half decades that any part of a tiger had to be amputated because of an injury suffered while being trapped.

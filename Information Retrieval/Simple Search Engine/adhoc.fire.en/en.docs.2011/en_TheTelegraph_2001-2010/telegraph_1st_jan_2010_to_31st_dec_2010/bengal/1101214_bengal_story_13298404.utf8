The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minority pangs in Congress
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Minority pangs in Congress
          BARUN GHOSH                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 13: Muslim Congress leaders are upset with what they believe is the inadequate representation given to the community in the newly formed Pradesh Congress Committee months before the Assembly polls.        
	Their resentment has come to the fore a day after the the CPM invited Muslims from Bengal staying in Delhi to a meeting in the capital to tell them what the Left Front had done for them during its 34-year reign.         
	I was PCC general secretary since the days of Priyada (Priya Ranjan Das Munshi). But this time, I was dropped though I had performed to the best of my capacity. Muslims in certain pockets always vote for us. So it would have sent a positive message to our community had there been a proportionate representation of our people in the PCC, said Abu Hena, referring to the December 4 PCC shuffle in which he and others did not find a place.        
	Although large sections of Muslims have switched loyalties to Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress in successive elections since the 2008 panchayat polls, the Congress has retained its support in minority-dominated areas such as Malda, Murshidabad and Calcuttas Garden Reach-Metiabruz.        
	Abdul Mannan, who resigned as general secretary last week despite being among the handful of minority Muslim leaders to have been accommodated in the shuffle, echoed the sentiment and said he would take up the matter in Delhi.         
	We dont accept the present PCC. It is full of those who have no political background. The party has been reduced to a platform for NGO-run people. I shall fight to the end, said Mannan, who had declared that he was quitting the post to protest the entry of unwanted elements.        
	AICC general secretary K. Keshava Rao, in charge of the partys Bengal affairs, expressed readiness to address the grievances, if any. Muslims constitute our traditional vote bank. We must address grievances, if they have any, over inadequate representation in the Bengal PCC. I shall talk to Bengal leaders when they come here for the AICC plenary from December 18, Rao said from Delhi.        
	But state Congress chief Manas Bhuniya didnt appear to agree with the notion of under-representation and claimed the new PCC had been formed by the high command after discussions with state leaders. I dont subscribe to the view that Muslims are not adequately represented in the PCC. I have to accommodate leaders from other minority communities also.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoists kill 3 in strikeback base hunt
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Purulia, Oct. 4: Maoists shot dead three Forward Bloc supporters in Purulia last night, the foray suggesting that the rebels are on the hunt for softer targets after being forced on the backfoot by the joint forces and a rejuvenated CPM.         
	Ration dealer Dasarath Majhi and Bloc supporters Suklal Murmu and Leru Majhi, the husband of a gram panchayat member, were dragged out of their homes in Bagmundis Chirugora village, trussed up and shot dead in front of villagers by a gang of 35 suspected rebels.         
	The number of Left casualties in Purulia at the hands of rebels in the past three months has now risen to seven, a pointer to the growing clout of the Maoists in the district.        
	Police said many rebels had shifted base to Purulia in recent months after coming under attack from the joint forces and the CPM in West Midnapore. Purulia is around 180km from West Midnapore.        
	We have reports that Maoists are fleeing from West Midnapore and taking shelter in Bankura and Purulia, said Purulia superintendent of police Rajesh Yadav. Although Purulia and Bankura are rebel hotbeds too, West Midnapore has borne the brunt of the Maoist attacks.         
	Off the record, police sources said that in West Midnapore, armed CPM cadres were recapturing village after village with the help of the joint forces.         
	CPM sources have said the party is planning to reclaim Lalgarh after snatching back Dharampur, Ramgarh and Pirakata from the Maoists in recent months.         
	Several villages in West Midnapore, too, have stepped up the heat against the rebels. People armed with sticks and scythes have been guarding their villages in the night to ward off Maoist attacks. Some villagers have chased away rebels trying to force them into joining their rallies.         
	The retreating Maoists are either escaping to Orissa or taking refuge in Bankura and Purulia, a police officer said.         
	From the reports we have received, it appears that the Maoists are now planning to build strong bases in Bankura and Purulia before attempting to strike back in West Midnapore. The Maoists may try to recapture the West Midnapore villages they have lost to the CPM, an officer said.         
	Yesterdays murders in Purulia reinforce our point. I cannot remember the last time the Maoists killed so many people in the district at one go, another officer said.         
	Around 9 last night, the Forward Bloc trio were dragged to a tree at the heart of the village and gunned down in front of shocked villagers.         
	Lerus brother Mukul Majhi said: The trio were shot dead in front of at least 100 villagers, including children.        
	They showed no mercy, said Jaleswari Majhi, Dasaraths wife. My daughter Chumki and I pleaded with the Maoists to let my husband go but they did not relent, Jaleswari said.        
	Suklals father Lakshmiram Murmu said his son was killed for refusing to attend a Maoist rally in the village three months ago.         
	They (the Maoists) had called a meeting in our village and had asked all residents to attend the meeting, Lakshmiram said.        
	Residents of Chirugora village said they feared some of them would also be killed as a large number of Maoists had assembled at the nearby Ayodhya Hills.         
	God knows what will happen now, Lakshmiram said.        
	A team from Bagmundi police station, 20km away, arrived at Chirugora this morning and sent the bodies for post-mortem.

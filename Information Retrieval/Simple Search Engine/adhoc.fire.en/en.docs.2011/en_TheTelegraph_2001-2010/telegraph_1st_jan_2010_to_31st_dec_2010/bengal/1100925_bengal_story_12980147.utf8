          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 24: The state government has agreed to spare nine companies of the state armed police (SAP) for the Bihar Assembly elections.        
	The Centre had repeatedly requested the Left Front government for 20 companies of the SAP for the five-phase Bihar Assembly polls, to be held from October 21 to November 20. However, the state government had refused, saying the forces were needed for the anti-Maoist operation in Jungle Mahal.        
	State home secretary Samar Ghosh said at Writers Buildings today: We have informed the Union home ministry that nine companies can be spared. However, they cannot be sent before October 21. They are needed here for security during the festive season.

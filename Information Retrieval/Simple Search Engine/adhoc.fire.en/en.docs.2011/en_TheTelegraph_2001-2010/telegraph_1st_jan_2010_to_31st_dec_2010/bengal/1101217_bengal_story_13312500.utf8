          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Siddhartha Shankar Ray                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 16: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim stayed away from an Assembly discussion on Siddhartha Shankar Ray today, reflecting the ruling Lefts aversion to the late Congress leaders legacy.        
	Although the Speaker had allowed todays obituary reference on demands from the Congress and Trinamul, his absence and that of the chief ministers was seen as the CPMs way of dissociating itself from Ray whose reign it often refers to as the black 1970s.         
	None of the Left members present uttered a word on Ray, despite deputy Speaker Bhaktipada Ghosh, who stood in for Halim, repeatedly asking the MLAs if anyone else wanted to speak. Only three leaders  the Congresss Manas Bhuniya, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee and nominated member Barry Brien  spoke.        
	For the CPM, any change in its assessment of Ray could prove tricky at the present juncture, when it is making the late leaders regime a campaign issue in its battle against Mamata Banerjee. The ruling party has been trying to convince people that a Trinamul-Congress win in the 2011 polls could mean a return to those dark days.        
	Government chief whip Syed Mohammad Masih said: As the resolution was adopted last week, there was no need to speak today.

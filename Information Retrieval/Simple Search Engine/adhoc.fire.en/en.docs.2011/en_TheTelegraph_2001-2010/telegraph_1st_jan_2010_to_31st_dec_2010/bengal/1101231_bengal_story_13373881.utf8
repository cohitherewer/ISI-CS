          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Mamata at the Dum Dum rally on Thursday. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray    
	Calcutta Dec. 30: Mamata Banerjee today followed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to Dum Dum, where she accused the state government of political sabotage and urged the public not to forgive the CPM.        
	Four days after the chief minister addressed a rally on the Dum Dum central jail grounds, the Trinamul Congress chief held a public meeting at the same venue today.        
	Mamata told the gathering of around 40,000 that the CPM was to blame for everything that goes wrong.         
	Dont forgive the CPM. The party can do anything to cling to power. It can go to any level. Political sabotage is on its mind.        
	Claiming that the Assembly polls will be declared any day, she appeared to sing the CPMs dirge. CPM tumi jotoi maro/2011, ebar haro (CPM, do whatever you can, you will lose in 2011), Mamata said, rephrasing a slogan the Left had coined during the seventies. The original slogan was: Police tumi jotoi maro, mainey tomar eksho-baro (police, however much you assault us, your salary will stay Rs 112).        
	The Trinamul chief accused the CPM of using its government machinery to disrupt the functioning of the Trinamul-run civic bodies and zilla parishads.        
	She warned the people that if the CPM came back to power after the Assembly elections, the state could witness a re-run of Nandigram and Singur.         
	In keeping with her recent trend of tailing the chief minister, Mamata announced a rally in Rajpur on Sunday. Bhattacharjee today addressed a rally of the Left-backed state government employees coordination committee in Rajpur.        
	She said she would address a gathering of government employees who oppose the Left. Mamata criticised the Left-backed coordination committee for holding its rally on a weekday.         
	We are going to hold the meeting on a non-working day. That is the difference between them and us. The chief minister is begging everyone  from primary school teachers to government employees  to keep the Left in power. The coordination committee will not be able to save them, she said.

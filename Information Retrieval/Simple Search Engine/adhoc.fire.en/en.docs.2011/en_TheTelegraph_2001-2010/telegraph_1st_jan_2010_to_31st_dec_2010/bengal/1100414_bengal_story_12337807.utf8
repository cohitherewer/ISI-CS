The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Same curse kills boys in same class
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Same curse kills boys in same class
  - Trousers out of reach, life lost         OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Tamluk, April 13: Haripada Pal had told his father he felt uneasy going to school wearing shorts. He was 15.        
	But for a man who earned Rs 1,500 a month when lucky, spending money on trousers for his son was a luxury.        
	Sitting next to a lifeless Haripada today, he said: Had he told me he wanted the pants so badly, I would have borrowed money to buy them.         
	Haripada killed himself, apparently unable to bear the shame of having to enter barelegged a classroom where half the children were girls and most of the boys were in trousers.        
	When he returned home from school  in East Midnapores Patashpur, about 150km from Calcutta  on Friday and drank a bottle of pesticide, his father was looking for work and his mother was caught up in her chores.         
	Rabindra, 40, a day labourer, said it was with great effort that he was sending his two sons to school.         
	His elder son Chandan wrote his secondary examinations from the same Heeralal Vidya Niketan this year. Chandan had worn half-pants till Class VIII. If only I had known that my younger son would go to this extent for a pair of full pants, the father sobbed.        
	Haripadas mother Basanti, 35, cried inconsolably.        
	He was the sensitive type. After being promoted to Class VII, he had repeatedly told us to buy him trousers. He told us that he had grown up and felt awkward in front of the girls of his class in half pants. He had quarrelled with us for the pants on several occasions. But we told him we couldnt immediately afford the trousers, said Basanti.        
	Haripada used to go to school in the shorts his father had bought him when he reached Class VI. Rabindra had bought trousers for his elder son only after he had been promoted to Class IX.         
	Classmate Pralay Burman, who lives in nearby Gokulpur, said Haripada was disappointed because his father could not buy him trousers.        
	I had told him that I, too, went to school in shorts and I didnt mind. But he pointed out that there were many others in Class VII who wore trousers. Moreover, there were girls in our class and he felt shy, said Pralay.        
	The teachers were shocked. The school has a uniform  white shirts and navy blue pants  but there is no bar on shorts. The school has not made it mandatory for students to wear trousers from Class VII, said headmaster Biman Poyra.

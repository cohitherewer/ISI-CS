	Purulia, Aug. 20: Maoists snatched firearms from the residents of five villages in Purulias Jhalda last night in a four-hour raid.        
	Police said that from the precision with which the group of 35 rebels targeted the villagers, it seemed they had information on which households kept licensed firearms.        
	The Maoists raided the houses of five villagers in Khamar, Jojuhatu, Kasidih, Kolgaon and Tentar, and took away six firearms.         
	The police said the Maoists had become desperate after suffering heavy casualties at the hands of the joint forces.

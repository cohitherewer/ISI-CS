The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | A divine task cut out for CPM
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      A divine task cut out for CPM
  - Mollah in Hardwar for poll strength        BARUN GHOSH                      Abdur Rezzak Mollah                                
	Calcutta, Oct. 22: Forget dialectical materialism. It is time to take a crack at dialectical spiritualism and separate pilgrimage from sightseeing.        
	Marxist minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah has said he went on a pilgrimage to Hardwar and Rudra Prayag to seek some strength before launching preparations for next summers Assembly elections.        
	But his party, brought up on the gospel that religion is the opium of the masses, feels it was a sightseeing tour. Since most places of pilgrimage are picturesque, perhaps only a party congress can settle the question.        
	I stayed in an ashram in Hardwar and took prasad daily. From Hardwar, I went to the small town of Rudra Prayag where the Alaknanda and Mandakini rivers meet, making it a pilgrimage spot of great significance. There is nothing wrong in visiting the holy cities of Hardwar and Rudra Prayag, Mollah told The Telegraph on his return to Calcutta this afternoon from the weeklong trip that began on October 14.        
	The land and land reforms minister is seen as a loose cannon in CPM circles for often going public against party leaders, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	But Mollah was quick on the draw when asked what had prompted him to go on the pilgrimage at a time of political clashes in Bengal, including his hometown Canning. The unrest had prompted governor M.K. Narayanan to appeal for peace.        
	I had worked out my Hardwar trip long back. I went on the pilgrimage to gain some strength before launching my preparations for the Assembly elections. I am not going to stay away from the polls as I had said earlier because I dont want people to call me a coward, Mollah, in his late sixties, said.        
	Asked if he had sought blessings to retain Canning East, a seat he has been winning since 1977, the minister said: I came back with renewed energy and I am sure of retaining my seat this time also.        
	The CPM leadership, however, claimed Mollah had gone sightseeing. We know that Rezzak had gone to Hardwar and Rudra Prayag for sightseeing. You are calling it a pilgrimage to give us a bad name because we as communists have no faith in gods and goddesses, said CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar.         
	Mollah is no stranger to controversy and to making remarks that have embarrassed his party. He had raised his voice against Bhattacharjee for forcibly acquiring land in Singur from farmers for the Nano project.         
	Two months ago, he was mildly rebuked by the CPM leadership for publicly saying that the party had become alienated from the masses and had a remote chance of returning to power.         
	The issue of whether a CPM member can be a religious observant was tossed up in 2006 when the late Subhas Chakraborty had performed puja at the Tarapith temple. He had chanted Jai Tara (victory of Goddess Tara) and offered Rs 501, two red hibiscus and a sari to the deity. Chakraborty was later censured for his un-communist gesture.        
	In January this year, former Kerala MP Kurisinkal Sebastian Manoj had resigned from the CPM saying it denied him the right to affirm his faith in god.

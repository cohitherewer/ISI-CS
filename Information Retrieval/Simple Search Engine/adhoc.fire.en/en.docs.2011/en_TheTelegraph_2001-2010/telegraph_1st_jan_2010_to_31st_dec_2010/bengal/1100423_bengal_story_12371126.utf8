The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Salt Lake civic truce
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Salt Lake civic truce
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Majumdar      
	Calcutta, April 22: The CPM has managed to coax Biswajiban Majumdar, the aggrieved outgoing chairman of the Salt Lake municipality, into agreeing to campaign for the party in the May civic polls.        
	Majumdar had refused to contest the civic polls and aired his grievances against the party leadership in public after being denied re-nomination from the ward he had contested five years ago.        
	I have my commitment to the people of Ward 15 from where I had contested last time. The party is now offering me another ward. Why should I accept that? Am I a puppet that dances to the party bosses tune? Majumdar had said.        
	He had also accused some leaders of the CPMs North 24-Parganas unit of using Jyoti Basus name to pressure him into granting them favours.        
	While some in the CPMs North 24-Parganas district committee wanted disciplinary action against Majumdar, a senior Left Front minister, who is a resident of Salt Lake, took the matter up with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and lobbied in the chairmans favour.        
	After Bhattacharjees intervention, state CPM secretary Biman Bose spoke to Majumdar yesterday, party insiders said.        
	Sources close to Majumdar claimed that Bose had appreciated his grievance at not being consulted before the party leadership decided to change his constituency. However, Bose told him not to air his complaints in public any more.        
	Amitabha Nandi, the district committee member in charge of the polls in Salt Lake, met Majumdar this morning, apparently on Boses instruction. Nandi is said to be responsible for shifting Majumdar from his constituency to an unsafe seat.        
	Both Majumdar and Nandi later said they had reached an understanding and the outgoing chairman would join the partys poll campaign.

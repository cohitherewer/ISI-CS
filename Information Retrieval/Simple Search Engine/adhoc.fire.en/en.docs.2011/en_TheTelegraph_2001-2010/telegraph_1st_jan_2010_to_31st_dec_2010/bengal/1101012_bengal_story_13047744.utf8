	Oct. 11: The chief ministers secretariat today said the alleged coal smuggler who had handed a cheque to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Burdwan yesterday had introduced himself as the president of a gurdwara prabandhak committee.        
	Jaswant Singh Upal alias Kale Singh had handed a cheque for Rs 1.11 lakh to Bhattacharjee for a college.        
	A gurdwara prabandhak committee was scheduled to send a representative to hand over a cheque to the chief minister. When Kale Singh went up to the stage, those present did not know who he was. The chief minister had no idea, said an official of the chief ministers secretariat.         
	We will hold a meeting to decide if we will accept the money, said Arpan Prasad Ghosh, the secretary of the committee formed to set up the college.

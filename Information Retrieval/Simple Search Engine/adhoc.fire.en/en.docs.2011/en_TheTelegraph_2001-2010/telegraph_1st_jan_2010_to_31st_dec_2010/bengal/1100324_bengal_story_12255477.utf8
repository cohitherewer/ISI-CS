                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hit-and-run van kills two
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 23: A Matador van today mowed down two motorcyclists while trying to speed away after hitting a 12-year-old girl at Karbala Road near Metiabruz.        
	Police said the van was also travelling at a great speed when it hit pedestrian Faroqui Khatun. Then the driver tried to escape and in the process rammed into the motorcycle coming from the opposite direction, said Abu Naskar, who lives in the area.         
	The girl is in hospital. Police identified the dead duo as cousins Asraf Ali, 22 and Khairul Basar, 20. It is a congested area and we have repeatedly requested the police to curb rash driving, a resident complained. The van driver has fled.

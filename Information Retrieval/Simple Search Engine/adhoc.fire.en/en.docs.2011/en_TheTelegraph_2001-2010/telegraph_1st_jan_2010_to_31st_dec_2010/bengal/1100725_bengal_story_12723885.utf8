	Siliguri, July 24: A MiG-27 fighter today crashed in a field in Jalpaiguri, burst into flames and skidded into huts nearby, killing two persons and injuring at least 20.        
	The pilot, Saket Verma, survived but was injured.         
	Officials said the IAF plane was on a routine sortie. It took off from the Hasimara Air Base in Jalpaiguri at 10.30am and crashed into the agricultural field in Dakshin Gurudebpur village 15 minutes later.        
	Bholen Roy, 55, was killed after the plane smashed into his hut. His younger brother Ranjit is in hospital with 100 per cent burns.         
	The MiG-27 also ploughed into the hut of Sunil Roy, injuring his wife Jaya and three children. Four other kids who were playing with the trio in front of Roys home were also injured. Later, one of Roys three children, Latika, died of her injuries in hospital.        
	We were working in the field close to our house when we saw the plane crashing down with a deafening noise. We ran for our lives, said Prabir, another of Bholens brothers.        
	Suresh Chandra Bhowmik, the superintendent of Jalpaiguri District Hospital where the injured were taken, said most of the 20 had severe burns.        
	Twelve MiG aircraft have crashed in north Bengal since 2002, including three this year.

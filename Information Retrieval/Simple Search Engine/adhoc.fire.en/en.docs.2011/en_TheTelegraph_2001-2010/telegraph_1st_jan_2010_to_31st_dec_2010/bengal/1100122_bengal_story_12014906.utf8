The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | RSS venue hurdle to Basu homage rally
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      RSS venue hurdle to Basu homage rally
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 21: The CPMs plan for a Jyoti Basu homage rally on Sunday at the Shahid Minar ground has been thrown into disarray because the RSS has a meeting there the previous day and has refused to vacate the area by evening.        
	CPM state committee member Rabin Deb said the dais would take at least 12 hours to erect and supporters would start arriving at the rally venue on Saturday night itself. But the RSS has said it will not vacate the ground before 6pm.        
	The CPM today blamed police for misleading its leaders on the January 23 RSS rally  its chief Mohanrao Bhagwats first public meeting in calcutta  though the force denied giving wrong information.        
	The police gave us permission to hold the condolence meeting at Shahid Minar. When party leaders Rabin Deb and Niranjan Chatterjee approached the police for permission, they were told that the RSS would hold its rally at Rani Rashmoni Avenue, said former CPM MP and party secretariat member Mohammad Salim. Rani Rashmoni Avenue is about 400 metres from Shahid Minar.        
	Only after we get possession of the ground, can we start constructing the stage. Against this schedule, we would have to work all through the night on January 23, Deb said. This is a huge affair because several dignitaries and high-profile leaders will come.         
	The RSS claimed the organisation had got police clearance to hold the rally at Shahid Minar three to four months back. There is no question of either calling off or deferring our rally at Shahid Minar maidan. The rally is Bhagwatjis first in the city since he became sarasanghachalak. Over 10,000 swayamsevaks are expected, said Ranendranath Bandopadhayay, the RSS chief in eastern India.        
	He said the swayamsevaks would not be able to vacate the ground before 6pm. Though the rally is supposed to be over by 5pm after Bhagwatji delivers his speech, sawayamsevaks from far-flung districts will take time to disperse, he said.         
	An RSS activist said they were ready to confront the CPM if the party dares to vacate us from the Shahid Minar by using force.         
	Asked about the CPMs allegation that the police had misled its leaders, Jawed Shamim, joint commissioner of police, headquarters, said: The RSS was given permission to hold its rally at the Shahid Minar ground on January 23. Another officer said the CPM was lying. Nobody told them the RSS rally would be at Rani Rashmoni Avenue.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 29: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has said it is happy with the outcome of the official-level tripartite meeting held in Delhi today to sort out areas of agreement and disagreement before the next round of political talks slated for mid-May.        
	Many of our demands have been agreed upon and this is something positive. The officials have said many issues raised by us could be accepted, said Morcha central committee member Amar Lama.        
	Todays talks were held so that only those points on which there has been no agreement were discussed at the May meeting. Sources said the area that is to come under the proposed Darjeeling hills interim authority continued to be a point of major disagreement. The Morcha insisted on the inclusion of the Dooars and the Terai, but the state and the Centre refused to concede.        
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillai and his Bengal counterpart Ardhendu Sen were among those present at the talks.

	Kakdwip, Oct. 31: Tales of tenacious survival and political manoeuvring lapped the shores near Nandigram today, not too far from the site of a trawler tragedy in which the toll has risen to 25.        
	Seven more bodies were fished out of the Hooghly today. No definite figure is available yet on the number of the missing as officials feel some people could have swam to safety when the trawler capsized near Sagar Island.        
	The passengers, many of them from the minority community, were returning from a fair at Hijli Sarif in East Midnapores Khejuri.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee reached Kakdwip, where the injured are being treated, this evening to supervise relief operations.        
	Aware of the sensitivities involved in the run-up to the Assembly polls and a feeling of alienation in the minority-dominated region, the Left government is trying to leave no room for charges of neglect.        
	It was decided at the CPM state committee meeting that the chief minister should go to Kakdwip and stand by the poor and minority community villagers who were affected by the accident, a source said.        
	After reaching Kakdwip around 6pm, Bhattacharjee visited five villagers admitted at the district hospital and held meetings with the district administration. It was decided that compensation would be given to the relatives of those who died.        
	Mamata Banerjee, too, reached Kakdwip around 11pm.        
	Trinamul leaders alleged the chief ministers visit was aimed at regaining ground the Left had lost to the party in South 24-Parganas.        
	As the bodies were being taken out, news came of a woman and a youth who managed to save themselves by drifting on wooden planks that apparently came loose from the trawler.        
	The plank carrying the middle-aged woman floated towards Ghoramara island, near the spot where the vessel capsized, and she was rescued by residents.        
	The youth, Tajuddin Mollah, drifted towards East Midnapores Nandigram, 5km from the tragedy site, and got stuck in a char (river island), across the river from Kakdwip in South 24-Parganas.        
	Tajuddin, 18, was saved by Nandigram residents who gave him food. Some of the residents then escorted him on a launch to Kakdwip where he was admitted to hospital. Fifty-two people have been rescued so far.         
	Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly said the trawler was carrying 248 people. Ganguly said the trawler could accommodate so many people as several of them were children.         
	 Many children were aged between two and 12. Of the 25 dead, 13 are women and the rest little boys and girls aged between three and 12, Ganguly said.        
	Nilanjan Shandilya, the additional district magistrate (revenue), said: Seven more bodies were recovered today, taking the toll to 25.         
	However, neither of the two could specify the exact number of those still missing. We are not sure how many people have swam to safety. We have asked police and district officials to visit the villages from where the people went to Hijli Sarif yesterday, Ganguly said.

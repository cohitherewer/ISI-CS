	Burdwan, Dec. 1: Two Trinamul Congress supporters were killed today after clashes with the CPM and subsequent police firing in a Burdwan pocket where the Left is losing grip, though it wasnt clear if the skirmishes or the cops action caused the deaths.        
	Both parties claimed that the deaths in Raina were from the firing but additional director-general of police (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha said: Whether the deaths have been caused by police firing is under investigation.         
	At least 10 rounds were fired after the cops came under attack from alleged Trinamul supporters who accused the men in uniform of siding with CPM cadres.         
	Opposition leader and Trinamul general secretary Partha Chatterjee today demanded the arrest of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who oversees the police, holding him responsible for the deaths. State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya echoed the demand for the chief ministers resignation.        
	Chatterjee said the CPM cadres had taken police help. At least 40 homes of Trinamul supporters were ransacked. Then, there was random firing by both the CPM cadres and the police. Seven of our supporters received bullet injuries, two of whom died on the spot. Three of the injured were brought to Calcutta in a serious condition, he said, and announced a dhikkar dibas (condemnation day) throughout the state tomorrow. Protest rallies will be brought out between 3pm and 4pm.         
	Late this evening, Trinamul leaders and Union ministers Mukul Roy and Sisir Adhikari visited the injured Trinamul supporters at Burdwan hospital. Roy said Mamata Banerjee was likely to visit Raina on Saturday.        
	The CPMs zonal committee secretary in Raina, Shyamaprasad Pal, also blamed the police. The Trinamul supporters were killed in the firing. But Trinamul supporters attacked the police in an organised manner. The party has unleashed a reign of terror in the area.         
	Pal claimed, however, that many Left supporters who joined Trinamul since last years Lok Sabha polls  sparking a turf battle between the rivals  had returned to the CPM.        
	Burdwan, traditionally a CPM bastion, is the home district of Bengal industry minister and politburo member Nirupam Sen. After the rural polls of 2008, Trinamul started making inroads into the district, winning a few panchayats. In the Raina area, though, the CPM won the panchayats, but with diminished votes.        
	The trouble started this morning when CPM activists allegedly dragged two Trinamul supporters out of a bus at Rainas Belsar village and beat them up. The Trinamul duo returned to their village, Jyotsadi, and told their party leaders about the attack. Soon, around 500 Trinamul supporters attacked the houses of CPM supporters in Jyotsadi with bombs and firearms, inviting a similar retaliation from villagers who back the CPM.        
	Around 11.30am, a team of 22 policemen, who had gone to the adjacent Bontir village to inquire into an allegation of ransacking of a CPM supporters house by alleged Trinamul activists last night, was passing by Jyotsadi.        
	At that point, alleged Trinamul supporters began to hurl bombs and fire at the cops accusing them of helping the CPM activists. The mob of Trinamul supporters attacking the police soon swelled to over a thousand.         
	The policemen were outnumbered and tried to escape. The police fired about five rounds of teargas shells and 10 rounds (of bullets) in a bid to disperse the mob. Ten policemen were injured. One of them was hit by bomb splinters in his head and admitted to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, said Burdwan police chief R. Rajsekharan.        
	Trinamul supporters Kajal Mollah, 28, and Hasmat Ali Mullick, 38, were hit by bullets in their back and chest. Their bodies lay on the road for hours.        
	Jahangir Mullick, 38, and Sheikh Bablu, 31, also Trinamul supporters, were hit by bullets in the chest and legs. Both were first taken to the Burdwan Medical College and then to the SSKM Hospital in Calcutta this evening.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Diesel train target

	May 19: Maoists this morning triggered a blast on railway tracks a few metres from a goods train carrying diesel near Jhargram.         
	The blast, around 2am, heavily damaged both the Up and Down lines but the train, travelling at about 60kmph, could not stop immediately and hurtled down the tracks.         
	Shards from the smashed windscreen left driver Salim Chandra Soren, 42, and his assistant Mrinmoykanti Dawn Poddar, 35, bleeding. They were travelling from Tatanagar to Khurda Road. Soren said it was dark and the blast had been muffled by the clanging sound of the train. I realised something has happened when the glass in front broke and I was hit on my forehead. I ducked. Dawn Poddar was hit on his chin and had to be given five stitches.         
	Soren called the authorities in Jhargram and Kharagpur and a special train with railway officials reached them, 27km from Jhargram station, around 4.30am.         
	Several trains like the Puri-Delhi Purushottam Express and Howrah-Ahmedabad Express had to be diverted. Three Howrah-bound trains  Hatia Express, Mumbai Mail and Koraput Express  which were detained at Tatanagar and Jhargram, reached Howrah seven to eight hours late. The Up and Down Steel Express were cancelled.

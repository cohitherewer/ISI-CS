The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dole decision before order
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Dole decision before order
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 28: The state government today said it had taken the decision to pay compensation to those injured in the Nandigram police firing a month before the Supreme Court verdict yesterday.        
	We had in principle decided to pay the compensation a month ago, state chief secretary Samar Ghosh said. We will go by what the Supreme Court has directed and pay the compensation as soon as the state finance department sanctions the amount. There are 159 people to whom we have to pay compensation.        
	According to a list submitted by human rights organisations, other than the 14 people killed in the firing, 162 had been injured or harmed. These include three women who had been allegedly raped on March 14, 2007.        
	Ghosh said the three women, who produced documentary proof from a hospital stating they had been raped, had already been paid compensation of Rs 2 lakh each last month.        
	The state government had earlier argued that not all those who were injured had taken police bullets. Many of them got accidentally hurt while the protesters tried to attack the police, it had said.        
	Sources in the state government said that during the hearing, it had become clear that the Supreme Court would not make a distinction between those injured. So the government had made the decision of paying the compensation even before the verdict.

	Nov. 4: The Purulia unit of the CPI (Maoist) today issued a statement denying any role in the abduction of police inspector Partha Biswas and his schoolteacher friend Saumajit Basu.         
	Purulia unit leader Bikram said in the statement: We have learnt from the media about the abduction of the duo. I would like to make it clear that we have no hand in this. We are conducting an investigation into (who is behind the kidnapping).         
	Bikram condemned the manner in which police spy on people in the guise of NGO workers. Basu used to work for an NGO, though it is unclear whether the statement referred to him.        
	Bikram, however, did not explain why the Maoists took 13 days to issue a statement. Biswas and Basu have been missing since October 22, with the administration and the media accusing the Maoists of kidnapping them.         
	Maoist sources said the reason for the delay could be that the Purulia unit had abducted the duo without informing the top leadership. They said the central leadership had probably been informed one or two days after the abduction. The sources said the central leadership had probably not approved of the kidnapping.         
	With pressure mounting on it, the Purulia unit may have decided to issue the statement, a source said.         
	However, the sources could not shed any light on the whereabouts of Biswas and Basu.        
	They said that when Atindranath Dutta, the then officer in charge of Sankrail police station, had been kidnapped in October last year, the Maoists had promptly claimed responsibility.        
	It appears that the kidnapping of Partha and Saumajit was done by the lower-rung cadres of the Maoists without the consent of the outfits top leadership, the source said.         
	A few days ago, CPI (Maoist) politburo member Kishan had claimed he was not aware of the outfits role in the abduction. He had said he would check with the Purulia unit.        
	Today, Basus wife Swachchhatoa and brother Abhijit met state home secretary G.D. Gautama at Writers Buildings. Later in the day, Biswass wife Barnali and mother Mamata met Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee at her Kalighat home and urged her to ensure that the duo are rescued.

	Kanchrapara, March 21: New Metro Railway coaches will roll out of a railway factory near Calcutta.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee today announced that Metro bogies would be built along with other coaches at the upcoming rail coach factory in Kanchrapara  only 39km from the Metro terminal at Dum Dum.        
	Along with electric multiple unit (EMU) and mainline electric multiple unit (MEMU) trains, coaches of the Metro Railway will also be built here, said Mamata while laying the foundation stone of the factory in this North 24-Parganas town.        
	Now, Metro coaches  including the much-awaited air-conditioned ones  are being built at the Integral Coach Factory in Tamil Nadus Perambur. Metro now has 18 rakes, most of them past their operational lives. This often leads to technical snags and disruption of services.        
	According to officials, manufacturing Metro coaches at Kanchrapara will be hugely beneficial. The factory being so close by, communication with the manufacturing unit will be much easier. Discussions can be held on a day-to-day basis and we can suggest any changes in line with passenger demands, a Metro official said. The time taken now to transport the coaches from Perambur will also be cut manifold, he added.

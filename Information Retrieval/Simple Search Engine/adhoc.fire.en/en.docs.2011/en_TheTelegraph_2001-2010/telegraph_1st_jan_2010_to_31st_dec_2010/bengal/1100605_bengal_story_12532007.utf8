The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | MPs pin hopes on paramilitary
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      MPs pin hopes on paramilitary
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 4: Two Left MPs from West Midnapore today asked the Centre to strengthen the paramilitary forces and central intelligence for better Maoist combat but opposed the use of the army.         
	Jhargram MP Pulin Behari Baske apparently told home minister P. Chidambaram at a meeting of MPs from the countrys Maoist-hit districts: If you put everything on the state police, what will the central forces do?        
	Baske told The Telegraph later he was not in favour of the army or the air force being pressed into service as the move would suggest the paramilitary forces were inefficient. The CPM MP wanted more paramilitary in Bengal and with increased powers.         
	Prabodh Panda of the CPI, the MP from Midnapore, held similar views and so did several MPs from neighbouring states.         
	Of the 48 battalions of the CRPF deployed in Maoist-hit areas, five are in Bengal. We need to have a stronger network of central agencies, Baske said after the meeting.         
	Sources said it appeared from the meeting that only Chhattisgarh wanted the use of the army.

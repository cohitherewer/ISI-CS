          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 30: Three state Congress leaders today offered to quit to protest Manas Bhuniyas plan to take in a Left-backed RJD MLA, weeks after Abdul Mannan resigned as general secretary resenting the entry of unwanted elements.        
	Burra Bazar district president Santosh Pathak and two other leaders from Burra Bazar met state Congress chief Bhuniya four days ago to register their protest against his plan to induct Mohammed Sohrab, the lone RJD legislator in the Assembly, into the party fold.         
	After I came to know that Sohrab is joining the Congress on January 7, I told Bhuniya that I would leave the party if he is taken in. A host of other party leaders also feel the same way, Pathak said.         
	Pathak, who was removed as Burra Bazar Congress president by Bhuniya but later reinstated following the high commands intervention, said the areas youth Congress president, Mahesh Sharma, and the local Mahila Congress chief, Usha Singh, would also resign.         
	Pathak said he would raise the issue at Sundays meeting of the state Congresss extended executive committee. The meeting will be chaired by Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	I will request Pranabda to prevent Manas from inducting Sohrab, who had won the 2006 Assembly elections with Left backing. Sohrab has enjoyed the backing of the Left for five years. Now he has suddenly realised the Congresss importance before the Assembly elections, the Burra Bazar leader said. He wants to fulfil his personal ambition, Pathak said, without elaborating.        
	He said Sohrab was desperate to join the Congress so he could contest the elections next year because the RJD MLAs constituency, Burra Bazar, has seized to exist because of delimitation.         
	Sohrab, however, denied the claim. The Congress is an all-India party. Bhuniya has rejuvenated the organisation since taking charge as state Congress chief, he said.         
	Sohrab claimed that he had dissociated himself from Lalu Prasads party two years ago but continued being an RJD legislator. I met Laluji two years ago and expressed my desire to quit. I have made up my mind to join the Congress, he added.         
	Sohrab said Bhuniya had assured me a berth in the Congress. Pranabda has also promised to take me in, he added. Mannan, however, rubbished Sohrabs claim. I was present when Sohrab met Pranabda in Calcutta. Pranabda had, in fact, discouraged Manas from taking Sohrab into the party. He had said such a move could antagonise Laluji, whose party backs the UPA at the Centre, Pathak said.         
	Bhuniya, however, said no final decision has yet been taken concerning Sohrabs induction, adding his objective was to expand the organisation.

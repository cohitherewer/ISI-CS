The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Leader rant on CPM 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Leader rant on CPM 
                            
	Calcutta, April 19: Bidhan Nagar municipality chairman Biswajiban Majumdar today said he would not contest the civic polls in May because the CPM had insulted him.        
	I felt insulted and humiliated by the partys behaviour. I think I have worked very diligently for the past five years but I will not contest in this election, Majumdar told a programme in Salt Lake.        
	Party sources said he was angry after he was not allowed to contest from the ward of his choice.               
	A Calcutta University teacher has been fielded there.        
	Majumdar had yesterday accused the party of finalising its candidates without consulting him.         
	They are now offering me another ward. Why should I accept that? Am I a puppet that dances to the party bosses tune? he asked.

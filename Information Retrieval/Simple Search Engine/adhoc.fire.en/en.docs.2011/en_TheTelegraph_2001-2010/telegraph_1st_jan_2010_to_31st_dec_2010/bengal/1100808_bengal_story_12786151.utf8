          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 7: A passenger of a Sealdah-bound Duronto Express was beaten up by train staff after he protested the unhygienic manner of serving food and called up Mamata Banerjees residence to complain.         
	Businessman Prabir Chandra Bose, 32, who was returning from Delhi on an AC three-tier coach, said the train staff kept the packets containing daal on the vestibule when they came to serve dinner at 10pm yesterday. Dirty water was seeping into the daal. When the staff started distributing the food, I protested. They threatened to beat me up, Bose said. I called up Mamatas residence and spoke to (Trinamul Congress leader) Nirmal Majhi.         
	The train made an unscheduled halt at Tundla junction and the food was checked. But when the train was waiting at Tundla, around 30 catering staff and other employees members of the train attacked Bose. They pulled me out of the train and beat me up. They also beat up my friend Pinaki Dutta, who was travelling with me, Bose said.         
	The Government Railway Police personnel at Tundla rescued me, Bose added. He filed a complaint with the railways after the train reached Sealdah at 3pm today.

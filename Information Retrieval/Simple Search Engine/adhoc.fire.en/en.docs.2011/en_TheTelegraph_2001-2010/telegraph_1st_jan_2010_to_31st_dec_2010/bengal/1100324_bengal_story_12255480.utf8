The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM talks appeal to Trinamul
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM talks appeal to Trinamul
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, March 23: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today appealed to the Trinamul Congress to join all-party meetings to resolve the states law-and-order issues but stopped short of making the same plea to its partner Congress in his continued effort to make a distinction between the two Opposition entities.        
	Speaking on an adjournment motion moved jointly by Trinamul and the Congress to discuss the states law and order, the chief minister said: It is good to discuss a motion concerning the states law and order, particularly the seizure of illegal arms. But there should be a genuine political will from all parties to tackle the problem because the Trinamul Congress always stays away from all-party meetings being convened by DMs (district magistrates) and SDOs (subdivisional officers). I am not mentioning the Congress because they attend such meetings.        
	I am appealing to Trinamul through the Speaker to sit with us at both the state and district levels to iron out the problems concerning the states law and order, he added.        
	However, Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee ruled out the possibility. In public rallies, he (the chief minister) has asked his party workers not to sit idle but instead hit us back. CPM activists are killing our men everywhere, he alleged.         
	Demanding that a central agency be engaged to recover illegal arms in the state, he called upon the chief minister to respond. When Bhattacharjee refused, Opposition MLAs walked out.         
	However, the Congress legislators rejoined proceedings after a recess and participated in the budget discussion. Its House leader, Manas Bhuniya, said the discussion was too important to be missed.        
	Asked if the Congress move indicated absence of floor co-ordination between the allies, Chatterjee said: The Congress rejoined the House only to air its criticism of the state budget. It doesnt mean our alliance is breaking up.

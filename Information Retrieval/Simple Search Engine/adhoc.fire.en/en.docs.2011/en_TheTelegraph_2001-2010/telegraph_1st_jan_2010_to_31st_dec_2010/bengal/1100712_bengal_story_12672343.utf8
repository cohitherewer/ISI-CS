          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, July 11: The Durgapur school that had detained a four-year-old student for an hour because his father was late in picking him up after classes today said it was planning to relax the pick-up time.         
	The reference is to a five-minute window guardians are allowed to pick up their wards, after which the students go into an hours detention.         
	Tanmoy Das, a nursery student at Aurobindo Vidyamandir, bit and injured his tongue out of nervousness after being detained in an empty classroom on Friday.         
	The schools managing committee has decided to meet soon to find a solution so that such incidents do not happen in the future. We are planning to relax the pick-up time by at least 10 minutes, said Suhas Chakraborty, the secretary of the schools managing committee.        
	Tanmoys father Goutam Das was late by 15 minutes yesterday. Goutam said he would withdraw his son from the school. I will not send my son to this school any more. I have decided that Tanmoy will study at home this year to help him recover from the bitter experience. I will get him admitted to a kindergarten class at some other school next year.         
	Das, who owns a small almirah-making unit, is also the state general secretary of Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party.        
	Rezaul Kabir, the officer in charge of Durgapur police station where Das has lodged a complaint against the schools principal, said: We didnt interrogate the principal as the school had been closed for the weekend. We may question her tomorrow.

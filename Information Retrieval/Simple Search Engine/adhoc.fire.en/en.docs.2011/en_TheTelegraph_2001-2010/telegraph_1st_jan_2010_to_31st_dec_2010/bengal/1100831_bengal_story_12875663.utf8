The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Strike relief for Ramazan
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Strike relief for Ramazan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 30: The state Citu leadership today said that in view of Ramazan, shops and markets in Muslim-dominated areas across Bengal would be kept outside the ambit of the September 7 general strike called by the Left trade unions.        
	The move is being seen as a bid to keep the minorities in good humour ahead of the Assembly polls next year. The results of successive elections in the recent past suggest that the Muslims have drifted away from the Left.         
	Citu general secretary Kali Ghosh said: The date of our strike coincides with the 27th day of the month of Ramazan. On this day, Muslims go out to shop and purchase new clothes for Id. Considering this, we have decided to exempt shops and markets in Muslim areas in the state from the general strike.        
	Ghosh added: We have begun sending instructions to our local units so that the exemption is granted.        
	The strike has been called to protest, among other things, the Centres policies of divestment and privatisation, the price rise and the lack of job security for contract labourers.        
	Ghosh, however, made it clear that offices and the transport sector would not be exempted from the September 7 strike.        
	Asked about the problems the Muslims would face because of the unavailability of transport, the Citu leader said: The date of a strike is decided after taking the opinion of all the state units. Coincidentally, the date this time has fallen in the month of Ramazan. We have tried our best to ensure that Muslims can shop conveniently. Unfortunately, transport cannot be run on the day of the strike.        
	Citu has not exempted the IT sector from the strike, either. Its a profit-making sector where workers are exploited like in other places. So, IT is very much within the strikes purview, Ghosh said.        
	Ramen Pandey, the general secretary of the Congress-backed Intuc, which will take part in the strike, said: We are not in favour of a general strike as the month of Ramazan is on and Id is also due this month. We dont want to inconvenience the Muslim community. Thats why, we will be observing only an industrial strike on September 7.         
	The Trinamul Congress-backed INTTUC is not participating in the strike.

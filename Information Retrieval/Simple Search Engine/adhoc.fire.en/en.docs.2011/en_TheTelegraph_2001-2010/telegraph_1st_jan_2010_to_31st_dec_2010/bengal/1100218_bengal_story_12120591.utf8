The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong points finger at Left 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong points finger at Left 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: The Congress today poured scorn on the communists, saying their ideology inspires the Maoists and those who provide legitimacy to the cult of violence by romanticising Naxalite objectives.        
	Speaking about Mondays Maoist strike, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari accused the Left of transplanting a foreign ideology predicated essentially on violence into the country.         
	Such violence, he argued, has become the inspiration for Maoists to wage an armed struggle against the state. The communists cannot run away from their responsibility.         
	Tiwaris assertion raised many eyebrows given that the Congress has always considered the Left ideologically closer and a section of the party takes pride in being Left of centre. Asked to reconcile todays stand with the Congress-Left alliances of the past, Tiwari conceded the tie-ups were a fact but appeared to play down the proximity factor. We cannot run away from historical facts. We did have alliances with the Left owing to political circumstances. But it is also true that the communists propagated the politics of violence.        
	Tiwari blamed the Left for the Maoists violence. Bengal is reaping what the Left has sown in the past three decades. They have institutionalised the culture of violence in Bengal. The communist movement in the last 30 years created a Frankenstein. If anybody is responsible for the Maoist violence in Bengal, it is the Left.         
	Asked about Congress ally Mamata Banerjees alleged softness towards Maoists and her demand for a central probe into the attack at the Shilda camp, Tiwari said: There is no ambiguity about the identity of the attackers but only Mamata can clarify what she intended to say.         
	Todays bitterness was unusual. Such criticism of the Left wasnt seen even after the withdrawal of support to the previous Congress-led UPA government in 2008 over the US nuclear deal.         
	The strident tone is being seen as the Congress leaderships attempt to send out a clear signal before next years Bengal polls. Tiwari hinted as much, saying CPM general secretary Prakash Karats offer of an alliance if the Congress dumped Mamata betrayed the Lefts sense of insecurity at a time Bengal was on the verge of change.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 4: The government asked district officials to discourage use of country boats a day after a fishermans dinghy sank in the Rupnarayan with picnickers from Calcutta.         
	Seventeen people are missing more than 24 hours after rescue operations started in East Midnapores Kolaghat.        
	I have alerted all districts so they discourage the use of country boats. However, these boats cant be stopped altogether because they ferry for villagers essentials like milk, vegetables, fish and fruits, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said.         
	The boat sank yesterday because it was overloaded, he added. Around 30 people were on the boat that can carry 15-20 at the most.        
	The trouble reached Calcutta from Kolaghat today when relatives and neighbours of the missing blocked Ultadanga Main Road and APC Road for nearly two hours from 3.30pm to protest the governments delay in launching the rescue. Over 24 hours have passed but not one body has been found. The rescue efforts began only at night, several hours after the boat capsized. This government doesnt care for common people, said Samir Sonkar, a member of the club that had organised the picnic.        
	In Kolaghat, friends and families blocked trains and gheraoed district magistrate C.D. Lama. Nearly 1,000 people from Ultadanga have been camping there since last night.        
	Four state ministers  disaster management, relief, labour and technical education  went to the spot. The meeting they had with the district magistrate and police chief decided to use fishing nets in the search operation.        
	A coast guard hovercraft and BSF and Calcutta Port Trust speed boats will scan 35km of the river, said disaster management minister Srikumar Mukherjee.

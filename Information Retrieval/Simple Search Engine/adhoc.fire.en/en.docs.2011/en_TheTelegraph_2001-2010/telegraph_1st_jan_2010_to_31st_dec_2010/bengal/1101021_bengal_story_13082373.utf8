	Kharagpur, Oct. 20: A compartment of the Howrah-bound Falaknuma Express jumped the tracks this evening near Kharagpur station but no one was hurt in the mishap that occurred hours after a Calcutta Metro derailment.        
	The coach that derailed was a sleeper class bogie, S-14. The train, coming from Secunderabad (Hyderabad), is popular with the scores of engineering students from Bengal studying in Andhra Pradesh as well as techies.        
	Eyewitnesses said four attendants of the pantry car, just behind S-14, jumped out when they saw the train derail just as it was pulling into Kharagpur. It was around 4.40pm when we heard a loud grinding noise and felt a jerk. Thinking it was an accident, we jumped on to the tracks, said attendant Mohammad Kalim.        
	Mohammad Abid Hossain, a resident of Maldas Harishchandrapur and an imam in Secunderabad, was sleeping on an upper berth in the coach. There was a jolt and I fell on the floor. I became scared and rushed out of the coach. When I realised it was nothing serious, I walked to Kharagpur station, said Hossain.        
	The derailed compartment was detached and brought to Kharagpur, and its passengers were accommodated in other compartments before the train resumed its journey to Howrah around 7pm. Half the train was empty. So, we did not make any arrangements for an additional coach. We accommodated all passengers in the train and it left for Howrah, said A.K. Handa, the divisional railway manager of Kharagpur.        
	As a result of the derailment, a number of trains, including Mumbai-Howrah Duranto Express, were detained at various stations before Kharagpur for over two hours.

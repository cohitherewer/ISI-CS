                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rally with split blame on Mamata 
  Kick-off today for Congress          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A Trinamul procession with marchers carrying sticks in Toofanganj town on Monday morning. Pictures by Main Uddin Chisti                                        
	Calcutta, May 10: The Congress will come out with its own explanation of the circumstances that led to the collapse of the alliance with the Trinamul Congress when Pranab Mukherjee kicks off the partys civic poll campaign tomorrow.         
	Mukherjee, the state Congress president, will hold a string of meetings with party leaders through the day before he addresses the rally at Lebutala Park, Sealdah.        
	Street-corner meetings were held across the city today to canvass for the rally.                   Masked men with bows and arrows tail the procession      
	We will have to put forth our version of the cause of the collapse to counter Mamata Banerjees sustained campaign against us. People should know we were not at fault, said K. Keshava Rao, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal.         
	Rao said the alliance could have been easily worked out had Mamataji offered 10 seats in addition to the 25 she was willing to give. I had a string of meetings with Mamataji to request her for just 10 more seats. I did not ask her to concede to the state Congresss demand for 51 seats. But she was rigid all through. We were left with no option but to field our candidates knowing that it would have no bearing on next years Assembly polls, he added.        
	State Congress leaders here said Mukherjee had sought newspaper clippings on Mamatas media briefings in which she blamed Pranabda, without naming him, for scuttling the alliance.                  The tail of the procession breaks up   and attacks a CPM office      
	We did not break the alliance. It was other way round. Pranabda would drive home the point tomorrow that the Congress had tried to stitch up a deal till the last moment, said state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.         
	The Congresss civic poll manifesto will mention how Mamata dumped the Congress and decided to jeopardise the electoral prospects of the alliance.         
	The draft manifesto is ready. We have taken a whole page in the six-page document to dwell on how Mamata broke up the alliance by trying to di-ctate terms on the seat-sharing, said Nityananda De, the chairman of the Congresss campaign committee.         
	The manifesto will also justify the partys demand for 51 seats.                   A cycle is pulled out of the locked   office and destroyed       
	On his return to Calcutta from New Delhi this evening, Mukherjee was asked about state party working president Subrata Mukherjees switch to Trinamul.         
	He said: If somebody leaves the party, it definitely affects the organisation. But what can we do about it?         
	The state Congress chief will meet the partys four Calcutta district presidents  Pradip Ghosh, Nirbed Roy, Pranab Basu and Santosh Pathak  tomorrow morning and visit Panihati in North 24-Parganas to address party workers.                  A makeshift CPM office that was ransacked on Sunday night      
	Mamata today again accused the Congress of acting as the CPMs agent to frustrate the alliance at a meeting with her 140 Calcutta Municipal Corporation candidates. She has left one ward, 93, for ally SUCI.        
	In Ward 45 of Calcutta, which covers a part of Burrabazar, Trinamul workers led by its youth wing general secretary, Rajib Roy, organised a procession on Sunday night in support of Congress candidate Pathak. We have decided to back Santoshda to protest Mamatadis decision to field Nirmala Pande, who is an outsider, from this ward, said Roy.

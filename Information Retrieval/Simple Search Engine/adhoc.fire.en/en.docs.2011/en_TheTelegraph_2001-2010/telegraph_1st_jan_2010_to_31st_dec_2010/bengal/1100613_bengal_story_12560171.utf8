	Calcutta, June 12: The Left state may be withering away but at least one satellite has attained the height of glory only Soviet elections were once credited with: bag more votes than voters.        
	The number of stamped ballot papers for the Kalyani University court elections has been found higher than that of those who voted.        
	Although 1,820 students voted in the June 8 elections, 119 excess ballots were found while counting. The process has been suspended.         
	Governor M.K. Narayanan, the chancellor of the university who must have come across similar skulduggery when he headed the Intelligence Bureau, has now ordered a probe by a retired judge.        
	Narayanan must also have been reminded of the Cold War-era joke  propagated by jealous capitalists, no doubt  of how the Soviet communist party used to bag 120 per cent of the votes cast.        
	In Kalyani University, the polls were being held to elect two registered graduate representatives  students who have passed out of the university.         
	The university authorities had sent the ballot papers to the 1,820 voters by registered post, according to the rules of the institute. However, when the ballot boxes were opened yesterday, 1,939 papers were found.         
	We have no clue how the extra ballot papers landed up in the boxes. We had issued only 1,820 ballot papers. Counting has been stopped. The incident is unfortunate. This is the first time in the history of the university that such a thing has happened, said Alok Banerjee, the vice-chancellor. We are determined to identify the culprits and take action against them, Banerjee said.        
	The Left-controlled university court has 71 members, representing lecturers, readers, professors, students, non-teaching staff, officers, supervisors, heads and teachers of affiliated colleges, research scholars and registered graduates. The phased election process had started in April.        
	The anti-CPM teachers and students in the university today threatened to launch a protest if the authorities failed to catch those responsible for the irregularity.         
	They claimed that the authorities had deliberately sent the excess ballot papers to help pro-CPM candidates win the election. The ballot papers were issued by the registrar. He should be asked to explain, a voter said.        
	The varsitys court and executive council had no anti-Left member for the past 17 years. This time, four Trinamul Congress-backed professors were elected to the bodies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Threat of 40-day hill strike
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Threat of 40-day hill strike
          VIVEK CHHETRI                           Bimal Gurung at Chungtung. (Suman Tamang)                                  
	Darjeeling, July 4: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today threatened a 40-day strike in the hills from July-end and reimposed its ban on licensed liquor in a bid to step up its statehood agitation.        
	Morcha chief Bimal Gurung said the Centre, influenced by the Bengal government, was delaying the next round of tripartite talks on the demand for a separate Gorkhaland state.        
	Announcing its strike schedule today, the hill outfit said it would call a 24-hour shutdown on July 25, followed by a 72-hour strike from July 28. After the July 28 strike, there will be a 72-hour relaxation and then a 40-day general strike, Gurung said.        
	We demand that the dates (for the talks) be immediately announced, failing which we will call general strikes in the hills, the Morcha chief told party workers at Chungtung, 35km from Darjeeling.         
	The last round of political- level tripartite talks on Gorkhaland, now re-christened Gorkha Adivasi Pradesh, was held on March 18 in New Delhi.         
	In 1988, GNLF chief Subhas Ghisingh had called a 40-day strike in the hills.         
	Morcha strikes in the past have stretched to a maximum of five days. This time also, there is the possibility of the hill outfit curtailing the 40-day strike if the statehood talks are held.        
	Gurung said all government offices, except those of the district magistrate and the superintendent of police, would remain closed during a non-cooperation movement that we will start from Tuesday.         
	Banks and post offices will however, remain open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The offices of the food and supplies department will be allowed to function on Mondays and Tuesdays, Gurung added. The relaxation will also apply to relief department offices and election offices, Gurung said.        
	On the ban on licensed liquor shops, Gurung said the outfit would close down all liquor off-shops from Tuesday so that no revenue goes to the Bengal government. Last year too, the Morcha had closed down such offshops for two months.

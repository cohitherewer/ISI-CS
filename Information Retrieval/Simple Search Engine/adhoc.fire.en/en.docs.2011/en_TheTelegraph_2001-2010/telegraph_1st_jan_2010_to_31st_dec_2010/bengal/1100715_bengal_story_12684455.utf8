          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, July 14: A harmless everyday lie, told possibly to save a playmate from being spanked, has cost a 12-year-old his life.         
	Rajat Nandan died of internal haemorrhage yesterday after being slapped by neighbour Sadhan Pramanik, 27, for lying about the whereabouts of Sadhans brothers.        
	Sadhan, a resident of Murshidabads Gangadhari village, had gone to Rajats house in search of his brother Rintu, 12, after he slipped out of the house without informing anybody on Saturday morning. Sadhan, a barber, suspected that Rintu had gone to Rajats house because his brother used to go there regularly to play.         
	Sadhan asked Rajat, who was standing in the courtyard, if his brother was in their house. Rajat replied in the negative. But soon after, Rintu suddenly came out of the house, a police officer said.         
	The officer said Sadhan had slapped Rajat and accused him of lying. Rajat began to tremble and slumped to the ground, unconscious.         
	Rajats father Rajkumar, a farm labourer, took him to Behrampore General Hospital. Rajat died yesterday after remaining in coma for three days.        
	Rajat suffered an internal haemorrhage in his right ear. As we dont have scanning facilities, we asked the boys parents to shift him to Calcutta. But they refused, saying Calcutta was an unknown place for them, said B.C. Kumar, an ENT surgeon at the hospital.        
	Rajkumar said he had lodged a police complaint against Sadhan, who escaped this morning after coming to know about Rajats death         
	Lakshman Dey, a grocer at Gangadhari village, said he did not think Sadhan had intended to kill Rajat. We believe that Sadhan slapped him in a fit of rage. Yesterday, our village elders held a meeting at which Sadhan was also present. He was asked to bear the medical expenses of Rajat, Dey said.        
	An ENT specialist in Calcutta said death because of internal haemorrhage in the ear was rare. Under the impact of a slap, the ear drum can get punctured and the vibration can lead to internal haemorrhage. But in such a case, a person usually turns deaf. Death is very rare. It could be that the boy suffered a head injury as well, said Arunava Sengupta, associate professor of ENT at SSKM Hospital.

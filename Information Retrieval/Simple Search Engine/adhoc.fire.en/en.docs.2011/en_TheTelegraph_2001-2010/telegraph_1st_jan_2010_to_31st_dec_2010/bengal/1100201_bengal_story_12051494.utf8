The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Karat echoes state leaders
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Karat echoes state leaders
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 31: Like his Bengal comrades, Prakash Karat today signalled the party would play up the contradictions between the Congress and Trinamul on Maoists and economics to drive a wedge into the Opposition alliance and effect an electoral turnaround for the Left.        
	At the last session of the CPM state committee meeting that prepared the partys road map for a course correction, Karat was quoted as saying: The parties which have forged alliance against us have contradictions and sometimes conflicts (among themselves) on a number of issues. We have to handle their contradictions cautiously but steadily.         
	Leaders from the partys district units pointed out that Karat did not speak much on the Congress, which they construed as the central leaders slow but steady warming up to the Congress after the Bengal brass clearly identified Trinamul as their main enemy.         
	Both Karat and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee indicated their agreement with the Ranganath Misra commissions recommendation to the Centre for reservation for Muslims in government jobs and education. But both reflected their dilemmas by insisting that the party and state government would take a decision after thoroughly examining the pros and cons.         
	It would be wrong to consider reservation for Muslims as a religious community. We have to think of supporting the backward castes within it. This is an all-India issue and we have to examine all the ramifications, Karat was quoted as saying.         
	Bhattacharjee referred to his governments special concern for Muslims and his intention to provide jobs to people from the community. But we have to provide succour to them within the ambit of the Constitution, he said, alluding to his earlier statement that constitutional experts would be consulted first.        
	While both the Sachar committee and the Misra commission had identified Muslims in India as backward based on economic, social and educational determinants, reservation based on religion would be a shift from the traditional Left Front position and could create differences within the alliance. A front meeting tomorrow could discuss the issue.         
	As the Maoist challenge overshadowed the deliberations, some leaders called for retaliatory violence. They also wanted to extend the marer bada-le mar (tit-for-tat) policy to Trinamul. However, the chief minister advocated restraint. No resistance will be successful if the people are not with us, he was quoted as saying.        
	State CPM chief Biman Bose later said: Our workers will exercise their right to self-defence and put up resistance by taking the people into confidence.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Dear dad (Honble MLA), dont back strike 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          People wait for vehicles outside Calcutta airport on Saturday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta, June 26: Reshmi has decided she will request her father, a Congress MLA, never to support a strike.         
	The Class VII student of the Delhi Public School (DPS) in Farakka, her mother Swati and brother Rahul were among the thousands of commuters who today bore the brunt of the Citu-sponsored 24-hour transport strike in Bengal.         
	The three had come to Calcutta to meet Mainul Haque, the Congress MLA from Farakka in Murshidabad.        
	Haque was not present when his family was struggling to find a vehicle outside Sealdah station to reach the MLA hostel off Kyd Street, where he has been staying since the beginning of the Assembly session.        
	The trios ordeal began after they alighted from the Gour Express at 6.30am. Rahul, a Class IX student at DPS, Farakka, was sent to call a cab. But the few taxi drivers who were present outside the station refused to oblige.        
	They refused to go. I saw a group of strike supporters forcing some people out of a taxi, Swati said.         
	A disgusted Reshmi said she would ask her father not to support strikes because they serve no purpose other than harassing commuters. Instead of calling strikes, politicians should sit across the table and address the problems of the common people.        
	Swati, Reshmi and Rahul had to wait for an hour before Haque arranged for a car.        
	Haque said tonight that he never supported bandhs or strikes because they cause hardship to people.         
	However, Haques party had called a 12-hour bandh to protest the alleged attack by CPM supporters on its MLAs at Mangalkot in Burdwan last year. Party activists burnt buses and all forms of transport were severely affected.         
	No taxi or auto-rickshaw agreed to move out of the Sealdah station premises today. The strike was enforced at the station under the vigilance of Citu leader Nihar Ghosh.         
	At Baguihati, Citu supporters stopped at least a dozen taxis and forced commuters out of the vehicles. They also threatened the taxi drivers. I had thought I would manage to reach office after I hopped on to a taxi that was going to Dalhousie Square, said a man in his mid-30s, who was stopped at Baguihati.         
	No policeman could be seen in the area.        
	Touts had a field day at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, where few taxies were present.         
	Those who could not arrange for private transport were left at the mercy of the touts. They are charging Rs 450 to take three of us to Sector V, said a senior official at an IT company who arrived from Bangalore this morning.         
	Airport sources said some flights were delayed because crew members and passengers could not arrive on time.         
	The pre-paid taxi booth outside Howrah station remained shut throughout the day. I understand that the price rise is going to hit the common man but what about those who were affected by todays strike? asked Pawan Kheria, 60, who had arrived from Patna and was waiting for a taxi outside Howrah station to go to Ballygunge.        
	The launch service, which on normal days ferries around 1 lakh people to and from Strand Road, also did not operate.         
	Dalhousie wore a deserted look. Sector V was not severely affected by the strike because most offices there are closed on Saturdays.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                             (From top) Pranab Mukherjee, Manmohan Singh                          
	Jangipur, Sept. 26: Pranab Mukherjee chose Manmohan Singhs birthday to launch a pension scheme for workers in the countrys unorganised sector.         
	Today is our Prime Ministers 78th birthday and that is why we have chosen this day to launch the scheme, the finance minister said today, announcing the Swavalamban scheme that aims to help all those not covered by any social security programme.         
	He (Singh) has strengthened the economy of our country sometimes as the finance minister, sometimes as the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and sometimes as the governor of Reserve Bank of India and now as the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has brought political stability in the country and has undertaken many development projects. We expect him to live for a hundred years, Mukherjee said.         
	In his quick brush-up of the Prime Ministers resume, Mukherjee graciously omitted one detail: that he himself presided over the economy as finance minister for some of the time that Singh was RBI governor.         
	Although the RBI governor is supposed to take decisions on his own and the minister is strictly speaking not his boss, in practice a consultative process is followed in which the minister has a decisive say. Singh headed the RBI between September 1982 and January 1985 while Mukherjee was finance minister from January 1982 to December 1984. If he remembered that today, he chose not to mention it, focusing only on the Prime Minister.         
	In Delhi, Singh had a quiet birthday, receiving phone calls from Sonia Gandhi and Rahul and flowers from the President.         
	Mukherjee, who announced the scheme in his Lok Sabha constituency Jangipur, said 87 per cent of the countrys work force would benefit from Swavalamban.         
	Under the scheme, each subscriber would have to pay Rs 1,000 a year. On turning 60, the subscribers would get 60 per cent of the accumulated amount while from the remaining 40 per cent with the Centre, they would be given a monthly pension of Rs 1,000 for the rest of their lives. It is open to workers between 18 and 55 years.

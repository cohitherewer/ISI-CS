The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM blames top cops
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM blames top cops
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 18: Bengal CPM leaders have criticised the police top brass for failing to pre-empt Mondays Maoist strike despite intelligence alerts.        
	At the weekly meeting of the state secretariat this evening, Dipak Sarkar, the partys West Midnapore secretary, and some others are said to have expressed strong displeasure in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the lack of coordination among senior cops.         
	Sources said Biman Bose, the partys state secretary, was upset with the contradictory statements of the Bengal home secretary and the police chief on the failure to prevent the attack.         
	Sarkar, inducted into the secretariat recently, fears the strike will hit the partys attempts to build armed resistance and stem the despondency among the rank and file. He had earned the secretariat slot in recognition of the initial success in countering the Maoists in parts of Junglemahal by mobilising armed cadres. Shilda, the scene of the strike in West Midnapore, was seen as a sound base for the success of the efforts.        
	Ministers took a cautious line, though. Industry minister Nirupam Sen declined comment and only reacted to Trinamuls demand that central forces in the area operate independently of the state police. As long as the Constitution guarantees the states role in maintenance of law and order, we will continue to do it, he said.        
	Veteran Benoy Konar left the fate of the joint operation to the chief minister and the Centre. We will continue to focus on mass resistance.         
	Although the party is keen to continue co-ordinating with Delhi, it feels the Congress-led Centre should snub ally Mamata Banerjee for her doublespeak on the Maoists even after the Shilda strike. If the Centre compromises with Mamata on Maoists, its fallout will be dangerous, secretariat member Mohammad Salim said.

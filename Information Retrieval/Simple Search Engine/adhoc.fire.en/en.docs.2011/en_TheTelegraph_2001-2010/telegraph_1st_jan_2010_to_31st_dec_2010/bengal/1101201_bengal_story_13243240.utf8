The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Acid attack on student
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Acid attack on student
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Barasat, Nov. 30: Two motorcycle-borne youths threw acid on the face of a college girl who was standing at a bus stop in North 24-Parganas this morning.         
	The girl, a third-year history honours student of Rabindra Bharati University, was left with burn injuries on the right side of her face. Doctors, however, said she was out of danger.         
	The victim, a Dunlop resident, was standing at the bus stop around 10.30am when the two assailants approached her on a bike, eyewitness Partha Roy said.         
	Roy said one of the youths had a bottle in his hand. He threw the acid on the girls face. The duo then whisked away, he said.         
	Roy said the victim slumped to the ground, clutching her face.         
	Police said the girl had told them she could not recognise the attackers. However, the police are not ruling out a triangular love affair as one of the possible reasons for the attack. The police said the victim worked for a company that imparts training to self-help groups that make soft toys, soaps, candles and incense sticks.        
	District police chief Rahul Srivastava said the girl would be interrogated once her condition improved. She had first been taken to Barasat district hospital from where her family members shifted her to a nursing home.         
	Bomb death and clash        
	A 42-year-old woman belonging to a family of Trinamul supporters was killed after CPM activists allegedly hurled bombs at her house in Burdwans Mangalkot last night. Purnima Majhis death sparked a clash between the activists of both parties. At least 15 people were injured and 10 houses were set ablaze.

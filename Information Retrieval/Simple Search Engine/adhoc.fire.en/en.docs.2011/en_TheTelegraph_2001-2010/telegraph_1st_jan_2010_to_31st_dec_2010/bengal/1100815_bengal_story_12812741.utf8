          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Howrah, Aug. 14: An 18-month-old boy who was pulled out of a drain an hour after he fell into it died allegedly after being turned away by three nursing homes in Howrah. His family ransacked and set fire to furniture at one of the nursing homes.         
	Jeet Adhikari was playing outside his Salkia shanty when he slipped into a drain around 10.45am today.         
	He was taken to Harekrishna Nursing Home. The authorities turned us away, saying they did not have a child specialist, Buddhadeb, Jeets father, said.         
	Two other nursing homes refused to admit Jeet, citing lack of infrastructure. Finally, the child was declared dead on arrival at a fourth nursing home.        
	Although Jeets family claims he was alive when he was pulled out of the drain, some neighbours said it was not possible as the child had been submerged for an hour.        
	Jeets family members and local residents ransacked Harekrishna Nursing Home, broke furniture and set fire to some benches. The mob also blocked GT Road for an hour.

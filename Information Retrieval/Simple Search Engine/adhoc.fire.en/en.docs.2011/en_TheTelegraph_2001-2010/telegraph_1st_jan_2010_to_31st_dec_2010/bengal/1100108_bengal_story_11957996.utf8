          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	West Midnapore, Jan. 7: Police today arrested three associates of Maoist leader Kishanji in Salboni.        
	Gopal Mahato of Lakshmanpur village and Haripada Mahato of Sundarpur, both in the Salboni police station area, and Joker Mahato of Shirshigram in Jhargram were picked up early this morning.        
	Manoj Verma, the superintendent of police of West Midnapore, said the three rebels were close to Kishanji, who generally stayed with Gopal when he was in Salboni and with Joker when he was supervising campaigns in Jhargram.        
	They had a number of cases against them, including murder and loot, said Verma.        
	All three will be put in police remand for five days.        
	Later in the day, trouble broke out in three places in Salboni, which the police suspect was a reaction to the arrests.        
	Maoists and joint forces clashed in Pidrakuli, Joypur and Buripala villages. We had information that they were going to try and take over the Pirakata camp of the joint forces so we started combing the area, said Verma.        
	There were no reports of injuries.

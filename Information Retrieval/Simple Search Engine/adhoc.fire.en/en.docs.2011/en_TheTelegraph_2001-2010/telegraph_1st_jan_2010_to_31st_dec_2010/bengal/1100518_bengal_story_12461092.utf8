The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress test case in north
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Congress test case in north
          BARUN GHOSH                          Mamata Banerjee at a civic poll rally in Calcutta on Monday where she dubbed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee a blot on Left politics and said her politics needed no certificate from him. The chief minister had on Sunday described Trinamul as a violent, lawless and coercive party. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Calcutta, May 17: The collapse of the alliance with Mamata Banerjee has presented a challenge before the Congress even in its citadels like Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Malda and Murshidabad.        
	In 2009, all the six Lok Sabha seats the Congress won were from the north Bengal districts.         
	This time, it had almost stitched up the alliance with the Trinamul Congress in seven municipalities across Malda, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri when the alliance fell through following Mamatas refusal to give more than 25 wards to her ally in the 141-ward Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Barring Murshidabad (where six municipalities are going to the polls), the alliance with Trinamul was almost final in north Bengal. But Mamatas unilateral move to snap the alliance in Calcutta prompted our leaders in north Bengal to field candidates against Trinamul nominees, said state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.        
	The Congress is now fighting its ally to retain its pockets of domination in the 13 civic boards across north Bengal.         
	The region is crucial for the Congress because that is where its strength lies. Bhattacharya said if the party could reaffirm its grip on north Bengal, we would be in a position to enter a hard bargain with Mamata over seat-sharing for the Assembly polls.        
	A good showing will also allow us to give a fitting reply to Mamatas humiliating offer in Calcutta, a Congress source added.        
	However, it is easier said than done with Trinamul gnawing at the Congresss citadel.         
	Going by the overwhelming response to our campaign for change, we are optimistic about all 13 municipalities, said Trinamuls north Bengal convener Gautam Deb.         
	Of the four municipalities going to the polls in Cooch Behar, the Congress controls one  Cooch Behar. The others  Dinhata, Toofanganj and Mathabhanga  are with the Left.        
	Much has happened in Bengal politics since the 2005 civic polls, though.        
	Despite our strong presence in Cooch Behar and Dinhata, we are facing a tough contest from Trinamul nominees in all four municipalities. Even in a Left bastion like Mathabhanga, Trinamul has two councillors in the CPM-controlled board, said district Congress president Biren Kundu.         
	In the 2006 Assembly polls, Trinamul had snatched the Dinhata seat from the Left.         
	In Jalpaiguri, the Congress controls Jalpaiguri municipality, but Trinamul hopes to cash in on its infighting. We shall also use our victory in the adjoining Rajganj Assembly seat in 2006 as a plank, said Jalpaiguri Trinamul president K.K. Kalyani.        
	In Malda, the Congress and Trinamul together run the Englishbazar municipality, while the Left controls Old Malda.        
	This time, we are confronting Trinamul in both municipalities, said Congress district president and Malda South MP A.H. Khan Chowdhury.        
	In Murshidabad, Trinamul has for the first time fielded candidates for all 103 wards in the six civic bodies  Murshidabad, Kandi, Beldanga, Jiaganj-Azimganj, Jangipur and Dhulian. The Congress here controls Murshidabad and Kandi while the Left controls the remaining four.        
	To be able to field so many candidates in Murshidabad is itself a proof of our strength, said Utpal Pal, Trinamuls district youth president.

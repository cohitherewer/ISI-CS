	Islampur (North Dinajpur), Jan. 25: Two children aged nine and 10 were the only survivors after a jeep that took the wrong lane to avoid congestion on a fog-enveloped highway crashed into a truck near here this morning.        
	Six people were killed  five members of a Sikkim businessmans family and the driver of the jeep they were travelling in.        
	Sunil Das, who has a shop at the bazaar in Kanki, was on his way to open his store when he saw the white Mahindra Bolero speed past and smash into the truck coming from the opposite direction. I closed my eyes at the last moment, but the loud bang confirmed the worst, said Das. The noise brought many people out of their homes around 7am.        
	Ram Bhajan Prasad, 53, his wife Mina Devi, 40, and daughter Sabita, 15, the wife of Prasads nephew, Parvati, 35, his neighbour Kailash Devi, 35, and driver Vikash Dorgi, 23, were killed.        
	Parvatis nine-year-old daughter Dali and Kailashs 10-year-old daughter Manisha have been admitted to MGM Hospital at Kishanganj in Bihar, 17km from the crash site on National Highway 31.         
	Police said the family owned several groceries in Sikkim. They were heading towards Chhapra in Bihar, where they hailed from.        
	Prasad was a leader of a forum of Biharis at Singtam, about 30km from Gangtok.         
	Subhas Prasad, another leader of the forum who came to Kishanganj today, said the family had left Singtam at 2am.        
	The children were shifted to a Siliguri nursing home late this evening. They havent been told about the deaths, Subhas said.         
	The officer in charge of the local Chakulia police station, Madhab Das, said the truck driver had fled leaving his vehicle behind.        
	Another officer said vehicles got stuck on one flank of the highway this morning because a truck had overturned.

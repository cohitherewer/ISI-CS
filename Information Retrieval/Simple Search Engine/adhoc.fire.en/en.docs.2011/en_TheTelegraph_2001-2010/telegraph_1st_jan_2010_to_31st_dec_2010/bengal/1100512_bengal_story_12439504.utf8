The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress takes off gloves

  - Alliance doesnt mean we have to fold up for its sake, says Pranab        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee at the Congresss campaign opener in Sealdah. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Calcutta, May 11: Pranab Mukherjee today hit out at Mamata Banerjee without naming her for trying to marginalise the Congress in Bengal.        
	Launching the partys campaign for the Calcutta civic polls today, Mukherjee defended his partys position during the seat-sharing talks with the Trinamul Congress and put it in a larger political context.         
	Citing the Congresss alliance with the NCP in Maharashtra, the DMK in Tamil Nadu and Lalu Prasad in Bihar, he said: This doesnt mean well have to fold up our party in these states. Political parties form alliances to expand themselves. If somebody thinks that to form an alliance means to fold up a party, I dont agree.        
	Mukherjee, the Bengal Congress president, said the party had asked for a minimum number of seats for the city civic polls, but had been rebuffed by ally Trinamul.        
	Mukherjees speech in the Congresss inaugural campaign rally belied suggestions that the party would be defensive about the collapse of the alliance with Trinamul. Instead, he set the tone for what cou- ld be an aggressive Congress campaign on what he sees as Trinamuls bullying tactics.        
	Just as Mukherjee did not name Mamata today, the Trinamul leader had earlier held him responsible for the break-up of the alliance without using his name. She had last week instructed Trinamul workers to go full blast against Bengal Congress leaders, dubbing them CPM agents.        
	Mamata has made no sec- ret of her annoyance with Mukherjee on several issues involving central as well as state politics. She had stayed away from the Lok Sabha with her party MPs when Mukherjee replied to the debate on the finance bill.        
	She had been upset over Mukherjees refusal to withdraw the service tax on railway freight. She had expected that he would prevail upon his Bengal colleagues to accept her terms, but instead he instructed them to put up candidates for 88 seats in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	In his hour-long speech, Mukherjee dwelt at length on the Congresss need for an alliance for the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. We had accepted 14 seats out of 42 and she (Mamata) took the remaining, Mukherjee said. What was the result? Her seats went up from one to 19. This means that the people voted for the alliance and not for an individual party.        
	He added: Does it mean one has to fold up the party for the sake of change? Ours is a 125-year-old party, which has faced many odds. So if one disrespects the party because there has been no alliance, I have nothing to say.        
	Earlier in the day, Mukherjee had addressed a meeting of party workers in North 24-Parganas Panihati.         
	Supporters scuffled with each other to get near the dais where Mukherjee was seated with state party working president Pradip Bhattacharya.        
	At that meeting, Mukherjee said it was irrational to equate the municipal polls with the Lok Sabha polls to reach a seat-share understanding.        
	No parallel can be drawn between the Lok Sabha polls and the municipal polls. The civic polls are fought on local issues and political issues do not play a major role, he said.        
	Mamata had insisted on 115 of the 141 seats in Calcutta citing her partys parliamentary poll performance.        
	Mukherjee told a news conference at Panihati the collapse of the alliance was unfortunate. We had tried for an alliance but it did not happen. What can be done?        
	Mamata will get a chance to respond to Mukherjees charges when she opens her campaign in the city tomorrow.

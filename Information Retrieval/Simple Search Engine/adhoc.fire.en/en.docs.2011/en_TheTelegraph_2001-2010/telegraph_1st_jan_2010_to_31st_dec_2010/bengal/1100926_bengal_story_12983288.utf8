	Dahijuli (Jhargram), Sept. 25: The security forces suffered their third fatality at rebel hands in Jungle Mahal this year when a CRPF jawan and a Maoist died during an encounter in the early hours today.        
	D. Melo Stephen, 25, from Manipur, took a bullet in the head during the two-and-a-half-hour clash in Banderboni village, 10km from Jhargram town. The dead Maoist is yet to be identified.         
	A security force source said Stephen may not have been wearing a helmet but this could not be confirmed.        
	Police said the forces raided Banderboni at 2am after receiving information that a group of Maoists was holed up in the village and its neighbourhood.        
	Most of the rebels belonged to the squad led by Shashadhar Mahato, brother of arrested Peoples Committee leader Chhatradhar Mahato, an officer said.        
	The police team parked their vehicles on a highway near Banderboni and walked 5km to the village. As soon as the forces took up position in a paddy field, the Maoists started firing from all directions. Our forces retaliated. Both sides fired 500 rounds, said Jhargram district police chief Praveen Tripathi.        
	He said the rebels later retreated into neighbouring villages. While searching the area, we found Stephens body in the field, a senior officer said.        
	Stephen had been posted at a CRPF camp in Silapara near Lalgarh, 15km from the encounter spot, since July last year.        
	It appears that some of the Maoists crossed the Kangsabati river and fled to Lalgarh, Tripathi said.        
	Another officer claimed several Maoists were injured in the encounter. There were bloodstains on the paddy field. The injured Maoists were probably dragged away by their comrades, he said.        
	Tripathi said a 9mm pistol and three explosive devices were found near the encounter spot. Around 25 villagers have been detained and are being interrogated.        
	Peoples Committee spokesperson Joydev Mahato alleged the police had killed at least nine villagers in the encounter.        
	In June, a constable of the Specially Trained Armed Company was killed in an encounter with the rebels near Jhargram. A month later, a Cobra jawan was killed during a gun battle in the Metala forest near Lalgarh.

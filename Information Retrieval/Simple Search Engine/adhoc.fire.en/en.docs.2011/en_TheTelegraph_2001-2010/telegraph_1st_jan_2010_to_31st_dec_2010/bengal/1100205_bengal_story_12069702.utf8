          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 4: The CPM today called for a movement against soaring food costs and a planned hike in the price of petroleum products, trying to put the Congress-led government in Delhi on the mat but also to regain support lost after Singur and Nandigram.        
	Introducing a discussion on the political situation in the country on the first day of the three-day meeting of the central committee, general secretary Prakash Karat highlighted the need for an anti-price rise movement along with other Left and like-minded parties.         
	Karat admitted the CPM had been unable to launch a mass movement on prices but spoke of stalling Parliament as well as hitting the streets.        
	Politburo member and Karats wife Brinda said: The government has no right to call itself an aam aadmi government as its policies have led to the unprecedented price rise.         
	The other issues on which the CPM will focus while attacking the UPA include its perceived flip-flop on Telangana as well as other statehood demands.        
	Karat also hinted that the CPM would accept quotas for Muslims in government jobs and education, as recommended by the Ranganath Misra panel. But he stressed that the acceptance was based on socio-economic criteria and the CPM would seek reservation for backward sub-groups among Muslims and other minorities. He said the CPM would pressure the Centre to amend the Constitution for the quota.        
	On the alleged Maoist-Mamata nexus, Karat left it to the state CPM leadership to co-ordinate with the Centre on anti-Maoist operations as well as handle the contradictions in the Trinamul-Congress alliance on the issue.

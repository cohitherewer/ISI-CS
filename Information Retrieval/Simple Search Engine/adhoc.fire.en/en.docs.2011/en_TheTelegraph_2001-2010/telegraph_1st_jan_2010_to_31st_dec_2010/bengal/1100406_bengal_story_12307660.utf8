The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pressure on party to digest Suman 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Pressure on party to digest Suman 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    Some of Kabir Sumans friends:   (  From top ) Actor Kaushik Sen, film director Suman Mukhopadhyay, and author Mahasweta Devi      
	Calcutta, April 5: Kabir Sumans friends among authors, artistes and activists today began a move to pressure Mamata Banerjee to accommodate the rebel MP in the Trinamul Congress and offer him the freedom to express his individual opinion.        
	In an appeal addressed to both Mamata and Suman, 20 people who had been seen at various Trinamul forums over the past couple of years urged the two to sit together and bury the hatchet for the sake of the country.         
	Trinamul had chosen him as a guest candidate for the Jadavpur seat knowing he was a protesting character, conscious about his individualism. So if he differs with the party on some issues, he must have the power to express his individual opinion, the appeal faxed to media houses said, leaving many in Trinamul frowning.        
	How can we buy such an argument? asked a leader from South 24-Parganas. One has to go by party discipline.        
	The alleged corruption of some South 24-Parganas Trinamul leaders and their misbehaviour with him at a programme last week had apparently prompted Suman to offer to resign from Parliament and the party.        
	Writer Mahasweta Devi, theatre personality Kaushik Sen, rights activist Sujato Bhadra and film director Suman Mukhopadhyay were some of the signatories to the appeal to Mamata to ignore Sumans offer to resign.        
	We issued todays appeal as a last-ditch effort to persuade Mamata to sit with Suman immediately and sort out their differences. We want her to reject outright Sumans text message in which he had expressed his desire to quit Parliament and the party, Mahasweta told The Telegraph tonight. At this juncture, we want Mamata to accommodate Suman by settling the scores with him through talks for a greater cause.         
	Asked if the appeal was prompted by Mamatas decision last evening to expel Sumans election agent Mufazzal Hossain, Mahasweta ducked the question but said: It was a bad development.        
	Suman told The Telegraph: I shall neither react to todays appeal, nor the expulsion of my agent. When I met Mahaswetadi on Wednesday, she had asked me to put my resignation on hold for seven days. So, I shall speak only after Wednesday.        
	Trinamul leaders insisted the party would not compromise with the rebel. The appeal does not carry any importance for the party. Suman has been an embarrassment ever since he became an MP. We want to get rid of him, a party general secretary said.         
	With Trinamul keen to distance itself from Maoists, a party vice-president said: It is not acceptable if Suman is vocal against Operation Green Hunt and on other sensitive issues inside the House and outside.        
	The Trinamul chief whip in the Lok Sabha, Sudip Bandopadhyay, to whom Suman had sent the offer to resign along with Mamata, said: He has lowered the partys image among people across the country by publicly going against Mamata. We are now waiting for his resignation.         
	Bandopadhyay had earlier written to the Lok Sabha Speaker, urging her to accept Sumans text message as a formal resignation letter.

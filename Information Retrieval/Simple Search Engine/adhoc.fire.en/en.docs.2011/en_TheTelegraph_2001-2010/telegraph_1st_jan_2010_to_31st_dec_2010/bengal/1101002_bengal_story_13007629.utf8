          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lalgola, Oct. 1: A schoolteacher saved an 11-year-old girl in Murshidabad from being forcibly married off by her mother who was finding it difficult to make ends meet after the death of her husband three months ago.         
	The teacher, Sonali Gupta, said she became worried after the girl, a resident of Mirpur village in Lalgola, remained absent from school for a week.         
	I visited her home yesterday morning. I was shocked to find out that she was getting married in the evening, Gupta said. The girls mother Seema Sarkar, 40, had arranged the marriage with a 17-year-old mason.        
	The girls grandmother and uncle were against the marriage. However, Seema was forcing her into the marriage because the groom had not demanded dowry, Gupta said. The teacher informed the block development officer (BDO) of Lalgola, Dibeyendu Sekhar Das, about the plan.        
	The BDO told me that a written complaint had to be lodged. The girls uncle agreed to lodge the complaint. He went to the BDO office in the afternoon and lodged the complaint, Gupta said.        
	Das went to the girls home in the evening with a police team. He told the girls mother and the grooms father that child marriage was illegal.        
	I explained the law to them and told them that if they tried to solemnise the marriage, action would be taken against them. Then they called off the wedding, the BDO said.        
	Seema said: I earn only Rs 35 a day by making bidis.

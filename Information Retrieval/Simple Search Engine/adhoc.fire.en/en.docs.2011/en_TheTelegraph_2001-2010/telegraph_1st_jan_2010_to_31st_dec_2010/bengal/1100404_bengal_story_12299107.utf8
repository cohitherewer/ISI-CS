                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Chidambaram to visit again 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 3: Union home minister P. Chidambaram is expected to visit Burdwan and some other areas in Bengal within a few weeks as his ongoing tour of the state has been truncated because of inclement weather in the Northeast.        
	The home minister, who reached Calcutta this evening and held a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, is scheduled to visit Lalgarh tomorrow. The Union home minister is going to Lalgarh tomorrow. That is confirmed, state home secretary Ardhendu Sen said.        
	But Burdwan, where political clashes had broken out between the CPM and the Opposition, does not figure in his final itinerary as he had to extend his stay in the Northeast because of the weather, which reduced the time to be spent in Bengal.        
	Yesterday, the Union home minister was supposed to visit Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh but could not go there because of inclement weather. So, he went to Tawang and Tirap today. Thats why he had to cancel his Burdwan trip that was scheduled this morning, a source said.        
	A joint delegation from the Trinamul Congress and the Congress tonight visited Chidambaram at Raj Bhavan and informed him of the Oppositions disappointment. But sources said the Union minister was expected to make another trip.        
	The delegation sought Chidambarams intervention to stop CPM atrocities in Bengal.         
	We wanted to know from Chidambaramji as to why he had cancelled his Burdwan trip but stuck to his Lalgarh tour. He explained that he got stuck in Arunachal Pradesh and that is why he could not make it to Burdwan, said PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya.        
	He said the home minister, when told about the CPMs atrocities in the districts, assured the delegation that he would visit all districts one after another.         
	At the Writers, the home ministers meeting with the chief minister lasted for around 30 minutes. After that, top officials of the state were called in to brief Chidambaram.        
	The Bengal government is learnt to have urged the minister to increase the deployment of central forces. We raised the issue of additional deployment of central forces so that more combat operations could be launched, a state official said.        
	We also underscored the need for more inter-state joint operations. We have had one inter-state joint operation with Orissa in February and another with Jharkhand in March, the official added.

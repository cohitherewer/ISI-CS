          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 6: Painter Suvaprasanna today strongly opposed the appeal by singer MP Kabir Sumans artiste, author and activist friends to accommodate him in the Trinamul Congress and offer him the freedom to express his individual opinion.        
	I strongly oppose the artistes and authors who said Kabir Suman should be accommodated in the Trinamul Congress, Suvaprasanna said.         
	The appeal had said Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee and Suman should sit together to bury the hatchet for the sake of the country and the people. Suvaprasanna, who is known to be close to Mamata, said: Suman, who talks rubbish against a political party that has elected him an MP, does not have anything to do either with the country or the people. Suman is a traitor and I dont find any justification in backing him.        
	Asked if he had begun a counter-campaign to ensure yesterdays appeal did not sway Mamata, the painter said: I have spoken to a few artistes and authors regarding Suman. They dont approve of what he has been doing consistently to lower the image of the party. Besides, I am in constant touch with Mamata.        
	A Trinamul general secretary said they were waiting for tomorrow. Suman had put his resignation on hold for a week following Mahasweta Devis request last Wednesday. Lets see what he does tomorrow. But we all want him to quit the party.        
	Author-activist Mahasweta said she was expecting Suman at her Golf Green home tomorrow. I shall again request him not to resign, she added.

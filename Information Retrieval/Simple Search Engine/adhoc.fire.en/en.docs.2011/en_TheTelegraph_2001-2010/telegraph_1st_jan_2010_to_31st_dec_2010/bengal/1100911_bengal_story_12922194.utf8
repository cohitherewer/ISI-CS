                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rivals unite at drought table
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsura, Sept. 10: The drought today brought the CPM and the Trinamul Congress to the same table.        
	Amit Roy, Trinamuls Hooghly general secretary, and Gourikanti Mukherjee, the chief of the Trinamul-led Chinsura municipality, attended an all-party meeting called by the Hooghly district magistrate (DM) with former CPM MP Rupchand Pal.         
	The one-hour meeting, held at DM Aswani Kumar Jadavs chamber to discuss the drought in Hooghly and steps to fight it, was also attended by the Congresss Dilip Nath, the BJPs Swapan Pal and several Left Front leaders apart from Pal.         
	Trinamul had earlier boycotted every all-party meeting called by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	Asked about the sudden change in stance today, Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said: Our party representatives attended the meeting to send the message that Mamata Banerjee was willing to cooperate with the administration to address the drought problem.        
	Bakshi said the partys stand was that it would not share the platform with CPM ministers, particularly the chief minister who is responsible for unleashing terror across Bengal. No minister attended todays meeting.        
	Bakshi said his party had attended several meetings convened by the subdivisional officer of Midnapore Sadar to discuss the Lalgarh situation a year ago.        
	At the Chinsura meeting, it was decided that district officials would visit Burdwan tomorrow to meet the central team touring the 11 drought-hit districts. Jadav said the Hooghly administration needed Rs 16 crore to tackle the drought.

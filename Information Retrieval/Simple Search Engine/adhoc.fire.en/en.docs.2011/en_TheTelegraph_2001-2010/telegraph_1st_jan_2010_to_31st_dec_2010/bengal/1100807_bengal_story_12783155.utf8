The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | On rally day, a Cong counter

  - Manas announces Tamluk meeting on August 9, Mamata unhappy        BARUN GHOSH                          Manas Bhuniya                                        
	Calcutta, Aug 6: On the day Mamata Banerjee has lined up her rally in West Midnapores Lalgarh, the state Congress is set to organise a similar one in neighbouring East Midnapores Tamluk.         
	Despite the alliance with the Trinamul Congress, the message from newly appointed state Congress president Manas Bhuniya is clear: the Congress has to do what it can to establish its clout in East Midnapore, where it has been cornered by Trinamul.         
	Bhuniyas move appears to have surprised even some in his party.         
	He has apparently planned the Tamluk rally to avenge the Trinamul attack on Youth Congress general secretary Usha Naidu in adjoining Khejuri last month, sources said. Bhuniya himself was allegedly heckled by Trinamul men when he had gone there a week later to address a rally.        
	Manass Tamluk rally on August 9 is aimed at countering the one being organised by us. Unable to swallow the humiliation he suffered in Khejuri last month, he planned the Tamluk rally. The Congress could easily join our apolitical rally in Lalgarh on that day to send a positive message to party workers across Bengal about the necessity of strengthening the alliance before next years Assembly polls, a Trinamul junior minister said.         
	He said Mamata had lodged a protest with Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, K. Keshava Rao, against the Congresss decision to organise a counter rally.        
	An AICC leader confirmed that Mamata had expressed unhappiness over the Tamluk rally as it would coincide with her Lalgarh meeting.        
	Tamluk MP Subhendu Adhikari of Trinamul said he would pay back Bhuniya in his own coin by organising a political convention of party workers in West Midnapores Sabang, the state Congress chiefs constituency, on September 12.         
	A Congress leader from East Midnapore admitted that Adhikaris announcement would be worrisome for Bhuniya because the Congress had trailed from the Sabang Assembly seat in last years Lok Sabha polls.        
	Reacting to the proposed Congress rally, Adhikari said: A political party is free to observe Martyrs Day in its own way on August 9 (the Quit India Movement of 1942 was launched on that day). But why is Manasbabu so eager to hold it in Tamluk? Is it just because we have already planned a rally in Lalgarh, which is in the neighbouring district of West Midnapore? This smacks of bad taste.         
	Bhuniya, however, said the Tamluk rally was planned at the instance of the high command in Delhi as part of the partys country-wide programme to commemorate the Quit India Movement.        
	But his party colleagues refused to buy his argument. We dont find any logic behind holding the Tamluk rally at a time we are taking care not to jeopardise the alliance with Mamata, a Congress general secretary in East Midnapore said.         
	Political observers believe that Bhuniyas move is aimed at helping his party get a foothold in East Midnapore where the Congress is hardly a political force.         
	Although only four of the 16 MLAs from East Midnapore belong to Trinamul, the party had polled more votes than the Left in all 16 Assembly segments in the last Lok Sabha elections. Besides, the Lok Sabha seats of Tamluk and Contai are represented by Trinamul.         
	East Midnapore Congress president Asit Ranjan Pal said the Tamluk rally would energise the party workers in the district who are demoralised because of the virtual wipe-out in the Lok Sabha polls.

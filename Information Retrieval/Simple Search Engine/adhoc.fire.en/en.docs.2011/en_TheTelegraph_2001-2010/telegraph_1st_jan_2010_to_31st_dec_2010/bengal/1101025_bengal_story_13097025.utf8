The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Humans vie with pigs for water

  - Asansol pocket forced to use toxic stream          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                          Women wash utensils as a pig drinks the dirty water flowing from the abandoned coal mine in Jamurias Satgram Phatak. Picture by Gour Sharma                                        
	Jamuria (Burdwan), Oct. 24: Promises of change may be flowing across Bengal but not water fit for humans in at least one pocket that boasts a municipality.        
	Around 60 families in a settlement just outside the flyover and mall-studded Asansol town have to jostle with pigs in a filthy and apparently toxic stream because the local civic body cant supply them clean water.        
	Satgram Phataks inhabitants, most of them labourers and rickshaw pullers, even have to drink the water sometimes. We are sometimes compelled to drink the water as the municipalitys nearest drinking water tap is 2km away. For the past 25 years, we have been using this water for bathing and washing utensils and clothes. No one cares about our plight, said Champa Majhi, 45, whose husband is a day labourer.        
	One resident, Dukhiram Hari, said outbreaks of diarrhoea and cholera were frequent. Doctors tell us we get the infection from the dirty water.        
	This is perhaps the only such clean water-starved pocket in the Durgapur-Asansol coal belt teeming with industries and mines.        
	The local CPI councillor of the Left-run Jamuria municipality, under which Satgram Phatak falls, blamed the problem on the residents habit and claimed they avoid using a well he had built for them sometime back.         
	I have erected a well at Satgram Phatak but the residents there have become so habituated to the water from the stream that they dont use the well, said Sukhomoy Pandey. However, this correspondent found the well dry.        
	Majnu Hari also said we have become used to it but blamed the continued lack of basics for her having reached such a state of resigned acceptance. It is impossible for us to carry home water for washing clothes, bathing or cleaning utensils. Now we have become used to it, said the 50-year-old domestic help.        
	Rickshaw puller Babulal Majhi does not see much hope. Before every election, the candidates come to us with folded hands and promise a better life. But nothing is done. We dont expect anything from them, said the 50-year-old.        
	Executives of Eastern Coalfields (ECL) suggested that piped water was the only solution and wells, like the one councillor Pandey tried to claim credit for, would not work in the area.        
	This (wells going dry) is quite normal in this coal belt where there are hollow patches below the surface and water escapes through these cavities, an ECL official said.         
	Jamuria municipality chairperson Bhaskar Banerjee admitted the families in Satgram Phatak, around 230km from Calcutta, are forced to use the canal water but promised remedies. We will install an overhead reservoir and supply piped water from the nearby Ajoy river. Drinking water is a chronic problem as the ground below the surface is hollow.        
	Local Trinamul leader Purnasashi Roy agreed that the situation would not change unless piped water was supplied. As the ground underneath is hollow, digging wells or deep tube wells is not the solution at all. Digging wells for residents is an eyewash which the Left-run municipality has been doing.

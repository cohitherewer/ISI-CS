	Durgapur, Feb. 8: Robbers walked into a bank that had no guard and whose door had been left ajar even after transactions had been closed, and took away over Rs 40 lakh.        
	At the Oriental Bank of Commerces Benachity Branch, in the heart of Durgapur town, five men whipped out revolvers when the bank was supposed to be closed for lunch. They pushed the employees and the few remaining customers to a corner, robbed them of their valuables and then headed to the vault.

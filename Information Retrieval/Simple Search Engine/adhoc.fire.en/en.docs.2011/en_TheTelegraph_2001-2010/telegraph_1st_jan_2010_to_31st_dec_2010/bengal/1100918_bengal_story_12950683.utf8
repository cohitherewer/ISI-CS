	Midnapore, Sept. 17: Suspected Maoists shot at a CPM leader in Jhargram today for resisting their attempts to set up a Peoples Committee unit in the town and organising people to guard their neighbourhoods at night.        
	Gour Poichha, 52, a CPM local committee member, took a bullet in his head and another in the waist.         
	Poichha is the first CPM leader in Jhargram town to be shot at by the rebels since the beginning of the Maoist movement in Jungle Mahal in November 2008. He was coming out of a tea stall when six youths on three motorcycles fired at him, police said.         
	The victim had gone out for a morning walk at 7am and had entered the tea stall on his way back home. He was shot at in front of the customers with whom he had been chatting while having tea, a police officer said.         
	Poichha was taken to Jhargram subdivisional hospital where his wounds were dressed. One bullet is lodged in his head and another in his waist. The bullet in his head needs to be taken out immediately, a doctor at the Jhargram hospital said.        
	The CPM leader had organised people to guard their localities at night. He had protested Maoist activities in the area several times and had stopped them from setting up a Peoples Committee unit in Jhargram town, said Praveen Tripathi, the Jhargram superintendent of police.        
	The police said Maoists had raided Poichhas house in April. However, he was not at home and the rebels left after ransacking the house.        
	On September 12, Maoists had shot at a CPM leader in Lalgarh town. Tarun Banerjee is being treated in a private hospital in Calcutta. His condition is stable, CPM functionary Anuj Pandey said.

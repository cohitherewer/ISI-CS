	Santiniketan, July 9: Visva-Bharatis Trinamul-led student union today temporarily withdrew its ongoing indefinite strike claiming the authorities had agreed to reconsider the recent fee hike.        
	We will continue our dialogue, vice-chancellor Rajat Ray said. But union president Shanku Deb Panda threatened to resume the agitation if the fees were not cut in a week.

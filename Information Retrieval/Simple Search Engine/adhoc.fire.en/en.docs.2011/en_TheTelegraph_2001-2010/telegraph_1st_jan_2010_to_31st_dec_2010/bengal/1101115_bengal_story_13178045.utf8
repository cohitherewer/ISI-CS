	Tamluk, Nov. 14: Trinamul Congress supporters gheraoed the house of a police officer in East Midnapore for four hours after some of them saw a woman sneak in last night.        
	Around 1,000 Trinamul supporters locked the door of the house in Bhupatinagar from outside, accusing assistant sub-inspector Ashok Karmakar of running a flesh trade racket.        
	A police team led by additional superintendent of police H. Meena rescued Karmakar and the woman around 2am today.         
	Karmakar, who is married, claimed he had been framed by Trinamul. The woman who came to my house last night is a relative. I am innocent, he said.        
	The police have started an inquiry against Karmakar, who hails from Naihati in North 24-Parganas, after the Trinamul supporters lodged a complaint against him and another assistant sub-inspector, Tapas Ghosh. The woman was released after questioning.        
	The Trinamul supporters claimed Ghosh had brought the woman to Karmakars house.         
	Last week, Trinamul supporters had forcibly taken away a man with alleged Maoist links from Bhupatinagar police station.

	Behrampore, Oct. 22: An army jawan who suspected his wife of being unfaithful allegedly throttled her to death and escaped from his Murshidabad village today, minutes after being caught trying to pass off the murder as suicide.        
	Police said Sanjay Mandal  who was home on vacation  had first tried to dump the body of Pushpalata, 30, telling villagers who got suspicious seeing him cart away the corpse on a cycle van that she was sick and was being taken to hospital.        
	Then, the 35-year-old jawan went back to his house in Goaljan, near Behrampore town, in an attempt to douse the suspicion. But the villagers followed him home a little later.        
	Suspecting that Pushpalata was dead, the villagers informed others. A mob of 200 went to his house and broke open the door. They found Sanjay trying to hang the body from the fan. He ran out just then, said an officer.        
	The villagers then dragged out Sanjays father Narayan and mother Tulsi, both in their 60s, and vandalised the house before setting it on fire. Narayan and Tulsi have been arrested based on a complaint from Pushpalatas uncle.         
	Sanjay, who had been paid a dowry of Rs 3.5 lakh at the time of marriage in 2003, suspected Pushpalata of having an affair with a youth in Behrampore where she went everyday to drop their six-year-old daughter in school. Their misgivings deepened after she refused an escort.        
	Murshidabad police chief B.L. Meena said Sanjay and his parents had been booked for murder. Sanjay is an army jawan but we are yet to find out where he is posted.

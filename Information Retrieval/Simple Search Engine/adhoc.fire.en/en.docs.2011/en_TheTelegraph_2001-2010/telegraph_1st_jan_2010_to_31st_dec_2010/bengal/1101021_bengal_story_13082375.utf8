The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata smells plot in small matter
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata smells plot in small matter
  - Nothing to be alarmed in one derailment, says railway minister         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee outside Maharashtra Nivas Hall on Hazra Road where the Trinamul core committee met on Wednesday evening to discuss party programmes.

	Calcutta, Oct. 20: Mamata Banerjee has hinted at a conspiracy behind todays derailment, saying it had to be probed if it was an accident or someone was behind the morning trip-up.        
	At the same time, the railway minister tried to play down the incident, saying it was a small matter that was being blown out of proportion.        
	There are Metro trains plying for 365 days throughout the year and there is nothing to be alarmed if there is a derailment on one day. I believe that it should not have happened. But this is a small matter and is being blown out of proportion by certain quarters, she said, her comment clearly aimed at the CPM.        
	Mamata also pointed a finger at the CPM. The derailment will be certainly probed to ascertain if it was a mere accident or someone was behind it. There are people owing allegiance to other parties as well in Metro Rail. We, too, have our people in the state government. But that does not mean we will unleash violence at Writers Buildings, she told a media conference at Maharashtra Nivas Hall in Hazra after wrapping up a party programme.        
	The probe will reveal the facts and those involved in todays derailment will be punished. You know what happened in the Jnaneswari crash and in Sainthia.        
	Mamata insisted there was no need to panic after todays incident. Why are you panicking? Dont follow the CPM pack, she said. It is a small incident. People die in plane crashes. Does that mean people will stop taking flights? People die on roads. These things happen but we cant say we will not use them.        
	The Trinamul chief then went back to her conspiracy theory. There is one incident or the other involving the Metro almost every day. Some people have been creating trouble in the AC rake almost daily since it was launched during Puja. Only last week, some passengers turned violent at a Metro station after the train got stuck in the tunnel.        
	When told that some CPM leaders had accused her of compromising passenger safety with her unending launch of new stations, the railway minister flared up. Why is the CPM clamouring over todays derailment? What do they have to say about the complete derailment of the administration? They have derailed everything in Bengal for 34 years. The CPM wont gain anything by pointing fingers at me. People know what is what.         
	Mamata was in her Kalighat home when the derailment took place but didnt meet reporters who had gone there to get her reaction.        
	Trinamul sources said she was glued to the TV and spoke to some Metro officials over the phone. She left for the Hazra address around 4.15 and stayed there for over four hours to chair a meeting of the partys core committee.        
	At the media conference, Mamata initially said she would only field questions on the partys programmes that were discussed at todays meeting but then relented and answered a couple of queries on the morning accident.         
	Trinamul plan        
	Mamata today formally began her partys preparations for the Assembly elections next summer, asking Trinamul managers across the state to launch mass-contact programmes after Kali Puja.

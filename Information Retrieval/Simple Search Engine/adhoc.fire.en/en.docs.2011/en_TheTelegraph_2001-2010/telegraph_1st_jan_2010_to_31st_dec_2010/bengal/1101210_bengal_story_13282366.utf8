The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist revenge hit kills CPM leader
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoist revenge hit kills CPM leader
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, Dec. 9: A CPM leader was shot dead in his party office opposite a Birbhum police station by suspected Maoists who left behind a poster condemning last weeks arrest of rebel kingpin Kanchan and four others.        
	The posters found beside the body of Shasthi Bauri, a bachelor in his fifties who had been living in the party office at Khoirashol after leaving home in the face of rebel threats since 2008, ask people to build up a resistance against the CPM.        
	We found a poster protesting the recent arrest of five CPI (Maoist) leaders from Calcutta and asking people to build up a resistance against the CPM. Our investigation has revealed that the assailants shouted Maoist slogans before escaping. All these suggest it is the handiwork of Maoists, Birbhum police chief Humayun Kabir said.        
	Four to five youths, their faces covered, arrived on bikes and entered the party office during a power cut in the area. They then shot Bauri, a district secretariat member, eight times. Two bullets hit him in the chest. The assailants then slit his throat, said another officer.         
	The bikes were seen speeding towards the Barabani jungles which lead to the Jharkhand border, 12km away. Spent cartridges found at the spot suggested 9mm pistols and Insas automatic rifles  common in the rebel armoury  had been used. Barui was rushed to a nearby health centre but declared dead on arrival.        
	The killing sent shockwaves across Khoirashol, a pocket known for its coal mines and around 280km from Calcutta.         
	Maoists had put up a poster in nearby Tantipara village threatening to kill five CPM leaders, including Bauri, and Sridam Das, a local committee member, in 2008. Soon after, Das was shot dead and Maoist posters were found beside his body. Bauri then left his home and started living at the party office. Later, another local committee member was shot dead in a similar way, a CPM leader said.        
	Birbhum district CPM secretary Dilip Ganguly said the police had alerted him about the threat to party leaders, including Bauri, but pointed a finger at the Trinamul Congress, too. We believe Maoists backed by Trinamul have killed him. We have called a 12-hour bandh against the murder tomorrow.

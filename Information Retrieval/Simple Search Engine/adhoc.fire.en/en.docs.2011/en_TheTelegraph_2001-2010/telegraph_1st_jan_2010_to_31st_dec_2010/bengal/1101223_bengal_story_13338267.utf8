          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Asim Dasgupta    
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: Asim Dasgupta today said MLA local area development funds pending for two years would be released soon but the legislators wondered whether they would have time to use the money with the elections only months away.         
	Several MLAs have received only half of the funds for the financial year 2009-10 and nothing so far in 2010-11.         
	State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya said the funds had not been released because of the financial crunch the state was facing. Sources in Writers Buildings, however, said many MLAs had not submitted utilisation certificates for money used in previous projects undertaken by them. As a result, fresh funds could not be disbursed.         
	Finance minister Dasgupta said in the Assembly today that the development and planning department and the finance department had held a meeting three-four days back in which it was decided that the funds would be released. The minister, however, did not mention any date.        
	He was replying to a calling attention motion tabled by Bhuniya requesting Dasgupta and Nirupam Sen, the planning and development minister, to release the funds.        
	Bhuniya said MLAs had to submit utilisation certificates by March next year. But according to the rule, at least 30 per cent of the allocated funds have to be utilised for the next instalment to be disbursed, leaving the MLAs only three months to use up the money.         
	The Congress leader said several proposed projects had been held up. I myself have not received a single rupee for the proposals I submitted for my constituency (West Midnapores Sabang), Bhuniya added.        
	In this years budget, Dasgupta had increased the annual allocation for MLAs by Rs 10 lakh. The new limit is around Rs 60 lakh.         
	A Congress legislator said on condition of anonymity that the disbursing authorities  district magistrates, block development officers, panchayats and municipal corporations  had in several cases said they had not received funds to execute project proposals submitted by MLAs.         
	The MLA said with the elections round the corner, there was not enough time to plan and execute development projects.        
	Several MLAs said they had planned the projects to showcase them as achievements during the campaign for the elections. However, they said they could not take their plans beyond the drawing board because of the paucity of funds.

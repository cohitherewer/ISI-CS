                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      TV to help cops kick the bottle

	Tamluk, Jan. 13: From 6pm to midnight, over a dozen policemen in Tamluk have one task  to see television.         
	The TV isnt their tool to skip work. Like good boys, they sit in a row in front of it through the six hours under strict instructions from the district police chief.        
	That is the only way the 14 could escape suspension after being identified as habitual on-duty drinkers.        
	While patrolling the streets of Tamluk on an evening about a fortnight ago, district superintendent of police Bastab Vaidya found two drunk constables. He summoned them to his office and told them they would be suspended.        
	One of the constables, 40-year-old Raghunath Das (name changed), broke down in tears. I told the SP I wouldnt drink again. I have a wife, a son in Class IV and a daughter in Class VI. If I am suspended, all of them will be ruined, he said. His colleague had followed suit in falling at the superintendents feet.         
	The SP then ordered a probe that identified 12 others across East Midnapore who were habitual drinkers.         
	He had them transferred to the reserve force in the district police lines and gave them day shifts.        
	After work, they sit in the superintendents office and surf through news and film channels between lectures from their bosses on how to kick the habit.        
	The officer had even got a VCD for a special screening of Sholay, on request.        
	Additional superintendent of police S.M.H. Mirza said it was an experimental attempt to keep the constables off booze. Most of them are family men and we are keeping them engaged in the evenings. We are watching TV with them and speaking to them about the ill effects of consuming liquor in excess, said Mirza.        
	Alok Patra, a doctor in Tamluk who treats alcoholics, said the effort was laudable but the cops would have to be kept under watch for at least six months.         
	The police have made the right move by making them do other things around the time they usually drank. Abstinence is most important. But the first six months are crucial.         
	Patra added that it was also important to keep these people engaged in social, religious, sports and other activities during the abstinence period.         
	The 14 constables are served dinner at the police headquarters and dropped at the nearby police lines in an office car after midnight.         
	An officer said the families had not been told why these constables were spending so much time at the SPs office.         
	The SP was also with us for a few days of our rehab routine, the officer added.        
	Constable Anirban Dutta (name changed), who said he had started drinking 20 years ago, has for the first time in so many years spent a fortnight without alcohol.         
	I started drinking 20 years ago. First, it was occasionally, just with friends, but then the habit grew and I began to drink daily. My wife often fights with me because of my habit. I hope the SPs initiative helps, Anirban said.

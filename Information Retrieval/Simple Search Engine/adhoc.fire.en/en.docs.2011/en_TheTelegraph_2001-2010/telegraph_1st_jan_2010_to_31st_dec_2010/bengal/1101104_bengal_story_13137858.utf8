	Calcutta, Nov. 3: Armed robbers broke shutters of five jewellery shops in Canning and escaped with ornaments worth Rs 8 lakh early today after scaring away a night guard with guns.         
	The robbers took away jewellery the shopkeepers had stacked for Dhanteras today.        
	Asoke Mazumdar, the secretary of the Swarna Byabsayee Samiti, said the robbers came around 2.30am, broke the vaults in the shops, located near a market, and escaped with the booty. He alleged police had done nothing despite earlier robberies.

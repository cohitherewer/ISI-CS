	Lalgarh, April 3: The suspected Maoist blast near Lalgarh, barely 4.6km from the helipad where Union home minister P. Chidambaram is scheduled to land tomorrow, has thrown the West Midnapore administration into a tizzy.        
	Police have doubled the already tight security measures that had been put in place last week for Chidambarams visit.         
	Officials said the blast was an alarm bell for the administration to ensure there were no holes in the security arrangements for the home ministers visit.        
	Elaborate arrangements have been made to throw a tight security ring in and around Lalgarh, West Midnapore police superintendent Manoj Verma said.        
	However, some district administration officials said the fact that the Maoists managed to trigger the blast in spite of tight security arrangements was a cause for worry.        
	We are lucky that this incident did not happen during the home ministers visit, an official said. We are also fortunate that the polices intelligence network got a tip-off about the planting of the improvised explosive device.        
	The police have detained five local people in connection with the blast.        
	We need to find out whether the IED was meant to be detonated today or during the home ministers visit tomorrow, an official said.         
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities has called a 24-hour bandh tomorrow in the three Maoist-hit districts of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia to protest Chidambarams visit.        
	The Border Security Force today carried out aerial surveillance over Lalgarh and Midnapore town.        
	Security personnel have searched every inch of the land around the helipad in Lalgarh, covering a radius of 2km, an officer said. A contingent of 1,200 security personnel will be deployed on the roads leading to Lalgarh tomorrow. A group of 160 Cobra commandos has entered deep into the forests of Kantapahari, Jhitka, Kadashole and Ramgarh.         
	The exact time of Chidambrams arrival is not being made public because of security reasons.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong on lips, not target
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong on lips, not target
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 5: The CPM may rail at the Congress on rising prices in Delhi but its prime rival back in Bengal is Trinamul, the party made it clear today.        
	The Trinamul Congress has been constant in the anti-Left equation in Bengal since the last few years. The Congress, BJP and the smaller parties are variables. Regular watchers of our recent political campaign will be able to identify the force against which we will concentrate our batteries in the coming days, said Mohammad Salim, a CPM state secretariat member.         
	The CPM is scheduled to hold a rally in Delhi on March 12 to protest against rising price of petro products and the general spike in costs of daily items. We will definitely take the anti-price rise movement to the highest pitch. But the decision about moves in Parliament and outside will be taken after the March 12 rally during consultations with other Left as well as secular and democratic parties, Salim said.        
	Mamata Banerjees nexus with the Maoists will also be highlighted at the rally, which chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will not attend.         
	Some in the Left Front have raised their brows on Bhattacharjees absence, but Salim, who will be present at the rally, argued: In a Left rally at the central level, we dont focus on chief ministers or ministers.        
	In private, though, some CPM leaders said Bhattacharjees move matched the partys two-pronged dealings with the Congress-led government in Delhi.         
	The CPM has to attack the Centre on price rise for its core support base. At the same time, the state government needs to maintain ties with the Centre to tackle Maoists.         
	Bhattacharjee cannot afford to thunder at the Congress in Delhi, a party leader said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Subsidy-stuck govt offers power bill cut
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Subsidy-stuck govt offers power bill cut
          OUR BUREAU                          Nirupam Sen                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: The Left Front government today said it would subsidise the electricity bills of those who use up to 200 units a month, bringing relief to 77 per cent of the 1.08 crore power consumers in the state.         
	It also offered a subsidy of Re 1 on every litre of diesel purchased to operate pumps for agricultural purposes. Both the sops came days after the state government announced a subsidy of Re 1 for every litre of diesel purchased by bus, minibuses and taxi operators to avoid a hike in transport fares.         
	The sops are being seen as a bid to woo voters ahead of the Assembly polls next year.         
	The Left hopes that the subsidy on electricity will take the sting out of Mamata Banerjees claim that the state cannot blame the Centre for price rise after having itself raised the power tariff last week.        
	More than 41 per cent of the 1.08 crore electricity consumers in the state will not have to bear the burden of the increased power tariff because of the subsidy, power minister Nirupam Sen said. The increase in electricity bill for another 36 per cent consumers will be lower, he added.        
	Following todays subsidy announcement, domestic consumers of CESC who use up to 100 units per month will be spared the hike as the subsidy will cover the extra amount. Domestic consumers using 150 units a month will see their monthly bill going up by Rs 5 as against Rs 13.50 had there been no subsidy. Likewise, households consuming 200 units per month will have to pay Rs 10.50 more instead of an excess amount of Rs 42.15.         
	There will be no hike in the electricity bills of commercial customers of CESC who consume up to 150 units a month. They will have to pay only Rs 5 more if the consumption is between 150 and 200 units.         
	Domestic consumers of WBSEDCL in the urban areas, who use up to 50 units a month, will not have to pay any extra amount. Those consuming 100 units will have to pay Rs 37 more a month with the subsidy as against Rs 50.75 without it. Those using 200 units a month will have to pay Rs 109 extra with the subsidy as against the Rs 136.75 they would have had to pay without the subsidy.        
	CESC charges are higher than WBSEDCLs.

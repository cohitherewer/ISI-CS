The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Greetings, officers (not commissioner)
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Greetings, officers (not commissioner)
          BARUN GHOSH                            Mamata Banerjee, Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti				                                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 7: Mamata Banerjees New Year greetings went to all bureaucrats and police officers earlier this week  all except Calcutta police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	The belated greetings from the Trinamul Congress chief, wishing a prosperous year and seeking co-operation to build a robust Bengal, went to police superintendents, district magistrates and department secretaries across the state.        
	Then why not Chakrabarti?        
	A Trinamul vice-president assigned the job of getting the letters delivered to the right addresses put it down to bitter memories of 1992, when Mamata was a Congress leader and Chakrabarti the deputy commissioner, detective department. She (Mamata) cannot forget the manner in which Chakrabarti got her arrested in 1992 for protesting on behalf of a deaf-mute girl at Writers Buildings, the party vice-president said.        
	The police had bodily lifted Mamata and stashed her in their van when she refused to budge, squatting for three hours in front of then chief minister Jyoti Basus office demanding his resignation over the rape of Dipali Basak.        
	The New Year greeting is the second from Mamata.        
	A similar message from her had gone to the heads of the business chambers and prominent businessmen in which she urged them to join hands to build a better future.         
	Both the letters are important in the present context. In the first one, Mamata tried to assert her pro-industry image, while in the second, she showed her keenness to establish the rule of law in the state by seeking co-operation from police chiefs and bureaucrats to build a robust Bengal, said Trinamul leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee.         
	The police commissioners elder brother, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti got one of Mamatas letters, though. The letter was sent to the elder Chakrabarti because he is the chief secretary and Mamata, though she is often critical about his style of functioning, never had any conflict with him, the Trinamul vice-president said.        
	In Trinamul circles, Mamatas letters are being viewed as an effort to increase her rapport with the officials and the police brass before the 2011 Assembly elections.        
	Didi is often critical of a section of police officers and bureaucrats because of their partisan style of functioning. But the current exercise is part of her strategy to win their confidence, keeping in mind that she is a chief-minister-in- waiting, a Trinamul general secretary said.         
	Purulia district police superintendent Rajesh Yadav admitted he had received the letter from Mamata. I have received the railway ministers greetings. But this is a personal communication between us and this is why it would be unfair to reveal its contents to you.

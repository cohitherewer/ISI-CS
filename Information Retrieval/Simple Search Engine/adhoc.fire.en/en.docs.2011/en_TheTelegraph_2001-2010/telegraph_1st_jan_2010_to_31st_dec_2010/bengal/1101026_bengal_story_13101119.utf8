The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Gurung panel hint
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Gurung panel hint
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, Oct. 25: Bimal Gurung today hinted that a joint verification panel could end the impasse on the territorial jurisdiction for the proposed interim set-up for the hills.        
	The committee, comprising representatives of the Centre, state and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, will survey the areas that can be tagged along with the three hill subdivisions in Darjeeling district as part of the new set-up, he said.         
	Those issues that have not been finalised such as territory and the transfer of legislative powers will be negotiated at the political-level talks. The Centre and the state are trying to bargain and I will never let down the people of the Dooars and the Terai, Gurung said. He said people shouldnt listen to rumours that the two regions had been excluded from the interim set-up.         
	But he said it would not be easy to instantly incorporate all the Dooars and Terai areas the Morcha wants.

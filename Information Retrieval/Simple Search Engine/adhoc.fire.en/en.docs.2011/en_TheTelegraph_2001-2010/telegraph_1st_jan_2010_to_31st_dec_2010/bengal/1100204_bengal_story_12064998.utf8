The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Crowd thin, Mamata gives rally a miss
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Crowd thin, Mamata gives rally a miss
          BARUN GHOSH                          Mamata: Whats happening?                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 3: Power minister Mrinal Banerjees death today may have come handy for Mamata Banerjee to call off a poorly attended dharna at Esplanade and wriggle out of an embarrassing situation, Trinamul sources said.        
	The sit-in, to protest CPM-sponsored violence and killings, was to continue from 11 in the morning to seven in the evening. Mamata herself was to have addressed the gathering at 3.30 in the afternoon.        
	But it was the gathering that was the problem. Till late afternoon, the crowd was sparse, especially for a Trinamul programme in the city starring Mamata. The traffic, expected to be disrupted because of the turnout, was normal for a working day.        
	Suddenly at 3.30pm, exactly the time Mamata was scheduled to arrive at the venue, opposite Metro cinema, Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi announced that the programme was being cancelled as a mark of respect for the minister. The sparse crowd appeared bewildered.        
	Many Trinamul leaders confided later that the real reason for the cancellation was the fact that Mamata did not want to address such a thin crowd and hurt her image.        
	Why should Mamata cancel her party programme for the death of a CPM minister, especially since she didnt attend the funeral of even Jyoti Basu? said a Trinamul leader. She cancelled it when she learnt of the unexpectedly poor turnout. She had a ready excuse for that.        
	Trinamul leaders said todays dharna was crucial as it was meant to be the kick-off for the partys fortnight-long protests across the state.        
	Party insiders said that had the death been the reason for the cancellation, the announcement would have been made much earlier. The power minister died at 12.55pm.        
	But why the unusually poor turnout?        
	The blame game has just begun, but the principal culprit for the moment appears to be Madan Mitra, the president of the Trinamul youth wing who was in charge of organising the programme.        
	Mitra has apparently told his aides that it was a miscommunication that caused the blunder. He had assumed, Mitra has said, that Mamata had communicated to leaders of the adjoining districts to bring in the hordes and had, therefore, not done anything himself. In the end, no one took the initiative to bring the people and the rally turned out to be a damp squib.        
	For the record, Mitra said: People somehow got the impression that Mamata Banerjee would not be attending the rally so they did not turn up.        
	Other Trinamul leaders attributed todays flop show to Mitras overconfidence.        
	He was under the impression that leaders from the neighbouring districts would bring people to the rally on their own. But they had not been briefed properly, said an MP from East Midnapore.         
	Subhendu Adhikari, the state president of the Trinamul Youth Congress who would normally have attended the rally, did not do so apparently because he was not aware that he should be in the city today.        
	Recent successes have brought in complacency among the leaders, rued a Trinamul supporter.

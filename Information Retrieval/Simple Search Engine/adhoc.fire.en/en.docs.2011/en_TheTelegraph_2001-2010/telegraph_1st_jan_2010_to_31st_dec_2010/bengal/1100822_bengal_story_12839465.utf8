          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Aug. 21: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today said it would renew its agitation to press for the inclusion of the Dooars in the interim set-up for the hills but also put the onus of the struggle on the people of the Dooars.        
	Morcha chief Bimal Gurung said he would hold a public meeting at Jaigaon near the India-Bhutan border on August 29 where he would announce the agitation programme for the plains.         
	During an interactive session here today to discuss the interim arrangement, several Morcha supporters from the plains expressed fear that the Terai and the Dooars could be left out of the new set-up.         
	Gurung told them: Have I ever said that the Dooars and the Terai would be left out? Stop listening to rumours. The onus of the struggle (to ensure that the Dooars is included in the set-up) will lie with you people now. We want to see how desperately you want the area to be included in the new set-up.         
	He added: We have to think of solutions. If the state government and the Centre give it in writing that the Dooars and the Terai will be included in the set-up, we will think of accepting the arrangement, Gurung said.

	 Calcutta, July 27: Calcutta High Court today said examiners of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education should be more cautious while evaluating Madhyamik answer scripts.     
	Justice Dipankar Dutta said: One mark can change the entire career of a student. So, the examiners should be more attentive while evaluating the papers. The observation was made after it was found that a Burdwan student who was given 64 in his English paper had actually scored 69.

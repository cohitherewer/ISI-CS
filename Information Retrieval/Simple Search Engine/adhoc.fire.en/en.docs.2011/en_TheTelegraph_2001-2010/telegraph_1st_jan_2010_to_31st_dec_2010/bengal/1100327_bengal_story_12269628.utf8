The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Telephone claim a lie: Mamata
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Telephone claim a lie: Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 26: Mamata Banerjee virtually dubbed housing minister Gautam Deb a liar a day after he claimed to have spoken to her over the phone and got an assurance over a Trinamul Congress-backed land resistance.        
	What he said about me is a lie.... It was an attempt to get cheap publicity by claiming he had spoken to me, she said this evening without naming Deb.         
	The minister had said: I rang up Mamata Banerjee and discussed the problems regarding supply of electricity in some parts of Rajarhat. She assured me that she would look into the matter and get back to me after talking to the... leaders of Chhapna.        
	Hidco, chaired by Deb, had acquired the land at Chhapna in 2005, but it has failed to take possession of it because the majority of the 2,000-odd landlosers there have turned the mouza into a pocket of resistance with Trinamul support.        
	Deb tonight insisted that he was not telling lies about his telephone talk with Mamata. He said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday to make public the contents of my discussion with Mamata over the phone.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM claims Maoist kill
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Jan. 23: A suspected Maoist was killed today by armed CPM supporters in Salboni after the rebels attacked two villages this morning.        
	Police are yet to reach the spot in West Midnapore that is 30km from Lalgarh.        
	The villages  Bhursa and Damdiha  had been under the control of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. In December, CPM cadres put up an armed resistance against the rebels and started gaining ground.        
	A police officer at Salboni said that villagers had informed that a body of a Maoist action squad member was lying in the forest on the outskirts of Bhursa. The dead man is yet to be identified. The villagers claimed two more Maoists had been killed but their bodies were dragged away, the officer said.        
	A 900-strong team of joint forces this evening launched a raid in Goaltore, Salboni and Lalgarh based on information that Maoist leader Kishanji was hiding in the area. The area falls within the circle of domination of the joint forces who entered Lalgarh in June last year.

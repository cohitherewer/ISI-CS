	Jangipur (Murshidabad), Oct 31: Pranab Mukherjee today said roads cant be built in the sky, stressing the importance of land acquisition and adequate compensation, issues on which the Centre could not proceed as scheduled because of objections from Mamata Banerjee.        
	The Union finance minister assured villagers who have given up their land for the upgrade of NH34 of adequate compensation, relief and rehabilitation.         
	We assure not only adequate compensation but also relief and rehabilitation to land losers. The (central) government will also try to give a job to at least one member of each family giving land for the project. Land acquisition is important as roads cant be built in the sky, he said at Jangipur, after laying the foundation for the project. NH34 will be made a four-lane highway.        
	The two-laned NH34 connects Barasat in North 24-Parganas with Dalkhola in North Dinanjpur. Work will begin by adding two lanes to the 256km stretch between Behrampore and Dalkhola. Mukherjee said 680 hectares would be required for widening the entire highway.         
	The farmers whose land is being acquired will have to be compensated to the maximum. Economic development has to be about inclusive growth and not just statistical figures of 9-10 per cent growth, he said.        
	The minister went on: One of the paradigms of development has to be the empowerment of people. The thrust has to be on deciding what is the right entitlement. Land cant be just acquired. The acquisition has to be decided keeping in mind factors such as the rehabilitation package.         
	Mukherjee said the widening of NH34 would facilitate trade with neighbouring countries such as Nepal.         
	He said the Centre would soon come out with a package to adequately compensate land losers. Mukherjee could not give an exact date of announcement of the package because several legal and other considerations are there.         
	The Centres plans of implementing the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill has been hit by Mamatas opposition to it. On October 25, Mamata had skipped a meeting in Delhi to discuss the bill.        
	The bill says that if 70 per cent of landowners in an area agree to sell to a private entrepreneur, the government can acquire the balance 30 per cent at the same price and pass it on to the industrialist or miner.        
	Mamata is opposed to any state role in land acquisition for private industry. She also wants a clause that will force industrial buyers to return the acquired land if it is not used within five years.        
	Work to upgrade the stretch of NH34 between Behrampore and Dalkhola will be done by the Hindustan Construction Company in three phrases and is expected to be completed in two-and-a-half years.

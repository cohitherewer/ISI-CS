The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sources fail Maoist police

	Calcutta, April 25: Police have been asked to smarten up their act and intensify operations against Maoists after the guerrilla carnage in Dantewada. But the main hurdle for the force in Bengal is that the Maoists have so far proved smarter.        
	Worried after a series of futile raids in the forests near Lalgarh over the past two weeks, the police directorate in Calcutta has sent a directive to the forces in Midnapore to stitch up a stronger intelligence network.         
	On a number of occasions, the police have learnt about Maoist build-ups in different parts of West Midnapore and launched raids only to discover that the guerrillas had fled a couple of hours earlier.        
	The Maoists have put together a very effective counter-intelligence network, said West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma. Whenever we carry out raids, they seem to receive information about our movement in advance and flee.        
	On Wednesday, the secu-rity forces got a tip-off about Maoists camping deep inside the Bhulabheda forest in Belpahari. A contingent of 200 policemen from the Niguria and Jamtolgora camps set off immediately. When the police reached the spot, they only found telltale signs of Maoist presence like food packets and a clay oven.        
	It is obvious that the Maoists had been alerted that we were approaching in large numbers and they would be outgunned, said an officer who has participated in at least 20 search operations. It is this kind of counter-intelligence that is frustrating our efforts. They are managing to stay one step ahead of us.        
	The Maoists have their own intelligence network. Another instance of its success, an officer said, was seen early on Thursday when a massive force raided a fair on the outskirts of Jhargram town. The police detained about 30 people from the fairground but had to release all of them as they were local residents who had nothing to do with the Maoists. But, the police said, the villagers corroborated the information about Maoists having been at the fair.         
	Even during last months raid on Chhotopukuria village, when the police apparently had information about injured guerrilla Kishan having taken shelter there, the force arrived after the Maoists had left.         
	A haul of medicines from a makeshift pharmacy, apparently being run by the Maoists in a nearby forest, was all that the police got.        
	The police said they were paying villagers to ferret out information about the Maoists. The tribals are poor, so money is a major bait, an officer said. They are providing us with whatever they know.        
	But, by the polices own admission, the Maoists carrot and stick policy appears to be working better. On the one hand the Maoists are providing the villagers with rice procured forcibly at low prices from ration dealers and rich farmers. On the other, they are using fear as a tool to muzzle them.        
	The tribals know that if the Maoists come to know that they are parting with information about them to the police, they will have to pay for it with their lives, an officer said. So we are really in a fix.        
	It is this that is worrying the police brass and has prompted them to send the directive to the district police.

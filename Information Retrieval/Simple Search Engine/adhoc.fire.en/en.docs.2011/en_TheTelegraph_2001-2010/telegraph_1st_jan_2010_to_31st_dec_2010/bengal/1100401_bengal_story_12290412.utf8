	Midnapore, March 31: The principal of the DAV Public School inside the IIT Kharagpur campus and his wife were killed and their 14-year-old son was seriously injured when the car they were travelling in collided with a trailer truck on NH-6, about 22km from Jhargram.         
	Tarun Kumar Das, 47, and Swapna, 40, were killed on the spot. Their son, Devadutta, a Class VIII student of the same school, suffered brain injury and was initially taken to the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital by local people.         
	We referred the boy to a Calcutta hospital after we found he had suffered brain injury, said Partha Pradhan, the superintendent of the Midnapore hospital. Some teachers of the DAV school took the boy to the Calcutta hospital.        
	Police said the accident occurred around 9.30am at Balibhasa village in West Midnapore, about 40km from Kharagpur.        
	The Dasses were going to their ancestral home at Baleswar in Orissa, said Manoj Verma, the district superintendent of police. A police officer said the car was flung at least 10 feet away under the impact of the collision.        
	An eyewitness said Das, who was driving the car, was trying to overtake another vehicle. He did not notice the truck coming from the opposite direction, said A.K. Tripathi.        
	Tripathi, whose son is a classmate of Devadutta, said he ran towards the mangled car which seemed familiar.        
	I peeped through the smashed wind screen and recognised principal Das. Some villagers also came to the rescue, Tripathi said. The villagers pulled out the injured Devadutta through one of the rear doors.        
	We also pulled out the body of the woman (Swapna), said Vivek Mahato, a villager. The police arrived 15 minutes after the accident and extricated Dass body by opening the front door with gas cutters.

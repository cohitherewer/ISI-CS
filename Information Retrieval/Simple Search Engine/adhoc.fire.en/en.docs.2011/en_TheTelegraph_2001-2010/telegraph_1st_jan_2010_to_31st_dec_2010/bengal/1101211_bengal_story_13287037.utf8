                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Ex-soldier kills son
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            The boy Arghya and his father Dasarath Halder                                 
	Konnagar (Hooghly), Dec. 10: A retired army havildar in Hooghlys Konnagar who had fallen out with his wife battered their 11-year-old son to death and told her days later on phone to hurry up and go find the body.        
	Dasarath Haldar apparently killed Arghya, a Class VI student, several days back in his house and vanished, police said. The decomposed body, with a cricket bat lying next to it, was found in his bedroom last night.        
	We recovered Arghyas decomposed body. There was a cricket bat lying beside it, said officer-in-charge Atish Das.        
	The 45-year-old Dasarath, who took voluntary retirement six months ago, had been living separately from wife Falguni, a CRPF constable, for the past three years. We think the boy was killed several days ago, another officer said.        
	Falguni was posted in Jamshedpur and Arghya used to stay with his maternal grandmother, 500 metres from Dasaraths flat. Dasarath used to take Arghya to his flat for a few days and return him to his grandmother, said the officer.        
	Falguni had come to stay with her mother on December 1. The same day, Dasarath took his son away with him for a few days. When her son did not return for days, Falguni went to Dasaraths flat on Wednesday morning and found it locked. She then approached the police.        
	Yesterday, the lady told us that her husband had called her and told her he had killed their son. Falguni also told us that her husband asked her to hurry up and go find the body, said officer Das.        
	Subdivisional police officer K.P. Barui said Dasarath had possibly killed his son in a fit of rage. A hunt is on for Dasarath.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      College clash kills man on the way home
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Uttams mother Alo Banik. (Pranab Biswas)                                  
	Palta (North 24-Parganas), Jan. 15: A train hawker possibly mistaken for a Trinamul Congress worker because he was walking close to a party activist was shot dead today by suspected CPM-backed outsiders who landed in a Palta college during students elections which the Opposition won after 25 years.        
	A series of clashes ensued in which a Trinamul supporter took several dagger blows and five people had to be hospitalised.        
	Uttam Banik, 34, who sells childrens clothes and amlakis on trains, took a bullet in the chest on his way home from Palta station this afternoon.        
	Swapan Debnath, 22, who was walking beside him on the road leading to PN Das College, some 30km north of Calcutta, was attacked with daggers.         
	A local resident who knew Uttam said Swapan was a known Trinamul activist. But the attackers charged at him and Uttam shouting catch those Trinamul people. A man took out a pipe gun and shot at Uttam. As he fell, some of them hit Swapan repeatedly with daggers, said Sudip Das.        
	Police said the trouble started around 3.40pm with each party accusing the other of bringing outsiders to rig the polls. However, the Trinamul students wing was the first to complain to the police about outsiders violating prohibitory orders and assembling near the college.        
	The police drove away a group of 25 who picked out Swapan and Uttam on the retreat.        
	The CPM claimed Uttam was its supporter and alleged that Trinamul had killed him. They didnt realise they would win the polls. Thats why they were trying to create trouble. They killed our supporter Uttam, said Arup Ratan Dasgupta, a member of the North Barrackpore zonal committee.        
	Uttams father Raghunath Banik, 65, said his son had nothing to do with politics.         
	As the news of the attacks spread, Trinamul supporters clashed with their CPM rivals on the college campus.         
	Both parties had brought outsiders to the college. Four people were injured before the police used the baton to separate the warring groups.        
	Another clash took place at the nearby BN Bose Hospital where the injured were taken.        
	We are looking for the culprits, said district police chief Rahul Srivastava.        
	At PN Das College, the Trinamul-Congress combine won 34 of the 35 seats.        
	The CPM has called a 12-hour bandh tomorrow in Palta and Barrackpore II blocks.

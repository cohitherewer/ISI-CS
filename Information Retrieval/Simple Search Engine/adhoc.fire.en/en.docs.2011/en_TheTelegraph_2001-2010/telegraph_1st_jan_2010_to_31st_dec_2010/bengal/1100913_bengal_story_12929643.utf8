The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul eyes Rahul show
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul eyes Rahul show
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata and Rahul                                 
	Calcutta, Sept. 12: The Trinamul Congresss youth wing today announced a string of programmes in an apparent bid to counter the Congresss membership drive in the districts that will begin with Rahul Gandhis three-day trip to the state starting Tuesday.         
	State Trinamul Youth Congress president Subhendu Adhikari, who chaired the partys youth convention in West Midnapores Sabang today, said: Didi (Mamata Banerjee) has asked the youth wing to steer our partys anti-CPM programmes till December.         
	Trinamul sources said Adhikari had deliberately used Sabang for launching the partys programmes as it is state Congress chief Manas Bhuniyas constituency. Bhuniya had won the Sabang Assembly constituency in 2006 by a margin of 6,000 votes.        
	Subhendus aim was to throw a challenge to Bhuniya who claims to have better organisational clout in Sabang, a Trinamul secretary said.        
	Several Youth Congress members were present at the Trinamul event today, Adhikari claimed. We hope to involve more youths from like-minded parties in our anti-CPM movement, he said.        
	Madan Mitra, the all-India Trinamul Youth Congress president, said some of the partys programmes would run parallel to those of the Congresss.        
	He said the youth wing of his party had convened an emergency meeting of its office bearers at Trinamul Bhavan in Topsia on September 14, the day Rahul begins his three-day trip by touring Birbhum, North 24-Parganas and Calcuttas Garden Reach.         
	On September 16, when the AICC general secretary is scheduled to address a convention of the Congresss Scheduled Caste workers at West Midnapores Garbeta, Trinamul will organise a demonstration in Jhargram in the same district.         
	Trinamul sources said the party, desperate not to yield any political space to the Congress in the state, had apparently planned the programmes in such a way that it coincided with the events Rahul is going to address.         
	Bhuniya evaded questions on the issue. It is Trinamuls internal matter, he said.        
	However, state Congress sources said the Trinamul programmes during Rahuls visit would embarrass us.         
	Sonia visit        
	Sonia Gandhi is likely to defer her visit to Calcutta on September 25 by a month, Pranab Mukherjee has reportedly told state Congress leaders. The Congress president will be preoccupied as the verdict of the Babri Masjid demolition case will be announced on September 24.

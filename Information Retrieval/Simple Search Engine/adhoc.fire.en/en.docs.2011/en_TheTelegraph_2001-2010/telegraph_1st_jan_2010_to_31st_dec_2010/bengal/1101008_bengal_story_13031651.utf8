          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Oct. 7: Suspected Maoists last night shot dead a primary school teacher who had come to visit his family in his native West Midnapore village which he had fled a year ago to avoid rebel coercion.         
	Gurucharan Mahato, 54, the teacher-in-charge at a primary school at Bagmari village in Sankrail, was allegedly dragged out of his house in Chhotoparulia by a group of 60 Maoists, beaten up and shot dead on a road 3km from his home. Bows and arrows and some slippers were found near the dead body.         
	The teacher had come to Chhotoparulia, around 25km from Jhargram town, to spend Mahalaya (today) with his wife and younger son.         
	The rebels left behind posters accusing Gurucharan, a CPM branch committee member, of being a police informer.        
	A year ago, Gurucharan had fled Chhotoparulia with his elder son Jyotirmoy, 20, fearing he might be killed by the Maoists. He rented a house close to his school in Bagmari, 30km from Chhotoparulia. Gurucharans wife Nilima stayed back in Chhotoparulia with their younger son Biman.         
	Even though Gurucharan stayed away from his home, Peoples Committee activists used to regularly call him and ask him to attend their processions and meetings.         
	Chhotoparulia is less than 2km from Bankshol, the native village of slain Maoist leader Umakanto Mahato. Umakanto, the prime accused in the Jnaneswari Express sabotage case, was killed during an encounter with the joint forces on August 27.         
	The rebels had a strong presence in Chhotoparulia till Umakantos death.         
	Gurucharans wife Nilima said: My husband came home yesterday morning. After having dinner with us, he went out to relieve himself. He went missing after that.         
	However, the police said Nilima was too scared to give the exact details of her husbands death.

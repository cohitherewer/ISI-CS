The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata sets Lalgarh date
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata sets Lalgarh date
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                          Mamata                                  
	Singur, Sept. 25: Mamata Banerjee today said she would visit Lalgarh again on October 5 and announced the Trinamul Congress would observe a black day on October 2 when the chief minister addresses a rally in Midnapore town.         
	At a rally in Singur to mark the launch of her anti-land acquisition movement there four years ago, Mamata said: I will visit Lalgarh on October 5. We have been saying repeatedly that the CPM is using the joint forces to recapture one village after another in and around Lalgarh. CPM cadres are using guns and goons for this purpose.        
	The Trinamul chief had addressed a rally in Lalgarh on August 9.        
	She claimed the CPM rally that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would address was being organised to celebrate the recapture.        
	We will observe the day the CPM organises the victory rally as a black day. This person (Bhattacharjee) will visit Midnapore to celebrate his partys armed recapture of villages, she said.        
	The chief minister had announced on Thursday that he would visit Midnapore town to address a party gathering and urge the people to build up resistance against the Maoist-Trinamul nexus.        
	Mamata today iterated her demand for the withdrawal of the joint forces from Jungle Mahal. She said she would wait for two to three days and then send a delegation to Delhi to press for the withdrawal.        
	The CPM will go underground once the joint forces are withdrawn. Why should the joint forces be there in Lalgarh when they are no longer needed? Mamata said.        
	She alleged the CPM had moved the police into Nandigram before its armed recapture by the cadres. She accused the party of using paramilitary personnel in Jungle Mahal to recapture villages.         
	I have requested the Prime Minister and the Union home minister to withdraw the forces, she said.         
	Ridiculing the CPM, Mamata said the party had branded her a Maoist but did not mind visiting the house of separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani in Kashmir.        
	I am for discussions with them (the Maoists). They are our countrymen. But then, I am branded a Maoist, she said. Without naming politburo member Sitaram Yechury, Mamata said: What happens when CPM leaders visit Geelanis house? When they visit the house of a person who supports the interests of another country, what should they be called? Leninbadi, khaobadi? she said.                    WITH INPUTS FROM UTTAM DUTTA

	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre to deal with the problems of workers of closed and sick tea gardens, including those in Bengal, within six months.        
	NGO International Union of Food had filed a petition in the apex court in 2004, saying garden owners owed around Rs 300 crore to more than 30,000 tea workers. The hospitals and schools in the tea gardens had also been shut down, denying the workers access to basic healthcare facilities and education.        
	The court has asked the Centre to invoke the Tea Act, 1953, which states that the government can sell tea gardens to clear the dues of the workers. The Centre can also take over closed and sick gardens under the act.

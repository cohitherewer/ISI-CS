          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Malda, Sept. 18: A car carrying the Congress chief of a panchayat samiti in Malda allegedly mowed down four people before the drunken driver tried to flee by ploughing through carts that villagers had lined up to block his escape route.         
	Police said Abul Kasem, the chief of Harishchandrapur-II panchayat samiti, was returning home to Degun village around 9 last night when driver Dhananjoy Moholadar lost control. The car ploughed into five people chatting beside the Bhaluka-Tulsihatta state highway in Balapathar village.         
	Bhuban Mondal, the Malda superintendent of police, said Dhananjoy was drunk.        
	The car sped off towards Degun as Mostaq Alam, 35, Abdul Bari, 28, Din Mohammad, 40, Mozammel Haque, 45, and Ahmed Hussain lay in a pool of blood on the road. Local people took them to hospital where Alam, Bari, Mohammad and Haque died. Hussain is being treated at another hospital in Bihars Purnea.        
	After the local people failed to stop the car, they called up acquaintances in Degun. The residents of Degun blocked the approach road to the village with carts and waited for Kasems car.         
	However, Dhananjoy banged his car into the carts and tried to speed away but villagers threw stones and stopped the vehicle.         
	The driver was dragged out of the car, roughed up and handed over to the police. The mob, however, did not harm Kasem after recognising him.

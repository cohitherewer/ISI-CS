The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Land protest relief for Mamata
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Land protest relief for Mamata
  - Villagers soften stance          A STAFF REPORTER                          A payloader at work on the rail land. (Gopal Senapati)                                        
	Howrah, Dec. 8: Trinamul Congress supporters who stopped the levelling of a rail plot acquired in Howrah in 1981 demanding higher compensation and jobs have decided to allow the work to continue while sticking to their demands.        
	The apparent softening of stance followed a meeting last night, hours after the agitation at the site in Bhagabatipur in Sankrail, between the local Trinamul MLA and the protesters. A railway engineer was also present during the discussions.        
	Sital Sardar, the Sankrail MLA, tried to reason with the agitators and held out the prospect of job opportunities if they allowed the Mamata Banerjee-led railways to use the 630-acre land for a coach factory as planned.        
	Members of the Save Farmland Committee, which is leading the protests, were part of the meeting with Sardar in a local school last night. Today, they said they would allow work to continue but, at the same time, stick to their demands.         
	Sardar is also said to have told the protesters that within a couple of months, Mamata would lay the foundation of the factory. But at the same time, he pointed a finger at CPM agents for the trouble.        
	Local people are not opposed to the setting up of the coach factory. But there are some CPM agents instigating people to stop the work. I told them that job opportunities would automatically come after the factory is set up. The villagers then agreed to allow the levelling of the land to continue, Sardar said today.        
	The MLA appeared to echo Mamata, who had alleged yesterday that outsiders were behind the row. But she had also said that the factory would come up only if the local people wanted it.         
	 Trinamul leader Ashis Malik, who is also the secretary of the Save Farmland Committee, said today: We realised that if the coach factory is set up, local people will get jobs. So we decided to allow work to go on. But we will stick to our demands.

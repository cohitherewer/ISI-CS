The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Medic dead in ransacked quarters 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Medic dead in ransacked quarters 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, Sept. 22: A state health department pharmacist was found dead today in his Purulia quarters that was ransacked.         
	A neighbour found Hemanta Singha Roy, 48, who worked at the Babugram primary health centre in Raghunathpur, lying dead in a pool of blood on the floor of his bedroom. Singha Roy had injuries on his head.        
	D. Bhattacharya, the subdivisional police officer of Raghunathpur, said: The house, inside the health centre compound, had been broken into late last night. The victim was hit on the head with a blunt object, probably a shovel or a rod, when he possibly tried to resist.         
	Arun Chatterjee, a BSNL employee, said he was passing by Singha Roys quarters at 7.30am when he saw the door open. I called out for Singha Roy but got no reply. I entered the house and found his body lying on the floor near the bed. There was a deep wound on the back of his head, Chatterjee said.        
	The mosquito net seemed to be in place, which suggests he must have got up in the night. However, the room had been ransacked, he added.        
	The police said Singha Roys cellphone and some other items were missing.         
	The pharmacist had been working at the health centre for the past 15 years. Singha Roy also used to examine patients and prescribed medicines in the absence of doctors. Local people said he was very popular as he used to attend to patients even if he was called late in the night.        
	His wife and two daughters live in Calcutta where the girls study, said Salil Karmakar, a local Trinamul Congress leader. The Singha Roys are constructing a house in Calcutta, he added.         
	Bhattacharya visited the murder spot with the circle inspector and the officer in charge of Raghunathpur police station. Sniffer dogs were also brought. The dogs led the police to a nearby pond. The cops fished out a briefcase belonging to Singha Roy from the pond.         
	He was not known to keep valuables in his house. We are investigating whether he was murdered because of any personal enmity, a police officer said. Chatterjee claimed outsiders had murdered the pharmacist.        
	Over 3,000 people from Babugram and neighbouring areas blocked the Raghunathpur-Santaldih state highway for two hours from 10am, demanding that the killers be arrested.

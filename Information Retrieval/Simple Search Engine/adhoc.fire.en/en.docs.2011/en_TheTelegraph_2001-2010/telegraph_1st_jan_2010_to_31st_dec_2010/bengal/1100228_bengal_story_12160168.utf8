The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Suspicion of several killers
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Suspicion of several killers
                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 27: The manner in which 58-year-old Sudha Devi Singhania was killed in her Kankurgachhi flat suggests three or four people were involved, police said today.        
	A post-mortem put the time of her death between 3.30 and 4.30 yesterday afternoon and confirmed strangulation as the cause. We believe there was more than one person involved, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.         
	The familys domestic help from Begusarai in Bihar, and his father, who works in a neighbouring building, are missing along with the Singhanias cash and jewellery. Rajendra, 20, the help who had joined the Singhanias only on February 2, had initially been the polices only suspect.        
	But the way the crime was committed has led them to suspect the involvement of more. Before being strangled Sudha Devis face had been wrapped with four saris, possibly to muffle her screams. Her hands and feet were tied and a blanket was placed below her feet, possibly to lessen the sound of her thrashing around. Its unlikely that such an elaborate plan would have been carried out by one man, a cop said.

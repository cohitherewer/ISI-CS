          ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR                          Adityas wife Soma in front of his picture. (Telegraph picture)                                  
	Nandigram, Nov. 1: On November 10, 2007, Soma Bera saw her husband for the last time. That was shortly before he got hit by a bullet, allegedly fired by a CPM cadre, and was carried away in a van.         
	Aditya Bera, a retired army subedar, is one of nine supporters of the Trinamul Congress-backed Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee who have been missing since the CPM recaptured Nandigram on November 10, 2007, eight months after 14 people were killed in police firing there.        
	Family members of the missing people said the state government should come to their aid and pay them compensation. We are struggling to make ends meet, Soma said.        
	Aditya, who was 57 when he went missing, had taken voluntary retirement in 1997.         
	My husband had joined a procession of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee near Tekhali bridge. Suddenly, a group of CPM cadres from Khejuri started hurling bombs and firing shots at the procession. One of our relatives saw my husband getting hit by a bullet and being carried away in a van, Soma said.        
	Soma said Aditya used to get a monthly pension of Rs 9,500. He had bought a trekker for our elder son Purnendu who used to ferry passengers between Tekhali and Nandigram in it. However, a few days before the CPMs armed recapture, some cadres raided our house and damaged the car.         
	Soma said that since Adityas disappearance, Purnendu had been supporting the family by driving a rental agencys cars. But he earns only around Rs 2,000 a month. He is struggling to provide us with two meals a day, Soma said.        
	Six months ago, Purnendu had written to the chief minister describing his familys condition and seeking financial assistance. However, we are yet to receive a reply. I need money to repair my trekker. I need money for my two sons education, Purnendu said.        
	He said local Trinamul leaders had come to his house before the panchayat polls and promised to arrange for money to buy a new trekker. They had also promised job for my wife. However, after the polls, they have forgotten us.        
	Purnendu said he had approached the Trinamul leaders several times. But they have asked me to wait till 2011, when they said they would come to power in the state.         
	Subal Majhi, a fisherman who had been with Aditya in the procession, has also been missing since November 10.         
	When the procession, held to protest the CPMs attempts at recapturing Nandigram, was moving towards Tekhali, CPM cadres started firing. Several villagers were injured. Some neighbours told me my husband was hit by a bullet, said Subals wife Krishna.         
	Poverty has since forced Krishna to discontinue her elder daughter Shefalis studies and send her to Delhi to work as a domestic help.

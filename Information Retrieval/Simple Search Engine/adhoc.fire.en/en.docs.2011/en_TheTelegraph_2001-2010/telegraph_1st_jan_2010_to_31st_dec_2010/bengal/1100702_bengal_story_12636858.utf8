The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist link to murder: CID
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoist link to murder: CID
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Ananda Das        
	Calcutta, July 1: Maoists may have been involved in the murder of former CPM MLA Ananda Das, the CID said today.        
	The CID said in a report it had prepared on the murder that a group of three to four Maoists could have mingled with the alleged Trinamul Congress supporters who shot Das dead.        
	Three to four persons in the mob played a key role in Dass murder. We suspect that these men were Maoists, a CID officer said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today told a Left Front delegation in his Assembly chamber that the CID would probe Dass murder.        
	In its report, the CID, which investigates all high-profile murders in the state, said the Maoists were spreading their network in Birbhum. The report also claimed that the rebels were planning to drive out the CPM from the district with the help of other mainstream political parties.        
	The Maoists are lending a helping hand to people and political parties that are opposed to the Left Front rule in the state. They have already taken a number of CPM men, who were either unhappy with the party or had been shunned by the Left, into confidence. The rebels plan to use these people to execute their strategies, the officer said.        
	The CID said the Maoists Birbhum-Burdwan-Murshidabad zonal committee had created a mass base in Birbhums Nanoor, Khoirashol and Dubrajpur. We suspect that Barun Sur and Madhai Patra, both members of the committee, played a key role in Dass murder, a CID officer said.         
	The officer said Maoists had played a major role in the agitation in 2007 against corrupt ration dealers in Birbhum and Burdwan in which two people were killed. In Nandigram too, they had joined hands with the Trinamul Congress in the agitation against land acquisition.

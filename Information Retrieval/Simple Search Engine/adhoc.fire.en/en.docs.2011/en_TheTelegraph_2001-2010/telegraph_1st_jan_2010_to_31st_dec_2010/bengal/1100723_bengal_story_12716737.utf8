          OUR BUREAU                          Pankaj Dutta, the CIDs special inspector-general, at Sainthia station on Thursday. (Soumi Bhattacharya)                                        
	Calcutta, July 22: The CID, which is probing the train tragedy at Sainthia, will send the viscera samples of the driver and the assistant driver of the Uttar Banga Express to AIIMS in Delhi for precise and correct results.        
	Police and several railway officials believe that M.C. Dey and Nirmal Mandal, both of whom were killed when their train rammed into the Vananchal Express on July 19, may have been drugged.         
	It is very important that we get the correct results, an officer investigating the case said. It appears that neither of the two drivers made any attempt to stop the train, he added.        
	The police have also asked for the trains speed recorder to verify the exact speed at which the Uttar Banga Express had entered Sainthia station. A senior railway official said it was being probed whether the signalling system and the Uttar Banga Expresss brakes were functioning properly.

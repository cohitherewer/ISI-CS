	Khandaghosh (Burdwan), Oct. 6: For the Mandals of Burdwans Naricha village, the Puja festivities will begin on Navami this year.        
	The family had abandoned its Puja last year after a clash before shandhi puja on Ashtami claimed a life.         
	The wreckage the clash had left in its wake have not been touched. The damaged idol will be fixed, the broken utensils, which still lie strewn on the mandap, will be replaced and the Pujas will begin from where it had been called off last year.        
	The family will offer a symbolic puja in front of a ghot (earthen pitcher) for Saptami and Ashtami.         
	An officer of the local police station said that last year, a group of allegedly drunk villagers from Dharmarajtala, in another corner of Naricha, had assembled in front of the Mandals chandimandap, where the Puja was being held, and started bursting crackers. Ashtami puja had just ended and preparations were being made for shandhi puja.        
	The Mandals were playing Bengali songs over loudspeakers when the villagers from Dharmarajtala started bursting crackers. When the Mandals protested, the villagers said they would stop only if the loudspeakers were switched off, the officer said.        
	What started as an altercation snowballed into a clash with sticks and rods, he added.         
	Susanta Dhara, 26, a Naricha resident who was pandal-hopping, was beaten to death allegedly by the Mandals during the clash. The residents of Dharmarajtala then ransacked the chandimandap and threw stones at the idols.        
	Dharas wife Alaka had lodged an FIR against 16 members of the Mandal family. The Mandals had lodged an FIR against 10 Dharmarajtala residents, accusing them of killing Dhara and vandalising the mandap.         
	The Mandals have kept the chandimandap locked since then as a mark of protest.         
	We still feel horrified when we remember what happened last year. Our Puja is 500 years old. We have been organising the Puja for 29 generations and such a thing was unprecedented, said Bibhuti Bhusan Mandal, 99, the eldest member of the family.         
	Another member of the family, Dayamoy, 40, said: We were so shocked that we had decided not to continue with the Pujas last year. The miscreants had damaged the idol, throw away utensils and ransacked the chandimandap. This year, we will begin the festivities with sandhi puja. We will keep the old idol and immerse it after Dashami.         
	Aloka, 22, said she wanted her husbands killers to be arrested. The Pujas have no meaning for me. What was my husbands fault?

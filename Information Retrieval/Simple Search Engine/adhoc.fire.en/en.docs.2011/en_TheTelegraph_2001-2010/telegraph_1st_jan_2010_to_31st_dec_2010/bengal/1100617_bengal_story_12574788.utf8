          OUR BUREAU                                                        Cops come out of the forest (in the background) with the slain Maoists after the encounter. Picture by Samir Mondal    
	June 16: A change in strategy helped police score their biggest success against the Maoists since Operation Lalgarh began on June 18 last year.        
	Officers said two factors contributed to the heavy toll they managed to inflict. First, was the pinpointed tip-off about the guerrillas.        
	Second, and more crucial, was the change of strategy  the decision to swoop down on the forest last night itself, instead of waiting till daybreak like they often did.        
	The police brass said at Writers Buildings it was the decision to conduct the raid at night that lent a surprise element to the offensive and caught the Maoists off-guard.         
	Normally, the Maoists are always on their guard, an officer said. But the police have rarely ventured into a forest at night, which appears to have made them complacent. Given the pattern of police response in the past, the Maoists were not expecting them at night.        
	Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh echoed this. Three things really helped, he told The Telegraph. The pinpointed information, the tactical decision and the planning, and finally the surprise element that this led to.         
	He added to the list a fourth factor  the bravery of the force.        
	Police sources said they normally did not venture into forests at night because of the fear of traps. During the day, we can carefully examine the environs, an officer said.         
	However, an exception was made last night because the source was very confident about his information. Additionally, we felt the gain from the surprise element would outweigh the greater risks.        
	So far, the Maoist intelligence network had proved better oiled than the polices. The rebels always stayed a step ahead of raiding police teams. But that machinery, run by ordinary villagers, failed them this time, also possibly because of the timing of the raid.                         Some of the arms seized on Wednesday. (Samir Mondal)      
	In the dead of night, everyone was fast asleep and that helped keep the raid a secret. The police only spoke to their contacts in the villages along the way.        
	Usually, the police come to know about Maoist groups very late and they flee by the time the personnel reach. This time, the information reached them well in advance.        
	An officer said an element of luck could not be denied. The Maoists had been camping at Duli for a month and not a word had got to the police about them until a few days ago. It means that their stranglehold of fear over the villagers is still very much present.        
	The confirmation of the guerrillas presence at Ranja forest came last night. The police activated their sources following some Maoist telephone intercepts. But for the intercepts, we wouldnt have known about their presence in the area, the officer said.        
	Once tipped off, the crucial difference from other occasions was the night raid.

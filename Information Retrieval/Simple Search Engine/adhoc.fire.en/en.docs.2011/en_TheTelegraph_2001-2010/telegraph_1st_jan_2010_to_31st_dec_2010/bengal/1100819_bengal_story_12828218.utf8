          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata in Calcutta on Wednesday. Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 18: Mamata Banerjee today gave her Lalgarh peace initiative a wider perspective aimed at blunting criticism, saying her call for negotiations with Maoists was on the same lines as an appeal by the Centre. She said her comments on slain rebel leader Azad were made in her capacity as a party chief.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief said she would give her opinion if the Maoists wanted discussions with her. She also stood by her demand for a probe into the encounter death of Azad.         
	At the August 9 Lalgarh rally, Mamata had implored the Maoists to lay down their arms and come to the talks table. She had also requested the Centre to withdraw the joint forces once the talks began.        
	Today, before leaving for Delhi to participate in the monsoon session of Parliament, Mamata said: I am sticking to what I had said in Lalgarh. Whatever I said was in my capacity as a party chief. I will go to Lalgarh again. I prefer an amicable and peaceful settlement to the Lalgarh problem and that should happen through negotiations with them (Maoists).         
	Discussions are needed to prevent bloodbath. It is also in the interest of our countrys security, she added.        
	I have seen media reports saying that they (Maoists) want to discuss the matter with me. If that is so, I will give my opinion, she added.        
	In Delhi, home ministry officials dismissed a purported ceasefire offer by the Maoists as a gimmick. A highly placed source said the ministry did not expect the Maoists to come to the negotiation table for another six months to a year.        
	Mamata said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pratibha Patil had also made appeals for peace and talks, and that her call was on the same lines.        
	I think discussions are necessary. The Prime Minister and the President have made appeals. However, I will have to cross-check with the government what they want to do. There is a separate ministry in the government dealing with these affairs, she added.        
	At the Lalgarh rally, the Trinamul chief had said that whatever had happened to Azad was not right, speaking after Swami Agniveshs allegation that the Maoist leader was killed in a false encounter.         
	Mamata today said the CPM was breaking the law in Lalgarh by setting up camps full of guns and goons.        
	CPM leader Mohammad Salim said Mamata was collaborating with the Maoists. How can a collaborator be a mediator? She must make her stand clear first. We also want the Prime Minister to come out with the governments stand on talks, he said.

	Calcutta, April 11: Aligarh Muslim Universitys Murshidabad campus will start working this July from two rented premises near Farakka, about 260km from Calcutta.        
	We will admit students for the 2010-11 session in our undergraduate and postgraduate courses in management, law and education, vice-chancellor P.K. Abdul Azis said in Calcutta. Three buildings have been identified at Ahiran and Dhuliyan, 20km from each other.         
	Around 300 acres belonging to Farakka Barrage has been identified at Ahiran for the main campus but the land is yet to be handed over. The VC will meet the chief minister tomorrow to request him to expedite the process. Once the land is ours, we will get Rs 25 crore from Delhi, he said.

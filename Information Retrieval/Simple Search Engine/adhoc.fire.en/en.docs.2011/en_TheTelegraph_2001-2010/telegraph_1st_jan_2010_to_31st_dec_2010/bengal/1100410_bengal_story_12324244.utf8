          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, April 9: A mother allegedly poisoned her two daughters and committed suicide in a Murshidabad village because she and her husband were finding it difficult to get a groom for the dark and not good-looking older girl.        
	Only yesterday, the family of a prospective groom had turned down farmer Joydeb Dass proposal for 19-year-old Tanushree, though he was willing to give Rs 50,000 besides furniture and jewellery as dowry. We couldnt find a groom for Tanushree in the past six months because she was dark and not good-looking. No one agreed to marry my daughter even after my dowry offer, a distraught Joydeb said today.        
	He found the three frothing at the mouth when he returned to his mud hut from his field around 10am. Two cups with dregs of tea in them were beside the girls, said Somnath Banerjee, officer in charge of Burwan, 250km from Calcutta. An empty pesticide bottle was lying next to the mother.        
	Rekha is suspected to have mixed pesticide in the tea for her daughters Tanushree and Tumpa, 16, after Joydeb left home for his 1.5-acre plot where he is growing the boro crop.         
	Five proposals had been rejected. Joydeb and his wife used to be very depressed, the OC said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Durgapur, Nov. 29: Dabangg was back with many a bang (of gunshots) and had several sleep-deprived souls scrambling for Zandu Balm and police.        
	A group of businessmen with alleged links to coal smugglers fired in the air and danced to decibel-defying chartbusters in a drunken frenzy at a wedding reception in a Durgapur hotel that continued late into the night.        
	Neighbourhood residents, who could not sleep because of the loud music and the gunshots, sought police help. But by the time the police arrived, the revellers had left.         
	Employees of the hotel in Durgapurs upscale City Centre said that around 12.30am today, when most of the guests had left, three businessmen started firing in the air with a double-barrelled gun and a revolver.        
	The group of three, all Durgapur and Ranigunj residents, were among the 1,000 guests at the party, held around the hotel swimming pool. The trio have links with the local coal mafia, an employee said.        
	A waiter said: The three men were dancing to Munni badnaam hui, Darling tere liye (from the Salman Khan-starrer Dabangg) with a few others. Suddenly, one of the trio rushed to the edge of the pool and started firing in the air.         
	Another man pulled out a revolver from his pocket and also began firing in the air. He was holding a glass of whisky in his left hand.        
	The waiter said the third businessman was so drunk that he lost his balance and fell into the pool. He said he was serving alcohol that the revellers had brought with them. But when they started firing, I felt frightened.        
	Several residents of the neighbourhood said they could not sleep because of the loud Hindi and Bhojpuri songs being played for hours. The gunshots so late in the night led to panic in the area.         
	A homemaker who lives in Cement Park Colony, opposite the hotel, said: Initially, I thought someone was bursting crackers at the party. But when I went to the balcony, I sensed something was wrong.        
	Another resident said he had developed a headache because the songs did not let him sleep.        
	An employee of a neighbouring hotel said some of the guests there complained about the loud noise at the dead of night. They got scared after hearing the gunshots, the executive said.        
	Kabi Dutta, the managing director and owner of Hotel Citi Residenci, where the party was organised, said: I rushed to the hotel after being told by the police around 12.45am that somebody had opened fire there. I had rented out the swimming pool and the adjacent space to a Ranigunj-based businessman for the wedding reception.        
	Dutta said he had no clue the guests would bring guns to the party. The businessman had also booked all the rooms at my hotel for his guests.        
	Joy Biswas, the subdivisional police officer, said the police went to the hotel after being informed that people with links to coal smugglers were attending the wedding ceremony.        
	But they fled before we reached the hotel. We are investigating the case and will interrogate the hotel owner, he added.

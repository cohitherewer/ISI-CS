The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul cow dung attack on CPM leader
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul cow dung attack on CPM leader
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Aloke Bhattacharya, his face smeared with dung, in Kanksa on Saturday.   (Gour Sharma)                          
	Durgapur, July 10: A group of Trinamul Congress supporters allegedly beat up a CPM leader and smeared his face with cow dung in Burdwans Kanksa today when he tried to pacify the group, which was demonstrating in front of a project site.         
	The Trinamul supporters had held up work at the Izzatgunj site, where a fire station is being built, demanding jobs.         
	When Aloke Bhattacharya, a CPM zonal committee member and Burdwan zilla parishad functionary, went to the site this morning to request the Trinamul supporters to withdraw the agitation, they allegedly beat him up.         
	The agitators started beating me without any provocation. Some of them even smeared cow dung on my face, Bhattacharya said.         
	Local CPM supporters rushed to the spot after hearing the news. The two sides threw stones at each other. Police arrived at the spot after some time and chased away the two groups with sticks. Two of the accused have been arrested.        
	The fire station is being built by the Burdwan zilla parishad as there is no such facility in Kanksa. The nearest fire station is in Durgapur, which is 30km away. The zilla parishad has assigned private contractors, who have engaged labourers.         
	Local Trinamul leaders alleged that only CPM supporters were getting jobs as the party was funding the project.        
	Our supporters are not getting jobs. The CPM is losing its foothold here and hence is trying to regain support by offering jobs, alleged Pallab Banerjee, the Trinamul Congresss youth wing president in Kanksa block.

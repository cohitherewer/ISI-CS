The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Deepak sings but gives aides time to flee
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Deepak sings but gives aides time to flee
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 6: Four city contacts of Maoist top gun Telugu Deepak have given police the slip in the past 24 hours.        
	Sources said CID sleuths raided suspected hideouts in Muraripukur, Beliaghata, Dum Dum, Sodepur, Kharda, Barasat, Jadavpur and Behala  areas in the city and on its fringes  but found nothing.         
	Deepak proved a hard nut to crack. He started disclosing the names and whereabouts of his contacts three days after his arrest and after round-the-clock interrogation. We immediately raided the spots but the contacts had had enough time to escape, an officer said.        
	Deepak was arrested from a bus stop in Sarsuna, Behala, on March 2.        
	We were aware of the names Deepak mentioned. They are attached to the Maoists frontal organisations and have been working in various parts of the city, an officer said.        
	The police said they knew almost all those working for the Maoists in the guise of running frontal organisations. We were waiting for evidence against them. Deepaks statement would have been enough for us to be able to grill at least four of them. He also told us about some young men and women from Jadavpur who organised camps in Haripur, East Midnapore, on behalf of the Maoists, said an officer of the intelligence branch who questioned Deepak, the Maoists guerrilla wing chief in Bengal.        
	Deepak has allegedly confessed he had supervised the 2006 murder of Rabi Kar, a Purulia zilla parishad member, and his wife Anandamoyee.

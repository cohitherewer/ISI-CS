The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Meet challenge to Mamata 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Meet challenge to Mamata 
          OUR BUREAU                          Mamata                                  
	Jan. 14: The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities has said it will hold a rally in West Midnapore tomorrow to counter Mamata Banerjees public meeting in Jhargram.        
	Mamata Banerjee has insulted us by criticising Chhatradhar Mahato, the spearhead of our Lalgarh movement. We will bring truckloads of people from Binpur, Salboni, Lalgarh and Belpahari for our rally tomorrow, said Asit Mahato, a leader of the Peoples Committee that is backed by the Maoists. Our main objective is to scuttle Mamatas Trinamul rally in Jhargram.         
	Last Saturday, a miffed Mamata had said during a news conference: Who is Chhatradhar Mahato? He is the CPMs creation.        
	She had also made it clear that the party did not endorse Trinamul MP Kabir Sumans songs on Chhatradhar.         
	Mamata, who was to hold a rally in Midnapore town on January 4, cancelled it at the last moment keen to keep her distance from the Maoists who were bent on attending the event.        
	The Peoples Committee refused to reveal where in West Midnapore the outfit would hold the rally. We will not disclose the venue, Asit Mahato said.         
	The Peoples Committee has stuck posters on tree trunks in Jhargram demanding Mamatas apology for insulting Chhatradhar Mahato.         
	Told about the tribal outfits plan for the rally tomorrow, Mamata said in Calcutta that she would hold the rally in Jhargram, no matter what the Peoples Committee said.        
	Asked to comment on the committees whip to tribals in junglemahal not to attend her rally, she said: I dont know what others are saying about the rally. My sole purpose is to address the problems of the people in that area.        
	Mamata also said: They (the Maoists) could initiate a dialogue with the Union home minister after shunning violence.         
	Trinamul leaders in West Midnapore have planned to bring people from areas that are not Maoist-infested.         
	Maoists kill one        
	Armed Maoists today shot dead Barin Sarkar, a Jharkhand Janmukti Morcha leader.

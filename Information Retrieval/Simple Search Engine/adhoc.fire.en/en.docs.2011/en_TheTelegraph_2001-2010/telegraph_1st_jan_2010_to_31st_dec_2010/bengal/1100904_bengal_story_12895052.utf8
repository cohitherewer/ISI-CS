                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Appeal to Rahul
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 3: The state Congress today said it would request Rahul Gandhi when he visited Bengal on Monday to prevail on the Centre to ask the Bengal government to seize illegal arms from people irrespective of their political colour.        
	We will tell Rahulji about our grave concern over the stockpiling of arms by CPM cadres, state Congress president Manas Bhuniya told reporters.        
	Bhuniya said: We would welcome a state government drive against members of the Opposition were they to be found in possession of illegal arms.        
	The state Congress chief said the party had sent a memorandum to Union home minister P. Chidambaram, requesting him to ensure the quick recovery of illegal arms by the state government. Unless illegal arms are recovered, the CPM might use them in the run-up to next years Assembly polls, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Politics focus, not civic score
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Politics focus, not civic score
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 28: The Left Front will rely less on civic issues and more on price rise, unemployment and the Maoist-Mamata nexus for the municipal polls because of their political significance before next years Assembly elections.         
	Releasing the front manifesto, chairman Biman Bose today described the May 30 municipal polls as a political struggle and stressed the need for a political campaign against the Centres anti-people policies.         
	At a recent closed-door workshop to fine-tune strategies for the campaign, industries minister and CPM politburo member Nirupam Sen is learnt to have referred to last years Siliguri Municipal Corporation polls to point out that the Left lost the board despite good civic work.         
	This result underlined the changes in the overall political mood and we have to fight it politically by keeping tabs on the peoples pulse, a CPM state secretariat member said.         
	The CPM and its allies find price rise a potent plank to try and regain their lost ground among urban poor and middle classes, especially after what they dub the success of yesterdays general strike.         
	We will tell the people how the policies of the Centre will only add to the woes of the aam admi, already reeling under the staggering price rise. The price index will go up further before the polls in May, said Bose, also the state CPM secretary.        
	As the front is trying to woo urban youths, many of whom are new voters, Bose accused the central departments, particularly the railways headed by Mamata Banerjee, of refusing to provide jobs despite lakhs of vacancies.        
	For the urban poor, the manifesto harped on the pro-poor policies of Left-run civic bodies.         
	The new sops promised include a 99-year land lease to those living on government plots for over 20 years, apartments for slum-dwellers and policies to regularise street vendors.         
	The CPM and its allies will train their guns on Trinamul for its anti-development role and politics of anarchy in connivance with Maoists, Bose said, adding that the Congress will be their principal adversary in districts like Malda and Murshidabad.         
	Asked about the absence of BJP bashing in the manifesto, Bose denied its relation to the CPMs growing floor co-ordination with the party in Parliament. The manifesto deals with the civic polls in Bengal and not Jharkhand (where the BJP is a major force), he said.        
	While stressing the political significance of the civic polls, Bose also admitted that they were meant to improve amenities.

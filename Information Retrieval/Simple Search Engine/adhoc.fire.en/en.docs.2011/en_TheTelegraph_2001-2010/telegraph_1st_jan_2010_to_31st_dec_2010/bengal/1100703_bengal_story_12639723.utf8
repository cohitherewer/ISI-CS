          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta/Bolpur, July 2: Trinamul Congress MLAs today demanded the resignation of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee over the murder of former CPM MLA Ananda Das on Tuesday.        
	Trinamul MLAs shouted slogans in the Assembly and rushed to the Well, calling Bhattacharjee a murderer. They also waved banners and tried to bring the House session to a halt. However, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim did not adjourn the proceedings.         
	Why should just the Birbhum superintendent of police be transferred? The whole Left Front government should be transferred, Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee shouted. Dass murder is a result of the failure of the police and Bhattacharjee, who is in charge of the department, the leader of the Opposition added.         
	The police today detained five people in connection with the Nanoor murder but released them because of lack of evidence. They had arrested five others yesterday, all of whom were Trinamul supporters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM drips acid, rivals get unity formula 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM drips acid, rivals get unity formula 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, March 18: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee dubbed the Congress spineless and poured vitriol on a Trinamul Congress leaders speech-making skills, the uncharacteristic diatribe derailing the chief ministers attempt to divide the Opposition and unwittingly reinforcing the unity among the allies.        
	Speaking on the governors address in the Assembly, the chief minister had initially tried to find virtue in the Congress and simultaneously criticise Trinamul in keeping with the CPMs strategy intended at driving a wedge between the two Opposition allies.        
	 I want to ask the principal Opposition party here (Trinamul) to exercise restraint. After the Lok Sabha elections last year, I find them flexing their muscles too much. Dont do this. You people are trying to grab schools, colleges and other institutions by force. I wonder how a party like the Congress is supporting all this. Manasbabu (Congress leader Manas Bhuniya), how can you all support such things? How can you two stay together even after such incidents are happening? Bhattacharjee asked.        
	The tone gradually turned testy. The Congress is gradually losing its backbone. It is becoming spineless. You people can stay together. But that will be an existence without your backbone, the chief minister said.        
	If the Congress was willing to swallow that, what followed brought the Opposition members to their feet.        
	Bhattacharjee let loose a barrage at the leader of Opposition, Partha Chatterjee. What do I say about the leader of the Opposition? His speech is so bad. Its worthless. One simply cant listen to it. Its a punishment listening to what he says. I feel petrified while listening to his speech, the chief minister said.        
	Bhattacharjee did not forget to try his hand at biting humour, either. Now I can understand why they (Trinamul) lost the Panihati College elections. He (Chatterjee) had delivered a speech there.        
	If the chief minister had more in store for Chatterjee, it was drowned in the Opposition din that erupted in the House.        
	Congress and Trinamul legislators walked out of the House after Bhattacharjees 30-minute speech. SUCI MLA Debaprasad Sarkar followed suit. I walked out to decry the chief ministers indecent remarks against the leader of the Opposition, he said.                     
	Outside the House, an emotional Chatterjee said: The Opposition unity unnerved the chief minister so much that he lost his senses and insulted us in the most unsavoury language.        
	The Trinamul leader added that his party would continue to boycott the chief minister. We will sit with the Congress legislature leader to decide our joint course of action when the chief minister will be present in the Assembly tomorrow, he added.        
	The Congresss Bhuniya said Bhattacharjees attack had destroyed the basic fibre of parliamentary democracy.        
	The allies are expected to move a privilege motion against the chief minister and demand that his comments be expunged from the Assemblys records.        
	However, industries minister Nirupam Sen later sought to control the damage. It was directed at the state Congress, not the party at the Centre, Sen said, advising Congress supporters to follow the stand of the Prime Minister who has identified Maoists as the biggest internal security threat.

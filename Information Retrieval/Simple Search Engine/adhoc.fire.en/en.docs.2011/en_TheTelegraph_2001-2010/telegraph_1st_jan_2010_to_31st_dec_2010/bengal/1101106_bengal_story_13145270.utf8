	Calcutta, Nov. 5: Calcutta police arrested 636 people and seized close to 60kg of banned crackers till Friday midnight.        
	The number is huge. Last year, around 350 people were arrested from our area but this year the numbers of violators have increased manifold. All were arrested for bursting banned crackers, said joint commissioner of police Damayanti Sen.

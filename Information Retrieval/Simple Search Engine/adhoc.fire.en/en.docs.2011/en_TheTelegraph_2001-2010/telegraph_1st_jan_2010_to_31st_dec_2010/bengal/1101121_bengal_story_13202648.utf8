                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Suspension for college thrash
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Nov. 20: An engineering college in Bankura today suspended three students for being allegedly involved in the assault of a first-year student who attempted suicide unable to bear the humiliation.         
	Ujjwal Kumar Anand, 18, a first-year student at Mallabhum Institute of Technology near Bishnupur, jumped off the roof of his hostel on Thursday night. He was admitted to a Durgapur hospital with head injuries.        
	Ujjwals condition was stated to be critical. He is yet to regain consciousness and has been kept on ventilator support, doctors said.        
	The authorities of the college today suspended Ujjwals classmate Deepak Kumar and third-year computer engineering students Gaurav Kumar and Anish Sharma. Gaurav is Deepaks cousin.        
	Principal Saran Kumar Sanyal said Ujjwal, a computer engineering student, had been beaten up twice this week by Gaurav for allegedly picking a fight with Deepak. Anish too was involved in the assault on Ujjwal, Sanyal said.        
	Our disciplinary action committee has, after preliminary inquiries, suspended the three students for being involved in the beating of Ujjwal. They will remain suspended till the formal inquiry into the matter is completed and a final decision taken, the principal said.         
	Sanyal said Ujjwal could not withstand the humiliation and had been depressed for the past few days. He was under mental pressure after being constantly threatened by the third-year boy (Gaurav). This possibly led him to attempt suicide, the principal added.         
	Sanyal said the parents of the suspended trio were supposed to meet him today but were yet to turn up.         
	Ujjwals father Bimal Kumar Anand arrived at the Durgapur hospital yesterday from his home in Bihars Dehri-on-Sone. I could not sleep last night. I am not in a position to speak right now. Let my son recover first. After that, I will lodge complaints against the college and those responsible for my sons condition, he said.        
	Dibyajyoti Das, the subdivisional police officer of Bishnupur, said no complaint had been filed so far in the case.         
	The only official information we have got so far is a written communication from the institutes principal, saying that an accident had occurred on Thursday night in which a first-year boy fell off the hostel roof and was seriously injured, Das said.

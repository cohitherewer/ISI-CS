	Midnapore, Dec. 24: Suspected Maoists killed four persons, including a CPM leader and a school hostel superintendent, in attacks on four villages in West Midnapores Jungle Mahal area early today.         
	A Maoist team allegedly dragged three persons out of their homes in three villages and gunned down one of them and hacked two others. Another rebel gang shot dead a Peoples Committee activist in a hamlet, sparking a clash between committee activists and CPM supporters. The committee blamed the CPM for the murder. All the attacks took place between 12.30am and 2.30am.         
	In the first attack, about 12 armed rebels, including two women, descended on the house of CPM branch committee member Manoranjan Mahato, 45, in Birmadol village, 5km from the Jharkhand border. He was dragged out of his house and shot dead some distance away, villagers said.         
	The Maoists then went to neighbouring Chirugora village, where they hacked to death Raghunath Murmu, 45, a Jharkhand Party (Aditya) member.         
	Next, the rebels proceeded to Odolchua, a few kilometres away, and dragged Rathindranath Gope, the superintendent of the local high school hostel, out of his quarters in the hostel compound and hacked him to death with choppers.         
	Jhargram police chief Praveen Tripathi said around 25 children were in the hostel when Gope, 38, was attacked. Some children have told the police that the attackers were speaking in Hindi. So we have strong reason to believe that the Maoists had sneaked in from Jharkhand. Tripathi said the killings were carried out to spread panic in the area.        
	The officer said the attacks may have been carried out to break the rapport the police had established with the residents over the past six months by organising health and sports camps. Another officer said the villagers could now shun the police for fear of Maoist attacks.        
	In the fourth attack, another rebel team shot dead Hekim Murmu, 36, a former CPM member who joined the Peoples Committee seven months ago, after pulling him out of his home in Kalaberia village, the police said.         
	The committee accused the CPM of killing Murmu. Around 50 committee members clashed with CPM supporters at Kalaberia around 7.30 this morning.         
	The committee activists fled after being outnumbered by CPM supporters and villagers. Later, the activists blocked the Lodhashuli-Rogra state highway nearby. Joint forces personnel chased them away.         
	Station attacked        
	Maoists laid siege to Purulias Urma station for two consecutive nights, forcing staff to flee and causing disruption of train services. Around 10.30 last night, armed rebels asked the station staff to leave the place. One train had to wait for four hours at Purulia station, 24km away, while another was diverted.         
	The four staff members returned this morning with a police team, following which train services resumed.         
	But around 9pm today, the rebels again chased away the staff, halting train services afresh. Till late in the night, the Delhi-Puri Puroshottam Superfast Express was stranded at Purulia station.

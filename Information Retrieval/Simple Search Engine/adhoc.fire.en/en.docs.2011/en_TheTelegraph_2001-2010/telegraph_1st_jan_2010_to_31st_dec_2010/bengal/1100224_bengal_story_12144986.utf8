The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shilda scoot before strike
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Shilda scoot before strike
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Shilda (West Midnapore), Feb. 23: Two officers from Binpur police station had slipped out of the Shilda camp half-an-hour before the Maoist attack last Monday without either informing their superiors or the Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) personnel.         
	The duos disappearance came to light only when senior police officers spoke to them yesterday, a week after 24 EFR policemen were massacred at the camp.         
	The officers were stunned to know that the two local cops, posted at the camp to provide logistical help to a force unfamiliar with the area, had left without informing the camp in-charge.         
	They left the place exactly 30 minutes before the attack. They failed to provide any satisfactory explanation for this violation of service norms. They even tried to hoodwink us by presenting a cooked-up story. We found their role extremely suspicious, said a senior West Midnapore officer.         
	According to sources, sub-inspector Lakshmikanta Gorai and assistant sub-inspector Baldeb Patra had been given the charge of helping the EFR personnel with basic logistics. Since the EFR personnel come from outside and keep moving from one camp to another, engaging local police is a regular practice. The two officers were also supposed to guide the EFR about possible threats and suggest precautionary measures, said another officer.         
	According to the rulebook, Patra and Gorai were even supposed to identify the strategic locations where sentries should be posted. Before leaving in the evening, they were supposed to inform the camp-in-charge.         
	They didnt follow the norms, said western range inspector-general of police Kuldiep Singh. They are being examined. If they fail to come up with a satisfactory explanation, both of them will have to face action, he added.         
	Some of the senior officers said the duos explanations had left them stunned. First, they told us they had gone to a place near Narayanpur, 2km from the Shilda camp towards Belpahari, on hearing that there was an IED (improvised explosive device) planted off the road there and the Maoists struck before they could return. When we asked if they found any explosive, they said no. The officers claimed that they inquired and spoke to local people at Narayanpur, said a senior officer.         
	After that session with Patra and Gorai, a police team had gone to Narayanpur. No one there recalled seeing the two police officers last Monday. None of them could also remember any bomb scare that afternoon, the officer said.         
	In a small place like Narayanpur, almost everyone knows the cops from Binpur police station. So it is unlikely that they would have missed the two men in uniform.         
	Several senior officers said the duo were under the scanner. We are not ruling out any possibility. They (Patra and Gorai) may have had prior information about the massacre and they left the place to save their lives. However, they may not have known the exact time, otherwise they could have applied tricks like leaving the camp for tea minutes before, an officer said.

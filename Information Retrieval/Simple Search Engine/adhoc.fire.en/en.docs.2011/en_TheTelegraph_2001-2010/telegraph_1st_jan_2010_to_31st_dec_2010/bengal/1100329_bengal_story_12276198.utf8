                                                  Flight in fear after diary on CPM trio
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Arambagh, March 28: A Trinamul Congress activist has been threatened with murder if he tries to return home by alleged CPM cadres angry since he lodged a police complaint against their leaders.        
	Mantu Chowdhury has been living away from home in fear since October.        
	In a village here in Hooghly district, his wife was not allowed to cultivate potatoes in his absence.        
	Mantu had filed the complaint last October after allegedly being shot at. CPM local committee member and panchayat deputy chief Basudeb Chowdhury and party activists Biswanath Patra and Nirapada Adak were the trio he named in the police complaint.         
	Basudeb was arrested in December in connection with the murder of Trinamul worker Ananta Dolui the previous month, but is now out on bail. Biswanath and Nirapada were never arrested because the police chose not to treat Mantus complaint as an FIR. It was instead treated as a general diary, which does not necessitate a probe.        
	Mantu, 37, has been staying in other Trinamul workers houses in different parts of Hooghly since October. His wife Sulekha said CPM activists had come to their house at Dakshin Narayanpur village several times in the past few months to enquire about Mantu.        
	Mantu, who would not disclose where he is hiding, said over phone that in late October, he was sitting in a field near his house with some Trinamul supporters and discussing party matters when the CPM workers attacked them.         
	They took my name and told me they would killed me and fired shots at me. All of us ran. One of my party colleagues had a motorcycle and I fled with him, said Mantu.        
	When he met district police chief Satyajit Bandopadhyay in January, he asked him to meet the inspector in charge of Arambagh police station, Samir Ranjan Lala.         
	However, Mantu could not summon the courage to go to Arambagh. He said he called up inspector Lala instead. The IC told me to contact the CPM pradhan of the local Arandih gram panchayat and then everything will be all right. How can the police ask me to go to a CPM leader when I am seeking protection from the CPM? Mantu asked.        
	Arambagh in Hooghly, an old Left stronghold, has witnessed a bloody fight for turf between holders CPM and challengers Trinamul since the general election last summer. Six people have been killed.         
	In Mantus absence, Sulekha had tried to cultivate potato on their small plot with hired labourers. But local CPM activists drove them away and the crop withered, she said.        
	CPM district secretariat member Benoy Dutta is aware of Mantus plight. He should come to us and sort out his problem through talks, he said.

	Calcutta, April 17: Hardeep Singh alias Vicky, the prime suspect in the shooting near a dhaba on Ballygunge Circular Road on March 21, has been arrested, the last missing piece falling into place in the case that began with a brawl in a nightclub.         
	Vicky, a resident of Tiljala, was arrested this morning from Park Street after he fell into a trap laid by the police, whom he had been eluding for the past one month.         
	We had carried out a number of raids earlier but each time he managed to escape. Today, we received a tip-off he would come to Park Street to meet his friends, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	The police said Vickys cellphone had helped them track him down.        
	He changed his SIM card. He has used two new SIM cards in the past one month, an officer said. But he committed one mistake. He had been using the same handset which has an exclusive IMEI number. We came to know about his phone numbers with the help of the IMEI number and accordingly monitored his call statements. From some of the people he had contacted, we learnt that he was coming to Park Street this morning. So we laid a trap and picked up him, the officer added.        
	On March 21, minutes after leather dealer Shaqueel Khan, 28, and disk jockey Vishal Agarwal, 27, had stepped out of New Sharma Hotel on Ballygunge Circular Road in search of a cigarette shop, Vicky and his accomplice Debojyoti Roy had fired at the two. Shaqueel suffered bullet injuries in his abdomen and jaw while Vishal took a bullet in his leg.        
	The police had arrested Debojyoti within a week of the incident. Investigation revealed that he had fired at the two while Vicky was driving the motorbike, an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad said.        
	A probe revealed that a short while before the shooting, a brawl had broken out between Vickys friends and another person called Babar Khan in front of Ginger, a lounge bar on Hazra Road.         
	Babars girlfriend was at the centre of the brawl, an officer said. Vicky, an acquaintance of Babar and his girlfriend, had allegedly pulled her hand and made lewd remarks at her, leading to a fight between Babar, his friends Shaqueel and Vishal, and Vicky.        
	Babar and his girlfriend went inside Ginger after the brawl. Vicky, who was not allowed to enter, stood and waited outside the watering hole.         
	He followed Shaqueel and Vishal after they came out of Ginger and went to the dhaba on Ballygunge Circular Road. When the two came out of the dhaba after their meal, Vicky and Debojyoti shot at them and escaped on a motorcycle.

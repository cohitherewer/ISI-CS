          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, June 29: A woman was allegedly hacked to death by her husband and one of her four sons because she had secretly written away a small plot to a daughter.         
	Her second son pushed away his sister when she tried to resist the attack this morning and her two younger sons looked on.        
	Mehenur Bibi, 45, had wanted to ensure her daughter had a place to stay after being deserted by her husband because she was certain the men in her own family would not let her stay with them for long.        
	The mother had given away one cottah from the 60 cottahs  two bighas  and a house she had in her name. The men could not bear that.        
	Kajla, 22, had been with her parents in Murshidabads Indradanga since her husband left her two years ago. She said in the FIR today how she helplessly saw her mother being killed. Seeing my plight, my mother had decided to give a small piece of land where I could build a hut. Last week, she told my father she was going to a doctor, quietly took me to the registry office at Lalbag and had the land registered in my name, Kajla said.        
	A villager who had seen them in the registry office told Imajuddin Sheikh, an affluent farmer with 12 bighas, about the mother and daughter. Mehenur confessed that she had indeed given her daughter a patch beside their house.        
	I saw my father and eldest brother Mahirul hack mother. When I rushed to stop them, Zahirul threw me aside, said Kajla. Manirul, and Minarul (aged 18 and 16) looked on.        
	Imajuddin and his sons are absconding, said Murshidabad superintendent of police B.L. Meena.

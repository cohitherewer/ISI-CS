The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Basu undergoes two blood transfusions
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Basu undergoes two blood transfusions
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 3: Jyoti Basu had to undergo blood trans- fusion on Saturday night and Sunday evening after his ha- emoglobin level dipped.         
	However, doctors at the private hospital where the 95-year-old is admitted with moderately severe pneumonia said his condition had marginally improved.         
	Basu underwent blood transfusion and his condition has improved marginally. But he continues to be on non-invasive respiratory support and is under observation, said T.S. Kuckrejja, executive vice-president, AMRI Hospitals, Salt Lake. The CPM leader has been there since the evening of January 1.         
	Doctors said that apart from the pneumonia, being treated with heavy doses of antibiotics, Basu had low haemoglobin and protein levels.         
	The haemoglobin level had dropped to 7.5 grams per 100ml. At Basus age, a person should have a haemoglobin level of at least 12 grams per 100 ml, a doctor treating him said.        
	His haemoglobin count went up to 9gm/100ml (after the first transfusion) and we expect it to improve further after the transfusion of the second unit, he had said before the second transfusion.        
	The level of the proteins albumin and globulin in his blood is low because of Basus food habits. He hardly eats these days. We are trying to raise the level with the help of artificial protein diets, being fed with the liquids he is being provided with, a doctor said.        
	Because of the low haemoglobin and protein levels, he is at times drowsy. But there has been an improvement in his general alertness. He is waving at doctors whom he knows, said a doctor.         
	We will wait for another day and a half for the antibiotics to ease the chest congestion. If they dont work, the drugs will be changed, he said.        
	A BiPap machine is being used to pump air into Basus lungs. The BiPap, a step short of a ventilator, is used for patients who can breathe on their own but need more air in their lungs. Patients are put on the ventilator when they cannot breathe on their own.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose, who went to see the party patriarch with colleague Benoy Konar this evening, said Basu had not been able to sleep last night and this morning. So he is sleeping now.        
	Hospital sources said Basu woke up around 8pm and sat on his bed with support.         
	Veteran doctor Mani Chhetri has become the chief adviser to the five-member medical board formed for Basus treatment.

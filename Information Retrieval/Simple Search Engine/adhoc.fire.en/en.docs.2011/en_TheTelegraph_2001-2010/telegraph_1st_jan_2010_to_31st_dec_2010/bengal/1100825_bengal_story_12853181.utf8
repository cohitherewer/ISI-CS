          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bankura, Aug. 24: Four persons were killed by suspected anti-Maoist groups in a Bankura village last night for their links with the rebels in the biggest such strike by the resistance outfits in Bengals Naxalite zone.        
	The killings in Hansadumri village bore the hallmark of rebels  the bullet-riddled bodies were found with the hands tied behind the backs. The murders come at a time villagers in pockets of neighbouring West Midnapore have protested the coercive ways of Maoists and the rebel-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	The killings are suspected to have been carried out by a Gana Pratirodh Committee. Such groups started sprouting in villages along the borders of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia last year against frequent bandhs and blockades by the Maoists and the rebel-backed Peoples Committee.        
	Residents of Hansadumri told the police the slain four had links with the rebels. We believe they were killed by a Pratirodh Committee (village resistance group), said Mohan Murmu (name changed) of Hansadumri.         
	A police officer echoed Murmu. Preliminary investigation indicates that they were killed by the Pratirodh Committee.        
	The bodies of Sujit Giri, Sanjit Gorai, Hikim Murmu and Lakshmikanta Soren were found this morning on the Bankura-Jhargram road, 18km from the local Barikul police station and 210km from Calcutta. They had been thrashed before being shot, said Bankura additional superintendent of police S.K. Jhajharia.         
	A fifth person who was with the group when it was attacked is missing. Arun Patra could have been kidnapped or may have escaped.         
	Sujit and Sanjit were related and had a timber business. Sujit was a member of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (Naren) group. Hikim and Lakshmikanta were former CPM supporters.        
	A third police officer said they were also probing whether the four had a feud with the Maoists. As the Maoists have a strong base in Barikul, we are also exploring this angle.        
	Four months ago, Mantu Mahato, brother-in-law of Maoist action squad leader Madan Mahato, was killed in the same Bankura pocket. That murder was also blamed on a Pratirodh Committee.         
	Tribal body Bharat Jakat Majhi Marwa backs the resistance groups, which were initially led by the Jharkhand Janamukti Morcha. Later, supporters of other parties, including the CPM and the Congress, joined in.        
	In a separate incident, a suspected Maoist was killed in an encounter with the joint forces in a West Midnapore forest 20km from Lalgarh.

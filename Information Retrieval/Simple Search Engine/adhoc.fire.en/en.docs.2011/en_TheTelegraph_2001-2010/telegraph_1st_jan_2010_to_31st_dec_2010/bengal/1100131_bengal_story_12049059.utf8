	Barrackpore, Jan. 30: College student Payel Pollay, 21, was crushed by a train this afternoon as she walked along the tracks at Khardah station talking on her mobile, unable to hear twin sister Pamels screamed warnings.     
	Stricken by grief, Pamel drank acid after returning home and is critically ill in hospital. While returning from their college in Barrackpore, 15km away, where they studied together, the siblings had got off a train and taken a pop-ular short cut along the tracks. Pamel was trailing her sister. Their father Pankaj, a state power distribution company employee, was too shocked to speak.        
	Midnapore: A man hit by Maoist bullets on Friday night during the rehearsal of a jatra in Salboni has died. He was identified as Jagannath Mahato, 28. Two others are in critical condition.        
	Calcutta: Over 20 shanties behind Yoga-yog Bhavan in Bowbazar were gutted on Saturday.

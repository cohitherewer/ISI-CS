          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 26: A railway employee has been arrested for the first time in the Jnaneswari Express case, with CBI sources saying the gateman is a Maoist sympathiser who had helped the saboteurs with exact train timings.        
	Dayamoy Mahato, 28, picked up last night with another man from a village near the crash site, may have also helped other suspects escape days after the May 28 disaster by tipping them off about the movements of police teams scouring the area.        
	Dayamoy manned the level crossing at Sardiha, which the express had passed before it derailed a few metres down the line at Rajabandh and was hit by an oncoming goods train.        
	The road that cuts through the tracks at Sardiha is one of the few in the area and the cops hunting for the crash suspects often used it. Dayamoy, the sources said, used his vantage position to send alerts.        
	Dayamoy had been detained in June but could not be arrested because of lack of evidence. CBI sources said his name had cropped up again in the interrogation of Lakshmikanta Roy, another suspect picked up a few weeks back.        
	Dayamoy had supplied the timings of Jnaneswari and the goods train. He also gave information on police movements, a CBI source said.        
	The gateman and Ram Mudi, 21, were arrested from a house in Indraboni, close to their own villages. An officer said Ram was a Maoist action squad member. A third person, Mantu Mahato, arrested in Bankura on July 31 in an illegal arms case, has also been booked in the Jnaneswari case and handed over to the CBI.         
	Dayamoy is from Rasua and Ram from Kalajhora, all within 6km of Rajabandh, said Jhargram police chief Praveen Tripathi. The total number of arrests in the case has now gone up to 16.         
	Senior commercial manager of South Eastern Railways Kharagpur division, K. Mohammad Azhar, claimed the CBI was yet to inform his department about the arrest of Dayamoy  a junior trackman in rail parlance. If he has been arrested, the law will take its own course.        
	The graduate from Manikpara College, near Jhargram, was a former Jharkhand Party (Naren Hansda) supporter. Dayamoy was once the general secretary of the party-led students union, another officer said.

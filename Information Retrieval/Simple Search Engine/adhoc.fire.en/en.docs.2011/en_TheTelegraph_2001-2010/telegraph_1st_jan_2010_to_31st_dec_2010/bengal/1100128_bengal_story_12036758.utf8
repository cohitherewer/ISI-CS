	Jan. 27: Police today claimed to have gunned down a Maoist from the same group that had killed a policeman in Bankuras Barikul on Monday night.        
	A four-hour encounter took place today in the hilly terrain of Belpahari in neighbouring West Midnapore district.        
	We rushed today following a tip-off that the group had crossed over from Bankura, a police officer said.        
	As 100 jawans approached Talpakuria village around 9am, bullets came flying at them from the jungle.        
	Over 250 rounds were fired in all and the Maoists retreated towards Laljal near the Jharkhand border, said district superintendent of police Manoj Verma.         
	The body of an unidentified young man in jeans was found in the jungle after the encounter. The force also found four improvised explosive devices, a .303 rifle and 10 cartridges.         
	Five suspected Maoist have been arrested.        
	In Calcutta, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said six companies of central forces that had been withdrawn from West Midnapore because of the Assembly polls in Jharkhand would return soon. This will take the number of central force personnel in the Lalgarh region to around 2,500 (26 companies).        
	Sen and state police chief Bhupinder Singh met governor M.K. Narayanan today and briefed him on the overall law-and-order condition in the state with special reference to Lalgarh.        
	Maoists tonight killed a CPM leader in Bankuras Sarenga. Ranjit Hembrum, 53, a zonal committee member, is the second CPM man killed in the region since Monday night.

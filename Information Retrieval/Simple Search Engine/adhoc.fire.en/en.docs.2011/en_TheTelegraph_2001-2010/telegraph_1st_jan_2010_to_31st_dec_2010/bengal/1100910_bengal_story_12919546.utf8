	Midnapore, Sept. 9: Around 5,000 CPM supporters and villagers, several of them hounded out of their West Midnapore homes by Maoists, today took out a procession in Ramgarh, a former rebel stronghold 11km from Lalgarh, a week after the party reclaimed nearby Dharampur.        
	Waving red flags, the participants of the rally also held a meeting where local CPM leaders urged the people to raise their voice against Maoists. Unlike Dharampur, Ramgarh had never been the stronghold of the CPM. The rebels held sway there until the arrival of the joint forces in June last year.        
	CPM sources said around 150 party workers who had fled their homes in villages neighbouring Ramgarh arrived there in two SUVs and a truck at 6am today. They set up a camp at Ramgarh rajbari on the outskirts of the village.        
	Anuj Pandey, the secretary of the Binpur zonal committee of the CPM, said: Many of their homes have been demolished or damaged by Maoists. So they have taken shelter at the rajbari. They will return to their villages after their houses are rebuilt or repaired.        
	Pandey, who had led the reclamation of Dharampur on September 2, said many of todays marchers were former supporters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. They could not protest earlier for fear of Maoists, he added.        
	The local CPM leaders urged the people to oppose a Peoples Committee bandh in Jungle Mahal tomorrow. They asked the traders at Ramgarh to keep their shops open.         
	Pandey kin dead        
	A relative of Pandey who was shot by Maoists on Sunday died at a Calcutta hospital today. Bidyut Pandey, a resident of Bhairabkundu in Lalgarh, had suffered four bullet injuries. CPM supporters at Bhairabkundu took out a procession to protest Bidyuts death, Pandey said.

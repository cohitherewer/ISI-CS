The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Coal-runners find protectors in khaki
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Coal-runners find protectors in khaki
										      KINSUK BASU       The Great Coal Robbery: A Telegraph expose                                        
	Barkolaghat (Birbhum), April 18: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has told his police to crack down on coal thieves and those who buy their loot, but his forces in Birbhum and Burdwan are offering safe passage to consignments stolen from the governments own mine at Borjore in Birbhum.         
	After carrying an expose on the daylight theft of coal from the Borjore mine  a joint venture between the state and the EMTA Group  The Telegraph tracked the supply chain of the stolen coal and found out how the police were facilitating the movement.         
	This supply chain will break the moment the cops stop co-operating with us. So, we do everything to keep the police happy, said an operator who facilitates movement of the stolen coal and is one of the many cogs in the wheel.         
	After plundering coal from the mines dump yard, villagers bring their booty in carts or bicycles to illegal dump yards at Barkolaghat, Bhimgarh, Sahapur, Kendgoria and Metela along the Birbhum-Burdwan border.         
	Depending on the demand-supply situation, the price of coal gets determined before the operators seal the deal with the buyers and despatch the consignments. In the past few months, the price of stolen coal has varied between Rs 900 and Rs 1,500 a tonne.         
	A tonne of coal from Borjore (officially) costs around Rs 1,400, but it is a captive mine for the governments power plants and so other buyers cant access supply from this mine unless it is stolen, said a mining industry insider.         
	Truckloads of stolen coal from the illegal dump yards reach end-users across Bengal and the neighbouring states as the police allow hassle-free movement.         
	While taking stock of the power crisis in Bengal  aggravated by coal shortage  Bhattacharjee had last week asked home secretary Ardhendu Sen to take stern action against the looters.         
	But while tracking the movement of trucks along the Birbhum-Burdwan border, The Telegraph found that the Writers Buildings decision had a long way to trickle down.         
	The looting at Borjore has stopped as the police have stopped loading of coal from the mine. But stolen coal from the illegal dump yards is moving freely, said a senior official of Bengal EMTA Coal Mines.         
	The stolen coal consign- ments reach the end-users primarily through two routes: the trucks hit National Highway 60, if they go through Birbhum, or National Highway 2 in Burdwan after crossing the Ajoy.         
	A senior police officer said they pass through the areas of at least eight police stations  Suri, Dubrajpur, Khoirasole, Pandaveswar and Kankortola in Birbhum and Asansol (North), Baramoni and Jamuria in Burdwan  before hitting the highways.         
	We have arrangements with the police. They dont create any problems either for the buyers who buy coal in large volumes or the villagers who supply the coal to the dump yards, said an operator who organises trucks for the buyers.         
	This newspaper had earlier reported that villagers buy Rs 100 coupons from local police stations to ferry the looted coal to either their villages or the dump yards.         
	But the rates are much higher when consignments from the dump yards leave for the end-users. Police stations issue pads to a select few operators against the payment of around Rs 1,500. The operators then sell the pads  a piece of paper with the operators name scribbled on it  to truck drivers at Rs 2,000 each.         
	Five of us get around 150 pads issued from the police station every day, said an operator who has his way with the cops at Khoirasole police station, adding that each night they deliver a list of the vehicles carrying the stolen coal.         
	Birbhum superintendent of police R.N. Mukherjee refused to admit any police role in the movement of the stolen coal. We keep a strong vigil, he said.         
	But on the night of April 17, this correspondent spotted policemen on night patrol checking truck numbers and tallying them with the list of vehicles that had bought pads from operators to carry the stolen coal consignments.         
	First, we need to buy pads from the operators. Then we have to pay around Rs 500 to the cops on night patrol, said a truck driver on his way to NH34.         
	Although stolen coal is despatched through the day, transportation in bigger volumes begins at night. Sponge iron factories and brick kilns dotting the region are among the clients.         
	The mushrooming of illegal sponge iron units and brick kilns has given a fresh impetus to the looting at Borjore and illegal mining in the Raniganj-Asansol belt.         
	On a peak day, 100-120 trucks use Barkolaghat before hitting NH2. Its not coal from Borjore alone, coal from ille- gal mines also finds its way to the dump yards here and so the number of buyers is huge, explained one of the operators.

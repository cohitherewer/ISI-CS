          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 4: The Congress today moved to bolster party unity in Bengal, accommodating all factions in the Pradesh Congress Committee and reinstating four district unit presidents.        
	The party central leadership announced the names of the 42 office-bearers of the new executive committee of the PCC. Deepa Das Munshi appeared the biggest gainer, with several of her loyalists finding berths. Loyalists of new state Congress chief Manas Bhuniya and Shankar Malakar too were picked.        
	K. Keshava Rao, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, said this evening from Delhi: We have formed the Pradesh Congress Committee with the aim to create a broad consensus and send a positive message to the party ranks across the state. With the Assembly polls round the corner, we need a strong organisation to effectively counter the CPM.        
	Rao said the reinstatement of the four sacked district Congress presidents  Pradip Ghosh, Debi Ghosal, Shankar Malakar and Shankar Singh  was aimed at ending the growing dissent within the organisation.         
	The quartet had been removed on the ground that they had become non-functional.        
	Rao said the central leadership had received representations from the four leaders. Their grievances have been addressed by the high command.        
	Bhuniya welcomed the high commands decision. I am thankful to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and senior AICC leaders for incorporating important leaders into the newly formed committee, he said.        
	He said he needed the selected members co-operation in the run-up to the Assembly polls.        
	After a meeting with Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in the evening, Bhuniya said: The committee will work as a family to strengthen the organisation and cement the relations with the Trinamul Congress.

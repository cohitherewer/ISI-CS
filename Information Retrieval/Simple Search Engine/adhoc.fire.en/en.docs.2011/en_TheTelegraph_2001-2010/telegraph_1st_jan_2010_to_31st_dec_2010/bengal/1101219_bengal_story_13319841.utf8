                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM plea to Opposition 
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                              
	Panagarh/Mangalkot, Dec. 18: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today appealed to the Opposition to cooperate with the state government for the welfare of Bengal.        
	The government wants the Opposition. What do they think? Do they think that the government does not want them? We cannot ignore them. We will have to carry them along, the chief minister said at Panagarh, Burdwan, where he inaugurated a three-day panchayat fair.        
	Bhattacharjee said the people of the state were suffering because of the Oppositions continued non-cooperation with the government.        
	His appeal was prompted by the absence of the sabhadhipatis of the Trinamul-run zilla parishads of East Midnapore and South 24-Parganas from todays event.        
	Bhattacharjee pointed out that the chiefs of the Congress-run zilla parishads of Malda and Murshidabad were present at the event but the Trinamul duo had stayed away.        
	I appeal to them (Trinamul) to cooperate with the government for the states welfare, he said.        
	Panchayat minister Anisur Rahman said railway minister Mamata Banerjee did not even bother to reply to the invite I had sent her.         
	Trinamul, however, accused Bhattacharjee of ignoring the Opposition over the years.        
	Partha Chatterjee said: The chief minister has now realised the importance of the Opposition after ruining Bengal with his misrule.         
	Chatterjee claimed that Bhattacharjee had said after the last Assembly elections that the Oppositions views did not matter as the Left had bagged 235 of the 294 seats.         
	CPM sources said Bhattacharjees appeal to the Opposition today was aimed at sending a message to Trinamul to come to the talks table and discuss steps to stem the escalating violence at the ongoing student elections at colleges. A CPM state committee member said the party believed that talks with the Opposition could ease the situation.        
	During his 40-minute speech, the chief minister urged people to oppose if any attempts are made to take away your land.        
	Although he did not elaborate, he probably had in mind the recent agitation in Sankrail, Howrah, by members of the CPM-backed Save Farmland Committee against the construction of a railway coach factory.        
	At a Left Front rally in Burdwans Mangalkot later in the day, the chief minister accused Trinamul of colluding with Maoists to let loose a reign of terror across the state. He urged the people to resist such attempts by Trinamul.

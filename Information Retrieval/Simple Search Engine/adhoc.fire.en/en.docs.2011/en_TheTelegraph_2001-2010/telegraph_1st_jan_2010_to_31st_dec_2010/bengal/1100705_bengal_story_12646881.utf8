	Burdwan, July 4: Members of a Citu-led union last night locked up 22 Railway Protection Force personnel and snatched from them two sponge-iron factory employees in Burdwan after stolen rail tracks were allegedly found on the premises.        
	Police rescued the RPF men at 5am today after 10 hours of captivity.         
	A group of 40 RPF personnel had raided N.N. Steel and Shyam Sales in Burdwan town yesterday and seized stolen railway tracks worth Rs 3 lakh. They also arrested the six employees, two from N.N. Steel and four from Shyam Sales.         
	As an RPF team stepped out of Shyam Sales withe the arrested staff, some 500 people surrounded them. They were members of the Burdwan Iron and Steel Works Employees Union, the majority workers body in the sponge-iron units that dot the region.         
	The protesters snatched two of the arrested employees. But some of the railway personnel managed to break free and flee with four of those arrested.        
	The union members then locked up the other 22 RPF jawans who were still inside Shyam Sales.

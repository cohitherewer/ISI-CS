                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Abducted inspectors train pass in Naxalite camp
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Purulia/Calcutta, Nov. 14: Police seized a free railway pass issued in the name of Partha Biswas from a Maoist camp on Purulias Ayodhya Hills they had raided on Friday, the first evidence of rebel involvement in the intelligence branch inspectors disappearance.         
	The police and the state government suspect the Maoists kidnapped Biswas and his schoolteacher friend Saumajit Basu from the Ayodhya Hills, a charge the rebels have denied.        
	A police officer said that after an encounter with the rebels near Bamni village on Friday, the cops searched the camp and found the railway warrant  a pass issued to police officers to travel free by train  in a bundle of Maoist literature.         
	On the basis of the information on the warrant  book no. 43825, serial no. 18 and dated 13.8.2010  the police found out that the pass had been issued to Biswas.         
	This is the first concrete evidence of the Maoists having abducted Partha Biswas, the officer said.        
	Another police officer said that from the warrant it was evident that Biswas was in the custody of the Maoists in the Ayodhya Hills after his disappearance.         
	We assume that Saumajit Basu was also with him. But we are yet to get any clinching evidence on this. It is likely that the duo have been taken to Jharkhand, the officer said.        
	The police said that during the search at the camp, they also found a diary belonging to Maoist leader Bikram. The diary contained three sketches of maps of the locality and its neighbourhood. One of the sketches showed the 35km route the chief minister today took from Purulia town to Balarampur, where he addressed a rally.         
	The other sketches appear to be the rebels future targets in Purulias Jhalda, Arsa and Balarampur. We also found letters addressed to intellectuals, claiming the Maoist movement was for the good of the people and those the rebels had killed so far were corrupt, an officer said.        
	We also seized training manuals on jungle warfare. The manuals are written in Bengali, he added.         
	Clothes, utensils, condoms and containers of rice and pulses were found in the camp, the officer said.        
	Biswas and Basu are missing since October 22.         
	On November 4, the Purulia unit of the CPI (Maoist) issued a statement denying having abducted the duo. Maoist sources had said that lower-rung rebels could have kidnapped the two without the consent of the top leaders.

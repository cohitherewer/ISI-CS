                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Tagore varsity VC action on PM nod
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: The human resource development ministry will consult the Prime Minister before taking action against Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray over alleged lapses in appointment of staff, including faculty members.         
	The ministry has decided to send a note to Manmohan Singh, the chancellor of the varsity, detailing the findings of an inquiry committee it had appointed to probe the charges. The three-member panel, headed by former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, has found lapses in the appointment of 100 staff members over the past four years. The panel submitted its report to the HRD ministry in September.         
	According to rules, the recommendations of the selection panels for various posts should be placed before the executive council of the university. The vice-chancellor can issue appointment orders only after the executive council approves the recommendations. However, the inquiry panel found that Ray had issued appointment orders before bringing the matter to the council. The vice-chancellor, however, had obtained the post-facto approval of the council.         
	The inquiry panel also found Ray guilty of not convening council meetings regularly. While the council met four times in 2007, the frequency of such sessions came down to three in 2008, two in 2009 and one so far in 2010.         
	The committee, however, did not find any evidence that Ray was involved in financial irregularities. There were allegations that the vice-chancellor misused government grants.         
	The UGC has forwarded the report to the HRD ministry. HRD minister Kapil Sibal held a meeting last week to discuss the findings. It was decided at the meeting that the Prime Minister would be approached. Sibal will send a summary of the report to Singh, sources said.

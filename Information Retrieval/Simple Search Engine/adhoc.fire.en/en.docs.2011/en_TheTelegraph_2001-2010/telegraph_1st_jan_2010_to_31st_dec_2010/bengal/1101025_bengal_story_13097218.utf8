The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamatas Rajarhat punch ready for Deb
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamatas Rajarhat punch ready for Deb
          BARUN GHOSH                            Mamata Banerjee and Gautam Deb                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 24: Mamata Banerjee today announced a land protest in Rajarhat, Calcuttas upcoming hotspot where housing minister Gautam Deb is seen as trying to match her flag-off frenzy with a project blitz.        
	The railway minister will lead a march of farmers in Rajarhat on November 13 to protest allegedly forcible land acquisition and denial of compensation relating to the New Town project and other plans.         
	Over 25,000 farmers will participate in a padayatra on November 13 to protest forcible acquisition of their land. Many of the farmers have been denied compensation. I will have to help them get justice, Mamata said this afternoon at her Kalighat residence before leaving for Delhi.        
	An official of the Housing Infrastructure Development Company (Hidco), which is developing many of the projects and comes under Debs department, expressed fears that the agitation might hit ongoing plans.        
	Besides the proposed financial hub (announced earlier this month by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) on 300 acres, a central business district on 500 acres and a mass housing scheme comprising 20,000 flats on 150 acres are coming up. We fear the rail ministers agitation might affect work in these projects, he said.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata had planned the protest to corner Deb, who has tried to project her as a stumbling block for the states development drive. He has also complained that she hasnt turned up for many project openings despite being invited by his department.        
	Mamatas Rajarhat march and the wider agitation will be like the ones she waged in Singur and Nandigram. It is aimed at exposing the housing minister. She is unhappy at the way Deb is out to scuttle her efforts to score over the Left by flagging off rail projects, a Trinamul general secretary said.         
	Other leaders said the large turnout for yesterdays march by the railway minister to demand the withdrawal of joint forces from Maoist-hit areas had spurred the Rajarhat offensive.        
	The entire area from Bidhan Nagar to Beliaghata (through which the march was held) is represented by CPM MLAs Rupa Bagchi and Manab Mukherjee, the state minister for tourism. A large turnout at yesterdays rally was indicative of our steady consolidation in the CPM bastion, said Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi.        
	Asked to react to Mamatas agitation, Deb said: The rail minister is most welcome in Rajarhat. I have tried to bring Mamata twice to flag off my programmes there. Now she is coming here on her own. If she calls me to the talks table to address the problems of farmers, I would be glad to attend. At least, this would send a message that the Opposition and the government should work in tandem for development.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Behind bush as Maoists pound rails
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Behind bush as Maoists pound rails
  - Track patrol man narrates guerrilla bid to derail trains        NARESH JANA                          Kanan Mahato at work. His face has been blurred. Picture by Samir Mondal                                        
	Jhargram, Jan. 1: Walking down the deserted tracks between Jhargram and Khatkura, a Maoist stretch lined by forests and eerily silent and bitterly cold on a late December night, Kanan Mahato and his colleague Panchu Patro were startled by the loud clang of metal hitting metal.        
	Too stunned to react at first, the railway employees assigned the task of checking a stretch of the tracks with lanterns on Wednesday night, quickly realised something was horribly amiss.        
	I knew it was the Maoists at work, but initially we could not see anyone, we could only hear the sound, Mahato told The Telegraph yesterday, a day after a disaster was averted because of his and his colleagues alertness.         
	Maoists had twisted out of alignment around 400 metres of tracks on the stretch between Jhargram and Khatkura stations.        
	Mahato and Patro moved closer and could make out through the gloom of the night the shapes of hordes of men who were hitting the tracks hard with axes, shovels and hammers.        
	The first thing that we did was to put out our lanterns, lest we be spotted, and hid behind a clump of bushes off the tracks, Mahato said.         
	From there, we could get a clear view of around 200 men hammering away at the tracks.        
	Then, from their cellphones they alerted their superiors at the Jhargram, Gidhni and Khatkura stations and waited for help to arrive.        
	At 9.45pm on Wednesday, Mahato and Patro had set off from Jhargram station in a local train and hopped off at Khatkura, 7km away, 15 minutes later to begin their night duty.        
	At Khatkura, they collected their duty book and set off towards Jhargram station with lanterns to inspect a 3.5km stretch.        
	Usually, Mahato and Patro would walk 3.5km towards Jhargram while two other trackmen would walk the same distance from Jhargram and the teams would meet at the midpoint. They would then write the status of the tracks in their duty books and exchange them.        
	This way, both Jhargram and Khatkura stations would have a fair idea of the condition of the entire stretch of tracks between the two stations, Mahato said.        
	After a two-and-a-half-hour trek, Mahato and Patro found a clip that affixes the tracks to the sleepers loose and stopped to fix it.         
	It was very cold, which made it difficult to trudge along the tracks, Mahato said.        
	By the time they met the team from Jhargram, it was 12.30am.         
	We chatted a bit, had a few bidis and then decided to return to Khatkura with the duty book, Mahato said.         
	So it was past 1am when we started our journey back.        
	They had barely walked 200 metres when they stopped hearing the sound of hammers and axes hitting the tracks.        
	After we had informed our superiors of the damage that was being done to the tracks, we were waiting anxiously, especially because we were aware that the New Delhi-Bhubaneswar Puroshattam Express was due to pass in 10 minutes, Mahato said.        
	In the cold, Mahato said they wanted to puff at their bidis, but were afraid to light a match for fear of being spotted.        
	We also put our phones on silent mode, though we knew that the sound of our cells ringing could not be heard above the din, Mahato said.        
	The two saw the Maoists take off the Pandrol clips and hammer at the tracks to dis- place their alignment. Any train hurtling down this track would be a sitting duck, Mahato said.         
	It was certain to get derailed. At periodic intervals, we kept updating our bosses about what was happening.        
	A little past 2am, some of the Maoists disappeared into the forest, apparently having completed their job. By 3am, the rest had gone, too.        
	Even though the sound had stopped and we knew that the Maoists had gone, we didnt dare budge from where we were, Mahato said.        
	They stayed there till 4.30 in the morning when the first train  an engine and a coach  carrying the officials arrived at the spot.        
	It was such a relief, Mahato said.         
	We were all the more relieved because not a single passenger had been harmed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bose shows Basu path in morality lesson
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bose shows Basu path in morality lesson
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, March 7: Biman Bose today cited Jyoti Basus idealism to contrast it with the influx of self-servers and opportunists into the party that has eroded the CPMs popular base.         
	The CPM state secretary reminded those gathered to pay homage to the former chief minister at a meeting organised by the South 24-Parganas Left Front committee how Basu had volunteered to be a whole-timer in the nascent communist party against a lucrative career as a lawyer after returning from England.         
	He didnt care to earn huge sums of money as a barrister. But today, we hardly see such eagerness to be a party whole-timer among our members in high-income groups, Bose said in Garia.         
	He asked cadres to go back to the people, hinting at the partys alienation from its support base. He singled out the Trinamul-Maoist nexus as the main enemy of the ruling Left.        
	The partys Calcutta district committee that concluded a three-day extended meeting today also echoed Bose on his worry of the influx of self-servers into the party.         
	As the meeting was for stocktaking for the coming civic elections to 82 municipal bodies across the state, including Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the documents placed before the meeting admitted that a large section of the party cadres was involved in promoting real estate, land speculation and even in running liquor shops.         
	Participants also complained about corruption in the upper echelons of the party and sought meaningful rectification, the current buzzword in the CPM.

          BISWANATH ROY                          A cockfight in Purulia. File picture                                  
	Purulia, Oct. 24: When Maa Durga leaves the pandals of Purulia, it is time for the roosters to come out.         
	For nearly five months each year, Purulia town is the venue for moroger ladai (cockfight). From Dashami to Dol Jatra, over 2,000 villagers field their birds in the Sealkheda ground.         
	The rooster fight, going on for nearly 100 years now, is no benign sport. Many owners tie iron spurs and blades to the legs of their birds, so bird deaths are routine.        
	Size matters, that is, big birds are pitched against each other. But the roosters are not weighed. The organisers, the Sealkheda Moroger Ladai Committee, decide such matters going by the eye.        
	Keen owners also put their birds on high-protein diet so that their energy does not flag.         
	Soumen Das, a manufacturer of cement pipes, will play four of his roosters this season. He has fed them high-protein food for a fortnight. I prepared the roosters for about 15 days. I purchased them from various village fairs and they cost me between Rs 700 and Rs 1,000 each. I have fed them small fish and tadpoles along with rice and wheat. This will make them strong, Das said.         
	That is not all. Das has to keep his eyes peeled so his birds dont stray. The roosters are tied up so that they dont go around having any other food or get attracted to hens, he said.         
	The moroger ladai committee collects Rs 5 from each owner for each participating bird. If the bird wins, the owner takes the defeated adversary home  dead or alive. There is no cash prize.         
	The fight continues till either one cock runs away out of fear or bleeds to death, said Debdulal Majumdar, owner of a stationery shop in Purulia town, a participant this time.         
	There are also people who are experts in tying the kat  the iron spur or blade  to the birds legs. We charge Rs 10 to Rs 20 for tying the kat to the legs of each bird. Each of us ties the kat to the legs of 25 to 30 roosters, said Sagar Mahato, a local labourer.        
	At least 2,000 people come from all over Purulia and even neighbouring Jharkhand. Some come to watch, some to participate, said Nabeyendu Mahali, a leader of the morog ladai committee.        
	Phani Das, a mason who owns two roosters, was one of the winners in a fight last Sunday. I feel very good because it is considered a good omen if one wins on Dashami. I hope to win more in the next few months, said Phani.        
	According to residents of Purulia town, betting on the birds is routine, though illegal. The stakes range from Rs 50 to Rs 500 according to the size of the contesting roosters, said a resident.        
	Rajesh Yadav, the Purulia superintendent of police, said betting and tying blades to the feet of the birds are illegal.         
	The cockfight has been going on as part of an old tradition. If we receive any complaint, we will look into the matter, he said.        
	No animal rights groups have complained to police against the blood sport yet.

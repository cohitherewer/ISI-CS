The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Class XI boy kills junior
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Class XI boy kills junior
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Feb. 5: A Class X student was allegedly beaten to death by his senior in a Murshidabad village for having complained to the headmaster about the older boy holding the hand of a girl in school.        
	The 17-year-old accused has been arrested for what police called a revenge murder.         
	Sixteen-year-old Swapan Sheikh was to have written his secondary exams later this month. He was the first in his family to have studied this far.        
	The name of the accused is being withheld because he is a minor. He has confessed during interrogation that he had committed the murder for revenge. He had an altercation with Swapan on the school campus involving a girl student. Thereafter, Swapan had gone to the headmaster and lodged a complaint, said Murshidabad superintendent of police B.L. Meena.        
	As word about the murder spread, over 100 residents of Swapans village marched to neighbouring hamlet Bholta, where the other boy lives, and hurled stones at houses and ransacked five of them.        
	Apprehending trouble, a police team had reached Bholta before the attackers, but they were hit with stones. Deputy superintendent Taj Mohammad, a constable, a home-guard and a National Volunteer Force jawan were injured. We had to fire five rounds of blanks to disperse the mob, superintendent Meena said.        
	Although the SP maintained that the police had fired blanks, the Kandi subdivisional officer said a resident of Shisgram who was part of the mob was hit by a bullet in his leg. He (Niamat Sheikh) has been admitted to the sub-divisional hospital and an X-ray has shown a bullet lodged in his left leg, Utpal Bhadra said.        
	Swapan had gone to SMH High School on Wednesday to get his Madhyamik exam admit card. In a corner of the compound, he apparently saw the Class XI boy talking to a Class IX girl with her hand in his.         
	Headmaster Mohammad Moazzem said Swapan had narrated to him what happened after that. When he protested and said a student should not indulge in such things in school, the other boy retorted that it was their business and asked him not to interfere, the headmaster said.        
	After Swapan went to the headmaster, the latter summoned the senior student to his office and rebuked him. I had warned him and told him that if I received any such complaint in the future, he would be thrown out of the school, Moazzem added.        
	Yesterday, Swapan had gone to water his fathers small plot when the accused allegedly hit him repeatedly with a bamboo stick. He fled as Swapan slumped unconscious.        
	When some villagers found him, they took him to a health centre, from where he was referred to the subdivisional hospital 15km away.        
	Swapan regained consciousness in the Kandi hospital and gave a statement to the police before slipping into unconsciousness again. Swapan was then taken to Behrampore General Hospital, where he died at 12.30am today, a police officer said.        
	Swapans father Bablu said his son was very honest. He was killed because he had protested something that was wrong. My wife and I never went to school. He was the first in our family who was to appear for Madhyamik, said Bablu, a marginal farmer. He has another son, who is Class VIII, and a daughter who is in Class V.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Kabir with Mamata but not singing yet
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Kabir with Mamata but not singing yet
          OUR BUREAU                          Suman on Friday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 8: Kabir Suman, who had embarrassed the Trinamul Congress a few days ago by singing paeans to Maoist-backed Lalgarh leader Chhatradhar Mahato, today attended a programme with Mamata Banerjee, prompting a section of the party to suggest he had fallen in line.         
	The Jadavpur MP sat in the second row on the dais behind a host of Tollywood stars and said Shilpi kyano upekkhito hon aami jani na (I dont know why an artiste is ignored) when he was called to speak.        
	The Tollygunge area, where Mamata laid the foundation stone for a hospital named after filmmaker Tapan Sinha, is part of Sumans constituency.        
	Kabir Sumans attendance today showed his willingness to toe the party line. He has realised that nobody is above the organisation, Trinamul secretary-general and MLA Partha Chatterjee said later.         
	However, many others in Trinamul saw in Sumans advocacy for artistes a veiled criticism of Mamata, though she referred to him today as our respected MP who is also a great artiste.        
	Two days ago, Mamata had called him an honoured guest in the party while asserting that she did not endorse the songs on Chhatradhar.        
	A Trinamul source said Mamata spoke to the Jadavpur MP last night and asked him to attend todays programme without fail.         
	Suman did go but refused to sing when local MLA Arup Biswas requested him to. As a result, singer Nachiketa, with whom the singer-MP is said to have a rivalry going, was asked to perform twice.         
	Never today was Mamata seen speaking to Suman, though she managed to talk to almost everyone else on stage.        
	Suman hugged Serampore MP Kalyan Banerjee when the latter welcomed him with a shawl. But, at the end of the show, he watched from a distance as others posed for photographs with Mamata and sang We shall overcome with Nachiketa.        
	Suman and Nachiketa were last seen together on stage in August, during the inauguration of Metros extended run from Tollygunge.        
	Several Trinamul leaders said they expected Suman to kick up a storm again. He is unpredictable and incorrigible, said a party vice-president. He wont change.         
	The United Students Democratic Front, an association known to be sympathetic to Naxalites, today requested Suman to quit his Lok Sabha seat and head to Lalgarh to meet the oppressed there. The outfit circulated CDs containing Chhatradharer Gan in Presidency College.

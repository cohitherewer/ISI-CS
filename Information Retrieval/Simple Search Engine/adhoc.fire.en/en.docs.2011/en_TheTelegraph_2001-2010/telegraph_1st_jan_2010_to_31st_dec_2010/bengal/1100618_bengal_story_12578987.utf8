          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 17: The state security commission today held its first meeting to advise the administration on improved policing and security.         
	The 90-minute meeting was chaired by health and panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra at Writers Buildings. However, leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee boycotted it.        
	At todays inaugural meeting, we discussed a number of things with regard to better policing, crime prevention and detection, the security environment of the state and threat perception, Mishra said.         
	Asked why he, and not chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee who is also police minister, was heading the commission, Mishra said: That is the governments decision. I cannot comment any further on this.        
	Responding to a question on Chatterjees boycott, Mishra said: Its his decision. He has chosen to not show up. What could I have to say?        
	The minister said the commission would discuss matters under its purview and submit an annual report with its recommendations before the state government. The state government will look into the recommendations and file an action-taken report which will be submitted before the Assembly.

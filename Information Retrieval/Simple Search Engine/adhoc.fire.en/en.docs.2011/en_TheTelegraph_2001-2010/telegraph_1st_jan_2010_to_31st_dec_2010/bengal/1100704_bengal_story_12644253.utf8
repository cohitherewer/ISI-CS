The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dope danger on Kalka
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Dope danger on Kalka
  - Passengers drugged and robbed twice in two weeks        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Burdwan, July 3: A drug-and-rob corridor has popped up on the route of Kalka Mail, four of whose passengers fell prey within two weeks of a similar ruse on the same train and on the same stretch.        
	The four youths were drugged and robbed of their six monthss savings last night when the Howrah-bound train was between Mughalsarai and Burdwan.         
	Railway police said the four passengers  Bikarna Mondal, Samir Ghorui, Subhas Bhowmik and Biswajit Samanta  were returning from Kanpur where they work in jewellery shops. The four friends, all aged between 25 and 30 years, are from villages in Hooghly. They were travelling in a reserved compartment.         
	The incident, which came 12 days after six men were robbed on the same train by a gang that had drugged them after befriending them, suggests the railway authorities have done nothing to stop such crimes on long-distance trains.         
	The four friends were taken to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital where three have regained consciousness. One of them, Bikarna, said they had boarded the train from Kanpur. We got down at Mughalsarai station around 10pm to have dinner. After that, we returned to the train and were chatting when four men who had boarded the train from Mughalsarai befriended us.        
	Bikarna said the four were in their forties. They asked us where we lived and what we did. When we told them we were jewellery craftsmen, they said they knew many people in the profession and would look for better jobs for us.         
	After the train left Mughalsarai station, one of the four men, who spoke in Hindi, offered the four friends mango drinks from a cardboard carton. They also took a few bottles but did not drink. We, however, did not find anything suspicious, Bikarna said.        
	The four victims fell unconscious half an hour after taking the drinks. This morning, their co-passengers informed railway police when the train reached Burdwan. They were taken to hospital. When three of the victims came to, they realised that the gang had taken away their savings  around Rs 50,000  cellphones and luggage.        
	Railway police said a ring that robbed passengers on long-distance trains was active between Mughalsarai in Uttar Pradesh and Bihars Gaya. Long-distance trains pass through the Mughalsarai-Burdwan section late in the night, when most of the passengers are asleep. The police said the robbers took advantage of this.        
	We have taken it up with the railway authorities and requested them to launch awareness campaigns at the two stations (Burdwan and Mughalsarai). At Burdwan and Asansol stations, we warn passengers over the public address system against speaking to strangers, a Government Railway Police officer said.        
	Tanmoy Roy Chowdhury, the superintendent of railway police, Howrah, said: In Bengal, police guard general and three-tier reserved compartments in long-distance trains as most of the complaints come from there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata spares Sonia, PM in civic campaign   Pranab amp; state Cong target
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata spares Sonia, PM in civic campaign   Pranab amp; state Cong target
          BARUN GHOSH                                  Bridges intact: Sonia Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee and Manmohan Singh                                       
	Calcutta, May 8: The Trin- amul Congress will make a distinction between Congress president Sonia Gandhi and state Congress leaders, whom Mamata Banerjee has dubbed CPM agents, while campaigning for the civic polls.        
	The Trinamul chief made her targets clear last night at a get-together at artist Suvaprasannas Salt Lake home where former Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee was introduced to some of the members of her culture clan.        
	We shall target the Bengal Congress, which has broken our alliance to help the CPM. Those responsible for scuttling the peoples mahajot (grand alliance) should be exposed for acting as the CPMs agents. But national leaders like Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh should be spared, Mamata was quoted as saying by someone present at the meeting.         
	The clarification followed queries from district leaders whether they should train their guns on Sonia and the Prime Minister now that the allies were fighting each other.        
	However, that Mamata would not like to burn her bridges with Sonia and Singh had become evident last Sunday when she told a news conference she was a part and parcel of the UPA, which is not the government of the Congress alone. She had also said she would not disturb the government as long as I can work for the people with honour.        
	A Trinamul vice-president said Didis decision indicated she would stick to the Congress in Delhi, no matter what happened at the state level.        
	Cooch Behar Trinamul chief Rabi Ghosh even defended the use of the Congress presidents pictures on his partys campaign posters. We have nothing against Soniaji. She is still the head of the alliance of which Mamata is a part.         
	However, Pranab Mukherjee, the state Congress president and Union finance minister, will not be spared because Trinamul holds him responsible for the split. Didi has greenlighted our campaign against Pranabda. He was instrumental in the failure of the alliance. He had okayed the decision to field candidates from 88 wards in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, a Trinamul general secretary said.        
	Suvaprasanna, too, said the head of the Congresss Bengal unit could not deny responsibility for the split. Pranabda should have ensured the alliance at any cost. He shouldnt have broken up the alliance when it was a political necessity to oust the CPM.        
	Mukherjee was not available for comment, but the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, regretted the Trinamul decision. Pranabda had no role in deciding to go it alone in Calcutta. I had requested Mamataji a number of times to give us at least 10 seats in addition to the 25 that she had offered. But she didnt budge an inch. So, our local leaders took the decision, he said from Delhi.         
	After the formal split, the Congress went on to field 25 more candidates for the 141-ward Calcutta civic body. But Rao said: Im confident the absence of the alliance in the civic polls will have no bearing on the Assembly elections.

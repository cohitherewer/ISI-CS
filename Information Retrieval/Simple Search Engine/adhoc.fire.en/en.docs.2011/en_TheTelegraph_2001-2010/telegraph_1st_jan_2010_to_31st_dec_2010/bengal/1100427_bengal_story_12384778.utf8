The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Revolt forces CPM U-turn

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Chinsurah, April 26: The CPM leadership today took what party sources called the unusual step of re-nominating two municipal chiefs in Hooghly, apparently under pressure from the ranks, after dropping them as part of its policy to field new faces.        
	The state CPM brass at Alimuddin Street had to intervene to ensure that Arambaghs Gopal Koch and Rishras Dilip Sarkar were in the fray for the May 30 civic polls.        
	The party said it would soon take a call on the two other municipal chiefs from the district who had been dropped  Sujit Guha in Baidyabati and Samir Banerjee in Konnagar.        
	Sources said Guha and Banerjee would also find place on the candidate list. Realising that resentment in the ranks will hurt our prospects in Hooghly, where Trinamul is fast emerging as a force to reckon with, we have decided to re-nominate all four chairmen, a CPM state secretariat member said in Calcutta.        
	Such fear of the ranks would have been unthinkable a decade ago. In the late 1990s, Taltala MLA Sumantra Hira had been summarily expelled from the party after he protested at Alimuddin Street on being denied a ticket.         
	Things have changed because of the changing political situation, a party source said. He added that the party was worried after Bidhan Nagar municipality chairman Biswajiban Majumdar publicly spoke against the leadership after being denied a ward of his choice. North 24-Parganas leaders had to be closeted with him for hours to get him to agree to campaign for the party.        
	Faced with a revolt in Hooghly, CPM state secretary Biman Bose met district leaders at Alimuddin Street today. Former Arambagh MP Anil Basu was among those at the meeting.        
	Officially, the district party unit had cited the four civic chiefs failure to submit their 2005 poll expense accounts to the state election commission as the reason for not fielding them. However, commission secretary S.N. Roy Chowdhury said he wasnt aware of any failure to submit accounts.         
	The CPM is banking on new-look teams to turn around its electoral fortunes. Sources said Koch had been at the helm in Arambagh for 24 years and Sarkar for 29 years.         
	Koch, who had earlier threatened to campaign against the party, today said: The party has changed its decision taking into account the growing resentment in the ranks.        
	It is to be seen whether the decision triggers cries for similar turnarounds in other districts as well.

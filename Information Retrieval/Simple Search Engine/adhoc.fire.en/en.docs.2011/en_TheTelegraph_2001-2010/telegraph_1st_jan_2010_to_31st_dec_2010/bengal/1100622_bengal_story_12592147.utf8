	Calcutta, June 21: The CPM and its partners today told the faithful all was not lost and they still had a year to regain lost ground, in one of their final efforts to raise the morale of cadres.        
	At a gathering at Netaji Indoor Stadium to mark the 33rd anniversary of the Left Front government, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: We should be cautious about the steps we take and find out whether faults are being committed. Theres a year left. Go to the people humbly, admit your mistakes and change for the better. Those who had got hurt and moved away from us need to be brought back.        
	The almost packed stadium in some way threw up the question whether it was the fronts farewell party.         
	We have a difficult task on our hands, a big fight ahead. Remember, we will have to move forward and not backwards, the chief minister said, hinting at the possibility that the Left may not be able to retain power for the eight time.        
	RSP minister Kshiti Goswami was clear on the Lefts flagging fortunes. The situation is difficult. Now its a question of whether we will be able to stay in power or not.        
	Marxist Forward Bloc minister Pratim Chatterjee also referred to the fronts gloom and doom. We are hearing murmurs from all corners that we are losing out (charidike jeno ekta gelo gelo rab).        
	The immense erosion in the Lefts vote bank among the poor and backward communities came up in the chief ministers address. The problems being faced by these sections will have to be addressed at the earliest. We did some introspection and found that we committed mistakes.        
	Is acquisition of farmland right? If that creates panic among farmers, we should be cautious and try to learn from our mistakes. If the rural poor, the SCs and STs feel panchayats run by us didnt bother to look after their interests, we will have to rectify ourselves. If the minorities are worried about their security and feel that we havent done much for them, the issue will have to be addressed. We cannot shirk responsibility.         
	However, the chief minister ridiculed the Oppositions slogan of change. What change do they want? We had set up democratic bodies like municipalities and panchayats.... Does change mean demolishing them? We took away land from zamindars and jotedars and distributed them to the landless and marginal farmers. Do they want to change that and give back the land to the moneyed?         
	We have drawn Rs 7,000 crore worth of investments in the past year. Should I ask the investors to pack up and leave? Does the Opposition want that to justify their slogan?        
	Bhattacharjee added: You all must unite and work to defeat the forces that are creating anarchy across the state. The Opposition doesnt have any alternative programme or policy. They are here to spread panic, terror and anarchy. This will have to be explained to the people.

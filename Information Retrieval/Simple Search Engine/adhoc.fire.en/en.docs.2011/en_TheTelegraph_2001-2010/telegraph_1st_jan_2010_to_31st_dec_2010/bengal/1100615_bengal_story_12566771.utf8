	Krishnagar, June 14: A rich Nadia garment trader was found dead this morning off the railway tracks in Ranaghat, his head severed from the nearly naked body.        
	Priyanath Mazumdar, 37, had left home as usual for one of his two stores in Chakdah yesterday morning. But unlike other days, he had not returned for lunch.        
	Shop employee Biplab Roy said Mazumdar told him around 11.15am yesterday that he would be back soon. But he did not return, and neither did he make any phone call.         
	His family lodged a police complaint when he did not return home by 9pm.        
	The motorcycle on which Mazumdar had left his shop, in a supermarket about 100km from Calcutta, was found in the parking lot at Chakdah station. The body was found about 30km from his home.         
	Mazumdar left behind his wife and two sons, aged 14 and 12. His parents are also alive.         
	Wife Krishna, 30, suspects he was murdered. There is no reason why he should commit suicide. Everything was fine in the family.         
	The Mazumdars had a ro- aring business, selling readymade clothes and dress materials, local people said.         
	Police are yet to figure out whether it was murder or suicide. The place where the body was found is busy since 7am. Whatever happened must have happened before that, a railway police inspector said.

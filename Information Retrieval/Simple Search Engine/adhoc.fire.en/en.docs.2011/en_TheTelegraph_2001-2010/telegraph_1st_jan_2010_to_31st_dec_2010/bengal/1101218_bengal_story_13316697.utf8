                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Shalishi stripping
                            
	Midnapore, Dec. 17: A mother of four was allegedly stripped by a West Midnapore shalishi which accused her of encouraging a love affair between members of two religions.         
	Batasi (name changed), the wife of a day labourer, lodged a police complaint today against 11 villagers who she claimed were part of the kangaroo court held in Matkatpur village, near Kharagpur, on Tuesday.        
	The meeting decided that I should be stripped. After that, some of the villagers tore my clothes and beat me up with sticks. I was ordered to leave the village by December 16 and warned against informing the police, the 36-year-old said.        
	We have started a probe. The woman has been sent for medical check-up, district police chief Manoj Verma said.

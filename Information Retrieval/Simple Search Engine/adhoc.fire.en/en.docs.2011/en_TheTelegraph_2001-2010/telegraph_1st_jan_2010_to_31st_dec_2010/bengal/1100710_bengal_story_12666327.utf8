	Tamluk, July 9: About 50,000 candidates seeking to fill 4,000 primary teachers vacancies in East Midnapore are in a fix as Trinamul Congress-backed organisations have called strikes in the district to deter the aspirants. The partys district general secretary, Mahmood Hussain, said: We want the job exams after elections are held to the primary school council in September.

	Calcutta, Sept. 4: Three persons have been arrested for allegedly swindling a central Calcutta trader out of Rs 70,000 by promising to double the amount within a month by investing it in a construction project.     
	Saifdul Islam and Zakir Hussain were picked up from Central Avenue and the kingpin, Abbas Ali Mondal, from Hooghly. The trio had taken the money from plastic trader Ali Khan, who lives in north Calcutta, on August 30, telling him they would introduce him to the contractor within half an hour. However, the accused did not return.        
	Calcutta: The students of several city colleges affiliated to the West Bengal State University on Saturday protested anomalies in the results of the BA, BSc and BCom Part II exams. Several results were incomplete. Many students who had done well in Part I were shown as failed in the result gazette while several who had not written many of the papers in Part II were shown as passed. Varsity sources said the goof-up happened because of the rush to bring out the results within a month.

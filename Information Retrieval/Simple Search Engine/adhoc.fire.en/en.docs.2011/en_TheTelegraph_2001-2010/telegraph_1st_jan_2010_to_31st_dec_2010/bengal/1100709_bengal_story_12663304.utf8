The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM keeps Durgapur but loses stranglehold
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM keeps Durgapur but loses stranglehold
          OUR BUREAU                          The abir-smeared hand of a CPM supporter flashes the victory sign in Durgapur on Thursday. (Gour Sharma)                                  
	July 8: The CPM today won a fig leaf of a victory in the Durgapur I bypoll, the rare triumph after a string of reverses elsewhere diminished by a steep fall in the margin.         
	The CPM did manage to hold on to the seat it had never lost since 1977 but its margin plunged from 41,000 in 2006 to 8,867 votes now. Compared even with the Assembly segment lead of more than 16,000 votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, the party has lost votes. This means the erosion has worsened from last year.        
	Delimitation, which nibbled away some rural areas where the CPM was unassailable earlier, must have played some part but the fact remains that the party could not stem the slide even though the lone bypoll had given it the opportunity to concentrate all its firepower on the contest.                   
	However, there are lessons for the Trinamul Congress and the Congress. The results underscore the need for both the parties to put up a united fight, with the Assembly polls round the corner. The parties had failed to stitch an alliance before the May civic polls. But they fought together in Durgapur this time, a probable reason for the slide in the CPMs vote count.         
	The Durgapur bypoll was necessitated by the death of former power minister Mrinal Banerjee in February. Banerjee had won the seat by a margin of 41,000 votes in 2006. This time, the CPMs Archana Bhattacharya won by only 8,867 votes.        
	Bhattacharya, who defeated the Congresss Bansi Badan Karmakar, said today: I dedicate my win to our dear and respected leader Jyoti Basu and of course to the people who didnt let us down amid the strong anti-Left tide.        
	However, the Congress was quick to claim moral victory as the CPMs winning margin had gone down.        
	We think our party has won a moral victory in the bypoll because the CPM won by only 8,867 votes. The figure is about one-fifth of the CPMs 2006 victory margin and almost half of the Lok Sabha lead the Left had in 2009. We could have fared better had there been no bandh on the day of the polls (July 5), said state Congress president Manas Bhuniya.        
	He alleged that several of the Congresss traditional voters were not allowed to enter the polling booths by muscle-flexing CPM goons.         
	Echoing Bhuniya, Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee said we could have easily won the seat if the CPM had not called the bandh.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata Banerjee congratulated the Congress candidate for putting up a brave fight against the CPM nominee.        
	In 2009, the CPM had won from the industrial belt of Burdwan, which had resisted the winds of change and stood by the party. The Left had won the Durgapur-Burdwan parliamentary seat by a margin of more than one lakh votes.        
	Amid the losses the CPM suffered in the agricultural belt of Burdwan in the civic polls this time, the party managed to retain the Raniganj and Jamuria civic bodies in the districts industrial belt.        
	Amal Haldar, the CPMs Burdwan unit secretary, said the residents of Durgapur had gifted the win to our beloved Jyoti Basu on his birth anniversary. The fight was tough as the two Opposition parties were together. But the people of Durgapur wanted a change in the call for change, Haldar said.         
	Karmakar, however, blamed the CPM bandh for the loss, echoing the Congress-Trinamul line. People couldnt come to the polling booths because of the bandh. The CPM also forced many voters in the coal belt of Durgapur to stay indoors. But we are confident of winning the 2011 polls, Karmakar added.

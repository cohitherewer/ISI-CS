          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Sept. 15: Most of the male residents of the two Burdwan villages that clashed over the control of a football field yesterday have fled fearing arrest, police said.         
	The police raided Lakshmipur and Aluni, both in Purbasthali block, this morning, a day after four people were killed in the clash, but drew a blank. Only women, old men and children were present.        
	We are yet to make any arrest, a police officer said.        
	The police have set up a camp between the two villages and are patrolling the area.         
	Yesterday, the residents of the two villages had fought over which group of boys should play on the field, sandwiched between Lakshmipur and Aluni.        
	Rathindranath Mukherjee, the subdivisional police officer of Kalna, and Dilip Ganguly, the inspector in charge of Purbasthali police station, visited the villages today and spoke to the residents.        
	Some villagers demanded more police camps in the area. But we told them we have already set up one and do not have the manpower for more, Mukherjee said.         
	The chief of the Trinamul Congress-run panchayat samiti, Manasi Das, said antisocial elements had been stocking arms in the two villages. We had alerted the police earlier but they did nothing, she said.

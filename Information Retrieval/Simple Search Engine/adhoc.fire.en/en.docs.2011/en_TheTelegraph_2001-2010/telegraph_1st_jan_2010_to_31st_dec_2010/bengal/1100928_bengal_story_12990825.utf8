                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mom amp; maid killed in front of babies
          OUR BUREAU                          Police try to pacify an agitated neighbour after Mausumi Ghoshs murder at Oxytown                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 28: A young woman and her maid were killed tonight by suspected robbers in Behalas Oxytown, a neighbourhood where four murders allegedly masterminded by a schoolteacher had rocked Calcutta in 1999.        
	Police said tonights killers slit Mausumi Ghoshs throat and hit her help on the head with a heavy object like a daggers butt.         
	Mausumis two-year-old son Avirup apparently cried out ora ma ke marchhe (they are beating mom) through the window around 8pm. The attackers fled as the childs scream alerted the neighbours.        
	Some of the neighbours said they had not heard the child but sensed something was wrong when Avirup stepped out of the house weeping. We went in and were horrified to see Mausumi and the maid lying in pools of blood, said one of the neighbours.        
	Thirty-year-old Mausumi also has a nine-month-old daughter, Arjama.         
	Mausumi, her maid Parul, who was in her 40s, and the children were the only people at home. Mausumis mother-in-law had left for the local bazaar in the evening.         
	Mausumis husband Avik works in Bihars Munger. The police said he had been informed about the tragedy.        
	The police suspect it was an attempted heist that went awry as the young woman tried to resist. An officer of the local Thakurpukur police station said the house had been ransacked. The bodies of Mausumi and Parul were found blindfolded, their hands tied at the back.        
	The Ghoshes have been living at P 19A Oxytown since the 1980s. They had recently started adding a floor to the single-storey house.        
	Aviks aunt lives a few blocks away. His distraught mother was there till late tonight.        
	Paruls son and his friends refused to allow the police to take away the bodies for hours, protesting lack of security in the area.         
	Not far from the place stands the house that was once home to a family that was wiped out by killers hired allegedly by a neighbour.        
	The neighbour, a schoolteacher, allegedly had an affair with Sohini Pal, elder daughter of Bidyut and Manjulika Pal, and decided to eliminate the entire family after the 22-year-old girl became pregnant and started pressuring him to forsake his wife and child and marry her.        
	However, in 2007, a lower court acquitted him for lack of evidence. Calcutta High Court ordered his re-arrest a few months later following a plea by the CID but the Supreme Court stayed that order.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 11: Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee has called state party leaders to Delhi on Tuesday after Mamata Banerjee put the ball in their court over problems within the alliance in many of the 81 civic bodies going to the polls in May.         
	Mukherjees initiative followed a Congress teams briefing on the outcome of their Friday meeting with Mamata in which she refused to offer the Calcutta Municipal Corporation seats it wanted.        
	Besides eight members of the state Congresss core committee, Raiganj MP Deepa Das Munshi, who is overseeing the elections to the seven civic bodies in north Bengal, and North 24-Parganas district president Debi Ghosal have been called on Tuesday.         
	Ghosal has been invited because as many as 21 municipalities are going to the polls in North 24-Parganas.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief had told her ally she could not offer the 51 seats it wanted in Calcutta if some of its leaders opposed the alliance in districts like Nadia, Murshidabad and Malda, where the Congress is on a stronger footing than her party.        
	The Congress had arrived at the number 51 adding the 19 wards it had won in 2005 with those in which it emerged second.        
	There is no denying that talks to forge an alliance with Trinamul have run into rough weather in many places. We hope Tuesdays Delhi meeting with Pranabda will help resolve the impasse, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.         
	He added there was a possibility of another round of talks with Mamata in Delhi.        
	Das Munshi, who has no love lost for Mamata, said she would tell Mukherjee how Trinamul was jeopardising the alliance by demanding more seats in areas where the Congress had a bigger presence.         
	Trinamul is resorting to pressure tactics to jeopardise the alliance in north Bengal, where the Congress is a stronger force. Its leaders are asking for more seats in Cooch Behar, Malda and Jalpaiguri, where the party does not exist. But in south Bengal, where Trinamul is stronger, they are refusing to give us what we want. Against this backdrop, the alliance cant be worked out.         
	There is also trouble in Nadia and Bankura, where Trinamul was accused of trying to split the Congress.         
	Nadia Congress chief Shankar Singh today iterated that he would field candidates against all 16 councillors of Ranaghat municipality who had broken away from the party last year to join Trinamul.         
	Singh was left fuming tonight when the chairman of the party-run Birnagar municipality, Nandadulal Roy, switched to Trinamul with five counci-llors. One of the three CPM councillors on the 14-member board followed suit. We have joined Trinamul to protest Shankar Singhs high-handedness, said Roy.        
	In Bankura, the chairman of Bishnupur municipality had earlier deserted the Congress. Party workers there have refused to campaign for him if he turns out for Trinamul.        
	In West Midnapores Kharagpur, veteran MLA Gyan Singh Sohan Pal said he would not offer any seat to Trinamul if the alliance was not honourable. The Congress now runs the board there, while Trinamul sits in the Opposition.

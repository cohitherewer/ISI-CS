                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bengal laggard
                            
	New Delhi, April 6 (PTI): All states and Union territories, except Bengal, today placed in the Supreme Court affidavits detailing their policies for removal, relocation and demolition of unauthorised places of worship on public land.         
	The court noted that only Bengal had not complied with its order and granted it three more weeks. However, the leeway came with the warning that the chief secretary would be called to the court on failure to meet the new deadline.         
	In Calcutta, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: I remember signing the document five days ago. I will have to find out why it did not reach the court.         
	Last December, the apex court had directed that no unauthorised construction shall be allowed in public places in the name of temple, church, mosque or gurdwara.

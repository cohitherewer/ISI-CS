The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Over 75 die in Bihar
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Over 75 die in Bihar
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, April 14: At least 75 people were killed and thousands rendered homeless in Bihar by the storm that also ravaged North Dinajpur in Bengal.        
	Officials said the toll in Bihars Purnea, Araria, Kishanganj and Supaul districts could go up further with reports of large-scale damage and destruction trickling in from remote areas.         
	 The phenomenon, in its intense form, lasted only a minute and a half, a weather official in Patna said. In those 90 seconds, 40,000 houses were smashed and lakhs left pondering an uncertain future.        
	The wind hit the Bihar districts close to midnight. The most affected of the four districts, according to Bihars disaster management secretary, were Purnea and Araria. As many as 66 people have died in these two districts, 33 of them in Purnea.         
	As in Bengal, what is believed to have caused deaths on such a scale are the tin-shed and thatched houses that dot the affected districts.         
	Also known as Seemanchal (border area), it is usually a flood-ravaged region. People live in low-cost, easy-to-rebuild houses that failed to withstand the impact of the not-so-usual storm.         
	Purnea district magistrate N. Sarvanan Kumar said most of those killed were women and children.         
	Power and telecom lines have snapped in vast swathes of the region.        
	A resident of Jokihat block of Araria said: We saw several houses collapse and their occupants cry for help. Hundreds of trees got uprooted and darkness enveloped the area as power lines tripped.        
	Accompanied by senior officials, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar carried out an aerial survey of the affected areas and announced a compensation of Rs 1.5 lakh each for the dependents of the dead.        
	Besides, the government will provide additional financial assistance to enable the people rebuild their houses, Nitish promised.        
	Bihar Opposition leader Lalu Prasad demanded an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh.        
	Araria superintendent of police S.S. Thakur said an old wall of the district jail collapsed during the storm and the police had to shift 650 inmates to Purnea.         
	The health department has rushed doctors, mostly orthopaedics, to deal with the sudden surge of patients in Araria, Purnea, Kishanganj and Supaul.

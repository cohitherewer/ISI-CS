          INDRANIL SARKAR AND ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                               
	Mangalkot, July 15: Manas Bhuniya was back in Mangalkot today, supposedly to drive away the CPM exactly a year after he and some of his Congress colleagues were chased away by an alleged CPM gang.         
	On the same day last year, a dozen Congress MLA, including Bhuniya, were chased across marshy paddy fields by armed attackers in the Burdwan town.         
	In his 40-minute speech, Bhuniya dwelt on the CPMs reign of terror across Bengal and announced a CPM hatao programme. The protest would be organised in collaboration with the Trinamul Congress.         
	There will be no let up in our movement against the CPM till next years Assembly polls. We will organise the CPM hatao stir from Darjeeling to Sundarbans to isolate the ruling communists from the masses, he told a rally at Mangalkots Shyambazar, about 4km from Dhanyarukhi village, where the Congress MLAs were attacked.        
	Congress activists from neighbouring Birbhum and Murshidabad took part in the rally. However, Congress workers in Dhanyarukhi did not take part as CPM activists had threatened them.        
	Bhuniya did manage to put up a show of unity at the rally by bringing in Congress leaders Pradip Bhattacharya, Deepa Das Munshi and Abdul Mannan, all of whom had voiced their resentment at Bhuniyas appointment as state Congress chief.         
	K. Keshava Rao, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, who was supposed to lead the rally, could not make it because he had a meeting in Delhi.

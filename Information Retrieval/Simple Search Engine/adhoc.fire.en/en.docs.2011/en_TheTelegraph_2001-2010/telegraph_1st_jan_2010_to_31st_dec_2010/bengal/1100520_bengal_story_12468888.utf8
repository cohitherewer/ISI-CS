          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Singh, before being moved into the Midnapore hospital. (Samir Mondal)                                        
	Srinagar, May 19: Vijaypal Singh had saved many lives in Jammu and Kashmir identifying explosives similar to the one that took him out only four days after he had moved into Bengal.        
	On the Srinagar-Baramulla highway, the CRPF officer had been in charge of road clearing.         
	He had identified two powerful IEDs (improvised explosive devices) in Pattan in the past two years. Had they gone off, they would have caused a lot of destruction, said the commanding officer of the CRPFs 52 Battalion, B.S. Rawat.        
	It was with this unit that Singh had been for three years in Kashmir before heading to Bengal.        
	He was promoted only a few days ago as a deputy commandant. But I can tell you he was not happy leaving Kashmir. He had developed an affection for the place, Rawat said about the finest officer of his battalion.         
	He was affable and dedicated. The road-opening parties are our first line of defence and those who man them have to wake up early in the morning and risk their lives in identifying IEDs on roads. It is they who ensure military and civilian movement. And I can tell you that he (Singh) did the job quite well.         
	Around 5.10pm today, when the bandage-swathed Singh was stretchered into AMRI Hospital in south Calcutta, he had already breathed his last.         
	Singh, 38, hailed from Rajasthan.        
	One of his Kashmir colleagues said Singhs wife, son and daughter lived in Pinjore, Haryana. They would occasionally join him here.         
	We had nothing to do, said a doctor at AMRI.         
	Out to familiarise himself to the new terrain, Singh was blown up near the Tentulmuri bus stop in Golatore.         
	The officer was first rushed to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital and then airlifted to Calcutta.        
	He was in a coma when the helicopter took off. Blood kept oozing from the back of his head. He kept throwing up blood and we realised the internal injury was grave, said Dr Achintya Kumar Nayek, who was in the helicopter with Singh and injured constable Naba Krishna Ghosh.         
	CRPF sources in Bengal said Singh had reported to the commanding officer on Sunday and was immediately put on area domination duty after a short briefing.         
	A constable who flew in with the deputy commandant described DC saab as a very tough officer.         
	He was on duty during many of the stone-throwing incidents in Kashmir since the 2008 Amarnath land agitation.        
	Before his less-than-two-year stint in Pattan, he was posted for a year in Magam and I remember he had recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition from a hideout there. Whenever the situation demanded, he would be at the front, said Rawat.         
	The local police may have let him down in Bengal. It seems the usual checks for booby-traps had not been carried out today, a senior officer said standing outside AMRI.         
	Trying to stitch together the events that led to the attack, senior Bengal police officers said the Maoists must have realised that Singhs team would have to take one of only two routes on the way back from Ramgarh.        
	An assistant commandant of the 52 Battalion in Kashmir, who identified himself as Singhs friend, said they had met on May 7, on the eve of the last day of Kashmir his posting. Today, we are flooded with calls from his friends and acquaintances who want to know about his death.

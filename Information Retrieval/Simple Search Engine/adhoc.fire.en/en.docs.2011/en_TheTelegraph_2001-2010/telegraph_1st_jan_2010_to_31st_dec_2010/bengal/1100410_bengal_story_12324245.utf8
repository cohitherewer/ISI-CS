The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Back home, in a box
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Back home, in a box
          AMIT UKIL                          Slain CRPF jawan Asish Bagals mother wails over his coffin. (PTI)                                  
	Dhoboni (Bankura), April 9: Kanailal Bagal is still grappling with the reality of his sons homecoming.         
	We last spoke to him the evening before the incident. He was happy, and so were we, that his leave had finally been sanctioned. Ill be reaching home on the ninth, he told us. He did reach bound in a box, said Kanailal, father of the lone CRPF jawan from Bengal to have been killed in Tuesdays Dantewada massacre.         
	When will these killings stop? There are many sons out there on the front line. I pray for them.         
	The farmer in his late 50s recalled how his wife Jyotsna and he were against his son Asishs joining the CRPF. When his selection letter came through in 2003, we told him there was no need to take this job. But he said what will I do sitting at home. Ive got a chance to serve my country. We let him go, Kanailal said.         
	He is not sure whether his second son Nilkantha should take up a job in the CRPF, due to him now on compassionate grounds.        
	The coffin carrying the dead Asish reached Dhoboni village, around 200km from Calcutta, at 5am.         
	Amid shouts of shahid Asish Bagal amar rahe, the coffin went up on the shoulders of jawans as well as youths who had grown up with Asish. Among them were Suman Pal and Subrata Kadma, both younger by a few years but still very close friends.        
	We used to play together in the local cricket team. He used to be a good all-rounder. Even after joining the force, he tried his best to come down every December to take part in the local club tournament, said Subrata.        
	He used to go out of the way to help others in trouble. There are very few like him, said Suman, his voice choking.

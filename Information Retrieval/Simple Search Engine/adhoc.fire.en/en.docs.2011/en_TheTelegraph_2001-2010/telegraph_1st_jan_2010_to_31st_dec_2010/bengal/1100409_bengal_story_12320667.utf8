                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bengal jawan relives agony of five bullets
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Biplab Malakar                           
	Barrackpore, April 8: Struck by five bullets, Biplab Malakar still remembers falling off the hillock.        
	Eighty-six of us were climbing a steep hillock, some crawling, some walking, when the Maoists suddenly started firing and hurling bombs at us. I was hit by bullets and remember falling off. I lost consciousness after that. When I came to, I was in hospital, said the 30-year-old CRPF jawan from Ichhapur in North 24-Parganas, who was injured in the Dantewada attack on Tuesday. Seventy-six security personnel were killed.         
	Malakar, who underwent surgery to remove five bullets from his legs, said he was feeling better. I have not been told whether I will need an amputation, he said.         
	Malakars mother Gita said she came to know about her sons injury from one of his colleagues yesterday but no senior official had contacted her.        
	One of Biplabs colleagues called me up to say he had suffered five bullet injuries in his legs. But till now, no senior official has called us up, Gita, a resident of Maya Pally in Ichhapur, said. We are yet to know his exact condition.         
	She said Malakar had joined the CRPF in 2006 and was posted in Kashmir from where he was transferred to Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh four months ago.        
	My son had sought transfer to the eastern region after my husband died six months ago. Biplab is now the sole earning member of the family, Gita said.         
	Malakars wife Mita, whom he had married one-and-a-half years back, said he was the youngest of four siblings. Malakars sisters are married.         
	My husband is a favourite with his sisters, all of whom are elder to him. He had come home only once since his transfer to Jagdalpur. That was three months back, Mita said.         
	Gita said she had spoken to her son over the phone for the last time on Friday night. He told me he would not be able to speak to me for the next few days because he would go on an assignment into the jungles, Gita said.        
	Chhabi Dey, Malakars eldest sister, said: We saw (on TV) the death toll rising every few minutes. We got scared and did not know what to do.

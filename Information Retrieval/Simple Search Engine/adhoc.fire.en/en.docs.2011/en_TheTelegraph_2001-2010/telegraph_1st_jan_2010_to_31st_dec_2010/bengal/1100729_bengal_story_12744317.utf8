The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Three new medical colleges on state radar
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Three new medical colleges on state radar
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, July 28: Three state-run medical colleges, each having 100 seats, will be set up in Bengal and 695 seats will be added to the existing 11 medical colleges, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra announced in the Assembly today.        
	Introducing the West Bengal State Health Service (Amendment) Bill, 2010, Mishra said Malda District Hospital and Behrampore State General Hospital would be converted to medical colleges. The Sagar Dutta Hospital and adjoining ESI Hospital in North 24-Parganas will be merged into a medical college.         
	The three new medical colleges will have 100 seats each. We have also decided to increase the number of seats in the existing medical colleges by 695, Mishra said.        
	This means that almost 1,000 seats will be added to the existing 1,205 undergraduate medical seats in the state.         
	The state health department will formally send an application for setting up the colleges to the Medical Council of India (MCI) by August 31. An MCI team will visit the four hospitals to inspect the infrastructure before approving the medical colleges.         
	The health department has already sought the MCIs permission for increasing the number of seats in the existing medical colleges.         
	Mishra told the House that over the past two years, the number of postgraduate medical seats in the state had been increased by 300.         
	The health minister called for a change in the MCI rule that makes it mandatory for medical colleges in the districts to be spread over 20 acres.         
	We had earlier suggested to the MCI that like in metros, the minimum land criteria for medical colleges in districts be made 10 acres, Mishra said, adding that there should be one medical college in each district.         
	Mishra expressed concern over the shortage of medical teachers in the state, saying it could become a hindrance while seeking approval for the new colleges.         
	The MCI can derecognise an institute if the rules regarding infrastructure and personnel are not fulfilled, he said. We will have to resort to aggressive recruitment in order to fill up the vacancies. Mishra added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rajarhat complaint
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rajarhat complaint
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 15: Four Rajarhat farmers today complained to Mamata Banerjee that their land had been forcibly acquired for the township project.        
	The complaints come two days after the Trinamul Congress chief made the same allegation against the CPM at a rally in the area.         
	Rajarhat Trinamul leader Ali Ahmed, who heads the Krishi Jomi Raksha Committee there, called on Mamata this afternoon at her Kalighat home and handed the letters the farmers have written to her. Ahmed later distributed copies of the letters among journalists.         
	In the letters, Mokshad Ali, Mohammed Punjab Ali, Anwar Ali and Oli Ahmed have alleged that they had not given land to Hidco voluntarily. I had to part with my land following threats from some goons, one of the letters read.        
	The four farmers, all residents of Rajarhats Jangra-Hatiara, claimed they had been paid paltry sums ranging between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 per cottah.         
	We want to get back the land or be paid the prevailing market price for our land, another letter reads.        
	The farmers complained that Hidco had included their names in a list of voluntary land-givers mentioned in an ad published in many leading dailies yesterday.         
	Housing minister Gautam Deb, also the Hidco chairman, said tonight that he would look into the matter if copies of the letter were sent to him.

	Midnapore, Oct. 13: Suspected Maoists today gunned down a CPM leader at a village 7km from Lalgarh, three days after the party recaptured the town.        
	The murder of Tapan Dolai, 52, a member of the CPMs Belatikri local committee, has created panic in the area, which has been apprehending a Maoist retaliation since the CPMs show of strength in Lalgarh on Sunday.         
	Dolai was working in his field when four motorcycle-borne youths approached him around 7am, police said. Two of the youths shot Dolai several times, killing him on the spot. The youths then sped away, a police officer said.         
	A CPM leader in Lalgarh said the party had a strong base at Belatikri because of Dolais organisational skills. He said Dolai had stopped the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities from setting up a camp in the village.         
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma today assured puja organisers in Lalgarh that the cops would step up vigil and keep a watch on pandals.

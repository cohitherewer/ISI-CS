	Belpahari (West Midnapore), March 30: A vital lapse by police in keeping unguarded a highway stretch between Belpahari and Banspahari may have allowed injured guerrilla leader Kishan an escape route to Jharkhand a few days ago.        
	The police suspect that Kishan, believed to have been hit in a gun battle in West Midnapores Lakshmanpur on Thursday, slipped into Jharkhand early on Sunday.        
	Kishan was said to be undergoing treatment at Chhotopukuria village on Saturday when the police received a tip-off. A force set out for the place immediately but Maoists engaged it in a gun battle and halted their advance.        
	Kishan, the police suspect, took this opportunity to escape to Jharkhand, only about 6km from where he was.        
	However, police sources pointed out that to sneak into Jharkhand, the Maoists had no option but to cross the highway.        
	This is where the police blundered. Instead of deploying policemen along the entire 18km stretch between Belpahari and Banspahari, they left it unguarded and provided Kishan an easy escape to Jharkhands East Singhbhum district.        
	The police blamed the lapse on the delay in receiving information about Kishans suspected presence at Chhotopukuria. When we received the information, we simply rushed a force to Chhotopukuria, said Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore superintendent of police. We did not have enough reinforcements at hand to immediately rush a huge force to patrol the entire stretch of the highway. The Maoists were probably aware of this.        
	According to intelligence branch officers in Belpahari, Kishans aides ferried him through jungle routes to Jharkhand.         
	Without crossing the metalled road between Belpahari and Banspahari, reaching Jharkhand is impossible, an IB officer said. Leaving the stretch unguarded was a major blunder.         
	The intelligence officials said they got to know through intercepts of telephone conv-ersations among the Maoists that Kishan had taken bullets. Based on the intercepts and inputs from villagers, we learnt on Saturday evening that the injured Kishan was being treated by quacks at Chhotopukuria. But the Maoists provided cover fire to Kishan and he managed to escape.        
	The police said they had successfully cut off the supply line for any proper medical aid to reach Kishan, which is why he was at the mercy of quacks. Two quacks suspected to have treated Kishan at Chhotopukuria are now in custody.        
	The police sources said they had made a list of doctors in the region who had been treating Maoists. They have been told that their movements are being monitored and they should stop helping the Maoists.        
	That is why, the police said, the Maoists had to fall back on the quacks among the villagers. But in case of bullet injuries, quacks can do little of significance, an officer said. So it was vital for Kishan to get to Jharkhand, where we believe the Maoists have their own medical treatment centres.        
	A village-by-village search across the Belpahari area has revealed that the Maoists have fled. The only place he could have gone to is Jharkhand, an officer said.

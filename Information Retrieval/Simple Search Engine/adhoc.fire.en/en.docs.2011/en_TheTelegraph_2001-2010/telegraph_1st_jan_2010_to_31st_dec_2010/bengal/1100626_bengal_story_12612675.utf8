                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Teachers without salary
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                              
	Durgapur, June 25: Over 1,400 primary school teachers in Burdwan who had been recruited in January have not got their first salary yet.        
	The district primary school council said it had not been able to prepare pay bills and open bank accounts for them because officials had been busy with the municipal polls and the census. Also, about 25 officials have retired between December and May. All this led to the delay, council chairman Nihar Ranjan Rakshit said.        
	What Rakshit did not say while bandying out the excuses was that only 50 of the councils 250-odd employees in Burdwan were engaged in the April-May census and 70 in connection with the May 30 elections.        
	The polls took place five months after the teachers started working and yet the Burdwan council could not do what all other districts did  open State Bank or rural bank accounts for the new teachers and send their pay bills to the treasury. In Hooghly, for example, as many as 12 municipalities went to the polls  thrice the number in Burdwan  but all the 2,100 new recruits there have been getting their salaries.         
	As many as 32,000 primary teachers were recruited across the state in January. In all the districts, primary school council employees were engaged in census and civic poll work.        
	We have not had any problems, said Khitish Patra, the Hooghly council chairman.        
	School education minister Partha De said he was not aware of the plight of the new teachers in Burdwan. I will seek a report from the district primary school council and ensure that they get their salary immediately, he added.        
	A primary school teacher draws a starting salary of around Rs 12,000 a month.         
	A young teacher said he was struggling to make ends meet, especially because he would not borrow money from his parents now that he had a job. I spend Rs 22 every day on bus fare and another Rs 30-40 on tiffin. I am helpless, said Sajid Hossain of Burdwan town, who travels 30km to Bhatar for work.

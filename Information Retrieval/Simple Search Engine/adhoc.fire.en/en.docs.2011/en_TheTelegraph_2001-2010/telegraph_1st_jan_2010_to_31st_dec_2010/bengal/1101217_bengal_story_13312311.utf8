          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Dec. 16: Two women were allegedly beaten up and molested by policemen who raided an East Midnapore village of Trinamul supporters today after a clash that left two CPM supporters injured.        
	Trinamul leaders alleged that a nine-year-old girl was also beaten up in the pre-dawn raid in Sonberia, close to the CPM-dominated Sunia where cadres had been holed up for days after an abortive attempt to recapture Nandigrams Khejuri.        
	Tamluk MP Subhendu Adhikari rushed to Sonberia and admitted the injured women and the girl to the Contai subdivisional hospital. The medical report of the hospital says they were assaulted by police personnel and suffered injuries in their lower abdomen and other parts.        
	District police chief Ashok Biswas dubbed the allegations baseless. We conducted a raid in connection with yesterdays clash. Family members of the men put up a resistance and they were removed. The allegations are baseless.        
	The police team was led by additional superintendent H. Meena. According to Trinamul general secretary in East Midnapore, Mahmud Hossain, the cops first raided the house of Indubhusan Giri, a local party chief, around 1.30am but could not find him. Then they arrested his son, Subhojit, 19, said Hossain.         
	Indubhusans wife Alaka alleged she was beaten when she tried to stop her son from being picked up. The cops then went to the houses of Indubhusans two brothers nearby and allegedly beat up and molested their wives. The girl thrashed was the daughter of one of the brothers.

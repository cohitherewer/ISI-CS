          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee and Mukherjee at the foundation-laying ceremony for the AMU campus in Murshidabad on Saturday. Picture by Kaushik Pramanik                                        
	Ahiran (Murshidabad), Nov. 20: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today praised Pranab Mukherjee and the Congress veteran returned the compliment at a time his party and ally Trinamul are locked in a war of words.         
	At the foundation-laying ceremony for an Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) branch in Murshidabads Jangipur, the chief minister addressed the Union finance minister as our respected great leader. A few minutes later, Mukherjee hailed Bhattacharjee from the same stage for always extending cooperation for any development work.         
	The chief minister said: When I came to know AMU was interested in setting up a campus outside Aligarh, I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister requesting that Bengal be considered as the venue.         
	Then I called up our respected great leader Pranab Mukherjee. Now the dream has come true.         
	The chief minister added: This is a historic day for Murshidabad. We feel proud that AMU, known for modernising and secularising education in the country, now has a branch in our state.         
	Mukherjee, in whose constituency (Jangipur) the branch will be set up, said he had always got the chief ministers support over development work in the state. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee always extends cooperation for any development work, he said.        
	When we were planning a new AMU campus, the chief minister conveyed to us his interest in the project, the finance minister said. He praised the state government for its positive response to efforts in providing quality education to a vast section of the population in the backward areas of Bengal.         
	A CPM leader said the on-stage bonhomie between the two leaders was not surprising.         
	Buddhada has a high regard for Pranabbabu. He often tells us how the Union finance minister lends a helping hand whenever he is approached, the CPM leader said.         
	The Congress, however, did not appear keen to read too much into the matter. The chief minister used to maintain a working relationship with L.K Advani during the NDAs rule at the Centre. Bhattacharjees relationship with Pranabda is the same, a state Congress leader said. Just because the chief minister described Pranabda as a respected great leader does not mean he has gone overboard with his praise.        
	But the bonding between Mukherjee and Bhattacharjee was in sharp contrast to the prevailing political atmosphere in the state. The Trinamul Congress has repeatedly attacked state Congress president Manas Bhuniya in the recent past and even accused him of being a CPM stooge. Bhuniya has retaliated by warning Trinamul that such invectives could jeopardise the alliance.         
	At the programme in Jangipur, Mukherjee said Murshidabad had been chosen as the venue of the AMU branch because it has now become a backward district although it was once the capital of the area which now comprises Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.         
	The new AMU branch will benefit the entire state, not Murshidabad alone, he added. Mukherjee said the Centre had sanctioned Rs 50 crore for the AMU campuses in Murshidabad and Keralas Malappuram.         
	The Bengal government has provided 265 acres for the AMU branch here, he added.         
	Union water resources minister Pawan Kumar Bansal was present at todays event.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Late, not laggard: CM
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee at the inauguration of the Durgapur IT Park on Monday. Picture by Gour Sharma                                  
	Durgapur, Nov. 29: The chief minister today said that though Bengal had been late in developing the information technology sector, it was now one of the leading states in IT with national and multinational companies setting up units.         
	It is true that we were late in taking initiatives to develop the IT sector in our state compared with Bangalore, Hyderabad or Noida. But now we have become one of the leading states (in IT), Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said after inaugurating the Durgapur IT Park, the first of its kind in the state outside Calcutta.        
	He cited how the Left Front government had brought Infosys and Wipro, among other IT giants, to our state.        
	Bhattacharjee said that earlier, IT companies campuses in Bengal had been confined only to Sector V in Salt Lake but his government now had plans to take them beyond Calcutta. We have plans to set up IT parks across the state.        
	The West Bengal Electronics Industry Development Corporation Ltd (Webel) has set up the Rs 21-crore IT park on a 2.21-acre plot provided by the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority.         
	The chief minister said that initially, a six-storey building with 5,642sqft space had been built at the park. At least 12 IT companies can set up their offices in the building.        
	He said the unique feature of the building was that if any company wanted to set up an office there, we will take only 24 hours to provide them space with the necessary infrastructure.        
	Bhattacharjee went on: One can walk in with a laptop and start business here. In the near future, more such buildings would be built at the park.        
	The Durgapur-based IT company ITRIX Technologies has set up its office on the ground floor. Three more companies have finalised agreements to open units in the building, sources said.        
	The chief minister said his government was taking initiatives to promote agriculture-based, knowledge-based and biotechnology industries, apart from the manufacturing sector.        
	He said skilled youths were needed to set up such industries. For that, we will introduce vocational training courses in schools. Everybody cant get a first-division, or star marks, in their exams. We will train the mediocre students too in vocational courses so that they can find jobs.        
	IT minister Debesh Das, who was at the inauguration programme, said the IT park had come up silently and without any publicity.        
	In an apparent dig at Mamata Banerjee, Das said: We were quiet about it because we believe in work. We dont believe in only laying foundations.        
	The CPM has repeatedly accused the railway minister of promising industries through newspaper ads but doing nothing after that.        
	Das said the Durgapur IT Park would provide jobs to 1,000 youths within the next few months. He said the government planned to set up computer-repairs training centres as 14,000 computer sets have been provided to around 1,400 schools.         
	Later in the day, Bhattacharjee addressed a rally organised in Burdwan by CPM youth wing DYFI. He accused the Trinamul Congress of creating unrest in the state with the help of Maoists.

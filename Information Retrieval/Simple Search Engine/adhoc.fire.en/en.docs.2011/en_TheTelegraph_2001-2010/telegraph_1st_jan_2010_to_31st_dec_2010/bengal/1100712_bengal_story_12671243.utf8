The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Anita follows Sovan, to meet Asok
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Anita follows Sovan, to meet Asok
          BARUN GHOSH                                    
	Calcutta, July 11: Bidhannagar municipality chairman Anita Mondal has decided to meet municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya to discuss development projects for Salt Lake, apparently taking a leaf out of fellow Trinamul Congress leader and mayor Sovan Chatterjees book.         
	Mondal said she would meet Bhattacharya, who is also the urban development minister, in a day or two. Sovan Chatterjee had recently met Bhattacharya on the ministers request to discuss development projects.         
	Mondal told The Telegraph over the phone this evening: Bhattacharya wrote to me, requesting me to meet him to discuss some development projects for Bidhannagar. He had called me up last Wednesday with the same request but I could not meet him as I had a meeting with Parthada (Partha Chatterjee, leader of the Opposition). I will certainly meet Bhattacharya in a day or two.         
	She stressed peoples welfare, asked if she was running the risk of incurring Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjees wrath by meeting a Left Front minister.        
	 I believe there is no harm in discussing development projects with the state government because peoples welfare is my primary concern, Mondal said.        
	A few Trinamul leaders lauded Sovan Chatterjee and Mondal. Such public pronouncements fuelled some degree of speculation if they had Mamatas silent, if not vocal, blessings and whether the Trinamul is experimenting with a subtle shift in anticipation of a change of guard at Writers next year.               
	As civic body chiefs, both Sovan and Anita are doing the right thing. If you are at the helm of a civic body, you will have to collaborate with the state government while implementing welfare schemes. I also did the same during my stint as Calcutta mayor, Trinamul leader Subrata Mukherjee said.         
	Sources said several Trinamul leaders and party workers did not approve of Mamatas continuous opposition to the Left Front government. They believe that Mamata could face resistance from the Left if she came to power after the next Assembly polls.         
	However, no one from the party has shown the courage to discuss the matter with Mamata.         
	A junior central minister from Trinamul suggested that Mamata should take a lesson from the snub handed to her by PWD minister Kshiti Goswami who today boycotted a railway programme in Dhakuria where Mamata flagged off three trains.         
	Some Congress leaders from Gujarat also had the same advice for Mamata. We oppose the Narendra Modi government tooth and nail. But when it concerns the states development, we keep aside our opposition, Gujarat Congress chief Siddharth Patel said today over the phone.         
	A north Calcutta Trinamul legislator today expressed displeasure at Mamatas rejection of housing minister Gautam Debs invite to an event to hand over flats to subscribers in the Rajarhat New Township.

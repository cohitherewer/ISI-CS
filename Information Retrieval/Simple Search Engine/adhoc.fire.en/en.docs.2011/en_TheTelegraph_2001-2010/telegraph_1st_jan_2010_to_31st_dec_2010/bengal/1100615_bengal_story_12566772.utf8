The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist fear stalls teacher hire
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoist fear stalls teacher hire
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, June 14: The recruitment of teachers for 150 primary schools across six West Midnapore blocks has been suspended as no job aspirant wants to work there because of the fear of Maoists.        
	The district primary school council had planned the drive to provide a second teacher to 150 schools that have a lone teacher now. The plan was aborted as the council realised it would struggle to find so many teachers for that region.        
	Over 3,100 people will be sent appointment letters for jobs in primary schools elsewhere in the district, but some 30,000 children in the Lalgarh region will have to make do with a lone teacher in their schools.        
	We are unable to recruit teachers for 150 primary schools since nobody is interested in going there fearing Maoists threats and attacks, said an official of the district primary school council.        
	In March, 50 teachers had either refused to report to work or fled after the first few days in primary schools in Salboni, Belpahari, Lalgarh, Binpur, Goaltore and Jhargram blocks. In March, we had recruited 50 teachers for the Maoist-hit blocks. But none of them agreed to work. We were forced to transfer them elsewhere in the district, district inspector of schools (primary) Madhup De said.         
	An official said there were about 1,500 primary schools in the six Maoist-hit blocks, but 150 of them were in the core area where the Maoist writ runs.        
	Those who had refused to work in March had complained about Maoist extortion threats and demands to make the Santhali language the medium of instruction.         
	Many teachers in the region pay a part of their salary to the Maoists. A primary school teacher in Salboni said they gave between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 a month. It is a matter of survival for us, said another teacher.

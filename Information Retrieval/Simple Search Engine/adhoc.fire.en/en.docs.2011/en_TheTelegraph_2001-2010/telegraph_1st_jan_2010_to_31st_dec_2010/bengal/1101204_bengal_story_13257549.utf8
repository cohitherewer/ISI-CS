	Tamluk, Dec. 3: Workers at Haldia dock today called off their strike after the authorities agreed to reduce the frequency of night shifts.        
	The authorities today agreed to a middle path and settled for a weeks night duty every month, a climbdown from a recent order making it mandatory for workers to work the night shift once every three weeks.         
	Around 500 workers at six berths of the dock had struck work since Wednesday evening after the authorities decided to increase the frequency of night shifts from one week in every five weeks to one in every three. The workers, affiliated to four unions, had cited serious health reasons to refuse to accept the order.        
	Today, the strike was called off following a four-hour meeting between the authorities and union representatives.        
	Citu leader Mukul Sen, who attended the meeting, said: We have withdrawn the strike after the management accepted our demand. Workers have started joining duty from tonight.        
	In the morning, the workers, all permanent employees, had scuttled the authorities move to use contract labourers for loading and unloading.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong seeks concession
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong seeks concession
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 9: Mamata Banerjee will not concede the Congresss demand for more seats in next months municipal elections, Trinamul Congress sources said after a meeting between the two parties this evening.        
	The Congress had demanded all the seats that its candidates had won in 2005 as well as those in which it had come second.        
	Officially, the Trinamul chief told her ally more meetings were needed before a seat-sharing deal could be sealed.         
	However, a party general secretary said tonight Mamata had told her aides the alliance for the civic polls would be worked out on her terms. Let the Congress place its demands, but Mamatadi wont entertain them.        
	The Congress team, though, returned optimistic. Mamata said she would take a decision after discussing our demand in her party. We are optimistic that she would accommodate us, state party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said after the 95-minute meeting at Mamatas home. The other state Congress working president, Subrata Mukherjee, and legislature party chief Manas Bhuniya were among those who attended.        
	If Mamata concedes, she will have to let her ally contest at least 51 of the 141 Calcutta Municipal Corporation seats. In 2005, when the two parties did not have an alliance, the Congress had won 19 wards in the city but emerged second in 32.         
	Among the 80 other civic bodies going to the polls in end-May, the Left controls 59. The Congress has 13 and Trinamul only three. The two Opposition parties together control another five boards.         
	 We deserve a fair share of seats in all 80 civic bodies because we had performed better than Trinamul in 2005, a Congress leader said.        
	But the ground situation has changed dramatically in the five intervening years.         
	After todays meeting, Mamata and the Congress leaders held a joint news conference and declared that they would fight together to ensure the CPMs ouster from Bengal.         
	We shall take our alliance forward to the 2011 Assembly polls, Mamata said. The parties promised a joint movement after the Bengali New Year.

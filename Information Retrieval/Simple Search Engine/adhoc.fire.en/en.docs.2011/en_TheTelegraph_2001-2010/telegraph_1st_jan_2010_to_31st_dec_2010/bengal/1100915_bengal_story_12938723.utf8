          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Midnapore, Sept. 14: Suspected Maoists today fired on a boat ferrying villagers in the West Midnapore pocket where five CPM supporters were killed yesterday.        
	A CPM supporter and a three-year-old child were injured in the 5pm attack in Nayagrams Patina, where the rebels had killed five persons, all from the same family, yesterday.         
	Police believe the target today was a CPM leader who was among those the rebels had come looking for yesterday but did not find. Kanai Dutta, a local committee member, jumped into the river and saved his life.         
	The rebels crawled out of the bushes along the Subarnarekha and sprayed bullets on the boat, which had around 15 passengers.        
	Jhargram police chief Praveen Tripathi said many people could have been killed. The rebels had sophisticated weapons. There could have been many casualties. It appears Kanai Dutta was the target.        
	CPM supporter Santosh Bera took three bullets in his chest, shoulder and waist. One hit the mirror of a motorcycle loaded on the boat and a shard from it slammed into little Bunu, who was with his mother Gita.         
	Many passengers jumped into the river and waded to the bank screaming for help.        
	Elsewhere, suspected Maoists shot dead a CPM supporter, Kaliram Mahato, 50, at Jeera village near Jhargram town last night. The rebels left behind posters saying Kaliram was a police informer.        
	3 killed in Burdwan        
	Two Trinamul supporters and a CPM activist were killed in separate incidents in Burdwan, signalling a rise in political clashes ahead of next years Assembly election.        
	Police said Panchu Ruidas, 60, and Esha Mullick, 52 died after being hit by arrows in Jamalpurs Moidipur, a CPM stronghold.        
	In the other incident, CPM worker Malek Sheikh, 23, was shot dead at Mathpara in Ketugram.

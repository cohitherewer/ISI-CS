	Calcutta/Chinsurah, Dec. 5: Maoists have a deal to get arms and training from Manipur insurgent group Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak), arrested rebel kingpin Sudip Chongdar alias Kanchan has told interrogators.        
	Maoists started procuring arms and ammunition from Prepak, which has also agreed to send its men to train the new recruits of the CPI (Maoist). Dense forests in Orissa and Jharkhand have been selected for such training camps, said Rajeev Kumar, the chief of the special task force (STF), which picked up Kanchan and four other rebels over the past two days.        
	An STF source suggested the Maoists are flush with funds they collect from mining companies in Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand through extortion and use the cash to buy arms from the Manipur outfit.        
	The deal with Prepak, which is fighting for an independent homeland, was struck around eight months ago, Kanchan has told STF sleuths.        
	The Maoists struck the deals as they are short of arms and ammunition after their suppliers were caught by police. They have enough funds extorted from mining companies, said the source.        
	The rebels have called a two-day Bengal bandh from December 8 against the five arrests.         
	Kanchan, the Maoists Bengal chief, was held along with fellow state committee members Anil Ghosh alias Ajitda, Barun Sur alias Bidyut and Kalpana Maity alias Anu. Another member of the CPI (Maoist), Bimal Mullick, was also picked up.        
	Kanchan has denied any rift between Kishan, the chief of the Maoists guerrilla wing, and the state committee. In the past, the police and the intelligence agencies had spoken of differences on strategy between Kishan, also a politburo member of the CPI (Maoist), and the leaders of the rebel outfits Bengal unit.         
	Kalpana told the police Kishan, who the cops believed was injured in a West Midnapore encounter around six months back, is in good health in a Chhattisgarh hideout. The police said Kanchan and Kalpana had rented a house in Chandernagore in Hooghly posing as a married couple. I recognised them the moment I saw their photos on TV. They left our house 12 days ago saying one of their family members was ill, said house owner Sikha Nandy.

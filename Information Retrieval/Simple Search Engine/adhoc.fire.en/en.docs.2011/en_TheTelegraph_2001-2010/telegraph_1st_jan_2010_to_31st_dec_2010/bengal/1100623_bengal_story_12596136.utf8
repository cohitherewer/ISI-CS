The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Adivasis open to statehood talks
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Adivasis open to statehood talks
          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 22: The Terai-Dooars unit of the Adivasi Vikas Parishad today wrote to the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha it was willing to discuss the proposal for a joint movement for a state called Gorkha Adivasi Parishad, in defiance of the outfits state leaders.        
	The letter has come as a shot in the arm for the Morcha, on the backfoot because of the backlash after the murder of ABGL leader Madan Tamang.        
	Since the Morcha launched its statehood movement two years ago, the Parishad had been insisting that the so-called Gorkhaland should not include the Dooars and Terai.         
	We had written to the Parishad asking them to sit for talks on the issue. Today, we received a letter from them stating they were willing, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said in Darjeeling.        
	John Barla, the convener of the Parishads Terai-Dooars unit, confirmed the letter and said: We have not joined the movement yet. We have asked for time and will let them know in a day or two.         
	About 40 per cent of the population in the Dooars and Terai is Adivasi. The Gorkhas, too, constitute 40 per cent of the population while the rest are Bengalis.        
	Since the Morcha promised to rechristen Gorkhaland the Gorkha Adivasi Parishad, Barla had been keen to sit for talks but his state leaders had prevented him from doing so.        
	Today, Barla said: There is no need to involve the state leaders in this as it is a decision concerning our region.

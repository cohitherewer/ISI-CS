The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | NSG told to get land on its own
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      NSG told to get land on its own
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 28: The National Security Guard has been told to procure the land if it wants a 600-acre training facility in Dankuni, about 20km northwest of Calcutta.        
	NSG director-general N.P.S. Aulakh met state home secretary Ardhendu Sen today to discuss the possibilities of finalising the Dankuni training facility.        
	I surveyed the location today where wed like the training hub to come up, Aulakh said after the 40-minute meeting at Writers Buildings.        
	However, the state made it clear that it couldnt be expected to acquire the land for the force. Dankuni is only about 20km from Singur, where the state has burnt its fingers once. They (the NSG) would like the training hub to come up at Dankuni. They need 600 acres for the purpose. They would (have to) purchase the land directly, Sen said.        
	The training unit will replicate the facilities at the NSGs Manesar training centre. Together with the hub (at Kaikhali near Calcutta airport), it would significantly reduce the response time in case of a terror strike, Aulakh said.        
	The Centre had decided to set up four regional hubs  in Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Calcutta  after 26/11, when commandos took nine hours to reach the scene of action from their lone centre in Delhi.         
	The Kaikhali hub, with about 250 commandos, was operationalised on July 1 last year.

  - Schoolchildren do what adults cant        A STAFF REPORTER                          Students of Aditya Academy Senior Secondary perform at the culmination of the Better Calcutta Contest 2009-10 at the Science City auditorium. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Calcutta, Jan. 30: They didnt adopt a pet. Or a child in need. Instead, Aditya Academy Senior Secondary adopted an entire village.        
	If last year the Barasat school had saved a pond, this year its students planted saplings to check its erosion, taught women to make paper bags and raised money to get the village with no electricity a solar-powered streetlight.        
	No wonder Aditya Academy won the ICC Trophy at the Better Calcutta Contest 2009-10 Award Ceremony, jointly sponsored by The Telegraph and the ICC Calcutta Foundation.         
	The 12th edition of the contest, which culminated at the Science City auditorium today, focused on Ecological Solutions for Sustainable Development.        
	All of us from Classes IX to XII have been spending three-and-a-half hours every week at the village for over three years. We have made compost heaps from the waste matter there, recycled their non-biodegradable wastes and even taught them to separate wastes into degradable and non-biodegradable piles, smiled Aleepta Guha Roy, a Class XI student.        
	That summed up the spirit of the contest, an initiative by the ICC Calcutta Foundation, to improve social and environmental awareness among future citizens. Of the 32 schools that enrolled this year, 27 qualified for the awards. There were five trophies in three categories  the ICC Trophy (with Rs 20,000), The Telegraph Trophy (with Rs 14,000 to each winner) and the Rasoi Trophy (with Rs 10,000 to each winner)  plus Special Merit Awards for seven schools with Rs 5,000 each and Merit Awards for 15 schools with Rs 3,000 each.        
	The jury comprised Beth A. Payne, the US consul-general, Swades Bhattacharya, adviser, environment management centre, ICC, Rakhi Sarkar, trustee and honorary general secretary, ICC Calcutta Foundation, and Rajeev Singh, director-general of the ICC. They evaluated the schools on the basis of video recordings, the reports of evaluators, and the reports submitted by the schools, before visiting the institutions.         
	Aditya Academy won the ICC Trophy. Apeejay School, Salt Lake, and St Xaviers Collegiate School got The Telegraph Trophy.         
	The St Xaviers students installed a system of rainwater harvesting on the rooftop of their new building to help water the school gardens and clean the campus. The school has also harnessed renewable energy by installing solar panels and the power generated is being used to run office computers. The students at Apeejay reached out to the slum dwellers near the Kestopur canal, and with the permission of the Bidhannagar Municipality helped build a public lavatory for them and also a garden.        
	The Rasoi Trophy went to Chowringhee High School  for rebuilding a public lavatory, installing a solar lamp on its compound and distributing paper bags to local traders  and to La Martiniere for Boys  for adopting a CMC park, planting trees and getting the civic body to repair a portion of the broken wall.

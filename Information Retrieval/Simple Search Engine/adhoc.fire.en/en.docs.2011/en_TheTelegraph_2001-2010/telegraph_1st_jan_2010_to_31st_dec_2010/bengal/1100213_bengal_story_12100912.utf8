          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Feb. 12: The project manager of a company engaged for the expansion and modernisation of the IISCO Steel Plant in Burnpur was shot dead last night outside his rented flat in Asansol town.        
	Satish Kumar Pillai, 36, from Tiruvalla in Kerala, was playing with his toddler daughter after returning home from work when he got a call on his mobile and stepped out.        
	His wife heard a gunshot 15 minutes later. I saw my husband lying on the ground with his face down. The back of his shirt was blood-soaked. I screamed for help, said Rajyashri.        
	Neighbours took Pillai to hospital, where a doctor said: The bullet entered from the back, went through his heart and left the body.        
	The assailant had spent only one bullet. A cigarette stall owner across the road said a man riding pillion on a motorcycle had shot Pillai. I was in my shop when I saw two men on a motorcycle drive up to him as he was about to enter his house. The man riding pillion shot him, Harihar Yadav said.         
	Pillai, a commerce graduate, was an employee of the Kerala-based General Industrial Builders (GIB).         
	Police are looking into two things. First, the recent sacking of a project supervisor with an alleged drinking problem. Second, allegations against Pillai that he had taken money from people promising them jobs in the project.        
	The supervisor, also from Kerala, disappeared from his Asansol flat yesterday afternoon, said additional superintendent of police Prasun Banerjee.        
	Pillais links with suppliers of building materials are also being probed. Circle inspector Gour Mukherjee said Pillais company was involved in civil construction.        
	GIB officials declined comment, saying the murder had taken place outside the project area. Rajyashri has left for Kerala with the body.

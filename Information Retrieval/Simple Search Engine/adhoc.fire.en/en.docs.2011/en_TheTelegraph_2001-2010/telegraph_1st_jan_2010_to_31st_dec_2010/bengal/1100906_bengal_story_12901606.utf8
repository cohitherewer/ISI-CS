                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      President reaches out to help war hero
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Behrampore, Sept. 5: A Nadia fisherman who won a Shaurya Chakra for pulling out 150 Indian soldiers from a turbulent river during the 1965 Pakistan war but lies bed-ridden in penury now will receive Rs 25,000 from the President.        
	District magistrate S. Bhattacharya said Pratibha Patils office had contacted the local authorities a few days ago seeking a report on Atul Haldar and his bank account details. The 80-year-old has been bed-ridden since a cerebral attack last year.         
	Rashtrapati Bhavans attention was drawn by a report on Haldar  who has been deserted by his four sons lying sick without any money for treatment in the July 30 edition of The Telegraph.         
	We have sent the details and expect a cheque of Rs 25,000 from Rashtrapati Bhavan any moment, said Bhattacharya. Haldar has also received Rs 10,000 from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	The resident of Nadias Majdia was brought home today from a Krishnagar nursing home where he had been admitted for the past few days after the family spent all the money they had.        
	Dr Subhas Saha, who treated him there, said Haldar had brain tumour. Haldars wife Ganga, aware the Presidents aid would arrive soon, is worried the money may still not be enough. Haldar gets a Shaurya Chakra monthly pension of Rs 1,500.         
	On September 18, 1965, Haldar, then 35, and his father had rescued the jawans after their vessel capsized in the Ichhamati.

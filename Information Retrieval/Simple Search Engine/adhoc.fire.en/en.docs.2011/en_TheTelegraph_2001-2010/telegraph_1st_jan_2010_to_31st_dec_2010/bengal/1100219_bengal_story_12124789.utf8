The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Our sir the first to flee: Constable
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Our sir the first to flee: Constable

	Shilda, Feb. 18: A constable has said Subedar Hastamukh Rai, the in-charge of the Shilda camp, was the first to scale the wall and flee when the Maoists launched the attack on Monday.        
	The anger of the policemen who survived the attack erupted today with many accusing Rai of being callous and not ensuring security.         
	Shishu Chhetri, an Eastern Frontier Rifles constable, said he had stepped out of the Shilda camp around five on Monday evening to have tea with colleague Mikan Tamang when the Maoists struck. They recognised us even though we were in plain clothes and not carrying any weapons, Shishu told The Telegraph.         
	One of them approached Mikan and fired a bullet in his stomach, killing him. He then pointed the revolver at me but I pushed him down and ran away. I returned only when the joint forces reached the camp later that night. One thought that crossed my mind while I was running was that had our sir (subedar Rai) listened to us and put more security in place, perhaps this attack could have been averted.         
	Another EFR constable, Amiya Tamang, who was inside the camp when the firing started, said Rai was the first to escape.        
	Our boss was on leave for a few days but was present at the camp, Amiya said.         
	Though he was on leave, he did what he normally does when he is on duty: sleep and relax and complain about us. When the Maoists attacked our camp, the first person to flee was our sir. I saw him rushing to the back of the camp, scaling the wall and escaping. So what if he was on leave? He could have picked up a gun and fought. He should have led from the front instead of running away like a coward. I also ran away after I saw him escape.        
	Some constables at the EFR camp said they had repeatedly told Rai to put up bunkers and a small tower for a radio transmitter like most other camps but Rai had taken no action.        
	Bhim Raj, another constable who survived the attack, said: We had told Rai many times that the security set-up at the camp was not adequate. We had asked him to speak to his seniors about the lack of sandbag bunkers at the two entry points but to no avail.        
	Shishu said Rai returned to the camp only after the joint forces reached the spot. However, he alleged that Rai did not bother to find out about the plight of his juniors. He did not even go inside the camp to inspect the damage.        
	Amiya said: I asked him how he was and what would be our line of action but he did not reply.        
	The inspector-in-charge of Binpur police station, Zulfiquar Ali Mollah, to whom Rai reports, said the subedar often kept him in the dark about the happenings at the camp.         
	Mollah, however, admitted a lapse on his part, saying he had information about a Maoist build-up near Shilda but did not act because there was no information of any attack on the camp.         
	Mollah said Rais conduct was being probed.        
	Rai could not be contacted as he was at the EFR headquarters in Salua.        
	Some police officers said Rais seniors should also share the blame for not carrying out checks at the camp to ascertain if all security measures were in place.        
	It is the job of the senior officers to check the lapses on the part of their subordinates, an officer said. Rai may have been lax but it was the job of his seniors to detect that.        
	Mollah said he had not taken any action as intelligence inputs came on a routine basis. Everyday, we receive such inputs, so it is not possible for us to verify each and every such report.

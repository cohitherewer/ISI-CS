	Calcutta, Feb. 20: The Forum mall off Elgin Road today received a phone call around 6.50 in the evening, saying a bomb had been planted inside one of the theatres, but it later turned out to be a hoax.         
	The screening of My Name is Khan was stopped and people were asked to vacate the mall. The police conducted a search for two hours but found nothing. Mall authorities have promised a refund for those who missed the show.

	Calcutta Dec. 14: The state government today filed an affidavit in Calcutta High Court saying it had not issued any notification declaring Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities a banned outfit.         
	But as it was acting as a frontal body of the CPI (Maoist), the committee came under the purview of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), the government said.        
	According to the UAPA, members of any frontal organisation of the CPI (Maoists) can be tried under it, public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CISF-like force after threat to industrialists
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CISF-like force after threat to industrialists
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Match 4: The Bengal government has announced it will raise a CISF-like force to guard government and industrial installations, saying that such a squad has become particularly important in the light of extortion calls to businessmen.        
	The need for such a force has become particularly important after it came to light that calls had been made to some industrialists who have been threatened with dire consequences if they failed to pay up, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said today.        
	Asked if industrialists would be guarded by the proposed force, Sen said: We do not rule out the possibility.        
	At Writers Buildings, Sen said that a battalion  1,000 personnel  each would be raised for Calcutta and the rest of the state. This would take four to five months to set up.        
	Two separate battalions for Calcutta and the state will be there. It will take a few months after the finance department gives the go-ahead. Private establishments will have to pay for the deployment. We are working out the cost of raising the force. We hope to recover the cost in 10 years by charging the private installations, Sen said.        
	Although the government had been gauging the need for such a force for some time, the announcement came a few days after two industrialists went to police to report alleged extortion threats.        
	Over the past few months, we had been considering whether an industrial security force can be raised in our state in order to provide security to government and private establishments and installations in the state. Accordingly, we sent a draft proposal to the state finance department a few weeks ago for approving the creation of such a force, Sen said.        
	He added that the force would be patterned on the lines of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).        
	The force will guard establishments. Industrialists have their own private security and some of them have them in heavy numbers. However, we do not rule out the possibility of members of the new force guarding industrialists, Sen said.        
	Extortion calls tagged with abduction threats were made to two city industrialists a few days ago but the matter came to light after they filed police complaints on March 1.         
	Family members of some industrialists recently met chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, who advised them not to venture out to places deemed unsafe after midnight.        
	Advice to business        
	The home secretary today said industrialists should contact the Calcutta police commissioner if they receive threat calls. After getting such calls, they (industrialists) should contact the police commissioner immediately and go by his advice. They should not hand over extortion money.        
	Sen refused to divulge the names of the industrialists who had been threatened. We dont want to disclose this now. According to them, they got the calls for the first time in their lives, he said, adding that it was still not clear if the calls were made from within India or abroad.        
	We are also not sure of the gangs that are operating and whether they were from abroad. More than one gang may be involved. Investigations are being done.

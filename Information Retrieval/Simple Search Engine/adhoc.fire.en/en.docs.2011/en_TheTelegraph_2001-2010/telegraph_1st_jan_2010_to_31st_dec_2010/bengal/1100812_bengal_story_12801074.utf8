          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Aug. 11: A schoolgirl in Burdwan hanged herself after being allegedly forced by police to file an attempt to rape case even though she had complained of a molestation bid.        
	Maman Das, a Class XII student, was also allegedly sent for a medical test against her wish by the officers of Burdwan town police station where she had gone yesterday to lodge a complaint against Raju Thapa, whose marriage proposal she had spurned.         
	Unable to bear the humiliation by the police, Mamon, 19, committed suicide at her home in Burdwan town, her uncle Khokan Das alleged.        
	He said Mamon was waylaid by Thapa yesterday. He tried to molest her but Mamon managed to escape. After Mamon complained to her two brothers, they went to Thapas house with some local youths in neighbouring Kajirhat.        
	Thapa, an unemployed youth, was not at home. His friends clashed with Mamons brothers and their accomplices when the group informed Thapas friends about the molestation bid. Mamons brothers, Sumit and Amit, then took her to the local police station. At 2am today, Mamons sister-in-law found her hanging from the ceiling.

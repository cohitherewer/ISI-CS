The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Second farmer suicide in drought belt
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Second farmer suicide in drought belt
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Aug. 23: Drought and debt have apparently driven a second farmer to suicide in Burdwan.        
	Jitu Bagdi, 28, a resident of Karotia village, laced his drink with pesticide and gulped it down on Saturday morning, the same day that Yunus Sheikh committed suicide after suffering losses because of scanty rainfall. Jitus village is just 5km from Yunuss Basantapur village in Ausgram.         
	Jitu, a sharecropper, died at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital last night. Both farmers killed themselves hours before the chief minister visited the district to review the drought-like condition.        
	Nakari Bagdi, 45, Jitus brother-in-law, said the farmer had failed to repay Rs 10,000 he had borrowed from moneylenders last year.         
	This year too, Jitu borrowed Rs 22,000 at a monthly interest of 10 per cent to cultivate the aman crop. However, because of the lack of rain for the past one month, the saplings turned yellow and dried up, Nakari said.        
	Jitus cousin Mohan, 30, also a sharecropper, said Jitu had been depressed as he watched the crops shrivel.        
	He had been telling me that he would not be able to save his crops because of the lack of rain, Mohan said.         
	He said he felt helpless because he had six mouths to feed, Mohan added. Jitu has left behind his wife Rupa, elderly parents, son Gira, 6, and daughter Munmun, 7.         
	No one else was present in the house when Jitu drank pesticide. His parents had gone to work in the fields with Rupa while his children had gone to school.        
	When Jitus wife and parents returned home for lunch around noon, they found him lying unconscious in the veranda, frothing at the mouth.        
	After Rupa raised the alarm, villagers rushed to their home and took Jitu to Nabagram health centre. On Saturday evening, he was shifted to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital where he breathed his last at 11pm yesterday.        
	Moneylenders had been pestering him. My husband was in no position to pay. His crops had dried up and he had not gone to work for the past seven days because he was depressed. He seldom spoke and hardly ate anything. I was feeling very tense. Now, I dont know what to do, Rupa said.         
	The subdivisional officer (SDO) of Burdwan (north), Arindam Neogi, said: We have found out that Jitu had electricity at his home and even owned a colour TV. We dont think debt and failed crops were the only reasons behind his death. We have information that he used to drink regularly and quarrel with his wife, Neogi said.        
	The SDO had a word of caution for reporters. Please write carefully. Dont make it look like something from Peepli Live (a film that tells the story of distressed farmers committing suicide).        
	Rupa, however, said her husband was not a drunkard. Let the SDO come and see how we live. We had electricity two years ago and we dont own a colour TV. Let the babu ask our neighbours if my husband was a drunkard, she said.        
	Black flag at CM        
	Two Youth Congress supporters were arrested today for breaking the police cordon and waving black flags at the chief minister when his convoy reached Midnapore town. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had gone to the district to review the drought-like condition prevailing there.

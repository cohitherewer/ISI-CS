          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Nov. 25: A Class IV boy was electrocuted this morning after touching a telephone towers barbed-wire fence that had been allegedly connected to a live wire by the guard to keep off intruders in his absence.         
	Around 7am, Saiful Sheikh, a resident of Murshidabads Dayanagar village, had gone to the field where the Vodafone tower was located. He was apparently electrocuted after touching the fence.        
	The boy did not know the fence around the tower had been electrified. He touched it and was killed on the spot, a police officer said.        
	The guard, Kajem Sheikh, is absconding.         
	Ten-year-old Saifuls father Tahajul Sheikh alleged Kajem never stayed in his room at the base of the tower at night. He used to go home every night, Tahajul said.        
	He added: He used to electrify the fence every night before going home so that no one could come near the tower in his absence.         
	The police said Kajem had tied one end of a wire to the fence while the other end was connected to the main switch in a room at the base of the tower. They added thieves usually eye copper cables and batteries used in generators and inverters at telephone towers.         
	Tahajul, a farm labourer, has lodged a police complaint against Kajem, the guards brother Sherful Haque, who is the owner of the plot where the tower is located, and the Vodafone officer in charge of the tower.         
	Angry villagers hurled stones at the fence after Saifuls death. They then removed the live wire from the fence with the help of a bamboo pole.         
	Additional superintendent of police Deepnarayan Goswami said the landowner, Sherful, had gone for Haj to Mecca.         
	Goswami said the police had gone to Kajems house but he was not there. We will interrogate the local Vodafone officials, he added.        
	Saurav Sarkar, the branch manager of Vodafone in Murshidabad, said he would order an internal investigation. The incident is very unfortunate. We will take strong action against the security guard, Sarkar said.         
	He added: We did not know that security guards electrify barbed-wire fences in this manner.        
	He said the companys representatives would visit Dayanagar village and meet Saifuls father. We will try to compensate the family.         
	Mohammad Alif, a local trader, said this was not the first time that Kajem had connected the fence to a live wire.         
	A month ago, a 14-year-old boy had got a shock after touching the fence. We had thought that after that incident, Kajem would never do such a thing again.

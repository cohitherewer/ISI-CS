                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Coal loot halted
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 22: Heavy deployment of police at a dump yard near the coal mine at Borjore in Birbhum has stopped local villagers from looting coal in the past two days.        
	There was no disturbance after a rake with 57 wagons loaded with coal reached Hazratpur near Borjore on Wednesday. Security along the route has been stepped up following political intervention, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said in Writers Buildings this evening.         
	Although chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee claimed success for the halt in coal looting, he did not rule out the possibility of the raiders returning. We have to be on our guard continuously and hope for the best, Bhattacharjee said.

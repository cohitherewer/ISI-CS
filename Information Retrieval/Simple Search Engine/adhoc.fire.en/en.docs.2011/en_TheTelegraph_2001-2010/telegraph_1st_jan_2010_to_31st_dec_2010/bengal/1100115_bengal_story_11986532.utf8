The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Boat sheds catch fire in Nalban
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Boat sheds catch fire in Nalban
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 14: Three storage sheds in the Nalban boating complex in Salt Lake caught fire on Thursday night.        
	No one was injured.        
	The fire started around 9.18pm in one shed at the rear end of the complex and then spread to the other two. The cause is not known yet.        
	Although the fire engines reached the spot quickly, firefighters could not begin work immediately as the entrance was not big enough for the vehicles to reach the area that was in flames.         
	One of the sheds contained wires, the other two had furniture and items used for decorating wedding pandals and shamianas. Nalban is often let out for weddings.         
	The delay caused because of the late entry caused the fire to spread.        
	The fire engines then started spraying water from inside Nicco Park, adjacent to it, from 11.20pm.        
	The five fire engines brought the blaze under control around midnight, but managed to extinguish it around 1.20am.        
	The amount of damage caused by the fire is yet to be ascertained.         
	Earlier this month, a woman fell off a fun ride trolley after it jumped rails.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dum Dum touches 41, heat wave in Calcutta
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Dum Dum touches 41, heat wave in Calcutta

	Calcutta, April 10: A heat wave swept through Calcutta today with Dum Dum recording a maximum of 41 degrees Celsius.        
	It is officially a heat wave if the days maximum is at least five degrees above normal.         
	Usually, the mercury mark recorded at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore is considered Calcuttas temperature. In Alipore, the maximum  40.1 degrees  today was a shade lower because of a cloud cover, but the weatherman said the reading at Dum Dum station this afternoon meant the city was officially experiencing a heat wave.        
	Dum Dums recordings show the condition of large parts of the city and its outskirts. So when the maximum crosses five degrees above normal at Dum Dum, it is safe to say the city is in the grip of a heat wave, said G.C. Debnath, director of the Regional Meteorological Centre.        
	Such nitty-gritty wouldnt bother ordinary people. For them, it has been a heat wave for the past few days, made worse by long and frequent power cuts. There was no relief from the twin torments today and neither the weatherman nor the power babus offered hope.        
	Calcutta is experiencing a very unusual weather right now, much like a Delhi summer. Dry heat, with loo in the afternoons, is expected to stay for at least two more days, Debnath told The Telegraph.        
	Relief could have come in the form of a Norwester, but there is none on the radar.         
	No Norwesters are ex- pected till at least April 15. The moisture content in the air has to be much higher for Norwesters, said an official of the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	A scientist of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida, called it one of the most notable weather anomalies this year, which will be studied in the context of climate change.         
	The peak-hour power deficit went up to 750MW in the districts and 225MW in Calcutta.        
	While most of the state suffered power cuts for six to eight hours, the city and its suburbs went without power for two to three hours from noon.        
	Till the state utilitys generation returns to normal, it will be difficult to meet peak-hour demand in the city, a CESC spokesperson said.        
	Of the total 1,470MW demand, CESC provided 1,245, that too after importing 121MW.         
	By 5pm, almost every Calcutta neighbourhood had experienced power cuts.         
	Across the state, peak-hour demand hovered around the 4,100MW mark. There seems to be no end to the crisis. We have faced power cuts for six to eight hours every day the whole of this week. Elders and children are falling ill in this heat, said Suprita Basu, 32, a homemaker in Salt Lake.        
	The state-run West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd (WBPDCL), which supplies the bulk of the power to areas under the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (WBSEDCL), generated much less than capacity and put the blame on inadequate coal supply and technical glitches.        
	Two 210MW units at Bakreswar and Kolaghat were expected to resume generation today but that did not happen.

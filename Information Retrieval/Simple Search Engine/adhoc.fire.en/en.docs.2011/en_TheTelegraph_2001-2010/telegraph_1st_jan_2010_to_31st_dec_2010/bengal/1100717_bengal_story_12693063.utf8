                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hit for pension share, freedom fighter flees 
          ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR                          Bishnupada Samanta. (Jahangir Badsa)                                  
	Tamluk, July 16: A 91-year-old freedom fighter was forced to flee his East Midnapore home after being repeatedly assaulted by a gang of local youths who demanded a share of his pension.         
	Bishnupada Samanta, who was an associate of freedom fighter Sushil Dhara during the 1942 Quit India movement, is now staying with his wife Subhadra at a rented house near a market, 5km from his home in Mahishadal.         
	I fought with the British to snatch from them my countrys freedom. I had also been imprisoned twice. But it is a pity that I was forced to flee my home because I refused to part with my pension. Some local youths want to grab the money for their personal gain, Samanta said, sitting in one of the two small rooms of his rented apartment.         
	The nonagenarian said he had to move out of his two-storey home in Mahishadals Amritberia village, where he had lived for 40 years, on July 3 after the torture became unbearable.         
	Samanta, whose five sons live separately, said only one of his grandchildren used to visit him, that too occasionally.         
	I have been getting a monthly pension of Rs 200 since 1972. It was increased to Rs 15,700 only three years ago. After the increment, I used to help the needy, Samanta said.         
	However, of late, a gang of local youths demanded that I give half my pension to them every month. When I refused, they started to torture me, he said.         
	Samanta alleged that one day last month, the gang barged into his house and pushed and punched him when he refused to part with the money. Then I decided to leave my home, Samanta said, his voice choking.         
	After fleeing his home, Samanta lodged a complaint against the youths with Mahishadal police station. He named three of them in the FIR. Krishna Samanta, Dipankar Samanta and Bhagaban Das live in the freedom fighters village.         
	In his FIR, Samanta has alleged that the three youths and their aides used to torture him for his refusal to give them the money, said Sunil Gangopadhaya, the sub-divisional police officer of Haldia.        
	Samanta has also complained to Mahishadal block development officer Barsharani Basu.        
	I have received a complaint from Samanta about the mental and physical torture he has been subjected to. We have begun a probe. We are also trying to arrange for his return to his own home, she said.        
	Samanta, however, said he had tried to return to his home after being assured by the police of protection. Gram panchayat pradhan Deepa Panda had arranged a meeting with the local youths last week. The panchayat told me that they would not intervene and I would have to settle the matter with the youths, Samanta said.         
	Samanta said he returned to his rented apartment as he did not want to budge an inch from my stand. I told Panda that I would not give a single penny from my salary to the youths, he said.         
	A senior police officer said we are looking for the accused and will arrest them as soon as we find them.        
	Several residents of Amritberia, however, supported behind Samanta. We are proud of Bishnupadababu for his contribution to the countrys freedom struggle. The youths wanted to grab his pension for their personal gain. The police should arrest the accused and give protection to him so that he returns to the village, said Kalipada Samui, 63, a retired schoolteacher.

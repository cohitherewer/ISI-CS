                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      After soccer deaths, village calls off Pujas

	Burdwan, Oct. 9: The residents of Burdwans Aluni, where four people were killed in a clash over the control of a football field on September 14, have decided not to organise Durga Puja in their village as the memory of the deaths is still raw.         
	The residents of Aluni have been organising two Pujas at their village for the past two decades.         
	Villagers said they were yet to get over the deaths of three Aluni residents in the clash and were in no mood to celebrate.         
	Smarajit Saial, 23, Bhola Bagchi, 18, and Kamal Samajpati, 43, were dragged out of their houses and killed during a fight between the residents of Aluni and neighbouring Lakshmipur over which group would play on the field, sandwiched between the two villages.        
	The murders and mayhem are still raw in our memory. I lost my younger brother (Smarajit) that day. How can I celebrate the Pujas? said Biswajit Saial, the deputy chief of the Trinamul Congress-run local Majida gram panchayat. For the past few years, Biswajit had been an organiser of one of the Pujas.         
	Bholas father Gurupada Bagchi, 54, a farmer, said he had lost all interest in the Pujas.        
	I have lost my younger son. How can I even dream of celebrating the Pujas? The other residents of Aluni feel the same, Gurupada said.        
	The organisers of both the Pujas held a meeting at Biswajits home in the last week of September and decided against celebrating.        
	We agreed that this year, the Pujas should not be held. So much blood has been shed and so many young lives lost, Biswajit said.         
	Bijoy Baidya, 27, one of the organisers, said this was the first time in two decades that the Pujas were not being held at Aluni.        
	There is no doubt that we will miss the Pujas. But never before has our village seen so many gruesome deaths, Bijoy said.        
	The inspector in charge of Purbasthali police station, Dilip Ganguly, said that since the clashes, the administration had imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 in Aluni and Lakshmipur. Both the villages fall under the Purbasthali police station area.        
	Pujas are not prohibited under Section 144. But if the villagers refuse to organise the Pujas, what can we do? the officer said.         
	The residents of Aluni and Lakshmipur had been at loggerheads for long over the control of the six-bigha field.        
	On the morning of September 14, a group of 100 villagers from Lakshmipur entered Aluni and set fire to a house. The residents of Aluni retaliated by hurling bombs and firing at the mob. Meghnad Ghosh, 32, a resident of Lakshmipur, was killed in the firing.        
	As news of the death spread, a larger group of nearly 5,000 villagers, most of them from Lakshmipur but several others drawn from neighbouring Babuidanga and Kamalnagar, stormed Aluni.         
	The mob then went on the rampage, setting fire to three houses and looting 50 to 60 of them. During the mayhem, Smarajit, Bhola and Kamal were hacked to death. The residents of Aluni tried to put up a resistance but were outnumbered.        
	Another officer said 20 people had been arrested so far in connection with the clash.

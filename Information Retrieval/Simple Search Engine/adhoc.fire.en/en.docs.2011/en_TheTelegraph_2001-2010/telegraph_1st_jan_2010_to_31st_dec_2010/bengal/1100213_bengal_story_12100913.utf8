The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Midway formula to end hill impasse
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Midway formula to end hill impasse
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Bhattacharjee at the rally. (Kundan Yolmo)                                  
	Siliguri, Feb. 12: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told a rally here today that a midway arrangement would have to be worked out between the government and those agitating for statehood to bring peace in the troubled Darjeeling hills.        
	We are willing to confer more powers and money on the hills, but dont talk of statehood, he said on Day I of a three-day trip to north Bengal.         
	The chief minister said he had spoken to the Union home minister on Darjeeling and P. Chidambaram had agreed that such an arrangement would have to be arrived at for a mutually acceptable solution. I spoke to Chidambaram on the issue during his recent visit to Calcutta and he, too, agreed. He told me hed return to Delhi and work on the alternative arrangement, but we will not accept the demand for a separate state.         
	They (the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha) should maintain peace as talks cannot be held under threats and amid use of force.        
	Bhattacharjee made it clear that irrespective of what the new arrangement was, it would not include Siliguri, the Terai and the Dooars. Id like to make it clear to the leaders of Darjeeling: dont utter the names Siliguri, Terai and Dooars. Whatever (the new) arrangement, it would involve only the hill subdivisions of Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong. Never think of taking a step beyond.         
	Morcha chief Bimal Gurung had recently hinted at a climbdown when he revealed that he had sent to Delhi a secret proposal that would be acceptable to all.         
	Without mentioning the secret proposal, the chief minister said Morcha leaders, too, had realised that they would have to work out a more acceptable arrangement.        
	Hinting that the alternative arrangement could be shaped around a body similar to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, Bhattacharjee said: We had persuaded Subash Ghisingh and formed the DGHC in the 80s when a similar movement had emerged. We paid money to the council and delegated powers. Whether the DGHC has succeeded is something the people of Darjeeling should decide. If there have been lapses, Ghisingh is answerable to the people.         
	Bhattacharjee said even the formation of Telangana looked uncertain. Its been put on hold by the Centre.

          VIVEK CHHETRI                                     
	Darjeeling, Oct. 26: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha will seek the opinion of its units outside Darjeeling before accepting the proposal for an interim set-up for the hills.        
	The exercise is being seen as an attempt to avoid the charge of unilateral decision-making that felled Subash Ghisingh.        
	Sources said Morcha president Bimal Gurung would invite soon leaders of its units in other parts of the country for deliberations. The meeting will be held very soon, probably on October 30, a source said.        
	The Morcha has units in the seven northeastern states, besides Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. It has a unit in Calcutta too.        
	Gurung and his aides are proceeding cautiously now as the initial agitation was for Gorkhaland, not an interim authority. The Morcha would like any conciliatory gesture on such a set-up to carry the label of consensus from within the organisation to neutralise possible charges of a sellout.        
	Ghisingh, whose writ no longer runs in the hills, had paid a heavy price when he accepted a proposal to confer the Sixth Schedule status on the hills.        
	The Centre, the state and Ghisinghs GNLF had signed a memorandum of settlement, which could not be implemented because of opposition in the hills.         
	The resultant vacuum had helped Gurung undermine Ghisinghs authority and eventually project himself as an alternative power.

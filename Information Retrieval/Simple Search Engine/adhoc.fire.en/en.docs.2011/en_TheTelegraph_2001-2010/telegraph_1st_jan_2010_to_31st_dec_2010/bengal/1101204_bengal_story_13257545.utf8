                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Tales of bullying buffet hot-head camp
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Purlembo Ao at Purulia court on Friday. (Mita Roy)                                  
	Balarampur (Purulia), Dec. 3: Three short-fuse murders in two months have opened the floodgates of public complaints against a police camp here that is meant to protect civilians from Maoists.        
	People in the neighbourhood avoid going anywhere near the base after sundown, said Kashinath De, a wholesale trader, whose shop is near the India Reserve Battalion camp where a constable killed a superior and a state armed police jawan yesterday.        
	So, traders who have shops on either side of NH32 near the camp have no option but to down their shutters after 7pm, he added.        
	De and many others alleged that the personnel at the IRB camp in Purulias Balarampur were hot-headed and trigger-happy, and had assaulted several residents and shopkeepers in the past couple of months.        
	The camp houses IRB personnel from Nagaland and state armed police (SAP) jawans. Yesterday, IRB constable Purlembo Ao had gunned down a senior and an SAP jawan for protesting the bursting of firecrackers during pre-Christmas festivities at the camp.        
	On October 1, some IRB personnel from the camp had shot a youth dead inside his car on the suspicion that he was a Maoist.        
	De said it was a huge risk to go near the camp after sundown. Who wants to risk his life?        
	Another trader, Netai Pal, who has a shop 200 metres from the camp, said customers from the neighbourhood had stopped coming to his shop.        
	They prefer to go to shops that do not require them to come anywhere near the camp. People want to avoid coming face to face with the jawans at the camp, Pal said.        
	He said even his relatives and friends felt afraid to visit his home, especially at night, because they would need to pass by the camp.        
	The IRB jawans have been camping at the Balarampur base since September. They are part of six companies of IRB jawans from Nagaland involved in anti-Maoist operations in the state.        
	Several shopkeepers said the IRB jawans regularly coerced them into giving them discounts.        
	Bholanath Majhi, the Balarampur block president of the Trinamul Youth Congress, said that recently, some IRB jawans had demanded liquor after a meal at a dhaba, 1km from the camp. Refused, they abused the dhaba owner and left without paying for their food, Majhi alleged.        
	On October 1, the IRB personnel had allegedly dragged several passers-by into the camp and beaten them up, after having mistaken the sound of firecrackers in the neighbourhood as Maoist gunshots. They later fired wildly, killing a traveller from Bokaro in his car and injuring his friend.        
	Majhi said the IRB personnel had been brought here to fight the Maoists but were harming the local people instead. He demanded that the jawans be shifted so that the people in the neighbourhood could breathe easy.         
	Ao, the constable who killed his senior Kebrihom Dominique and SAP jawan Sanjay Bor yesterday, was produced in a Purulia court today and remanded in 14 days jail custody. He has been charged with murder and faces either a death sentence or a life term.        
	The bodies of Bor and Dominique are being taken to their homes in West Midnapores Khejuri and Nagaland, respectively. Bor was given a guard of honour at the 13th SAP battalion headquarters in Purulias Simulia.        
	In Calcutta, the additional director-general of police (law and order), Surajit Kar Purakayastha, said the firing was being probed.        
	A director-general of police from Nagaland arrived in Calcutta today, Purakayastha said. The Nagaland officer will visit Balarampur tomorrow and investigate the incident with state police officers.         
	Purakayastha said a decision on the platoon in Balarampur will be taken after that.

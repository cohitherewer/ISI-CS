                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Fire notice to tinderboxes
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, April 24: Police today served notices on the owners of 12 Calcutta buildings that had been branded fire hazards and warned them of legal action if they failed to undertake blaze-prevention measures within a specified period.        
	The period varies from 15 days to six months depending on the measures the buildings (see chart) need to take. The owners were summoned to Lalbazar and handed the notices.         
	Following the March 23 Stephen Court blaze that killed 44 people, a team was formed with officials from the CESC, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, fire services department, directorate of electricity and the police to inspect the citys hazardous buildings. It has visited 15 residential-cum-commercial buildings and 29 markets in the past month.        
	Although all the buildings have major changes to make, officials said the conditions of Mercantile Building and the one on 138 Canning Street were the worst. At Mercantile, the wiring is very poor. Besides, there is a tea stall with an open source of fire in front of the meter box. At 138 Canning Street, there are no miniature circuit breakers (MCBs). Also, there are no fire extinguishers or sand buckets near the meter box, said Soumen Chatterjee, a CESC manager.         
	In the short term, the buildings have been asked to revamp the wiring near the meter box and install MCBs and fire extinguishers. They must revamp the entire wiring in six months, Chatterjee added.         
	The owners who came to Lalbazar said the of will am- ong tenants was a hindrance. Special commissioner of police Banibrata Basu said they could be jailed for three to five years for not implementing the recommendations.

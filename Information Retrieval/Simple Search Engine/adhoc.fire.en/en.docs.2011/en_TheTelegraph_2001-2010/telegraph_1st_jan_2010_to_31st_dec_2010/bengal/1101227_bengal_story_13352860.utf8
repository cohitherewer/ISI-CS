The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong call to protect interest in alliance
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong call to protect interest in alliance
          BARUN GHOSH                              Pranab Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee				                                 
	Calcutta, Dec. 26: Bengal Congress leaders have requested the party high command to ensure that an alliance with the Trinamul Congress is not on Mamata Banerjees terms and that the Congresss interests are safeguarded.         
	The state Congress leaders do not want a repetition of the humiliation during the 2001 Assembly elections, when the party had teamed up with Trinamul. The Congress had to be satisfied with only 57 of the 294 Assembly seats. Kamal Nath, the then AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, and Pranab Mukherjee, the then Bengal Congress chief, had accepted Mamatas terms while firming up the alliance.         
	We will shortly begin seat-sharing talks with Mamataji. Several Bengal leaders have requested the high command to ensure that the 2001 episode is not repeated, K. Keshava Rao, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, said.         
	Rao said it was too early to say how many seats the Congress could be offered for next years Assembly elections in Bengal. Mamataji is the projected leader of the alliance. Whenever she gives us time, we are ready to initiate the dialogue on seat-sharing, he added.        
	Rao said the tension between Bengal Congress leaders and the Trinamul chief would not affect alliance talks. Trinamul is our principal ally. The alliance will be mutually beneficial for us. The recent war of words (between some state Congress and Trinamul leaders) wont hurt alliance talks, he said.        
	Union finance minister Mukherjee said there was no tension between Trinamul and the Congress. We had fought the Lok Sabha polls together. We shall do the same for the coming Assembly elections, he told reporters on the sidelines of a programme in Burnpur.        
	However, several state Congress leaders voiced concern that the alliance could be firmed up on Mamatas terms. Raiganj MP Deepa Das Munshi, who has a strained relation with Mamata, said: In 2001, we had to be satisfied with 57 seats. We had even sacrificed over a dozen sitting legislators to strike the alliance. We are not going to accept such a meek surrender this time.        
	Deepa said the denial of tickets to sitting legislators had weakened the party organisation. In 2001, sitting Chopra (in Raiganj) MLA Hamidul Rahman was denied a ticket for the sake of the alliance. In the 2006 Assembly polls, the CPM won the seat by defeating our nominee. This shows how our organisation has weakened in the district (North Dinajpur) over the years, she observed.         
	She said she had requested the high command to ensure that the seat-sharing deal is struck taking our views into account. She added that the partys dignity must be kept intact.        
	Senior Congress leader and Intuc president Pradip Bhattacharya said he had requested Mukherjee to safeguard the interest of the party while negotiating with Mamata. An alliance with Mamata is the need of the hour. But what had happened in 2001 should not happen again, he said.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said the Congress should remember that ours is the bigger organisation. We too want an alliance with the Congress. But the party should not grumble over the number of seats they get. The deal will be struck on Mamatadis terms.

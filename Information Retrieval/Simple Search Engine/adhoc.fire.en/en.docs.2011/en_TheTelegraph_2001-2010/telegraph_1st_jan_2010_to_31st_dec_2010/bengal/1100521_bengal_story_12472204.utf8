                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bombs weeklong wait for right target
          PRONAB MONDAL                          The site of the Maoist attack on the Goaltore-Ramgarh road                                  
	Goaltore (West Midnapore), May 20: The bomb that killed five CRPF personnel, including a deputy commandant, near Lalgarh yesterday had been planted a week ago in a pothole in the middle of the road and covered up with dry leaves, Maoist sources revealed today.         
	The rebels were waiting for the right opportunity, which came yesterday morning when they not only saw the two police Boleros cross the spot but also found out which one carried CRPF deputy commandant Vijay Pal Singh.        
	When the cars returned by the same route  making a cardinal error  the rebels let the brown Bolero pass before detonating the bomb when the silver Bolero was right over it.        
	Earlier, as soon as Maoist informers had spotted the cars carrying the CRPF personnel on their onward trip to the Ramgarh camp, they had rushed to three villages inside the Chowkisole forest  Gadra, Komarband and Memul  where the rebels have hideouts.        
	According to Maoist sources, the rebels had then activated their network and learnt that a CRPF deputy commandant was travelling in the silver Bolero. They also learnt that the CRPF personnel would return in an hour.        
	The local Maoist leadership then asked about 30 of its young cadres, including two experts in detonating IEDs, to rush to the spot and activate the explosive device. The bomb, which had a wire attached to it that stretched 150 metres into the forest, needed batteries and a flashgun to detonate it.        
	The armed cadres reached the spot on motorcycles in 10 minutes and the bomb experts got down to work while the others took up position along the edge of the forest.        
	About 40 minutes later, at 11.30am, the two Boleros approached the spot. The silver car carrying Singh was following the brown Bolero at a distance of about 100 metres.        
	The Maoists detonated the bomb, killing four personnel on the spot and injuring two others, including Singh. The deputy commandant later died of his injuries.        
	The rebel sources said they had expected the brown Bolero, which was carrying eight CRPF jawans, to return after hearing the blast. They said the Maoists had planned to fire at the jawans if they came back.        
	However, the brown car sped away, possibly fearing a trap. It returned after 20 minutes with reinforcements.        
	After the blast, the Maoists disappeared into the forest on their motorbikes.        
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the police were probing if the Maoists had specific information about Singhs presence in the car. He said the rebels knew that the two Boleros would return and that is why they took up position so quickly.         
	The police said that last year, they had defused four bombs on the Goaltore-Ramgarh road.

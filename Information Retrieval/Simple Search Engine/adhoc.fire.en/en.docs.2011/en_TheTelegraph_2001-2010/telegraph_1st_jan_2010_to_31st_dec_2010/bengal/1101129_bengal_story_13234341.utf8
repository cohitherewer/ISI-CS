                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Manas plea for restraint
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Bhuniya and Mamata                                 
	Calcutta, Nov. 28: The name is Manas, Manas Bhuniya, not manasputra.        
	The state Congress president today requested Mamata Banerjee to restrain her party leaders who have been piercing him with derogatory remarks such as Buddhas manasputra (soul mate). Partha Chatterjee had recently used the term to suggest Bhuniya was close to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee by punning on the Congress leaders name.         
	Addressing a news conference today, Bhuniya said: I request Mamata Banerjee to restrain these Trinamul functionaries from making such derogatory remarks in future because it is denigrating the Congress party and the post of the PCC president.         
	The state Congress chief said that in the recent past, Trinamul leaders such as Kalyan Banerjee, Subhendu Adhikari and Madan Mitra had called him a CPM stooge.         
	Bhuniya warned that such snide remarks could affect the political ties between the Congress and Trinamul. The relationship between the two parties should be cordial to facilitate a strong alliance and ensure the CPMs ouster from Bengal.         
	The Congress leader, however, tempered his statements by saying he was sure Mamata does not endorse such comments. In the same breath, he added: However, if she does (endorse), it will be very painful. I appeal to her to ask her party leaders to restrain themselves. We should respect each other.        
	Bhuniya, who had yesterday met governor M.K. Narayanan with an appeal to call an all-party meeting to discuss the states deteriorating law and order, today repeated his request.         
	In Khejuri, CPM activists attacked and set ablaze the houses of Congress supporters, Bhuniya alleged. They even burnt down the house and garage of Congress block president Dipak Samanta. It is clear that Bengal is being rocked by violence. The governor should immediate call an all-party meeting.        
	The state Congress chief announced a series of programmes in the districts from tomorrow, including a 12-hour bandh in Murshidabad on December 3.        
	Mamata trawler aid        
	Mamata today handed over cheques of Rs 2 lakh each to family members of 60 people who died in the trawler tragedy in Kakdwip last month.         
	The Trinamul chief said at the programme in Kakdwip to hand over the cheques: I am giving the cheques on behalf of the zilla parishad.

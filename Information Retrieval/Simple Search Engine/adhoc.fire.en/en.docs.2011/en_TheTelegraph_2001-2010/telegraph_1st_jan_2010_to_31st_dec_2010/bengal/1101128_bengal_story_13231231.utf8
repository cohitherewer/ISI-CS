          A STAFF REPORTER                          A pangolin in Alipurduar                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 27: Pangolin scales worth more than Rs 400 crore have been seized at Calcutta airport this week, with officials saying they were being smuggled to China.        
	The consignments, hidden in bags labelled ayurvedic medicine, were bound for Imphal, from where they would have been flown to China via Myanmar, officials of the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) said.         
	Yesterday, 511kg of pangolin scales, packed into 12 bags, was confiscated at the cargo terminal. On November 21, another 135kg of scales, being carried in five bags, had been seized at the airport.         
	The consignments had been flown to Calcutta on a private airline from Chennai, the officials said. Since these were registered cargo, no passenger was accompanying the bags.        
	Sesha Giri Rao, DRI additional director-general, Calcutta, said that traditional medicines were prepared from pangolin scales in China.         
	DRI officials said an international gang was involved in killing pangolins, peeling off the scales and smuggling them to China.         
	They added that the DRI and the wildlife crime control bureau were conducting raids to bust the racket and nab the kingpins. Sources said the gang leaders could be in India.        
	Forest department officials said pangolins were an endangered species.

	Durgapur, Dec. 28: Union coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal today accused the Bengal government of doing nothing to check illegal mining and pilferage in the states coal belt.     
	He said he had requested the chief minister six months ago to take initiatives to stop the menace but he had received no response. Jaiswal said he had also requested Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to consider the possibility of rehabilitating around 4 lakh people living in unsafe areas in the coal mining zones of Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia.         
	Behrampore: Two Murshidabad villagers smuggling out cattle to Bangladesh were allegedly gunned down by BSF jawans near the border on Tuesday. Murshidabad police chief B.L.

Two gang members died while the other escaped, Meena said.

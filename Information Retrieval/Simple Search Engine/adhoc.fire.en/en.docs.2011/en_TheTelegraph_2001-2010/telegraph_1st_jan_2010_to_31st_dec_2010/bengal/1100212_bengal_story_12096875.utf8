          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Feb. 11: A Class IX student lost one leg while another had to be amputated from below the ankle after he was allegedly thrown off a running train near Burdwans Panagarh yesterday following an altercation over charging his cellphone.        
	Prakash Yadav, 15, was travelling without a ticket from Dhanbad to Howrah in a three-tier sleeper coach of the Poorva Express when he had an argument with two youths over charging his cellphone.         
	His left leg was severed under the wheels. We had to amputate his right leg from below the ankle as it was severely injured, said Nemai Chandra Debnath, the superintendent of the Durgapur sub-divisional hospital where Prakash was admitted. Prakash, who was going to Calcutta to meet his relatives, was also given blood at the hospital.         
	Prakash, the only son of a farmer in Dhanbad, said today that he had been charging his cellphone around 6.45pm yesterday when the two youths sitting opposite him asked him to remove his phone from the plug point as they wanted to charge theirs. When I refused, they started to abuse me, Prakash said.        
	He alleged that after the train left Durgapur station, the two dragged him by the collar towards the door and kicked him out of the train. I tried to grab the handle but slipped. I slid off the steps and my left leg went under the wheels. My right leg must have hit something which I dont remember, Prakash said.         
	He said none of the other passengers had come to his rescue when he was being assaulted.        
	Passengers of a local train, which was passing by after 15 minutes, spotted Prakash lying in a semi-conscious state beside the tracks and informed the Railway Protection Force personnel at Panagarh station, about 160km from Calcutta.         
	Prakash was taken to the station and given first aid.        
	The officer-in-charge of Durgapur government railway police, Ratan Ganguly, took Prakash to hospital.         
	Prakash gave Ganguly his father Shiv Narayan Yadavs phone number.         
	Prakash has lost a lot of blood. Even though we are yet to receive any FIR, we are inquiring into the matter, Ganguly said.        
	Shiv Narayan reached Durgapur from Dhanbad early today.        
	My son was going to visit some relatives in Calcutta. We too were supposed to go on Friday. I am in a state of shock. How will he support himself when his mother and I will no more be there? Shiv Narayan said, breaking down in tears.        
	Whom do I accuse in my complaint? My son has not seen them (the two youths) properly. However, I will lodge a complaint shortly, he added.

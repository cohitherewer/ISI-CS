          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb 18: The Bengal cabinet today approved the creation of 5,000 posts of constables for the state and Calcutta police and 250 for the Eastern Frontier Rifles.        
	Nearly 1,700 posts in various government departments will also be created.        
	State finance minister Asim Dasgupta said: The state cabinet today approved the creation of posts in the police and other government departments. This is part of the 1.02 lakh jobs that we had proposed to create in the ongoing fiscal. We will create 3,500 posts of constables for the state police and 1,500 for Calcutta police. In government departments, 1,693 new posts will be created and 4,716 existing vacancies will be filled up. The cabinet has also approved the creation of posts for 250 EFR personnel.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee attended the cabinet meeting.        
	Ahead of elections to 82 civic bodies in May, the cabinet ratified a proposal to regularise 6,300 casual staff working in some municipalities of the state. Casual staff working for a minimum of 10 years will be regularised, Dasgupta added.        
	Also approved was the state home departments proposal to raise a special combat force. The combat force will be a special battalion with 939 jawans to deal with subversive forces in the western part of the state, the finance minister said.         
	A senior official said that at present, the sanctioned staff strength of the state police was 65,000, of which 7,000 were lying vacant. After the cabinet approval for 3,500 posts, an equal number of posts will remain vacant, he added.        
	The state cabinet also cleared the proposal to raise the salaries of MLAs from the current Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per month. It also hiked their daily allowance from Rs 500 to Rs 750.         
	The daily allowance is paid when MLAs attend Assembly sessions or participate in standing committee meetings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Taslima back with Calcutta plea
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Taslima back with Calcutta plea
          SANJAY K. JHA                                          Taslima Nasreen      
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Taslima Nasreen arrived in Delhi from the US two days ago and has since been insisting on visiting Calcutta, a demand that has the authorities worried, sources said.        
	The controversial Bangladeshi author, who has antagonised Muslim clerics through her writings, has arrived here for renewal of her Indian residential permit, which is to expire later this month.        
	She wants to go to Calcutta at least once, maybe for some time. She says coming to India without seeing Calcutta is meaningless for her, the sources said.        
	They said she had told the Bengal government she would not stay in Calcutta for long. The state government, however, doesnt want her to come, leaving the central authorities in a bind.        
	Taslima had last visited India in August 2009 when her residential permit was extended by six months on condition that she leave the country immediately instead of using the permit to stay back. The same condition had been set when the permit was renewed the previous time in February last year.        
	The author, who has been kept somewhere in Chittaranjan Park, a Bengali residential colony in south Delhi, has a home in Calcutta. She had left the city in 2007 following violent street protests against her stay and later left the country.        
	She is allowed to enter India only after she shows her return ticket, and is usually told in advance she cannot visit Calcutta or meet the media.        
	Neither the Congress nor the Left wants to court controversy by standing by the author, who has been living in the US for the past two years. The BJP has demanded political asylum for her.

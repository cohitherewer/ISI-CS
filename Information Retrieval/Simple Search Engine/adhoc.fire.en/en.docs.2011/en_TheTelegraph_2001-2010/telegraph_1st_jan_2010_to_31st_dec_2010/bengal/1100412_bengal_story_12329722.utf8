The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Balm for Muslims
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Balm for Muslims
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Calcutta, April 11: The state government will allocate Rs 30 crore this year for minority welfare in five districts that are not part of a central scheme for Muslim concentration areas because less than 20 per cent of their population belongs to the community.         
	In the 12 Bengal districts with a minority population of over 20 per cent, the Centre will spend as much as Rs 686 crore over a period of two years. We had to take care of the districts that were left out, said minority affairs secretary Gopalika. This is the first time a move has been made to focus on development of minorities in these districts.        
	It is being seen as a desperate bid to win back Muslims whose lost faith in the Left is believed to be a prime reason for its sliding fortunes.        
	The Rs 30 crore will be spent on building primary health centres, low-cost homes, additional madrasah classrooms and anganwadi centres, purchase of irrigation pumps and augmentation of water supply in the minority-inhabited pockets of West Midnapore, East Midnapore, Hooghly, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling.        
	The guidelines would be sent to the district magistrates in a fortnight. Well insist on community development schemes, said an official.        
	Insiders said the CPM was in a hurry to showcase the governments concern for Muslims, especially after the UPA announced its focus on districts having minority concentration  officially a population of over 20 per cent. Cooch Behar, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur, Malda, Murshidabad, Burdwan, Birbhum, Nadia, Howrah, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and Calcutta are part of the programme.        
	We have seen the erosion in our minority base in the 2008 panchayat polls and last years Lok Sabha elections after the Sachar committee report had pointed out the pitiable condition of Muslims in our state, a CPM leader said.         
	According to Gopalika, these five districts may not have minority concentration as defined by Delhi, but they have many blocks where minorities constitute 20 per cent of the population.        
	Bankura and Purulia have not been included in the list as they have a Muslim population of only around 3 per cent, an official said.

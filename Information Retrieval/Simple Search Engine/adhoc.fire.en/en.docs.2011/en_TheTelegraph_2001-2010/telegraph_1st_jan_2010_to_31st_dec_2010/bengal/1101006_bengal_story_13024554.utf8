The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | March for Mamata show
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      March for Mamata show
          OUR BUREAU                          Midnapore/Calcutta, Oct. 5: Trinamul MPs Mukul Roy (left) and Subhendu Adhikari lead the march on Tuesday. Picture by Samir Mondal                                  
	Trinamul Congress activists today marched with members of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities from Lalgarh to CPM pocket Dharampur trying to marshal supporters for Mamata Banerjees public rally in Midnapore town tomorrow.        
	Trinamul central ministers Sisir Adhikari and Mukul Roy led the 500-strong procession, many of them youths on bikes, in a show of strength that a prominent CPM leader claimed was organised by parading outsiders.        
	The CPM held a rally here a month back as proof of reclamation of its territory. But this was all a gimmick. The overwhelming response to our padayatra shows the CPMs alienation, Adhikari told the gathering in front of the CPMs newly renovated office in Dharampur, among the pockets the Left party reclaimed from the rebels.        
	However, Anuj Pandey, the CPMs Binpur zonal committee secretary who last month unfurled the party flag after being forced to flee a year back in the face of the rebels onslaught, rubbished Adhikaris assertion.         
	Not a single person from Dharampur joined the Trinamul-led procession. The Trinamul leaders brought in outsiders, Pandey said.        
	A Trinamul leader countered the claim by suggesting Pandey was speaking out of pique. Pandeys anger is quite obvious because his two-storied house, opulent by local standards, was vandalised by a huge crowd (led by rebels) on June 15, 2009.         
	However, eyewitness accounts lent credence to Pandeys claims. I came from Gohumidanga to attend the padayatra. I was a former member of the Peoples Committee but have now joined Trinamul because of the atrocities by the joint forces and the armed CPM cadres, said Nityananda Mahato, 44, a day labourer.        
	Niranjan Pradhan, 30, who rode a bike to Dharampur from Lalgarh, also said not many had joined the march in Dharampur. Dharampur is still a red bastion and that is why many of us came from outside.        
	A police officer said around 300 Peoples Committee members joined the march as it covered the 11-km path. But Dharampur itself wore a deserted look, with shops downing shutters.         
	Trinamul leaders said Mamata had sought briefings on the preparations for tomorrows rally at the sprawling College Ground in Midnapore. Sources said she had last addressed a gathering there after floating Trinamul in 1998.

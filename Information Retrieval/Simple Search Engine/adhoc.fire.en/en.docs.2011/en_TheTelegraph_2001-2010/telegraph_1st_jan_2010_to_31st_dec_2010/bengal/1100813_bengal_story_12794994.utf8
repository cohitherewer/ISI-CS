          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Satyajit. (Jahangir Badsa)                          
	Tamluk, Aug. 12: Suspected Maoists have threatened to kill the son of Nishikanta Mondal, the Trinamul Congress panchayat chief of Sonachura the rebels had murdered last year, if he joins politics.         
	To put more pressure on Satyajit, the rebels are also threatening his sister Sanchaita, a schoolteacher.         
	I have been receiving calls and letters threatening me to stay away from politics. They (the Maoists) are telling me that my fate will be the same as my fathers if I join politics. The Maoists and the CPM are behind this, Satyajit, a resident of East Midnapores Sonachura, said.         
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee had announced at a rally in Nandigram last November that she would field Satyajit as the partys candidate in the by-election for the panchayat seat that fell vacant after Nishikantas death. The bypoll is yet to take place.        
	Sanchaita has been receiving threat calls for the past one month. On July 13, a group of unidentified men visited her school at West Midnapores Chandrakona and asked for her. However, Sanchaita was absent that day. They did not reveal their identity. Before leaving, they told me to ask her to be careful, said Joydeb Das, a clerk at the school.        
	Sanchaita has not attended school since then and also left the teachers hostel where she had been staying. She has lodged a complaint with the police, who have assured her of protection.         
	Sanchaita has applied for transfer. I will not be able to attend school because I feel scared. I dont want to go to the school even with police protection. The police had told me they would provide a woman constable. But at a time people are getting killed in West Midnapore in the presence of the joint forces, I would feel insecure even if I am escorted by a constable, Sanchaita said.        
	Satyajit too had lodged a police complaint last month.         
	We are probing Satyajits complaint. The police camp at Sonachura has been alerted, said Salil Gangopadhyay, the sub-divisional police officer.         
	Nishikantas wife Manashi said: I have already lost my husband. Now I dont want to lose my children. I have asked my son to stay away from politics. I have also told my daughter to leave her school job if necessary, she said.

	Sarenga, March 7: Rifleman Dipak Duley sobbed today and rued that there was no one to protect his father at home when he was away guarding the countrys borders.         
	Dipak, who is in his thirties and has put 10 years in the army, returned to Bankura from his post in Siliguri today. His father Ranjit Duley was kidnapped by the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities on Friday.        
	In the Bankura village of Saluka, where the Duleys live, Dipak sobbed as he said: I have been protecting my country for so many years on the China and Bhutan borders. It is very sad that there is no one to protect my father at home.        
	The 48-hour deadline that the tribal committee had declared for the release of six people to set Duley free has lapsed but there is no news of the headmaster.         
	We are very tense today as 48 hours have passed and we have received no information from the police or the abductors, said Dipak.        
	He pleaded with visiting journalists: Please try and contact Sidhu Soren (the Gana Militia leader of the Peoples Committee). I want to request him to release my father.        
	His mother Kalpana sobbed uncontrollably. Please arrange for the release of my husband, she repeated after Dipak. Duleys other two sons, Golok and Tapas, sat embracing their mother.         
	Kalpanas daughter Parul Das has come from Khatra in Bankura. Duleys nieces  Mita and Susmita, daughters of his slain younger brother Ramkrishna  stood by.         
	Ramkrishna was killed by Maoists last year because he did not quit the CPM. Duley, who was a CPM branch committee member and was threatened after Ramkrishnas death, did not renew his membership. Mita said: After our fathers death, it was jethu (Ranjit Duley) who became our guardian. We dont want to lose another father figure.        
	Kalpana was unhappy with Bankura superintendent of police Vishal Garg. We have called up the SP many times but he did not respond even once. The police station is also not telling us anything, she said.        
	Rebels kill 3        
	Maoists shot dead three persons since Saturday night in Salboni, West Midnapore.         
	The rebels killed a labourer, Shibshankar Das, on Saturday night.         
	Police said 10 Maoists went to his house and dragged him out. They took him to a road about 100m away from his home and shot him in the head and chest. The rebels left posters claiming responsibility for the murder.         
	In Kharikashuli village, the rebels killed DYFI activist Chandan Singh. The third murder was of Vinod Singh in Gormal village. Both men were found dead in paddy fields on Sunday.

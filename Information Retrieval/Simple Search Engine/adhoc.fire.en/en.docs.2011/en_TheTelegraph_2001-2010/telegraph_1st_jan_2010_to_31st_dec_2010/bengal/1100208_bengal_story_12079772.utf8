          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sitting in the audience, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees wife Meera pops a lozenge during the rally at Brigade. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 7: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said little against the Congress-led Cen-tre at a Left Front rally on aam aadmi issues such as price rise, and instead attacked the Congresss partner Trinamul and its nexus with Ma-oists and the north Bengal separatists.         
	He had reasons to spare the Congress. A front leader said his interaction with Bhattacharjee gave him the impression that the chief minister felt the CPMs efforts to drive a wedge into the Congress-Trinamul pact appeared to be working.        
	The reading came from Bhattacharjees informal talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, home minister P. Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia on the sidelines of the chief ministers conclave on price rise in Delhi yesterday, the front leader said.         
	I told them we wanted more co-ordination with the Centre to fight Maoists but pointed out that their ally Mamata Banerjee was taking a different line. They seemed to have realised that her position was opposed to the Centres and the Congresss, not only on Maoists but also on development, the front leader quoted Bhattacharjee as telling some allies.         
	To the allies, Bhattacharjee appeared satisfied with his groundwork for Chidambarams meeting with the chief ministers and officials of four Maoist-hit states on February 9. He apparently indicated that he would not mind a unified command against the rebels as in the Northeast.         
	The chief minister had more than one reason to be happy. Yesterday, his party general secretary, Prakash Karat, had indicated his approval of the Bengal leaderships overtures to estranged Left ally Congress and made a distinction between the Congresss and Trinamuls policies on Maoists and the development of Bengal.         
	At the rally, however, Bhattacharjee thundered against foreign and desi vested interests, the rich who have been dispossessed by land reforms and have now ganged up to dislodge the Left from power.         
	These forces do not want the Left to control governments at the Centre and the states, he said.         
	He resolved not to surrender to the forces of darkness led by Trinamul. And he exhorted farmers, sharecroppers, farm labourers, workers, teachers, government employees, artistes and youths  many of whom have deserted the Left after Singur and Nandigram  to recall what they had gained from Left rule and what their loss would be if the Trinamul-led Opposition came to power.         
	He especially addressed the Musalman bhais, reminding them how they had gained from the land reforms and lived in a state free of communal strife.         
	But there was not a word on the Ranganath Misra commissions recommendation to the Centre to provide reservation for Muslims in government jobs and education, despite a prod from the Forward Blocs Ashok Ghosh, who spoke before Bhattacharjee.         
	As they broached the issue with the chief minister bet-ween the speeches, the allies gathered the impression that the chief minister still had his reservations about reservation. It reflects the CPMs dilemma on how to make room for a quota for the backwards among Muslims without being accused of indulging in vote-bank politics.         
	I will do something for Muslims. Have patience. We have been preaching Left politics for long and actions have to be taken within its parameters, Bhattacharjee was quoted as saying.         
	The traditional Left position is against quotas on religious lines. The issue will come up at a front meeting tomorrow. The allies want Muslims to be declared a backward community and a commission set up to explore the modalities for reservation, as in Kerala.         
	Yesterday, Karat had voiced the partys support for quotas for the economically and educationally backward among Muslims and other minorities but left the details for the Centre to work out. In Bengal, he said, the government will take appropriate decisions.         
	Bhattacharjee, so far, has indicated his desire to address the issue by expanding the reservation net for Other Backward Classes, which sections of his party and the front consider inadequate.

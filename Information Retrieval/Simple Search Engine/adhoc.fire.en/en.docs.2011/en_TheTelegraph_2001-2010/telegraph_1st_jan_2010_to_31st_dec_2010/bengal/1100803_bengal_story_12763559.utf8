	Aug. 2: Railway police have arrested two persons for the train robbery last week, their suspicion raised by empty travel bags and wallets lying by the road that connects the crime spot with the village from where the duo were picked up.        
	Government Railway Police officials said they had also seized a trolley bag, Rs 1,100 in cash and some ladies garments from the houses of Mohammad Ziaul, 40, and Mohammad Rahisuddin, 20. The police said the duo were illegal coal miners. The two will be paraded in front of the victims for identification, said S.N. Chakraborty, superintendent of railway police, Kharagpur.         
	One of the mud roads that leads to Murulia village begins from the level crossing across which a gang of 30 had fled after robbing passengers on the Tata-Chhapra Express on Thursday, he said.        
	When we took the road on Friday morning for investigation, we found several travel bags and wallets lying on both sides. We suspected that they could belong to the passengers of the robbed train, Chakraborty said.         
	We questioned villagers in Murulia and found out that Ziaul and Rahisuddin had left the village in the early hours of Thursday. We deployed plainclothesmen at the village and picked up the duo when they returned with some of the booty yesterday.

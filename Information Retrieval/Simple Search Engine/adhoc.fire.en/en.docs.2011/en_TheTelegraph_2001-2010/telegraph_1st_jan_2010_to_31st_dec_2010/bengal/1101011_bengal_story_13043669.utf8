                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Deb invites Mamata again
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 10: State housing minister Gautam Deb today sent two officials to Mamata Banerjees home with an invite to a government programme in Rajarhat on October 13 despite repeated snubs from the railway minister.        
	The invite is for the foundation-laying ceremony of a financial hub. Now it is up to her to attend. But I shall keep trying to bring her in for government-sponsored programmes as she is the leader of the principal Opposition party, the CPM leader said.        
	Asked about earlier snubs, Deb said: I wont mind because peoples welfare is my concern. He argued that if finance minister Pranab Mukherjee could agree to attend, why not the railway minister.

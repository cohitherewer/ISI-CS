The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bhuniya funds SOS to Asim
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bhuniya funds SOS to Asim
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Nov. 16: Bengal Congress chief Manas Bhuniya today met finance minister Asim Dasgupta over the states financial problems and sought immediate release of development funds held up for the past two years.        
	Bhuniya said after the meeting that the MLAs were yet to get the local area funds for 2009-10, and that development was suffering because the cash had not been disbursed.        
	The government owes each MLA Rs 50 lakh for the last fiscal. This year, the funds have been increased to Rs 60 lakh but not a single paisa has been paid. However, the finance minister has assured me the funds will be released on an emergency basis, Bhuniya said, a day after holding Dasgupta responsible for the states financial bankruptcy.        
	The Centre-run rural job scheme, NREGA, has also taken a hit as the state was not passing on the funds despite getting them from Delhi, he said.        
	Bhuniya repeated his demand for a public debate on the fiscal problem and urged Dasgupta to invite parties and economists.

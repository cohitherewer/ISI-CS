The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress scrambles to apply minority balm
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Congress scrambles to apply minority balm
          BARUN GHOSH                            Abu Hena, Manas Bhuniya	                                
	Calcutta, Dec. 14: Manas Bhuniya today offered to quit as Congress legislature party chief to make room for a Muslim leader upset at being kept out of the newly formed PCC along with others from the community.        
	Abu Hena, whose father was part of the Siddhartha Shankar Ray cabinet, will take over shortly. Hena, my deputy in the Assembly, will get a new post. He will shortly take over as CLP chief, Bhuniya said, a day after Hena publicly slammed the leadership for dropping him from the new Pradesh Congress Committee.        
	Hena confirmed his elevation was imminent. I was informed that the leadership will take a decision on my appointment as CLP chief after the three-day AICC plenary in Delhi from December 18. I have been deputy CLP leader since 2006 when I was elected from Lalgola for the fourth consecutive time. My elevation would boost the morale of my community, which is hurt at not being adequately represented in the new PCC.        
	The 61-year-old, general secretary in the previous Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) headed by Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, had yesterday underscored the need for proportionate representation of the community in the PCC.        
	The Telegraph had reported in its edition on Tuesday that Muslim Congress leaders were upset after Hena and others from their community did not find a place in the PCC after the shuffle carried out on December 4.         
	The complaints assumed greater significance against the backdrop of the CPMs renewed attempts to win back Muslims, whose shifting loyalties have been partly blamed for the ruling Lefts reverses since the 2008 rural polls.        
	This morning, Bhuniya reached out to another leader. He called S.M.S. Haider, who heads the partys minority cell, and told him he would be inducted as secretary. Manasda called me to say not to grumble over non-representation of our leaders in the PCC. I shall be made a secretary, Haider said.         
	The new PCC has only one Muslim, Mohmmmed Sohrab, as vice-president.         
	The previous panel had four Muslim vice-presidents  Motahar Hossain, Kazi Abdul Gaffar, Fazle Haque and Nurul Islam, who died early this year.        
	Abdul Mannan was named the lone Muslim PCC general secretary this time but he resigned from the post last week to protest unwanted elements in the new set- up. That slot has not been filled.        
	Hena, elder son of the late Abdul Sattar, agriculture minister in the Ray-headed Congress government, said his first job as CLP chief would be to play an effective role as a responsible legislature party leader in the House and work in tandem with ally Trinamul Congress to expose the ruling communists misrule in Bengal.         
	In the 294-member House, the Congress has 21 legislators. Trinamul, with its 36 MLAs, has been given the status of the principal Opposition.        
	But some of Bhuniyas colleagues werent sure if Henas upgrade would help the Assembly polls months away. An MLA not on the best of terms with Bhuniya said Hena should have been appointed CLP chief soon after Manas was made PCC president in June.         
	With only a few months left for the Assembly election, and this House session being the last one before the polls, Hena will not be able to do much, the MLA added.

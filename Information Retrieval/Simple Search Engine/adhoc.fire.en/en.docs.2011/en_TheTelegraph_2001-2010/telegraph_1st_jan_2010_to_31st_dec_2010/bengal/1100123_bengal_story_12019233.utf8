          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 22: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees intervention has cleared the hurdles in the way of a CESC power plant in Haldia, its chairman Sanjiv Goenka said today.        
	Plans to build the 600MW plant on 334 acres were stuck for months apparently because CESC had not got from the government the last 30 acres.         
	The chief minister intervened about a month ago and things have started moving, Goenka said. We should get the land in the next 3-4 weeks.        
	The power utility that serves Calcutta will take three years to get the plant rolling.         
	The peak-hour demand for power has risen exponentially in the city over the past few years and 2009 was especially bad with long blackouts becoming a regular feature of once power-surplus Calcutta.        
	CESC is set to add 250MW in its Budge Budge plant, taking its capacity to 1225MW. But the peak-hour demand in Calcutta last year was 1582MW.        
	Goenka had earlier expressed his displeasure at the the delay in the transfer of the Haldia plot.        
	Land has been a vexing issue for industry as well as the government over the past few years. A proposed 1,000MW plant in Burdwans Katwa has had to be shelved because of resistance to land acquisition.        
	With the government going slow on procuring land for industry after a series of poll debacles, the Haldia Development Authority was sitting on the 30 acres, though the land had already been acquired.

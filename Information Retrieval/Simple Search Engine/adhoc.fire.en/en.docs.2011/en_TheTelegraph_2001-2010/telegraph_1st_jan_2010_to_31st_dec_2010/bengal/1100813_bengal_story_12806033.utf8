The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Drought cloud on rice
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Drought cloud on rice
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 12: The state has witnessed 33 per cent less rainfall this monsoon so far, prompting predictions of lower rice production and raising the spectre of a drought in seven south Bengal districts.        
	Two months into the monsoon season, the (rainfall) situation shows no signs of looking up. There is little chance of improvement within the next few days, state agriculture minister Naren De said today.        
	De said that this year, the rice production in the state was projected to fall to 123 lakh tonnes against the 150 lakh tonnes produced on average every year.         
	Every year, paddy is cultivated on 43 lakh hectares. But because of the lack of rains this time, we expect there will be no produce on 11 lakh hectares. So, the state is expected to lose out on about 27 lakh tonnes of rice. Last year, the state had produced 148 lakh tonnes, De said.        
	The minister said Bengals annual requirement of rice was 140 lakh tonnes.        
	Officials at the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore said Gangetic Bengal  the rice belt of the state  had witnessed 33 per cent less rainfall so far this year.        
	If the (rainfall) deficit reaches the 50 per cent mark, we will have a near-drought condition, De said. He said the districts worst affected by the rainfall deficit so far were Purulia, Bankura, Howrah, Hooghly and Birbhum.        
	Agriculture scientists said the state government was considering advising farmers to cultivate alternative crops such as maize, pulses and oilseeds that required less water. As a long-term measure, the government should make efforts to revive water bodies and dig new ponds for irrigation, said agriculture scientist Santanu Jha, who teaches at Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University in Kalyani.

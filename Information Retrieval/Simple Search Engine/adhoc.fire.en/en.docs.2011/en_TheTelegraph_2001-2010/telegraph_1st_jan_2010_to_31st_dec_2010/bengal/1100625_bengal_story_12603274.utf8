	Calcutta, June 24: The CPM state secretariat tonight ratified in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the draft report on the partys poor performance in the civic polls.         
	The report will be placed at the partys two-day state committee meeting, which begins on Saturday.        
	According to CPM insiders, the draft dwells at length on the partys organisational weaknesses that led to the debacle.

	Kakdwip, Nov. 1: The death toll in Saturdays trawler disaster today rose to 62, with 37 bodies being fished out of the Hooghly during search operations that were affected by heavy rain and the rivers turbulence.         
	We have recovered 62 bodies. The search operation was slow today because of the inclement weather. We will continue the search tomorrow, said Nilanjan Shandilya, the additional district magistrate (revenue) of South 24-Parganas.        
	Home secretary G.D. Gautama said at Writers Buildings that 73 people were still missing. He said 220 people had boarded the trawler that capsized near Kakdwip.         
	We calculated the figures from reports collected from the panchayats of the five villages from which people had gone to the fair at Hijli Sharif, Gautama said. The people were returning from the fair in East Midnapores Khejuri when the tragedy happened.        
	The home secretary said the state government would pay a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the family of each of the dead.         
	Mamata Banerjee has also announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of the dead. The Trinamul Congress chief reached Kakdwip at 11 last night and visited some of the injured at the subdivisional hospital. She also visited two villages  Anandanagar and Bhutor Mollah Pole. Most of the dead and injured are from these two places. Mamata returned to Calcutta in the early hours today.        
	The district administration has launched a probe into the cause of the accident. An FIR has been lodged against the owner of the trawler and the boatman. We are yet to ascertain the cause of the accident. Overloading and strong river currents are two of the possibilities, Gautama said.        
	Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly accompanied the search teams, which comprised divers from the navy, Calcutta Port Trust and the civil defence department.         
	Union minister C.M. Jatua of Trinamul today visited Kakdwip and monitored search operations. There is a lack of coordination between the district administration and those involved in search operations. No post-mortem was done at Kakdwip Hospital yesterday. The bodies were sent to Diamond Harbour Hospital. This led to a delay in handing over the bodies of the victims to their families, Jatua said.        
	Nearly 1,000 villagers today blocked NH117, which connects Taratala with Kakdwip, from 3pm, demanding speedy post-mortems and the release of bodies to families.

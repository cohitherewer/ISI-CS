The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mollah patta jab at Opposition 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mollah patta jab at Opposition 
          DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY                               
	Bhangar (South 24-Parganas), Sept. 20: Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today accused the Opposition-run rural bodies of stalling the distribution of pattas among landless peasants.        
	A patta is a land deed that entitles a landless peasant to cultivate a plot free of cost. However, he or she does not have the right to sell it.        
	We have about 10,000 acres of vested land in the state which can be distributed among landless peasants. But we are being prevented from distributing them as pattas in the districts where the Opposition controls zilla parishads, panchayat samitis and gram panchayats. This is unjust, Mollah told an event organised to distribute pattas among 1,600 families in South 24-Parganas.         
	He said the government would organise a Patta Divas in all the districts.        
	The Opposition is of the opinion that if pattas are distributed by the Left Front government, the credit will go to us. Some people are regularly threatening block development officers and telling them patta distribution cannot be carried out before 2011 (when the Assembly polls will be held), he said, without naming the Trinamul Congress.

	Bolpur, Aug. 8: Five persons have been arrested for allegedly parading nude a minor tribal girl and video-recording the incident.         
	The men had stripped the girl of her clothes in Birbhums Rampurhat for speaking to a truck driver.         
	They were arrested after police came across an MMS of the video footage circulated by the five.

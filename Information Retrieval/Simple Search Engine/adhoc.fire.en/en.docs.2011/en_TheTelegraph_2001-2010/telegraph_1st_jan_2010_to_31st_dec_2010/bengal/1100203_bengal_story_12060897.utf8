  - Subrata goes to ally, colleague asks why the hurry        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata with Subrata at her home. Telegraph picture                                         
	Calcutta, Feb. 2: Mamata Banerjee may have her differences with the Congress but the compulsions of electoral politics ensured that she sat with state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee today to chalk out a joint campaign and strategy for the civic polls a few months away.         
	After last years Lok Sabha poll success, the Congress-Trinamul combine is again set to put to test a united effort for the elections to 82 civic bodies, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, being seen widely as a precursor to next years Assembly elections.         
	The process of jointly contesting the civic polls began today with a preliminary discussion with Mamata on our campaign and strategy. The talks were very positive, Mukherjee told a news conference with the Trinamul chief seated next to him after a 35-minute meeting at her Kalighat home this afternoon.        
	He added that the details of the seat-sharing deal would be worked out later. But I can tell you that if we are able to put up consensus candidates, we shall win almost all the 82 civic bodies.        
	The Opposition controls only 26 of the 82 civic bodies.         
	Mamata said: It has been agreed upon that we will contest the civic polls and the 2011 Assembly polls together, come what may.         
	Write it down, our alliance will remain intact despite attempts by some to scuttle it, she added, alluding to a CPM note circulated among members after its just-concluded state committee meeting. The note says the Opposition alliance may not last long.        
	Mamata today put behind for the sake of the electoral al-liance all her recent differen- ces with the Congress, from sending central forces to Lalgarh to sharing the dais with the CPM at various programmes.        
	Didi is serious about ke- eping it intact because of her own political compulsions. She is confident that the Congress, which has a secure and traditional vote bank, would help her sweep the polls, said a Trinamul vice-president.        
	At the news conference, Mamata bristled when asked if Mukherjee wanted to switch to her party so that he could become the Calcutta mayor again. Why are you asking this embarrassing question when he has come here to meet me as a Congress representative? she asked.        
	Mukherjee, who had men-tored Mamata as a Congress leader, had joined Trinamul later and was elected mayor in 2000. But he returned to the parent party after Trinamul refused to make him the mayor even if it won the 2005 polls.         
	Trinamul sources admitted that the possible mayoral candidate was among the issues discussed today.         
	Note of dissent        
	Mukherjees meeting angered the other Congress working president, Pradip Bhattacharya, who said he had not been told about it.         
	I was under the impression that the dialogue with Mamata would begin only after we discussed our own strategy for the civic polls at a meeting with (state party president) Pranab Mukherjee on February 8. I dont know why Subrata was in a hurry to meet Mamata when we are yet to set our own house in order, he said.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Students stay off schools
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Kamardah High School on Friday. (Jahangir Badsa)                                  
	Tamluk, Nov. 26: Very few students attended school in violence-wracked Khejuri today and in Sunia, across the river, all educational institutions remained closed for the third consecutive day.         
	The schools in Khejuri had opened today after remaining closed since Wednesday, when armed CPM cadres had made a failed attempt to recapture the area.         
	Most schools closed for the day after prayers because not even 10 per cent of the students were present. Several teachers were also absent.         
	Most of the students and their guardians are scared following the violence in Khejuri. That is why the attendance today was so poor, said Dipankar Roy, the district inspector of schools. I have asked the subinspector of schools in Contai to assess the situation and inform me, he added.        
	A source in the office of the district inspector of schools said all 10 schools in Sunia, on the other side of the Rasulpur river, would remain closed until normality returned.         
	At the high school in Khejuris Kamardah, the village the cadres had tried to recapture, only 50 of the 700 students turned up. Around 40 students sat for the Madhyamik pre-test while those from other classes were asked to return home after prayers.         
	Headmaster Gourishankar Pradhan said the Class X students who remained absent today would be allowed to sit for the test some other day.         
	On Wednesday, cadres had entered the school and asked the hostel cook to prepare a feast for them.        
	The attendance in all the other nine high schools and 20 primary schools in Khejuri and its neighbouring villages was equally dismal today.         
	At Birbandar village, where a Class XI student had been hit by a stray bullet in his left leg during the CPM-Trinamul clash, the lone school saw only 70 of its 900 students attending classes. Those present were asked to leave after prayers.         
	Headmaster Nirupam Giri said most of the students lived in villages along the banks of the Rasulpur river. There has been sporadic exchange of fire in those areas since Wednesday. So the majority of the students did not step out of their homes in fear, Giri said.        
	He said many students could not sit for the Madhyamik pre-test. We will make alternative arrangements for those absent, Giri said.        
	Kamardah resident Archana Maity said her granddaughter Shobhana, a Class VI student of Kamardah High School, was yet to recover from the shock of Wednesdays violence.        
	Archana said Trinamul activists were targeting the villagers who had been forced by the CPM to participate in a procession on Wednesday. The houses of some of the villagers have been ransacked. So I decided against sending Shobhana to school today, Archana said.        
	Another Kamardah resident, Shankari Mondal, a Class X student, said: My home is only 1km from my school. But I did not go to school today as I did not want to risk my life.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	April 12: A Calcutta police team today detained a 19-year-old in South Dinajpur to find out the identity of a person who had called up a telecom service providers office in Chhattisgarhs Raipur a couple of days ago and threatened many Dantewada-type attacks in the future.         
	The police said the person who had issued the threat was in frequent touch with Amit Saha, who was brought to Calcutta from Kumarganj this evening.        
	Special task force personnel who had arrived in district headquarters Balurghat yesterday picked up Saha, known to be an active supporter of the CPM student wing, from his home today.         
	The person who had called up the Airtel office in Raipur apparently used to call Sahas number frequently and speak at length.         
	On all occasions, the calls have been traced to Chandrakona in West Midnapore.        
	Our aim is to find out from Saha the identity of the person who issued the threat, said Rajeev Kumar, special additional commissioner of police, special task force. The probe is in an initial stage.         
	Sources said Saha told the police the caller was a student whom he had met on train while travelling to Calcutta recently. He also said the caller had told him he was from Raiganj in North Dinajpur.        
	Saha is believed to have named the caller, but the police would not reveal it. We are trying to verify claims, an officer said.        
	The SIM card Saha has been using is registered in the name of Sujit Sutradhar, also a Kumarganj resident. Police had initially detained Sutradhar, but let him go later.

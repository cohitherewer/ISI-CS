	Dec. 12: Two policemen and a local tough allegedly assaulted a government hospital doctor in Hooghly last night after the father of one of the policemen died.         
	Susmit Das was slapped and then pushed to the ground and kicked by a mob.         
	According to police, the 65-year-old father of a Calcutta Police constable, Sujoy Saha, was taken to Serampore Walsh hospital with breathing difficulty around 8.45pm yesterday. He died at 10.15 pm.        
	Dr Das said Gopal Saha was in a critical condition. I immediately administered oxygen. I then went on a round to check on other patients. Around 10pm, I was told Sahas condition had worsened. He died soon after, the doctor said.        
	Das said, a little later, the patients family came with some youths and attacked him. They slapped me. My spectacles were thrown off. Then they pushed me to the ground and kicked and dealt blows on me.         
	K.P. Barui, sub-divisional police officer of Serampore, said: We arrested five people, including Biswajit Duttagupta of the state armed police and Sandip Nandi, who was wanted by the police. We did not arrest Sujoy because he will have to perform the last rites of his father.

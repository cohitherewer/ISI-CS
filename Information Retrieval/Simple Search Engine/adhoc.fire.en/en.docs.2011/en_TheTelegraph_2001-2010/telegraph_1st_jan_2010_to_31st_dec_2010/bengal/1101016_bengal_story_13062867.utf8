          OUR BUREAU                          Waterlogging in front of a pandal in East Midnapore on Friday. (Jahangir Badsa)                                  
	Oct. 15: Incessant rain today dampened the Puja mood in coastal East Midnapore, including Digha and Contai, amid forecast of more showers till tomorrow evening in the district.         
	Officials at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore said the rain was being caused by a depression over the Bay of Bengal close to the Orissa coast.         
	Met officials said several parts of south Bengal, especially East and West Midnapore and South 24-Parganas, were likely to receive heavy rain till tomorrow evening. While the coastal belt could experience a washout, other parts of the three districts would receive heavy rain, an official said.        
	The depressions influence should wane within a few hours of landfall, another Met official said.        
	The sky above East Midnapore was overcast in the morning. As the day wore on, heavy rain started.         
	District officials said nearly 350 of the 700-odd pujas in the district were affected by the downpour.        
	There is mud and slush in front of pandals. The surroundings of several pandals have been waterlogged, said Ujjwal Sengupta, the block development officer of Ramnagar. The situation is similar in Nandigram.        
	Around 2,000 people who were supposed to visit Digha today cancelled their hotel bookings.         
	The organisers of a puja in Ramnagar said only 10,000 to 15,000 people visited their pandal today instead of the usual one lakh on Ashtami.        
	However, in Haldia and Tamluk, the rain stopped this evening and people thronged the pandals.

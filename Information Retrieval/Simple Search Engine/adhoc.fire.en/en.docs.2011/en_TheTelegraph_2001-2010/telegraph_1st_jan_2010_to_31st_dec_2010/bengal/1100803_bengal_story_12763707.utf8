The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Left Front bow amp; arrow for Mamata
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Left Front bow amp; arrow for Mamata
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Calcutta, Aug 2: The Left Front today played good cop and bad cop on Lalgarh, the administration allowing Mamata Banerjee to hold a rally there next week with conditions but the CPM accusing her of declaring the meeting apolitical to let in Maoists.         
	The state government thinks it is not desirable to hold a rally in Lalgarh where prohibitory orders are in place. But if a political party insists on organising a rally there, permission will be given with a string of conditions, state home secretary Samar Ghosh said.         
	Mamata had declared that she would hold a meeting in Lalgarh on August 9 and had asked the Left Front government to ensure her security during the trip.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose today told a rally in Esplanade that the Trinamul chief had labelled the meeting apolitical so that Maoists could attend the event.        
	On July 21, the Trinamul chief had said she would hold a political programme at Lalgarh. In a turnaround yesterday, she announced that the meeting would be apolitical and invited supporters from like-minded parties. Actually, its the Maoists who were against a party meeting at Lalgarh so that people close to them could attend the event. They dictated terms and Trinamul accepted them, Bose said.        
	The Left Front chairman also countered Mamatas allegation that the CPM had formed suicide squads to kill her.         
	These are wild allegations. From her statements, it becomes clear that her party has been thinking of such a way to attack the Leftists, Bose said. He urged his party workers to be cautious and keep the party informed if you face any problem.        
	Mamata refused comment on the permission, saying: Let me get the copy of the order first. Only then will I be able to react.         
	Trinamul leaders reacted strongly to Boses allegations about the partys nexus with Maoists.         
	Didi said the event would be apolitical to draw a cross-section of people to the meeting, called to protest the CPMs terror politics. Boses comments are nothing but an attempt to garner cheap political gains, Trinamul leader Subrata Bakshi said.        
	Rebel bandh        
	The Maoists and the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities have called a 48-hour Bengal bandh from tomorrow to protest the death of committee leader Sidhu Soren in an encounter with the police on July 26.

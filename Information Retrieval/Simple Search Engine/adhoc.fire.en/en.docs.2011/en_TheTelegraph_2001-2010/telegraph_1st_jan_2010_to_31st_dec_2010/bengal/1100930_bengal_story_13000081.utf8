	Serampore, Sept. 29: Two persons were arrested in Hooghly today in connection with the death of a Congress worker in a bomb-and-bullet attack on a blood-donation camp at Habra in North 24-Parganas last December.        
	Srimanta Dolui and Sanjib Patra are wanted in the Bapi Chowdhury murder case. The duo are hired killers. We had information that they were coming to Serampore to kill an antisocial, said K.P. Barui, the subdivisional police officer of Serampore. They were arrested after they got off a train at Baidyabati station.         
	A motorcycle-borne gang had attacked the blood-donation camp, near which a sit-and-draw competition was also being organised. The attackers had targeted Bapi, allegedly for protesting local gambling rings. Trinamul Congress supporter Ranjit Roy was also killed.         
	Barui said Dolui and Patra had told the police that the main accused in the case, Nanigopal Das, who was arrested in May, had hired them to murder Bapi.

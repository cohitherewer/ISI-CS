	Calcutta, Nov. 4: The state government today set up a four-member committee to find out the cause of Saturdays trawler tragedy near Kakdwip and fix responsibility.         
	The death toll today climbed to 83 with one body being recovered.        
	Home secretary G.D. Gautama said at Writers Buildings that the committee, led by divisional commissioner of presidency range, K.N. Behera, would also probe whether the trawler, which was fished out of the Hooghly today, had a valid licence.         
	The committee will submit its report within a month. It will recommend ways to avoid such mishaps in the future, the home secretary said.        
	Nilanjan Shandilya, the additional district magistrate (revenue) of South 24-Parganas, said the trawler was found on the riverbed near Chakfulbari, close to the accident spot.

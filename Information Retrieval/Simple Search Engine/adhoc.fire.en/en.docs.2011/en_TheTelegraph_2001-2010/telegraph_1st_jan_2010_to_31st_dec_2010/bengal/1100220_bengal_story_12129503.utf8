	Calcutta, Feb. 19: No roll calls, no security drills, no daily briefing to the district headquarters and no surprise inspection or supervision by senior officers.        
	This was how the Shilda camp, where 24 Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) jawans were massacred by Maoists on Monday, was run.        
	This is also how most other camps of the state police are run, officials reviewing the security set-up in West Midnapore said today.         
	The investigation by the police brass reveals that basic security norms were not followed in the camp.        
	We were shocked to find that there was no roll call of the jawans and the mandatory drills had not been carried out for months. They were anything but battle ready, a senior officer told The Telegraph.        
	He said the district administration compromised the security of the camp and of its personnel. What was the point of setting up a camp when the jawans were not secured. There was no infrastructure at all, he asked.         
	No senior officer ever visited or went on a surprise check to ascertain if security measures were in place. This is true of most other state police camps, the officer said, in sharp contrast to the security alertness of the central forces.         
	Inspections have to be conducted every week to find out the battle-readiness of the jawans and their problems. The exercise has not been carried out in any of the police camps since they were set up to combat the Maoists. Senior officers need to attend the drill every week to oversee their preparedness. After inspection, they can tell the camp-in-charge what they are lacking and how to secure the camp. Such visits also help in boosting morale, the officer said.        
	After the inspection, the officer is expected to give a standing order to the person in charge of the camp and other policemen, especially sentries. The standing order is based on how many people will be guarding the camp and others co-ordinating with local people, he said.         
	About the Shilda camp, he said: With no bunkers and watch towers, it resembled a dharamsala. Most of the time the 50-odd policemen at the camp slept or relaxed.         
	The subedar who was in charge of the camp was reporting to the inspector in charge of Binpur police station but there was little co-ordination.        
	Even regular briefings to the district headquarters or the commandant didnt take place. Despite the intelligence inputs, nobody bothered, the officer added.         
	A senior EFR officer blamed the district administration for the massacre. We had written six times to the superintendent of police to shift the camp to a strategic location but nothing was done. Our policemen were kept there to be used as cannon fodder, he said.        
	He recounted how CRPF personnel had refused to stay in the camp last year, citing security reasons. After a night at the camp, they forced the authorities to shift them to a secluded place.

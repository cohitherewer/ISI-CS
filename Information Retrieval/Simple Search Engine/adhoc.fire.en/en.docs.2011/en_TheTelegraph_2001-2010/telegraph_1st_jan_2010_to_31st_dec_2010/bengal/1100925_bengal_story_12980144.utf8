The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Alert saves, fingers point
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Alert saves, fingers point
          OUR BUREAU                          The carcass of one of the elephants being taken away on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	Sept. 24: Alerted by the forest department, the railways today halted a train for half an hour to let an elephant herd pass the same spot where seven were crushed to death in north Bengal less than 48 hours ago.        
	The life-saving information flowed in the middle of an open blame game between the railways and the state forest department over the mass death on Wednesday night when a goods train ran over a herd. Another but less raucous round of finger-pointing involving the Union environment and forest ministry also unfolded during the day.        
	The Alipurduar-bound Intercity Express stood at Binnaguri station in the Dooars, waiting for an all-clear signal from forest officials till the herd in Jalpaiguris Moraghat loitered away from the tracks.         
	The railways today stressed that the accident spot in Jalpaiguri was not a notified elephant section, suggesting that the goods train was not required to follow the cautionary guidelines laid down for elephant corridors.        
	The railways said in a statement today: It appears that the elephants came far away from the forest area and their movement pattern was beyond the area identified by the ministry of environment and forest.         
	According to a railway official, only four notified elephant corridors fall between Alipurduar and Siliguri: Gulma-Sevoke, Chulsa-Nagrakata, Madarihat-Hashimara and Hashimara-Kalchini. The elephants were crushed at Moraghat, 30km from the nearest of the four corridors, Chulsa-Nagrakata.         
	Trains are supposed to ply at a maximum speed of 50kmph through elephant corridors, blowing the whistle constantly. The state forest department said the goods train was travelling at a speed of 70kmph on Wednesday night.        
	Bengal forest minister Ananta Roy blamed the railways for evading responsibilities by issuing such statements. The railway authorities should know that elephants do not understand notified or non-notified areas. Elephants roam around the entire Dooars stretch, he added.         
	Atanu Raha, the principal chief conservator of forests, said: Elephants reside and roam about in the area between the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary near Siliguri and the Buxa Tiger Reserve near Alipurduar. There are several notified and non-notified elephant corridors in that area. In no way can the railways justify movement of the train at 70kmph through Moraghat.        
	The railway statement also cited the absence of advance information. The railways did not get any advance information from forest officials regarding the unusual movement of elephants in and around the non-notified elephant section. Therefore, the drivers of the goods train were not aware of the elephant movement, the statement said.        
	Union environment and forest minister Jairam Ramesh said in a statement from New York that the accident happened despite several assurances from the railways that it would put in place measures to avoid such tragedies.         
	Ramesh said he had written several letters to the railway ministry and had held a number of meetings with officials of the Railway Board to discuss measures to mitigate train hits. I have been reassured on more than one occasion that these measures will be put in place, he said.        
	The minister said he would again meet Railway Board officials when he returns to India on September 26.         
	An official said the Railway Board had suggested some measures to stop elephant deaths from train hits to the Bengal forest ministry in March. However, the board was still awaiting a reply, the official said.        
	 The suggestions include fencing of tracks, erecting ramps to prevent animals from coming near the train line and constructing underpasses.         
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee said: I understand that this unfortunate incident took place in an area outside the identified elephant corridors. I have asked the Railway Board to work out a joint strategy with the Union ministry of environment and forest to prevent such incidents.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 24: A teacher of a Ballygunge school was today arrested for allegedly beating up a Class I student for being inattentive in class.        
	Mamata Ghosh, who teaches at Kamala Chatterjee Girls School, was arrested after eight-year-old Srijas father lodged a police complaint yesterday.        
	Ghosh, who was picked up from her home in Tollygunge, has been released on bail.        
	The teacher had detained my daughter inside a classroom after classes ended. She also beat up Srija for failing to bring her drawing material to school as she had been instructed the day before. Ghosh accused my daughter of being inattentive and punished her, Srijas father Sabyasachi Das said.         
	Das said he had gone to pick up Srija from school at 10am yesterday. She came out weeping. There were red bruises all over her face. The teacher had slapped her so hard that blood had clotted over her left jaw, Das alleged.        
	Pushpa Bhaduri, the headmistress, said: We will hold a meeting on Monday to inquire into the allegation.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, Aug. 25: A CPM functionary was arrested in Nanoor in connection with political murder two weeks after a Trinamul Congress leader was held, with the Opposition party saying police were trying to strike a balance in the changing political scenario in the state.         
	Jainal Sheikh, a CPM local committee member and panchayat functionary, was arrested from his home in connection with the murder of five Trinamul workers. He is also accused of being involved in several political clashes in the Birbhum town. The police found a musket and cartridges in his house.        
	Two weeks ago, Monirul Islam, the Trinamul vice-president of Birbhum, was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of three CPM workers.         
	Sources in the Birbhum unit of Trinamul and the CPM said the arrest of a member of the ruling party was unheard of in the district, once a Left stronghold, even till the Lok Sabha polls last year.         
	Bikash Chowdhury, the Bolpur Trinamul president, said: It appears that the police have understood that taking only the CPMs side will not help. It is clear that Trinamul will come to power in the Assembly polls next year. So the police are trying to strike a balance.        
	However, Birbhum superintendent of police Humayun Kabir denied Chowdhurys charge and said the police were working hard to stop political murders in Nanoor.        
	Jainal, 45, a member of the Thupsara gram panchayat, has been accused of being involved in three murder cases this year, including the killing of local Trinamul leader Munshi Nurul, 38.         
	Trinamul district president Anubrata Mondal said the party had submitted a list of 51 CPM workers to the police last month. These CPM workers had killed our supporters and we wanted them to be arrested. We are happy that Jainal has been arrested.         
	Nine days ago, the police raided the houses of two other CPM workers and seized two carbines and a pistol.         
	When asked about Jainals arrest, district CPM secretary Dilip Ganguly said: We want the law to take its own course.

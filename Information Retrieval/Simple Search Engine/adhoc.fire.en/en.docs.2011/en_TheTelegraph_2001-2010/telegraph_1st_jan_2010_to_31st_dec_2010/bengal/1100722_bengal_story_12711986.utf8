	Burdwan, July 21: Fourteen of the 20 unidentified bodies from the train tragedy were claimed by their relatives today but six could not be given away because the claimants could not produce identity proofs.        
	The bodies had been lying at the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital morgue. Claimants are required to furnish their photo-identity proofs along with those of the dead. A certificate from the local panchayat, giving address details of the deceased and the claimant and their relationship, is also needed.         
	But six claimants could not furnish these documents as they were from Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	Uttam Mishra, a resident of Bhagalpur who has lost his wife, eldest son, uncle and brother-in-law, said the procedure of handover of bodies was not so complicated at Suri Sadar Hospital, where too some of the bodies had been taken.         
	Mishra said he had collected the bodies of his wife, uncle and brother-in-law from the Suri hospital but could not take eldest son Ramus body from the Burdwan hospital because he could not furnish his sons identity proof. Ramu was only seven years old. He obviously did not have a voters identity card or PAN card. Now how will I get his body? Mishra asked.

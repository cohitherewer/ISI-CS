	Durgapur, Oct. 28: Durgapur Projects Limited today disconnected power supply to a central government-owned company because of non-payment of electricity bills to the tune of Rs 60 lakh since 2003.        
	The Mining and Allied Machinery Corporation in Durgapur was taken over by a consortium of Coal India, Damodar Valley Corporation and Bharat Earth Movers in June. The power bills had accumulated since 2003, a year after the company was declared closed by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction.

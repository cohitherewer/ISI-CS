The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minister car attacked
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Minister car attacked
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Roy (right) and the car that had been attacked                                  
	Barasat, April 14: Alleged CPM supporters today stoned a car carrying two Trinamul Congress ministers in North 24-Parganas Sashan and a glass shard from its smashed windshield tore through a bodyguards shirt and slashed him.        
	Junior Union ministers Mukul Roy and Sultan Ahmed reached the North 24-Parganas village around 11am to visit the house of Barun Roy, one of the two men killed in a CPM-Trinamul clash yesterday.        
	Police asked them to wait for an hour till security arrangements could be made and they did so. But when the ministers car and another, carrying party workers, started for the village in the interiors of Sashan, 25km from Calcutta, stones came flying from all direct- ions and the police looked on. The stones were being hurled even as our escorts looked on helplessly, said Ahmed, the Union minister of state for tourism.         
	A police officer said the ministers ducked on the cars floor to save themselves. A stone hit the windshield and a shard hit the stomach of Roys bodyguard, constable Kanai Mondal. Some among the mob also battered the car with sticks.        
	North 24-Parganas police chief Rahul Srivastava said: We chased away the mob to protect the ministers.        
	CPM leader Qutubuddin Ahmed admitted a demonstration around the ministers car but denied stone-throwing.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, April 23: A woman was found dead in a cottage on the Iskcon temple premises in Nadias Mayapur today.        
	The woman, aged around 30, had arrived yesterday with a man in his 40s and a two-year-old girl.         
	The man had identified himself as Anil Bhowmik, claimed his wife was Jhuma and registered themselves as a family. They had given an address in Nadias Chakdah. But it was false. We found a phone diary in her purse and called a few numbers but no one recognised her, said Nabadwip inspector-in-charge T. Karati.        
	Some Iskcon employees were attracted by the cries of the baby today. They called the police when they found the cottage locked from outside.

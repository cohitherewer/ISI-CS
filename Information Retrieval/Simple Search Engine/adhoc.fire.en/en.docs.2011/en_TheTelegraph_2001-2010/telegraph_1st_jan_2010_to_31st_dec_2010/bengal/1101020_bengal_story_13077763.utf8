The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM digital war on evil
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM digital war on evil
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 19: Tech-savvy comrades are relying on new tools  text messages and social networking sites  to attack Mamata Banerjee this festive season.        
	Asubher sathe aposhbiheen dwando chai (Let there be an uncompromising struggle with evil), read a text message a CPM whole-timer sent out with his Shubha Vijaya greetings.        
	The message did not identify the evil but it is common knowledge that comrades describe Mamata as asubho ar protikriyashil shakti (evil and reactionary force).         
	The political establishment in Bengal has a tradition of unofficially pressing a pause button on political programmes and rallies in the festive season  between Mahalaya and Lakshmi Puja. But as the chant for change gets louder across the state, the comrades are working round the clock to stem the slide in CPMs support base.        
	The SMS salvo  also spotted as the Facebook status message of the CPM wholetimer  assumes significance after a Sharodiya greeting card, designed by Mamata and sent to her friends, highlighted how the goddess was aiming a trident at an invisible evil.         
	With the Trinamul Congress and CPM heading for the ballot battle a few months from now, the meaning of evil is a no-brainer  the CPM in case Trinamul leaders are using the word, and Trinamul when CPM leaders have the expression on their lips.         
	Yes, we do describe her (Mamata) as an evil force in our exchanges over text messages or social networking sites. The wide reach of these mediums make them (the messages) more effective, said a young CPM leader.        
	Smiling comrades in kurta-pyjama selling party literature from neatly done-up stalls, draped in red and decorated with giant photographs of Marx-Lenin-Stalin, is a common scene across Bengal during the festive season. But this time, as the barb-laced messages suggest, the comrades are also active in the virtual world.        
	Through this festive season, many young turks of the CPM have not missed any opportunity to poke fun at Mamata and her performance as railway minister, filling the virtual world, for instance, with updates on delays in Metro.        
	Tollygunge station-e metro-r darja 15 minute dhore bondho roilo, automatic locking system collapse hoye jaoay. Political gimmick dite giye Kolkatar gorber Metro-ke kothai niye jachchen? (The doors of Metro remained closed for 15 minutes at Tollygunge station because of the collapse of the automatic locking system. Look where Metro, Calcuttas pride, is being taken as someone is busy in political gimmicks) reads the Facebook message of the CPM whole-timer.         
	Several people commented on the message, producing a lively discussion board even as Mamata was busy pandal-hopping and wishing people with Tagores poem, Anandalokey mangalalokey birajo satya sundaro.        
	A CPM state secretariat member saw nothing wrong in the practice. Its not a case of using or abusing the festive season these are disturbing times and people are being killed every second day. Our work is to make the people aware of such happenings through constant interaction. SMS or Facebook can be an engine to take us forward, he said.         
	Trinamul leaders shrugged off the attacks, saying such campaigns would not affect the partys prospects.         
	Let the CPM and its men do all this. Public opinion has gone against them and thats irreversible now. A loaded Facebook status message or a twisted text message wont help the CPM anymore, said a senior Trinamul MLA who is also a party general secretary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Govt plans blaze drive
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Govt plans blaze drive
  - More than 70 per cent city schools vulnerable to fire        MITA MUKHERJEE                          The gutted computer lab at Hindu School on Thursday                                        
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: The state government is planning a drive to identify state-run and state-aided schools in Calcutta that are vulnerable to fire and take safety measures, a move prompted by the two fires at Hindu School this week.        
	The fires at Hindu School (on Thursday and Friday) have made it necessary to examine all the schools thoroughly and immediately initiate measures wherever necessary, said Dibyen Mukherjee, director in the school education department.         
	Mukherjee said a meeting would be held next week to discuss how quickly the government could start implementing the fire-safety measures.         
	He said the government had started the process of assessing fire-safety arrangements in schools a few years ago following a Supreme Court verdict that all schools should have fire-fighting measures in place. The ruling had come after a blaze at a school in Tamil Nadus Kumbakonam killed nearly 90 children in 2004.        
	A source in the school education department said the assessment process had revealed that more than 70 per cent of the 1,500 government-run and government-aided schools in Calcutta were vulnerable to fire.         
	The source said most such schools in Calcutta had only one entry and exit point. There is only a single staircase in several school buildings that have four to six floors, he said. The source cited as an example the four-storey Sanskrit Collegiate School in College Square that had only a single staircase.         
	A lone staircase makes escape and rescue work during a blaze difficult if the fire reaches it, the source said.         
	The source said the school education department would prepare a report on the fire-fighting preparedness of the 1,500 schools. On the basis of the report, we will hold a meeting with the public works department and the finance department to chalk out the amount of funds we will need to build a second set of staircases and entry and exit points at these schools, the source said.        
	Education department officials said many of the school buildings in Calcutta were old and it was difficult to build a second set of staircases and entry and exit points there.        
	Over the past 10 years, the electricity consumption in most schools has increased considerably with the installation of computers, air-conditioners, fax machines and LCD projectors. But the old wirings have not been replaced with new ones to bear the excess load. Schools that have kitchens for cooking mid-day meals are more vulnerable to fire, the source said.         
	Many schools are located in narrow lanes  especially in Burrabazar and Bowbazar  which could make it difficult for fire engines to carry out operations, the source added.         
	Dipak Das, general secretary of the West Bengal Government School Teachers Association, said: What happened in Kumbakonam could happen any day at some of the schools in Calcutta if immediate measures are not taken to set up proper fire-safety arrangements.        
	Das said that after the Stephen Court fire, the association had surveyed fire-fighting arrangements in state-run schools and submitted a memorandum to the state government in March, requesting it to ensure that every school had two entry and exit points. But no action has been taken so far, he alleged.

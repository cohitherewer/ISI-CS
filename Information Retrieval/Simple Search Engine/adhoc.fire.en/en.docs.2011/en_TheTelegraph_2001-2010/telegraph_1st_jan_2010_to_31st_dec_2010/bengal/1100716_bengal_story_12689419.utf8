	Midnapore, July 15: Suspected Maoists hacked and shot dead a singer enlisted with Akashvani, Calcutta, in West Midnapore, accusing her of being a police informer.         
	Nilmoni Tudu, 45, who used to sing in Akashvanis Santhali programmes, had also been elected as a member of the local Kendubari gram panchayat 10 years ago on a Jharkhand Mukti Morcha ticket.         
	Nilmonis husband, Furlai Tudu, 57, said a group of 12 armed Maoists came to their house in Gopiballavpurs Patharnasha village last night and asked for drinking water.         
	After drinking the water, they asked my wife to accompany them. They accused her of being a police informer and said she would be tried in a peoples court, Furlai, a farmer, said. I cried and requested them to leave my wife but they did not listen. One of them slapped me and took Nilmoni away to a nearby forest, Furlai said.        
	Villagers saw Nilmonis body lying on a road 4km from her house around nine this morning. She was shot behind the neck and had multiple hacking injuries. Nilmoni was an enlisted Santhali singer with All India Radio, said Manoj Verma, the district superintendent of police.        
	Verma said the group of Maoists had killed a youth in Orissas Haribhanga village and set fire to two houses before killing Nilmoni, whose village is 1km from the Orissa border. Verma added that the rebels could have targeted the two villages because there had been recent raids by joint forces in the area.

	Calcutta/Purulia, Dec. 17: Last nights killings appear mainly to be the fallout of Maoists anger at villagers who they suspect have been passing on information to police about rebel hideouts in the Ayodhya Hills.        
	The area has become a safe haven for many of the rebels who have fled parts of Jungle Mahal in neighbouring West Midnapore and Bankura following the crackdown by the joint forces and the return of CPM cadres.         
	Intelligence sources believe that yesterdays murders were meant to deter villagers from tipping off the police and fortifying the rebels safe haven.         
	Intelligence branch inspector Partha Biswas and his schoolteacher friend were allegedly taken hostage from the area in October.         
	The rebels are particularly suspicious of Forward Bloc supporters. We conducted an internal investigation after an attack on our camp at Bamni village by security forces on November 12. Two of our comrades were killed. Our probe revealed that without specific information, it was not possible to locate our secret camps. We came to know it was the local Forward Bloc activists who had informed the police, said a source in the CPI (Maoist).        
	He did not specify whether the seven persons killed last night had passed on any such information but suggested the strikes were meant to guard the rebel turf. They had caused damage to our organisation and that is why they have been punished. We will protect our stronghold in Ayodhya Hills at any cost as it is very important to us.        
	According to officials of the state intelligence branch (IB), some of the rebel leaders on the run from Lalgarh have taken shelter in Nayagram in West Midnapore, along the Orissa border, and the Ayodhya Hills.         
	Both places are strategic locations for the rebels. Nayagram is located along the Bengal-Orissa border and Ayodhya Hills is linked with Jharkhand through forest routes. The two neighbouring states are Maoist hotbeds. In Ayodhya Hills, rebels are in vantage position because of its geographical location. If they find it difficult to fight the police, they will simply sneak into Jharkhand, said an IB officer.        
	The police admitted that the latest spate of killings could trigger a panic-induced exodus. It will certainly affect our intelligence network. After the massacre, do you think people will come forward to help us with information on the rebels? asked another officer.         
	The villagers are already on the edge. There are 1,200 people in the area, most of them Bloc workers and supporters. We feel scared being with the party after such an attack, said Tarapada Singh, a supporter and a resident of Banghbinda whose woman pradhan Chapala Garai was one of the seven killed last night.        
	Another supporter, Subodh Mahato, said: We have to often attend party meetings and processions. Now we will have to speak to our party leaders. If we dont get assurances about our security, we cant remain in the party.

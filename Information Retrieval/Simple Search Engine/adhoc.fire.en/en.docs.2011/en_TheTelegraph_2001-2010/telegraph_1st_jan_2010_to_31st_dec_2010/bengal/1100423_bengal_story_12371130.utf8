                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hunger protest for arrears
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, April 22: A senior clerk of a government-aided high school in Burdwans Kulti, who joined work in 2002 after six years in suspension, today sat on an indefinite hunger strike in front of the school demanding arrears for the intervening period.         
	Tapas Mondal, 54, who claimed that Rs 2.44 lakh was due to him, was suspended from service following his arrest in March 1996 after his neighbour brought charges of assault against him. He was sent to judicial custody by an Asansol court.         
	The authorities of Mithani High School suspended him after he was jailed. Mondal said he received half his salary for the first three months of suspension and then 75 per cent of the amount till 2002.         
	Although Mondal got bail two months after he was sentenced, he was not allowed to join work.         
	The school authorities told me that I could join only after the case was dismissed. The court acquitted me in March 2002 and I resumed normal duties after that, Mondal said.         
	However, Mondal alleged he was yet to receive the money deducted from his salary during his suspension.        
	I have been proved innocent. Why should I be deprived of my dues? I have approached the school managing committee and the director of school education but nothing has happened, he said.         
	Two high court orders asking the school to pay Mondal his dues have not yielded any results.        
	Now I have no option but to sit on a hunger strike, he said.

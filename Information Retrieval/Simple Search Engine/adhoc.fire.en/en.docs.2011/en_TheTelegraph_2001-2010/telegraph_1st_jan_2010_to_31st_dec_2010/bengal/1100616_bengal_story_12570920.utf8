   Charge: unlawful assembly          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Midnapore, June 15: A senior scientist of the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute in Calcutta and two Jadavpur residents were arrested along with 10 Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities members from a village 12km from Lalgarh this afternoon.         
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said they had been held for unlawful assembly from an area where Section 144 of the CrPC was in force. It disallows any congregation of more than four people.        
	The trio from Calcutta were identified as Nisha Biswas, 50, the scientist, Kanishka Chowdhury, 50, who claimed to be a college teacher, and Manik Mondal, 30, who said he was an author.        
	The police said the three had been visiting villages in and around Lalgarh since Saturday. They had even attended a kangaroo court where villagers were beaten up for violating the PCPAs diktats, an officer said.        
	The police are mulling whether to charge them under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). A senior officer said they had evidence to suggest the three had been raising funds for Maoists. We are interrogating them for more details on the amounts and frequency of such contributions. We are exploring whether the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act can be used against them.        
	The three are members of the Lalgarh Sanghati Mancha, which, an officer said, is virtually an arm of the Maoists.        
	Verma said the police learnt about a Peoples Committee meeting in Mathurapur and rushed as it was within the area where the prohibitory orders were in force.        
	By the time a joint force team reached the village from the Dharampur camp, the gathering had dispersed. The three from Calcutta were found in a room in one of the huts in the village. Around 60 others were detained from other parts of Mathurapur and brought to the Pirakata outpost, where all except the 10 PCPA members and the three from Calcutta were let off, an officer said. They will be produced in court tomorrow.        
	Bandh: The Maoists have called a bandh in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore on June 18, the day the joint forces had entered the region a year ago. Maoist squad leader Manoj Mahato said they would observe it as Dhikkar (condemnation) Day. In the past, the guerrillas have triggered blasts to spread terror and ensure their bandhs success.

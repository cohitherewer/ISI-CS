          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, Oct. 3: Armed robbers stopped at least 10 vehicles and looted cash and valuables on an unpatrolled Birbhum road last night, prompting police to suspend the on-duty officer who was not present at the time of the heist.        
	The police said a gang of 25 masked robbers armed with revolvers, pipe guns and daggers blocked a road connecting Bolpur and Illambazar with tree branches around 10pm. They stopped the cars, mostly goods carriages, and plundered Rs 1 lakh in cash and valuables.        
	The victims claimed no policeman was in sight during the one-and-a-half-hour robbery on the road running through Choupahari forest.        
	Birbhum police authorities have suspended assistant sub-inspector Sachin Pal, who was in charge of patrolling the 25km stretch between 6pm yesterday and 6am today.         
	Birbhum superintendent of police Humayun Kabir said preliminary investigation had revealed that local people were involved in the robbery.         
	We are interrogating some local people and hope to make a breakthrough soon. We have suspended Pal for remaining absent from patrol duty, Kabir said.        
	Of the 10 vehicles forced to stop by the robbers, eight were pickup and matador vans, one was a truck and the other a Sumo whose lone occupant was the driver. The masked men surrounded the vehicles and ordered the occupants at gunpoint to get off.         
	The driver of a matador van, Pradip Ganguly, said one of the robbers hit him on the head and the shoulders with the butt of a revolver when he refuse to part with his money and cellphone.         
	Pradip, whose vehicle was the last to be stopped, said: The robbers rushed towards my matador with revolvers and asked me to stop. When I refused to hand over the Rs 5,000 I was carrying, one of the robbers entered the cabin of my matador, hit me with a revolver butt and snatched my money and cellphone.         
	The others, however, had handed over their valuables  mobile phones, gold rings and cash  without protesting, a police officer said.        
	Pradip and some of the other victims have lodged an FIR at Illambazar police station. Pradip was taken to the Illambazar primary health centre and given first aid.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | When in doubt, call a bandh
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      When in doubt, call a bandh
  - Indefinite hill strike from today        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Darjeeling, June 18: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today called an indefinite strike in the hills from tomorrow, falling back on a time-tested tactic after being forced on the backfoot following rival Madan Tamangs murder.         
	The Morcha, which had been looking for a way to reassert its strength, said the bandh was called to protest the governments failure to explain a baton charge on its supporters in Kurseong on Wednesday.         
	The government has been stepping up heat on the Bimal Gurung-led party since Tamangs daylight murder on May 21 by suspected Morcha supporters. The administration started asserting its writ after nearly three years.         
	The CRPF was deployed in Darjeeling town after Tamangs murder. Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) administrator B.L. Meena filed FIRs against Gorkhaland Personnel, a Morcha squad of lathi-wielding volunteers which has been illegally occupying government properties. On Wed-nesday night, the police even visited the squads headquart- ers, 35km from Darjeeling town, something unthinkable a few months ago given the states non-confrontation policy.         
	Meena also started a probe into the development projects undertaken in the hills following last years devastation caused by cyclone Aila.        
	Under the circumstances, the Morcha had been looking for a chance to put the press- ure back on the government. The strike will continue unless the administration gives us a written explanation on the decision to lathicharge a peaceful gathering, assistant secretary Binay Tamang said.        
	But faced with a Supreme Court notice, the outfit has decided to keep NH31A, the lifeline of Sikkim, out of the strikes purview. Tea gardens, cinchona plantations and schools where the mid-term exams are due have also been exempted.

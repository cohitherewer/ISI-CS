The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Front split on quota for Muslims
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Front split on quota for Muslims
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 27: The Left Front is divided on reservation for Muslims in education and government jobs as recommended by a Centre-appointed commission and demanded by the Forward Bloc.         
	The CPI has supported the Bloc demand. But the RSP considers any such move a departure from traditional Left position and has dubbed it sheer opportunism to win back Muslim voters who had deserted the ruling front in recent polls and supported the Mamata Banerjee-led Opposition.         
	The CPM is believed to have come around after the chief ministers earlier reservations about reservation, but the party is not decided yet. Its central committee will debate the thorny issue at its session in the city in early February.        
	The allies want CPM state secretary and front chairman Biman Bose to call a front meeting to discuss the possible minority quota.        
	The Ranganath Misra Commission had recommended at least 15 per cent reservation for minorities in government jobs at central and state levels and in non-minority educational institutions. Of the 15 per cent, it had called for a 10 per cent quota for Muslims, who make up 73 per cent of Indias minority population.        
	In the wake of the Sachar Committee report, which has become a handy tool for the Opposition to slam the Left for its poor showing in minority welfare, the CPM had demanded reservation for Dalit Muslims in a charter it prepared for the advancement of (the) Muslim community.         
	The party had asked the Centre to ensure adequate share of the quota for OBCs in government jobs for OBC Muslims and adequate representation of Muslims in the recruitment for state and central security forces.         
	But the CPM had so long been divided on outright reservation for a religious community. It had always held economic determinants as supreme criteria for state protection.         
	RSP leader Manoj Bhattacharya said: Our party will stick to the old Left position  reservation should not be on the basis of religion.

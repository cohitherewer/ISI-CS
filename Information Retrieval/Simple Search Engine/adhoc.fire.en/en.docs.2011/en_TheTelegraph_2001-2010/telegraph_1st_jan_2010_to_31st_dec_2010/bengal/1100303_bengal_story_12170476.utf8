The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong erects civic seat roadblocks
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong erects civic seat roadblocks
          BARUN GHOSH                              Pranab, Adhir				                                 
	Calcutta, March 2: Two district Congress units in Bengal today spoke out against accommodating partner Trinamul, a day after Pranab Mukherjees warning that the party should not rock the alliance boat before polls to 82 municipal bodies later this year.        
	In Nadia, the district Congress leadership today said it would field nominees against those 16 party councillors of the Ranaghat municipality who had switched en bloc to the Trinamul Congress last year. District chief Shankar Singh said he would put up candidates against all 16 party deserters if Trinamul fielded them. We shall not compromise, come what may, if those 16 party deserters are given Trinamul tickets to contest the civic polls in Ranaghat, he said this afternoon.         
	In Murshidabad, where Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury is the district unit chief, a party leader said the Congress would not offer a single seat to Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee because her party was not a force to reckon with in the district and had a nexus with the CPM.         
	In Murshidabad, Trinamul has entered into an unholy nexus with the CPM to ensure the Congresss defeat in recent elections to several school and college governing bodies. So, we are not offering a single seat to Trinamul because that would indirectly help the CPM, said Asoke Das, an Adhir aide and Congress general secretary in Murshidabad.        
	The scenario may change in the coming days if senior Congress leaders intervene.         
	Yesterday, Bengal Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee reportedly told state leaders that he would personally intervene wherever the alliance encountered seat-sharing problems.        
	Mamata has already made it clear to her Nadia unit that all the 16 councillors who had deserted the Congress would be fielded as Trinamul nominees. Didi has already told us to field all 16 councillors, said district Trinamul president Ujjwal Biswas.        
	Congress general secretary K. Keshava Rao, who is in charge of Bengal, has decided to visit Bengal at the end of this month to resolve the impasse. We are worried about seat-sharing with Trinamul in both Nadia and Murshidabad districts, said state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

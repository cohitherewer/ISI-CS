          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Swamijis birth anniversary (tithi) celebrations at Belur on Wednesday. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: The Centre plans to invoke Swami Vivekanandas teachings of social and cultural harmony in an effort to encourage students to help protect monuments near their institutions.         
	Swamijis birthday  January 12  will be celebrated as Heritage Day in educational institutions to attract students to conservation, human resource development ministry sources said.         
	Last week, the University Grants Commission (UGC) issued an order to all universities and deemed universities communicating the HRD ministrys directive. The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) is likely to issue a similar order for its schools while those affiliated to central boards such as the CBSE may follow.        
	The move follows discussions within the government on expanding at the national level a project started jointly by the Archaeological Survey of India and the Madhya Pradesh government. It involves using students as a cadre of heritage conservation activists.         
	The HRD ministry is drafting an action plan using key teachings of Swamiji to encourage students to protect monuments. It has suggested to agencies like the UGC and the KVS that students may be asked to take an oath on January 12 pledging their commitment to preserving monuments.         
	The idea is that each school or college can identify a set of nearby monuments. Its students can then either start conservation efforts for these monuments, or assist ongoing efforts, a source explained.         
	The move also has a second aim  to try and build a generation of youth that stays away from defacing monuments.         
	Swamijis birthday is also celebrated as National Youth Day since 1984.

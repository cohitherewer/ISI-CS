The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Incentive carrot for Maoists
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Incentive carrot for Maoists
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, July 28: The state government today announced an incentive package to bring Maoists back into the mainstream.         
	Such a package has already been introduced in Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in keeping with the Centres guidelines. However, unlike in the two states, the rebels in Bengal have shown no inclination to surrender.        
	We will distribute posters and leaflets in Bengali and Alchiki in the Maoist belt, informing the rebels about the package, said Bhupinder Singh, the director-general of police. However, he said pending cases against the Maoists who surrendered would continue.        
	The DG said the government would deposit Rs 1.5 lakh in a bank in the name of every surrendered Maoist. The surrendered person can use the money to start a business with the government as his/her guarantor. If the person does not invest the money, he/she can get it after three years from the day of surrender provided he/she remains in the mainstream.        
	However, Singh admitted that the government did not expect any frontline Maoist leader to surrender. We expect only those eager to return to the mainstream to surrender. This process, however, does not mean that arrests will not be made. We will continue to conduct raids and arrests, he added.        
	Inspector-general of police (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha claimed some rebels had contacted the police expressing their wish to surrender.         
	Lalgarh bail        
	Three persons arrested last month for planning a meeting in Lalgarh where Section 144 is in force were granted bail today. Scientist Nisha Biswas, teacher Kanishka Chowdhury and author Manik Mondal had been accused of waging war against the state.

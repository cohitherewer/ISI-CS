The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cop saviour after road slump 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cop saviour after road slump 
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                           Traffic police constable Aniruddha Dhar. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 25: A traffic police sergeant rushed to hospital a Kargil war hero who collapsed at the busy Hazra crossing this morning after suffering a possible heart attack and even paid from his own pocket for his treatment.         
	Aniruddha Dhar and four of his colleagues who were on duty at the south Calcutta crossing rushed towards Ratan Karmakar after they saw the retired army officer slump to the ground clutching his chest around 10.35am. Dhar stopped a taxi and, with the help of his colleagues, carried Karmakar, 55, to the vehicle.         
	Dhar took Karmakar to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan near Lansdowne, 1km away. Doctors suspected Karmakar had suffered a heart attack and suggested that he undergo some tests, including an ECG and a CT scan. The retired officer had also suffered a head injury after he fell on the road.        
	Soon after, one of Dhars superiors arrived at the hospital. Together, they paid Rs 1,350 for the medical tests, but Karmakar was shifted from the hospital before the tests could be done.        
	From the call list of Karmakars cellphone, Dhar found out that the last-dialled number was that of one Rahul. When the sergeant dialled the number, it turned out that Rahul was Karmakars son. Dhar informed Rahul that his father had taken ill and asked him to come to the hospital.        
	Rahul arrived around noon and shifted Karmakar to Command Hospital in Alipore. It was very kind of the policemen to help my father, Rahul said.        
	Doctors at Command Hospital said Karmakar had suffered a brain haemorrhage following the injury to his head after he fell down. He had also suffered a cerebral attack. His condition was stated to be critical.        
	Later in the day, Dhar said he had just done my duty. The perception about the police being brash and non-cooperative is far removed from reality, he said.         
	Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan has returned the money to Dhar and his superior as Karmakar was shifted before the tests could be done.

	Calcutta, Nov. 24: Maoists helped the Trinamul Congress foil the CPMs attempt to recapture Khejuri today, intelligence branch officials believe.        
	In a report submitted to the state government last week, the intelligence branch had said the rebels had entered Khejuri and Nandigram a few days ago, anticipating a CPM attempt to recapture the area before next years Assembly polls.         
	Intelligence officials said the CPM cadres retreated today after failing to match the superior firepower of the Maoists.        
	The officials said the Maoists had struck a deal with Trinamul in Nandigram after being forced on the back foot in Lalgarh.        
	An intelligence official said: There is a heavy presence of armed CPM cadres and joint forces in Lalgarh. The Maoists want Trinamul to pressure the Centre to withdraw the joint forces from Lalgarh and organise rallies against the CPM. In return, the rebels will ensure that the CPM does not enter Khejuri and Nandigram.        
	Police sources said the rebels had asked local recruits to fight for Trinamul and ensure the CPMs defeat in these areas.         
	An officer said: Rebel leaders have given assignments to the foot soldiers. A section of them has been asked to keep round-the-clock vigil on the areas through which CPM cadres may try to enter.         
	Since there is tight police vigil on the roads, the Maoists are using the riverine route to transport arms and ammunition to Khejuri and Nandigram from Lalgarh and Orissa.        
	Another officer said the rebels suffered a leadership crisis after state committee members Telegu Dipak and Narayan Sanyal, who were building the outfits network in Nandigram, were arrested earlier this year.         
	Several Maoist leaders have come to Nandigram now because there is no one to lead the residents who had been given arms training after the police firing there in 2007, the officer said.        
	The intelligence branch report had warned the government of a bloodbath if the CPM tried to recapture Khejuri and Nandigram.         
	The Maoist foot soldiers in these two places are local villagers who have been trained and recruited by the rebels. They have more firepower than the CPM, an intelligence official said.        
	He added: The CPM cadres who tried to recapture Khejuri today did not have the backing of the joint forces that they enjoy in Lalgarh.        
	Maoists sources confirmed the rebels were camping in Nandigram.        
	A leader of the Bengal-Jharkhand-Orissa unit of the rebels said the Maoists had fought a battle in 2007 on behalf of the victims of CPM atrocities in Nandigram and Khejuri.        
	As part of our strategy, we left Nandigram after ensuring that the CPM would not be able to return there. But now, we are concentrating on Nandigram again as we have information that the CPM is trying to recapture the area, the rebel leader said.         
	He said the Maoist foot soldiers did their job successfully today. The leader hoped the CPM leaders would take a lesson from todays retreat.

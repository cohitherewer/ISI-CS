          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bapi after his arrest. (Gour Sharma)                                  
	Durgapur, Nov. 28: The son of a CPM leader has been arrested for allegedly running a gang of bike-borne jewellery snatchers in Durgapur.         
	Bapi Konar, 26, was picked up from his hideout in his home village of Dharala in Durgapurs Bud Bud today after one of the gang members, arrested yesterday, told police about him. Bapi is the son of Ashok Konar, a member of the Ausgram II krishak sabha zonal committee.         
	Four members of the gang have been arrested in the past three days.         
	On Friday, Rajesh Jha was caught by local residents when he was escaping after snatching a womans necklace in Durgapur town. Based on information provided by Jha, the police arrested two other gang members, Bijoy Sau and Nishikanta Pal, from Kota village, on the outskirts of Durgapur.         
	S.S. Sarkar, the Durgapur additional superintendent of police, said Sau told them Bapi was the leader of the 15-member gang, which had snatched ornaments from four women in the past two weeks.         
	Sarkar said Sau had told the police about the modus operandi of the gang. Two gang members would slowly approach an unsuspecting woman on a lonely street from behind. After closing in on the target, the pillion rider would snatch necklaces or other ornaments from the woman. Then the duo would speed off, Sarkar said.        
	He said that on Friday, Jha and another gang member were chased by local residents after the duo snatched a gold necklace from a woman and sped away on their motorbike. The duo fell off the bike after it skidded. The residents caught Jha while the other man escaped, Sarkar said. The mob beat up Jha and handed him over to us.        
	Jha has told the police the gang used to operate in and around Durgapur town.         
	CPM leader Konar alleged Opposition parties were trying to frame him and his son in false cases.         
	The police are in league with the Opposition parties. Together, they have plotted a scheme to malign me and my party, said Konar, a former chief of the Kota gram panchayat.

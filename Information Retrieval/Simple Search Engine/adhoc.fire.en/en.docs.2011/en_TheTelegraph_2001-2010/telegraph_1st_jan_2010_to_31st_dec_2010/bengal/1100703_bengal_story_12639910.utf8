The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | New colleges stuck in security deposit net
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      New colleges stuck in security deposit net
          MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	Calcutta, July 2: New UGC regulations that make it mandatory for colleges in rural areas to have at least a five-acre campus and deposit Rs 15 lakh for each stream have made the future of 10 proposed institutions in the state uncertain.         
	According to the earlier guidelines, a three-acre campus and Rs 5 lakh as security deposit in a nationalised bank were needed to approach the government for setting up a state-aided college.         
	But now, the promoter of a state-aided college has to ensure a five-acre campus in order to get affiliation from a university. Also, the organisers will have to make a security deposit of Rs 15 lakh in a bank for each stream they will offer. This means that if a college wants to run BA, BSc and BCom courses, they will have to arrange for Rs 45 lakh as security deposit.         
	The organisations, which have submitted proposals for setting up the 10 colleges, are finding it difficult to fulfil the new regulations, which have been framed in June.        
	Most of the organisations who have approached us want to set up colleges in rural areas, where there is a shortage of general degree colleges. But because of the new UGC regulations, the process of clearing the proposals for new colleges has been put on hold as their promoters are finding it difficult to fulfil the two clauses, said Subimal Sen, the chairman of the West Bengal State Higher Secondary Council.        
	In order to set up a state-aided college, the promoters have to set up a registered society. The society then needs to arrange for the land and the initial security deposit.         
	The higher secondary council then conducts an inspection of the site and checks the documents. If all the conditions are fulfilled, it refers the proposed college to the higher education department, which gives the final approval. The proposal is then forwarded to the university to which the college is seeking affiliation.        
	The state government provides the funds for constructing the college building and setting up infrastructure. It also releases grants from time to time for paying the salaries of the teaching and non-teaching staff.         
	But under the new regulations, the promoters of the 10 proposed colleges who had already fulfilled the earlier norms are finding it difficult to start the institutions.         
	We have adequate land as some philanthropist organisations have agreed to donate their property. But we are not certain if we will be able to arrange for the security deposit, said a spokesperson for an organisation that is planning to set up one of the colleges.        
	The state government is concerned because the UGCs new criteria have come in the form of regulations and the education department has to follow them. The UGC used to earlier issue guidelines for the affiliation of colleges. The state had the freedom to frame its own rules based on the UGC guidelines.         
	We will have to abide by the new regulations because if the rules are violated, the UGC will deny registration to the proposed colleges. We have made it clear to the organisations they will have to fulfil the new regulations, an official of the higher education department said.        
	The new UGC rules have been framed to stop the mushrooming of inferior colleges, said Ratnabali Banerjee, a UGC official.         
	The security deposit can be used by colleges during emergencies such as hiring teachers on part-time or contractual basis if there is a shortage.         
	In north Bengal, the government has been forced to put the proposals for setting up two new colleges  in North Dinajpurs Chopra and South Dinajpurs Tapan  on the back burner. The organisations wanting to set up the institutions have failed to get enough land for a five-acre campus. In keeping with the old guidelines, the promoters had arranged for three-acre plots.        
	Several other proposed colleges, including those in Purulias Jhalda, East Midnapores Contai, Bankuras Raipur and Birbhums Mayureswar, are stuck because they have failed to fulfil the two norms.         
	Some of these colleges are running from pillar to post to arrange for the security deposit, a higher education council official said.

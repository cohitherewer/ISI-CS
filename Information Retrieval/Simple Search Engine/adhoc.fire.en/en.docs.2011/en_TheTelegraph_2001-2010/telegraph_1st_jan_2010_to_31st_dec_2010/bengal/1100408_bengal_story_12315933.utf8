The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | PC-Bimal meet on Friday
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      PC-Bimal meet on Friday
          VIVEK CHHETRI                           Bimal Gurung                                  
	Darjeeling, April 7: A Gorkha Janmukti Morcha delegation led by Bimal Gurung will meet Union home minister P. Chidambaram in New Delhi on Friday.         
	Although the ministry and the Morcha have confirmed that the talks will be held on April 9, Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said today he had no knowledge of Gurungs meeting with Chidambaram.         
	The first direct talks between the Morcha president and the home minister will take place at a time nobody is willing to concede an inch of territory that is to come under the interim set-up proposed for the Darjeeling hills.         
	While the Morcha wants the entire Darjeeling district and parts of the Dooars, the Centre has been insisting that the interim arrangement be confined to the hills.        
	Confirming the meeting, a Morcha source said four to five senior leaders would accompany Gurung.         
	The meeting is likely to focus on the territory the Morcha wants included in the interim set-up. The Morcha has demanded that areas where Nepali-speaking people are in majority in the Dooars and Siliguri, in Darjeeling district, be included.         
	The party has, in a proposal sent to the Centre in March, already made a climbdown by leaving out areas where the Gorkha community is in a minority in the plains. The party will not make any further concession as far as territory is concerned, a party leader said.         
	A senior official said the central and state governments had no intention of giving Gurung control of the Dooars and Siliguri. As the elections to the Bengal Assembly are just one year away, both the Centre and the state are in no mood to incorporate the Dooars and Siliguri in the new set-up, the official said.         
	The issue of territorial jurisdiction may become a stumbling block while arriving at a settlement on the new arrangement, given the stand of the governments and the hill party. There are compulsions for the governments and the Morcha. None will budge, an observer said. Gurung had skipped all five tripartite meetings in the past.        
	Sources said the meeting between Chidambaram and the Morcha chief had been in the pipeline since the fifth round of talks on March 18. Everyone is aware that the issue cannot be sorted out without direct dialogue between the Centre and Gurung, the official said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                           Empty jewellery boxes strewn on a bed at the Ghoshes Salt Lake home, which was burgled on Friday night. (Aranya Sen)                                   
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: Burglars broke into two empty houses, one in Salt Lake and the other in Belghoria, and escaped with jewellery and cash while the unsuspecting families were busy pandal-hopping.        
	While gold ornaments worth Rs 3 lakh were stolen from the Ghoshes FD Block house in Salt Lake last night, thieves took away jewellery, Rs 12,000 in cash, a laptop, credit cards and other valuables from the Choudhury home in Belghorias Ariadaha today.        
	Ranjit Ghosh, 63, a former state electricity board engineer, had left his home around 8pm on Ashtami with wife Kabita, 54, and younger son Arunava, 27.        
	When the trio returned to their one-storey house around 10pm, they found the bathroom and living room lights on.        
	We remembered having switched the lights off before leaving. When I entered one of our bedrooms, I was shocked to see the almirah open, Kabita said. Ranjit said 16 bhori gold ornaments had been stolen.         
	The Ghoshes said a portion of the glass pane of the adjacent rooms door was broken and a pebble lay in front of it. A relative of the Ghoshes said the burglars may have thrown the pebble to check if anybody was home.        
	Kabita said the thieves had probably climbed onto the roof and opened the staircase door to make their entry.        
	They somehow loosened the latch of the door. Then they broke the locks on the collapsible gate. They also broke the latch of the wooden door that leads into the house from the stairs, she said.        
	The burglars broke open the bedroom almirah that contained the jewellery.         
	Ranjit had brought the ornaments home from his bank locker a week ago so that Kabita could wear them during Puja.        
	Two gold necklaces, a few bangles and two pairs of earrings have been stolen. Most of these were wedding gifts from my father, Ranjit said.        
	He said several imitation necklaces and bangles lay strewn on the bed in the living room.        
	Most of the imitation ornaments were twisted out of shape. The burglars probably dumped all the jewellery on the bed and beat them with a hammer to pick out the gold ornaments, Ranjit said.        
	We have been living here for 26 years but nothing like this has ever happened before, Kabita said.        
	An officer of Bidhannagar South police station said the burglars had not taken anything apart from the jewellery. A new laptop and the LCD television set had been left untouched.         
	Prasun Choudhury, the Belghoria resident whose home was burgled on Navami, said he had left home at 10am with his parents, wife and son to visit pandals.        
	Choudhury, a journalist working with an English daily, said the thieves had left with gold necklaces and bangles, credit cards, a laptop and a few expensive pens.        
	When we returned at 5pm, we saw the almirah in my bedroom overturned. The almirah had been ransacked and clothes and other stuff lay scattered around the room. The burglars had also ransacked my study, Choudhury said.        
	He said the thieves had made their way in by breaking the grille gate and a door at the back of the house.

	Calcutta, Sept. 11: A non-driver who had slipped behind the wheel of his friends stationary car to turn on the air-conditioner ended up knocking down and injuring five people on the SSKM Hospital compound today.        
	Hospital visitor Wasim Akhtar, 22, told police after his arrest that he had switched on the ignition to be able to start the AC and had then stepped on the accelerator by mistake. A police source said Akhtar had admitted to not knowing how to drive.        
	One of those injured, however, claimed that the young man was trying his hand at driving and came speeding towards us.  
	Akhtar, a call centre employee, had come to the hospital around noon to visit a relative of a friend. Feeling suffocated after a while, he had stepped out and sat in friend Tanveer Ahmeds blue Chevrolet Beat, parked outside the cardiology outpatient department (OPD).        
	Soon, the car started moving and ploughed into a group of people sipping tea outside the OPD.        
	We were having tea. Suddenly, I realised something was speeding towards us. Before I could turn around, the car knocked me down, said Amit Chakraborty, who sustained head injuries.         
	Chakraborty, in his thirties, had come to see a friends father who is in the hospital. He was accompanied by nine of his friends, four of whom were injured, one seriously.         
	One of the four, Munna Chowdhury, got trapped under the car and was dragged to the wall of the OPD. The car then rammed into the wall of the OPD, Chakraborty said.         
	Chowdhury, in his thirties, was left with a fractured waist and injured hands and legs. Doctors said his condition was critical.        
	We rushed Munna to the emergency ward. The doctors initially said his injuries were not serious, Chakraborty said.         
	Apart from Amit and Munna, the of us sustained minor injuries, said Krishna Majumder. The friends had come to see Majumders father in the hospital.         
	Amjad Ali, one of Akhtars neighbours who came to Bhowanipore police station where the youth was taken, said Akhtar had accidentally stepped on the accelerator as he knew nothing about driving.         
	However, Chakraborty claimed: He was trying to drive.        
	Akhtar has been booked for rash and negligent driving. He has been charged under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 338 (causing grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code, said an officer.         
	Hospital superintendent Pravash Chowdhury, however, told The Telegraph he was unaware of the accident.

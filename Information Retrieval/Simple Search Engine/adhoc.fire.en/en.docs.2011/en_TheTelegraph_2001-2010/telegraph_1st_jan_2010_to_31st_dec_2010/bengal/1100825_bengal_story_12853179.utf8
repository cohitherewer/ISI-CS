                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Market   heist near police station
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Durgapur, Aug. 24: A gang of 30 cleaned out shops of cash, ornaments and electronic goods in Panagarh market in a two-hour raid not far from the local police station.        
	Traders, who discovered the heist when they came to open their shops this morning, estimated their losses at Rs 5 lakh.         
	The gang struck between 12am and 2am today, police said based on the accounts of pavement dwellers who claimed to have seen the men arrive in three pick-up vans with crowbars and pickaxes but did not raise the alarm fearing they would be attacked. Twelve shops were burgled.        
	The traders gheraoed the police team that arrived later this morning and blocked the nearby NH2 for over an hour, accusing the force of not patrolling the market.        
	The police are busy taking bribes from truck drivers on the highway. Thefts have become a regular feature and we are feeling insecure, said Barid Baran Chatterjee, president of the Panagarh Bazaar Chamber of Commerce.        
	Chatterjee alleged that plainclothesmen deployed to keep a watch on the market, 30km from Durgapur town, were withdrawn recently. The plainclothesmen had been sent after several thefts earlier. The decision was taken after meetings with us but they have been withdrawn after the present officer-in-charge, Saikat Roy, took charge.        
	Joy Prakash Sahu, whose jewellery shop was burgled, blamed the rising crimes in the area on the withdrawal of the plainclothesmen. A couple of weeks ago, me and my brother were attacked when we were returning home after closing the shop. The snatchers tried to take our money. I cant understand what the police were doing (last night) when the gang was looting the shops only 300 metres from the police station.         
	The traders observed a bandh today and demanded that the culprits be caught within 48 hours.         
	Another officer, who had spoken to some of the pavement dwellers, said: Some of them (in the gang) also carried revolvers.         
	Durgapur additional superintendent of police S.S. Sarkar said the gang might have come from Jharkhand but may have had some local contacts.

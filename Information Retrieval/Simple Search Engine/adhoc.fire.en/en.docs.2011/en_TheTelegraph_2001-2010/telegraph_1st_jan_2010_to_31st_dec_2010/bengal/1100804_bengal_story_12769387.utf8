	Krishnagar, Aug. 3: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said students would lag behind without the knowledge of English, his renewed thrust on the language coming almost three decades after his party-led government abolished it at the primary level.        
	English is an international language. If someone does not know the language, he will have to lag behind, the chief minister said while laying the foundation stone of the states first English medium madrasah here.        
	Bhattacharjee, who was on a tour of Nadia, said English was necessary in all fields, from getting jobs to running businesses and urged the madrasah students to study science, mathematics and English apart from the regular religious studies.        
	He also held up the language as a bridge within the multi-lingual country. English is such a language that it is useful even in a country like India. In our country, we have many regional languages like Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. But if you know English you will be able travel everywhere.         
	The chief minister has dwelt on the theme several times before, even at madrasah gatherings.        
	The CPM-led Left Front had abolished English at the primary level in the early 1980s.         
	But following pressure from large sections of the public as well as from within a section of the CPM and Left Front partners to review the move, the Pabitra Sarkar Committee was set up in 1997.         
	The panel submitted its report in 1998 following which English was introduced from Class III the same year and from Class-I six years later.        
	Bhattacharjee later laid the foundation for a Rabindra Bhavan at Ranaghat in Nadia and announced that the government would renovate Rabindranath Tagores residence at Jorasanko in north Calcutta.         
	 The government will also set up a Rabindra Prangan at New Town in Rajarhat where exhibitions highlighting various aspects in Tagores life will be held.         
	Later in the afternoon, the chief minister inaugurated a new administrative building in Tehatta and urged government officers to listen to the problems of the poor people and try to redress their problems.        
	Dont ignore the poor people. Listen to their problems. Try to address them.

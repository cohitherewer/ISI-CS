The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong revs up for Rahul city rally
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong revs up for Rahul city rally
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      A Congress supporter wears a Rahul Gandhi mask near Victoria Memorial on Sunday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                          
	Calcutta, Sept. 5: Rahul Gandhi will address a rally tomorrow in Calcutta to launch the Youth Congresss membership drive and meet Bengal Congress leaders in a whistle-stop visit likely to last just over three hours.        
	Rahul is expected to start his address at the rally on the Shahid Minar grounds around 1.30pm. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, already in the city, is also slated to attend.        
	After that, Rahul is scheduled to meet executive committee members of the Congresss state unit at Bidhan Bhavan. All MPs, MLAs and chiefs of party-run civic bodies have been invited. From there, he will leave for the airport on his way back to Delhi.        
	K. Keshava Rao, AICC general secretary who oversees the Bengal affairs, arrived here tonight. Rao along with state party chief Manas Bhuniya and others will receive Rahul at the airport around 12.30pm.         
	Rahulji so far has no other programmes lined up tomorrow. But there may be slight changes, subject to his approval. Let us first discuss it with him on his arrival, Rao said tonight.        
	Asked if Rahul planned to call on Trinamul Congress chief and railway minister Mamata Banerjee at her Kalighat home, Rao said he had no knowledge about it.         
	Bhuniya promised a rousing welcome for Rahul. Our supporters carrying party flags will line the road from Dum Dum to Shahid Minar. Rahuljis visit will help us revive the organisation, the state party chief said.        
	Rahuls visit comes at a time the Congress has been trying to come out of ally Trinamuls shadow ahead of the state polls in summer next year.        
	Today, the Congress got a shot in the arm when Mamatas one-time strongman in West Midnapores Keshpur, Mohammed Rafique, rejoined the party. Rafique had left us in 1998. He returned as he was being slighted there, said Bhuniya, without naming Trinamul.        
	But Rafique slammed Mamata. I had done a lot for Mamatadi. We drove out the CPM from Keshpur and Garbeta in the late 1990s.         
	But these days, we were being slighted. I came to know that three days ago, she told a core committee meeting that I was no more a member.

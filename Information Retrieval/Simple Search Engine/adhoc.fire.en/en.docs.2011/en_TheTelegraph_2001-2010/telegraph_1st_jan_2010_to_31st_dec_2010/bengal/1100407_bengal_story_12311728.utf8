	Calcutta, April 6: Some 800 policemen posted in six camps along Bengals border with Jharkhand may become sitting ducks in case of a major attack by Maoist guerrillas, senior state police officers admitted today.        
	The massacre of jawans in Chhattisgarh today sent alarm bells ringing about the lack of infrastructure in the border posts and the administrations failure to take lessons from the February attack on the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in West Midnapores Shilda.        
	The camps  at Belpahari, Chhurimara, Jamtolgora and Neguria in West Midnapore and Dulukdihi and Bogdubi in Purulia  lack basic infrastructure like bunkers and watchtowers. Besides, none of the policemen there have night-vision telescopes fitted to their rifles, something so essential to fight in the dark.        
	These camps also have a logistical disadvantage in that they are located so close to Jharkhand  all within 1km to 7km  in a hilly terrain dense with forests.         
	The officers said that a big guerrilla group, double or triple the number posted at any of these camps, can easily descend from Jharkhand and give the police a beating.                
	There are about 100 to 120 police personnel, drawn from both the central and state forces, posted in each of these camps, inspector-general (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha said. If the Maoists emerge from the forests and surround the camps, the police will be in a very disadvantaged position and the situation can be a cause of great worry. The chances of reinforcements arriving on time is remote as the Maoists would have planted improvised explosive devices on roads leading to the camps that they target.        
	After the Chhattisgarh strike, the Bengal police apparently went into a huddle and decided that the chinks in the armour, especially in these six camps, would have to be repaired at the earliest.        
	Unless the security infrastructure is improved in these camps, we will be endangering the lives of the policemen posted there, said an officer. It is obvious that the Maoists are stepping up their attacks and we must be prepared for all eventualities.        
	After the Shilda attack, some 10 camps that the police felt were not secure were dismantled and merged with others. But nothing was done about the border camps and nor was it possible to withdraw them, given their strategic position.        
	Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh, too, expressed his apprehension today after the attack in Chhattisgarh. Anything may happen and one cannot rule that out, he said at Writers Buildings. They may try (to do a repeat of Chhattisgarh). Policemen have been asked to be ready for self-defence and to retaliate. No one can say such an incident will not occur here.         
	An alert has been issued to Maoist-hit districts, mentioning the possibility of an attack, especially on the six vulnerable camps.        
	If about a thousand Maoists attack a camp, as in Chhattisgarh, those posted in any of the camps across the state will be helpless, an officer said.         
	However, those along the border are the real source of worry.         
	The other camps are at a distance from the border and the Maoists will find it impossible to reach without being intercepted, the officer said. For instance, he added, Lal- garh is at least 20km from Jharkhand and that gives it the security of distance.         
	Chief secretary Asok Mo-han Chakrabarti said: We keep telling the police to be on high alert at all times and be wary of traps set by the Maoists. The risk will always be there.        
	He added that some security measures had been taken following the directions of Union home minister P. Chidambaram, who was in Lalgarh on Sunday.

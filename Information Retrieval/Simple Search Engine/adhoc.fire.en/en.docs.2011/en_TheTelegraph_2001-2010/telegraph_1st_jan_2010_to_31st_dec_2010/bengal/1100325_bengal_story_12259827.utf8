The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cry to scrap 30% norm
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cry to scrap 30% norm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, March 24: Christian missionaries running nearly 700 schools in Bengal today demanded that Indias apex minority education watchdog immediately withdraw its stipulation that at least 30 per cent of students in all minority institutions should be from that community.        
	The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) order has fuelled resentment among the missionaries who feel that if it is implemented, the schools they run will not be able to fill the 30 per cent quota and thus lose their minority status.         
	They also face the possibility of getting converted into general-category institutions, raising the fear among the Christian missionaries that the state government will impose its education policies on them.        
	Even if we do not depend on financial assistance from the government, we will not be able to enjoy the freedom to follow our own education policies and ideologies if our schools are declared general- category institutions, said Lucas Sircar, the archbishop of the Calcutta diocese of the Roman Catholic Church.        
	We will not accept the order, the archbishop said.        
	Missionary schools which avail of government assistance in the form of dearness allowances for teachers or grants-in-aid for paying teachers salaries will be the worst affected by the NCMEI order.        
	The missionaries fear that once the institutions they run lose their minority status, the government-aided missionary schools may be asked to recruit teachers through the state School Service Commission. The government may also take away their right to appoint their own principals, they fear.        
	As of now, unaided as well as state-aided minority schools enjoy the freedom to appoint their own teachers and principals, select their students and follow their own admission and education policies.         
	Minority-run schools stand to lose the minority label if they do not admit 30 per cent students from the Christian community every year, church sources said.        
	In Bengal, most of the Christian missionary schools do not have more than 15 per cent students from the community.        
	The NCMEI order needs to be scrapped because even in the Christian-majority areas, the schools may not get 30 per cent students from the community every year, said Father Faustine Branc of the Roman Catholic church.         
	The Christian missionaries, as well as other minority institutions run by Buddhists, Sikhs and Muslims, have decided to organise rallies, demanding that the NCMEI order be withdrawn.         
	The heads of the founder bodies of churches running the 700 Christian missionary schools in the state have held meetings to discuss the matter.        
	On April 5, delegation comprising representatives of all minority schools will meet NCMEI authorities in Delhi and submit a memorandum.        
	In Bengal, Christians comprise only 1 per cent of the total population. How are we going to fulfil the new criteria set by the NCMEI? This is an infringement on the rights granted to minorities in the Constitution, said Herod Mullick, secretary of the West Bengal Association of Minority Schools.

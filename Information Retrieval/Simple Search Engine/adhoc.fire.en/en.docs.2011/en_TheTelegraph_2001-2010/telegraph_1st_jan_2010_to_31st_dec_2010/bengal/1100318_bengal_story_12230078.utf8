                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Unlettered farmer donates plot for school
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE AND INDRANIL SARKAR                           Shibram De                                  
	Ketugram (Burdwan), March 17: An illiterate farmer in Burdwan whose children are school dropouts has donated 14 cottahs to the state government to build a girls school.        
	Shibram De, an 80-year-old farmer in Ketugram, came to know that there was no land to construct a girls school from Tarun Sadhu, the headmaster of Sir Ashutosh Memorial Institution, the co-educational school in the village.         
	De owns four acres in Ketugram, apart from the 14 cottahs where he grew vegetables.        
	Sadhu, along with a former teacher of the school, Madhusudan Sengupta, approached him for land two months ago. Sengupta stays near Des two- storeyed thatched house and is his friend. I am a year younger than Shibram but we are friends. As soon as I approached him for the land and told him that a girls school will be set up there, he agreed without thinking twice, Sengupta said.         
	Sengupta said he and headmaster Sadhu had approached several villagers asking for land but no one agreed to donate a plot. Some of them asked for jobs in the school for family members and some demanded the school be named after them. But these conditions we could not accept, he said.         
	The nearest girls school from Ketugram is 18km away.        
	The government does not have a policy to buy land to build schools in rural areas. A school can be built on vested land or on plots donated by villagers.        
	When the district inspector of schools (secondary) had almost given up hope, De, offered to donate 14 cottahs.         
	After agreeing to donate the land, Shibram spoke to his three sons, who farm the four acres, and told them about his decision.         
	The Des earn around Rs 10,000 a month by cultivating the land. Shibrams sons agreed with their father.         
	My wife and I never went to school and all my sons are school dropouts as I could not afford their education. So, I didnt hesitate when Madhusudan and the school headmaster approached me for land. My sons agreed, Shibram said.         
	His youngest son Nemai, a Class IX dropout, said: Initially we hesitated but agreed because the land will be given for a noble cause. We feel proud of our father.         
	The block inspector of schools (secondary) Nazmul Hoda said that the land had been donated and the registration has been completed.        
	We have sent the proposal to start construction of the school building and allocation of the required funds to the DI (secondary), he said.         
	The villagers of Ketugram said they were proud of De.        
	Shibrambabu has become a hero for us. The block inspector schools approached us for land but we did not have the heart to part with our plots. Shibram babu never thought twice before donating his land, said Netai Mondal, a villager.

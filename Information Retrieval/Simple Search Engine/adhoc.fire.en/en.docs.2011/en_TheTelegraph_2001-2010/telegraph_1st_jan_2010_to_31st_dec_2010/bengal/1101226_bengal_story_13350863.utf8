          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 25: A woman whose baby daughter is admitted to SSKM Hospital today alleged that a junior doctor tried to molest her after sending her husband to get medicines.        
	The woman, a resident of Sandeskhali, North 24-Parganas, alleged that the doctor called her and her husband to a room around 2pm to discuss the condition of her one-and-a-half-year-old daughter, who was admitted on December 6 with a leg injury.         
	She said the doctor prescribed some medicines and asked her husband to get them. When her husband left, the doctor closed the door and allegedly tried to molest her, the woman claimed.         
	She said the doctor fled through a back door when her husband and several hospital staff arrived after being alerted by her cries for help.         
	The woman later lodged a complaint with hospital authorities, who forwarded it to Bhowanipore police. The police have registered an FIR. The doctor is absconding.        
	Hospital officials said an internal inquiry would be conducted.

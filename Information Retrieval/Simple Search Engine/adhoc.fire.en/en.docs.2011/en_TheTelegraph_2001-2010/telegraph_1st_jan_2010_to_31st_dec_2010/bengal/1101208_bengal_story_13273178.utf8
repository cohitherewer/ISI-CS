          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      The wife of the slain CPM supporter. (Kaushik Pramanik)                          
	Behrampore, Dec. 7: A CPM activist who refused to pay up for staying in a Congress-dominated Murshidabad pocket was shot dead this morning, triggering a retaliatory attack that left his killer dead hours later.        
	The violence in Tarbagan village of the Domkol area is part of a larger cycle of CPM-Congress clashes that has claimed five lives, including todays deaths, in the past four months.         
	Abul Hussain, the assailant who triggered this mornings chain of attacks, is a local thug with alleged Congress links and is blamed for many of the previous incidents of violence.        
	Asok Das, secretary of the Congresss Murshidabad unit, claimed todays bloodshed was the fallout of a dispute over non-payment of wages under the rural job scheme NREGA to Congress supporters by the Tarbagan panchayat. The body is one the few run by the CPM in the area. The Congress has called a 12-hour bandh in Domkal tomorrow.         
	At Writers Building in Calcutta this evening, state panchayat minister Anisur Rahaman, who is the CPM MLA from Domkol, denied that the attacks were related to the NREGA wage payments.        
	Panchayats in Domkol, around 245km from Calcutta, had been under the control of the Left till the 2008 rural elections, after which the party started losing ground. Now, the Congress controls 11 of the 13 rural bodies in the area.        
	Hussain and his gang had been demanding Rs 1 lakh from each of the CPM workers for letting them return to the villages from where they had fled in the face of the Congresss threats. This morning, Hussain demanded a similar sum from CPM worker Manik Mondal, 51, who had returned home to Tarbagan only last night.        
	Mondal refused, after which Hussain pulled out his revolver and shot him dead. His wife, son and daughter-in-law fled the house and raised the alarm.         
	Other villagers chased Hussain and attacked him with scythes and choppers. Hussain succumbed to his injuries in hospital this evening.        
	CPM district secretariat member Narayan Das alleged that police had done nothing to check the continuing violence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Coffins roll in and cries for Gorkhaland go up
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Coffins roll in and cries for Gorkhaland go up
          OUR BUREAU                          The Last Post for the slain policemen at the EFR headquarters at Salua, about 75km from Shilda. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Feb. 17: As the coffins carrying the 13 slain EFR personnel hailing from the hills reached the police lines near Siliguri tonight, cries of Jai Gorkha and Jai Gorkhaland rent the air.        
	Over 500 people from the hills who had been waiting to be part of the cortege demanded a gun salute for the policemen around 10.30pm, though the honour had been bestowed on the policemen at force headquarters Salua yesterday itself.         
	Police officers tried to reason that a gun salute could not be given after sunset. The people refused to listen and surrounded Darjeeling superintendent of police D.P. Singh.         
	The police persuasion bore fruit finally and a long line of 11 vans finally left for the Darjeeling hills with the bodies around 11.15pm.         
	North Bengal inspector-gen-eral K.L. Tamta, who escorted the bodies, played down the demonstrations, saying it was natural for the crowd to be emotionally charged.         
	However, the death of 19 policemen from the hill communities in the Maoist raid has given the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha a chance to stoke the statehood fire, though its leaders had shared dais and shaken hands with those of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities not long ago.         
	The Gorkhas lay down their lives whenever Bengal is in trouble, but their plea for statehood remains unheard by the state government, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said while waiting for the bodies in Siliguri. He was in Lalgarh last year, voicing support for the Maoist-backed agitation against the state and its police force.        
	Giri said the Morcha had called a strike on Friday in the area it wanted as Gorkhaland and there would be condolence meetings for the policemen across the Darjeeling hills, Terai and the Dooars.         
	Since early morning, hordes of Morcha supporters were seen leaving for Siliguri to receive the 13 martyrs from the hills. Six of the 19  though from the hill communities  were not hill residents.         
	The Morcha has faxed a letter to the chief minister and the Union home minister demanding an inquiry into the Maoist attack. We want a full inquiry. Why were only jawans who had crossed the age of 40 posted in such a vulnerable area? The state government never provided them with adequate training and posted them in such an area without equipping them properly, Morcha spokesperson Harka Bahadur Chhetri said.        
	One of the cops killed on Monday was 59 years old. Suresh Rai was from Mirik.         
	We are not concerned about (monetary) compensations. The families of the deceased have already started talking about Gorkhaland as the only compensation, Harka Bahadur added.         
	Not to be left behind, another hill outfit, the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League, demanded the chief ministers resignation and imposition of Presidents rule in the state.

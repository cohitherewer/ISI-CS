	June 16: The Calcutta scientist and 12 others arrested near Lalgarh yesterday have been charged with waging war against the state.        
	The lawyer for Nisha Biswas, 56, a senior scientist of the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institutes glass division, said she had been conducting a survey along with Behala High School teacher Kanishka Chowdhury, 50, and small-time author Manik Mondal.         
	The Midnapore court sent them to 14 days jail custody.        
	Along with the trio from Calcutta, the police had arrested from Mathurapur 10 members of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. All 13 have been charged with waging war, criminal conspiracy and unlawful assembly.        
	When Nisha was produced in court, her husband Sampad, 56, also a scientist in her institute, was in the room.         
	They have a son who lives in Mumbai. He is called Sonu at home, said a neighbour of the Biswases at Patuli, on the southern fringes of Calcutta.        
	Nisha had done her MSc from Agra University, said a colleague who described her as a bit aloof.         
	An officer of the institute said she was erratic in her attendance. She has not been coming to work since Monday without informing the office.        
	According to the police, Nisha was in Lalgarh since Saturday. They had even attended a kangaroo court where villagers were beaten up for violating the PCPAs diktats, an officer had said yesterday.        
	Nishas former colleague Ashish Nandi, her neighbour now, said: She was a sprightly young woman of Punjabi descent  her maiden name was Sood  when she joined the institute as a 24-year-old in 1978. There she was to meet her future husband.         
	Nandi had attended their wedding in May 1981. Nisha was by far the smartest of all the women here. She used to drive her own car. She quietened down a fair bit in office after a spat with a senior, said Nandi, who retired a couple of years ago.         
	I never suspected she had Maoist links, he added.        
	In court, lawyer Mrinal Chowdhury said: The police fo-und only a digital camera, a tape recorder, pens and writing pads and Rs 4,500 on them. So, how dangerous can my clients be?         
	If proved guilty, she could be jailed for life.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Vivekananda to counter koel
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Sept. 20: State Congress president Manas Bhuniya today came up with an answer to the cuckoo jab: Swami Vivekananda.        
	Rahul Gandhi did not come to Bengal as a tourist. He also didnt come to chirp kuhu kuhu. He came here to rejuvenate the Youth Congress, Bhuniya said at an event in Burdwan.         
	Rahulji has said dont underestimate yourself. He has asked the youths to arise and awake. He wants to build a new Bengal with the help of the youths. If one studies history, he will find that Rahulji did not say anything new. He only echoed Swami Vivekananda, Bhuniya added.        
	Vivekananda had once said during a lecture: Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached.        
	Bhuniya had a message for those making disrespectful comments: Dont forget Bengals culture and heritage.        
	Mamata Banerjee has twice referred to the proverbial koel in apparent allusions to Rahul. At a rally in Nanoor yesterday, she had said: There are people who come like a koel before an election and disappear after chirping kuhu kuhu once the spring is over.        
	Responding to Mamatas reference to family members in politics, Bhuniya said: Some people are pointing at dynasty rule. Have they forgotten about the self-sacrifice of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira and Rajiv Gandhi? Rahul is not an example of dynasty politics but a symbol of self-sacrifice.

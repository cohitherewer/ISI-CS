          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 28: The wives of intelligence branch inspector Partha Biswas and his friend Saumajit Basu, who were abducted by suspected Maoists in Purulia, today appealed to the captors to release their husbands and requested the administration to ensure their safe return.        
	I do not know who has abducted my husband. But I want to urge his captors to release him. I want to tell them my husband is a social worker. Please release him, keeping in mind the good things he has done as a social worker, Barnali said at a news conference in Purulia.        
	Barnali said she had last spoken to Biswas on October 22 (the day the two were kidnapped) around 2.30pm. He inquired about us and told me he was fine. I request the police superintendent and the district administration to ensure that he returns home safely, Barnali said.         
	She met Rajesh Yadav, the superintendent of police, after the news conference.        
	Saumajits wife Sankhatua met the director-general of police, Naparajit Mukherjee, and the additional director-general (law and order), Surajit Kar Purakayastha, at Writers Buildings and requested them to ensure her husbands return. The government is yet to give any positive information on my husband, Sankhatua said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rage after lock-out
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rage after lock-out
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sankrail, March 31: Nearly 1,500 workers of a jute mill in Howrahs Sankrail stormed the factory and set fire to three union offices, a godown and officers quarters after the management suspended work this morning.        
	The trouble began around 6am when the workers reported at Delta Jute Mill to find the gates closed and a suspension-of-work notice pasted on the entrance. The workers accused a section of the union leaders of conniving with the mill authorities to suspend work.         
	Discontent was brewing among the workers after the management and the unions recently signed an agreement deducting their daily wages.        
	The workers also set fire to a shed where jute is dyed and a guest house on the mill campus. Rapid-action force personnel later cane-charged the workers and dispersed them.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Everyone steals, says minister
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 13: Panchayat minister Anisur Rahman today admitted corruption in rural bodies but immediately added that everybody steals, not just the CPM.        
	The panchayats are not the property of the Left Front. All parties, including the Left Front, Trinamul and the Congress, are involved in running them and all of them are involved in corruption. Amra keu shadhu na, shobai churi korey (None of us is a saint. Everybody steals), Rahman told the Assembly.        
	He was replying to the CPMs Dilip Sarkar who wanted to know if a commission would be set up for the appointment of panchayat employees, a process alleged ly riddled with irregularities.        
	Later, speaking in the Assembly lobby, Rahman almost appeared to defend graft by saying it was inevitable.         
	There is corruption from the Prime Ministers Office to the panchayat pradhan. There is so much money involved because of schemes, as a result of which there is corruption.         
	Rahman admitted there was scope for corruption in panchayat recruitment.        
	He also said the Left government had not been able to live up to its potential, echoing some in his party.         
	We have not been able to do all that was possible. For our mistakes, there is some resentment in the minds of people, Rahman said in the House.

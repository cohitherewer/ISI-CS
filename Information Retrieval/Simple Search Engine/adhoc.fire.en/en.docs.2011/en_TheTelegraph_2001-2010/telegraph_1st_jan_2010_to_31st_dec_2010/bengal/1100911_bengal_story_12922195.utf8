                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Pit turns grave for illegal miners, guard
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Gangs extract coal from an illegal mine in Raniganj. File picture.                                   
	Durgapur, Sept. 10: At least two coal thieves and a security guard trying to stop the theft were killed today in Asansol when an abandoned mine caved in.        
	Residents of Deshermahan village in Jamuria said around 20 men armed with shovels and pickaxes had arrived at the mine, once used by private firm Bengal EMTA, at 3am. They dug a number of pits and climbed down to extract coal.        
	Security guard Shindu Roy Chowdhury rushed in when he got wind of the theft around 7am. He was standing on the edge of one of the pits and trying to dissuade the thieves from extracting coal when it suddenly caved in. Most of the thieves managed to clamber out but two of them and Shindu got burried under the rubble, said Anwar Hossain, 35, an eyewitness.        
	Before police arrived, local coal smugglers whisked away the bodies of the duo and cremated them in order to cover up the incident.         
	The police came around 9am and took away the body of Shindu, 28.         
	Most of the thieves were residents of neighbouring Deshermohan and Joynagar villages. One of the dead coal thieves was identified by villagers and family members as Sudan Badyakar, 45, a resident of Joynagar.         
	Sudans wife Rebati, 35, alleged that the coal smugglers cremated her husband secretly and did not even inform her.         
	My husband used to earn between Rs 150 and Rs 200 a day by stealing coal from illegal pits in the area. Today, he went to work as usual around 3am. In the morning, some of our neighbours, who had accompanied him to the mine, told me about his death, Rebati said.        
	I could not even see his body. The coal smugglers cremated him immediately after his death. I used to tell my husband not to get involved in illegal mining but he refused to listen as the money was good. What will happen to my four children now?        
	Debashis Dhar, the deputy superintendent of police, Asansol, said: We have heard about the death of two illegal miners. We are investigating the matter.         
	B.N. Dutta, the managing director of Bengal EMTA, blamed the rampant illegal mining in the area for the tragedy. The subsidence happened at a place outside our mining area. We have nothing to do with the incident, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Kid hospital upgrade push
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Kid hospital upgrade push
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: The Bengal cabinet has approved a proposal to upgrade the states only referral hospital for children into a research institute, three years after the chief minister announced the plan.         
	The BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children and BC Roy Memorial Polio Clinic will now be merged into a research institute with several superspeciality departments, a senior health department official said today. It will be called the BC Roy Postgraduate Institute of Paediatric Sciences.         
	The BC Roy Hospital at Phoolbagan has often been in the news over the past few years for a high rate of deaths. The Medical Council of India recently barred it from conducting a postgraduate diploma course that the hospital had conducted without approval for 32 years.         
	In April 2007, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had announced that the two hospitals would be merged and upgraded into an institute. Swastha Bhavan sources said the health department had not taken any initiative to implement the plan till July this year.         
	It was only after the hospital authorities wrote to the health department that things started moving, a Swastha Bhavan official said.        
	We had requested the health department to take steps to get the necessary clearances so we could go ahead with the plan for setting up the institute. With the cabinet giving its approval, we are expecting the process to be completed soon, said M.K. Chatterjee, the principal of the hospital.        
	It will become the biggest state-run paediatric institute in the country, he said.        
	Paediatric medicine, cardiology, neurology, gastroenterology and other superspeciality departments will be set up, Chatterjee added.         
	Health department officials said the upgrade would help the hospital recover from a severe shortage of doctors.         
	The hospital has around 360 beds but the number of patients often crosses 500 with three children sometimes sharing a bed. It now has only 11 senior doctors and 37 junior doctors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rebel whiff in death
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rebel whiff in death
                            
	Midnapore, Oct. 15: The charred body of a woman whose husband and son were allegedly killed by Maoists last month was cremated by the residents of a village near Jhargram without informing police, prompting local CPM leaders to allege she was murdered by the rebels.         
	The police said their sources had informed them that Jayanti Mantri, 42, a resident of Baghjhapa, was cremated by the villagers on Wednesday. Jayantis body had been lying inside her home for five days. When the stench became unbearable, the villagers took the permission of Peoples Committee leaders and cremated the body, a police officer said.        
	Local CPM leaders alleged Jayanti was molested and burnt to death by the rebels after she abused Peoples Committee leaders and threatened to reveal everything.

	Burdwan, Aug. 10: A Class X student was punched and kicked in the head and abdomen by a group of boys yesterday after he protested against lewd comments they were passing at a classmate.        
	Bishu Adhikary, 16, a student of Kanchannagar Dinanath Das High School in Burdwan town, had to be admitted to hospital where doctors kept him under observation before releasing him this morning.        
	The boy was punched and kicked in the head, abdomen, chest and back, said a doctor who treated Bishu at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.         
	The boys who assaulted him were detained before being let off with a warning.        
	Police said the four boys had on Sunday teased the Class X girl while she was walking to a friends house. The girl protested and the boys told her they would teach her a lesson, said Subhashis Chowdhury, inspector-in-charge of Burdwan police station.        
	Two of the boys are students of Class XI and Class XII of a different school. The others are Class IX dropouts.        
	After the girl complained to her classmates, Bishu offered to escort her to school. While the two were on their way to school, the four boys again passed lewd comments at her. When Bishu protested, the four pounced on him. They punched and kicked me and threatened to kill me, Bishu said.        
	While Bishu was being beaten up, the girl rushed to the school and informed the headmaster. Some teachers and students of the school ran to the spot and took Bishu to hospital. Headmaster Subhas Dutta lodged a complaint and police detained the four boys.         
	The boys were released after local Trinamul Congress councillor Khokan Das requested the inspector-in-charge to let them off with a warning.        
	We let them off but warned them their crime had been recorded in a general diary and strong action would be taken if they committed another offence, Chowdhury said.

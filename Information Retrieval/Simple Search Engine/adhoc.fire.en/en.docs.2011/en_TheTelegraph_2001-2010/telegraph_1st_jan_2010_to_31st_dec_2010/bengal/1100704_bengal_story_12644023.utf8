	Calcutta, July 3: A teenaged girl who escaped from captivity and ran into two beat policemen has blown the lid off what appears to be sex slavery in the heart of Calcutta.        
	The 14-year-old girl has said she was raped for over a year in a house in Chandni Chowk by a trader who brought her over from Joynagar in South 24-Parganas.        
	The girl fled trader Ziaul Haques house in the early hours today and went to police. Bowbazar police have arrested Haque, a fruit shop owner.        
	Haque lives in a rented apartment in Chandni Chowk. His wife stays at his ancestral home in Chennai and visits him twice a year.         
	The girl said in her complaint that Haque used to beat her up regularly and made her do all the household chores for one-and-a-half years.        
	Two months after he brought her to his house, Haque started raping her, the girl said. She said Haque used to shut all the doors and windows so that her cries for help could not be heard by neighbours.         
	Haque had also allegedly threatened the girl not to tell anyone about the assault. She was forced to keep mum when Haques wife came to visit him.         
	The girl kept quiet because she was scared about what would happen to her after Haques wife left for Chennai, an officer said.        
	Last night, when Haque was asleep, the girl opened the main door and escaped. On C.R. Avenue, she met the policemen who took her to Bowbazar police station.

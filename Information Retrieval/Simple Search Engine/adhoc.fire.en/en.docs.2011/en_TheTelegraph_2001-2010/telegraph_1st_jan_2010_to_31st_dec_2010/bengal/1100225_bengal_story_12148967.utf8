	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Mamata Banerjee was at her favourite game, yet again.         
	Presenting her proposals for Calcutta Metro  the countrys oldest tube network  the railway minister today renamed five stations.         
	I dont see a link between a railway budget and renaming of stations. But if it is Mamata, anything is possible, said Bhaskar Roy, who takes the underground train service every morning to reach his office at Park Street.         
	Now he will be getting off at Mother Teresa.         
	Metro authorities said they had yet to get an official word on the renaming from the ministry. But once that comes, it should be a matter of days for the new names to come into effect.        
	Then, Mahatma Gandhi Road will be Thakurbari, Chandni Chowk will be Tipu Sultan, Park Street will be Mother Teresa, Maidan will be Goshtha Pal and Kalighat will be Bhagat Singh.        
	The railway ministers fascination with names is not new. Earlier, she had changed Tollygunge Metro station to Mahanayak Uttam Kumar. Four stations south of Tollygunge were named after Netaji, Masterda Surya Sen, Geetanjali and Kavi Nazrul when Metros extended run was launched.         
	It is mere tokenism. She should have concentrated on making travelling by the Metro more comfortable for commuters, said Pratyasha Rath, 22, a student.         
	Commuters complained of waste of time at ticket counters every day as people try to figure out the name of the station for their destination. Long rush-hour queues often become longer because people keep asking the name of their station while buying tickets, said Pinakpani Bhattacharya, 34, an IT professional.        
	As news of the name changes reached Metro passengers heading home this evening, many wondered aloud about the benefits of such a move.        
	Ive known people from outside the city who have had a tough time finding their destination because most stations here are named after people, said Karthik Sukumaran, 29, who works in a private bank.        
	Some wondered why the stations were being renamed the way they were as some names had no association with the places.        
	Park Street will now be called Mother Teresa. Kalighat will be Bhagat Singh. Does anyone know why? Whats the association of these people with these places? asked Dhruv Biswas, 32, an income tax lawyer.        
	Mamata, most Calcuttans felt, would have done Metro commuters a big favour by increasing the frequency of trains and focusing on upgrade of coaches and maintenance of the tracks.         
	Mamata has said at various events that renaming stations after icons is her way of showing them respect. But most Calcuttans are not willing to buy that argument.        
	How does renaming Mahatma Gandhi Road, named after one icon, as Thakurbari, named after another, achieve that end? asked Dipankar Ghosh, 58, an RBI officer.

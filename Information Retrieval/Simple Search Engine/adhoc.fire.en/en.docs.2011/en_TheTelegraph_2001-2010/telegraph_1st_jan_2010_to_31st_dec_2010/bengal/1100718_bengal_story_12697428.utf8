	Santiniketan, July 17: Students of Visva-Bharati University have kept the vice-chancellor and 20 teaching and non-teaching staff confined inside a varsity hall since 12.30pm today to protest a recent fee hike.        
	The students have also detained a doctor who came to see Rajat Kanta Ray after he complained of uneasiness.         
	A police team was sent to the varsity late in the night.        
	Around 150 undergraduate, postgraduate and research students had assembled at the central office building to submit a representation to Ray, demanding that the old fee structure be reinstated. But when the vice-chancellor refused to accept their demand, the students gheraoed the building and began a dharna. The other officials inside the building were also not allowed to step out.         
	We want the varsity to revert to the old fee structure. Unless our demand is fulfilled, we wont let anyone step out of the central office building, said Mithun Singha Roy, one of the conveners of the Students Forum Against the Enhancement of Fees.        
	While the admission fee for undergraduate courses has been raised from Rs 660 to Rs 6,660, that for postgraduate courses has been increased from Rs 700 to Rs 7,000. Research students now have to submit Rs 13,000 instead of Rs 3,000.        
	Principals of around half a dozen bhavans, the different wings of the varsity, registrar Manimukut Mitra and public relations officer Amitabha Chowdhury held a meeting and later went into a huddle with the vice-chancellor but are yet to find a solution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Festive mood dries up in rice bowl
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Festive mood dries up in rice bowl

	Ausgram (Burdwan) Sept. 7: The pall of drought and suicides has darkened the festive mood among farmers in Burdwans Ausgram though Id and the Durga Puja are round the corner.        
	While the residents of Karoti have decided to cancel the only puja in the village, the villagers of Purbototi are still undecided. Even if they organise a puja, there will be no idol.         
	In Basantapur, a Muslim-dominated village, the residents dont have money to buy new clothes for Id (on September 11).         
	Drought and debt have apparently driven one farmer from each of these villages to suicide so far this year.         
	We will not organise Durga Puja this year. We are depressed because of the suicides and the bad crop, said farmer Aditya Mukherjee, one of the organisers of the Durga Puja at Karoti. I have not yet managed to repay the Rs 8,000 I had borrowed last year. This time, I have taken a loan of Rs 10,000 to cultivate my five-bigha plot. I dont know how I will repay this huge debt. The moneylenders are hounding me. Maybe, I will also have to commit suicide, Aditya, who has a daughter, said.        
	Farmers in Purbototi said they were in no mood to organise a Durga Puja this time.         
	Shyamal Saha, who has been able to cultivate only 15 bighas of his 25-bigha plot, said: Most of the saplings I had transplanted have turned yellow as there has been very little rain. The earth has cracked. I dont think there is any other alternative but to commit suicide after killing my wife and three children, said Shyamal, who owes moneylenders Rs 22,000.         
	Residents of Basantapur, which recorded the first farmer suicide in the state this year, said they could offer little more than prayers on Id.        
	Naushad Sheikh, 45, a sharecropper, said: I owe moneylenders Rs 30,000. My crops have dried up. I cant dream of buying new clothes for Id. He has five mouths to feed: his wife, two daughters and two sons.         
	Sheikh Mansur, 40, Sheikh Azizul, 35, and Sheikh Yusuf, 56, have also lost their crops and are neck-deep in debt.        
	Ausgram Block 1, under which the three villages fall, does not have any irrigation facilities despite being in a district known as Bengals rice bowl.         
	Azizul Haque, the chief of the CPM-run gram panchayat of Ausgram, said: The cultivable land here is rain-fed and there are no irrigation canals. Although we have installed three pumps, we are yet to receive electricity connections for them.         
	District magistrate Onkar Singh Meena said efforts were on to provide electricity for the pumps as quickly as possible.

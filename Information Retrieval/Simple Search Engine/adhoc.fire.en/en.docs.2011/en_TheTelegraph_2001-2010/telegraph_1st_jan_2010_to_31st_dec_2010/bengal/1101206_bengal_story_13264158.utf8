          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Behrampore, Dec. 5: Four labourers travelling on a rice-laden truck were killed when the vehicle missed a bend in dense fog, careened off a highway and fell into a ditch in Murshidabads Suti this morning.        
	Around 15 minutes later and only 6km down the same National Highway 34, a villager was run over by a truck.        
	The twin tragedies come two days after a bus crashed into a stationary truck near Asansol in similar weather conditions, underscoring the perils of driving in winter on some of Bengals busiest highways.        
	In the Murshidabad tragedy, the four labourers  part of a larger group of 12 returning home with rice given to them as wages in kind for harvesting a paddy crop  were crushed after the truck toppled over on them. The others have been admitted to a Jangipur hospital, 15km away.         
	 In the second accident, Saju Sheikh was hit by a truck whose driver did not see him crossing the road in the fog.

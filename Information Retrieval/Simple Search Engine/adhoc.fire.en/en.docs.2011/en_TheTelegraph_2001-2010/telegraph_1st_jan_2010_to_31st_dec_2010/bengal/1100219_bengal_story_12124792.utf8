  Inquiry to fix blame, officials ticked off 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Bhattacharjee at Writers rsquo; on Thursday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                      
	Calcutta, Feb. 18: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said there was a lack of alertness by police when Maoists struck at the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in Shilda on Monday and that an inquiry would be conducted to find out whether lapses in intelligence had led to the heinous attack.        
	It was undoubtedly a heinous attack that led to the death of so many policemen. But there was a breach of security a lack of alertness on their (the polices) part, the chief minister said at Writers Buildings this afternoon.         
	Yesterday, we took the decision to order an inquiry to examine the lapses that had occurred. We would also investigate whether there were lapses in intelligence and whether the police had prior inputs on the attack, Bhattacharjee said.        
	We want to find out how this incident happened, the modus operandi of the Maoists, how many people were attacked and how many Maoists had raided the camp. We also want to find out what the policemen were doing at that time, particularly their alertness. We want to learn from our mistakes, the chief minister added.        
	Bhattacharjee refused to comment a Union home ministry officials conjecturing that the personnel at the camp were having a picnic at the time of the attack.        
	Asked whether the inquiry would fix responsibility, the chief minister said: Not only that. We will find out what was the condition of the EFR camp during the time of the attack.        
	Yesterday, home secretary Ardhendu Sen had said action would be taken against those found responsible for the lapses while director-general of police Bhupinder Singh had claimed the inquiry would not be a fault-finding exercise.        
	Bhattacharjee reacted sharply to the discrepancies in the statements, saying: This cannot happen in a government, with two different statements being issued. Its unfortunate. I have told the DG and the chief secretary to discuss among themselves and avoid such situations. I believe such mistakes wont be repeated.        
	The chief minister today claimed that Maoists from other states had joined their cadres in Bengal to carry out the attack on the Shilda camp.        
	We have received information that not only Maoists of our state but squads from the states bordering Bengal had jointly conducted the operation. They have looted almost all the arms and ammunition in the camp, he said.        
	Bhattacharjee said the Bengal government would begin an offensive against the Maoists soon so that we can strike before they strike again.        
	Asked about the prospect of an inter-state operation, he said: Our first meeting on the joint operation was held in Midnapore recently. I havent spoken to the chief ministers of states bordering ours in the recent past. But I did have a talk with Chidambaram on the day of the attack. We will be on the offensive very soon.        
	When asked about the two-member central team visiting the trouble-torn areas of West Midnapore, Bhattacharjee said there would not be any problem working with them.        
	The central government has sent some officers and we have been informed about the visit. Another team will be coming shortly. They are welcome. They wanted to know what had happened and also gave us some advice. We have no problems functioning together, the chief minister said.         
	The central team, comprising Brigadier D.S. Dadwal (retired) and Sunil Singh, the deputy secretary in the Union home ministry, met the director-general of police today and told him that the location of the Shilda camp wasnt proper and that there was a general lack of alertness on the polices part, a source said.        
	There was also a proposal from their end that the relatively old policemen in the EFR be taken off, the source added.         
	The chief minister said the following decisions had been taken:         
	The Shilda camp will be relocated to a nearby place on forest land and reconstructed at the earliest.        
	 Besides the compensation of Rs 15 lakh each, the families of the dead jawans will get salaries till the date they would have served as a one-time lump-sum payment as well as a job for one member.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: A 50-strong mob ransacked the gynaecology department of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital on Saturday after the death of two newborns, alleging negligence and misbehaviour by doctors and nursing staff.        
	Pinki Khatun, the mother of one of the newborns, said she had given birth to a son on Thursday. Initially, there was no problem but some complications developed yesterday. The baby fell silent and refused to be fed.        
	She alleged that despite several enquiries, the doctors and the nursing staff did not tell them what the affliction was. The babys condition deteriorated last night and he died at 5.10am today.         
	Pinkis husband Md Tajuddin, a vegetable vendor at Kidderpore market, and her uncle Md Ismail said no doctors were present early in the morning. When we enquired about the baby, some of the nurses misbehaved with us, Pinki said.        
	Around 10.30am, around 50 of Pinkis relatives ransacked the gynaecology department and broke windowpanes. They also broke furniture in the doctors room. Hospital officials said Pinkis relatives were joined by the family members of Sumita Singh, whose baby also died today.        
	Sumita, a resident of Topsia, had given birth to a boy a few days ago. Her relatives also complained of negligence on the part of the doctors.         
	S.K. Saha, the medical superintendent of the hospital, said: The babies were in critical condition and had to be admitted to the nursery section. There was no negligence on the part of the doctors. The family members had been regularly updated on the babies conditions. He said the authorities were planning to beef up security at the hospital.        
	An officer said at Beniapukur police station that three persons had been arrested in connection with the rampage.         
	Those arrested have been booked under the recently introduced West Bengal Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act, 2009, he said. They wont be able to seek bail, the officer added.

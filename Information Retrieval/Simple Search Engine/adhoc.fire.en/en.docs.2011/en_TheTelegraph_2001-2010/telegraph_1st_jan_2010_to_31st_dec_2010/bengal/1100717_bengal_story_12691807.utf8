	Midnapore, July 16: A Maoist was killed and two arrested after police raided a village in West Midnapore where one of the Jnaneswari Express sabotage masterminds was supposedly holding a meeting with his aides early today.        
	The police raided Jaybandhi village near Jhargram after receiving information that Umakanto Mahato, Saheb Ram Murmu alias Jayanta, accused of being involved in the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in Shilda attack, Gautam Rana, a rebel released on bail, and their accomplices were holding a meeting there.         
	The Maoists started firing at us when we reached the outskirts of the village. We retaliated, said Mukesh Kumar, the additional superintendent of police (operations).         
	One of the Maoists, Bikram Mahato, 40, was killed in the half-an-hour gunfight, Kumar said. He said the Maoists retreated into the village after realising that they were outnumbered.         
	The police, with the help of villagers, then raided several houses and arrested Nepal Patra and Ranjit Rana, Gautams brother. The police said Umakanto, Gautam and the other Maoists escaped into a nearby forest.

	Calcutta, Jan. 20: A Calcutta-Chennai IndiGo flight with 175 passengers on board returned here tonight, apparently after the pilot detected a snag in its flaps. The plane, which took off at 8.55pm, landed again at Dum Dum at 10.05pm. An airline official said the plane would leave tomorrow with all the passengers.

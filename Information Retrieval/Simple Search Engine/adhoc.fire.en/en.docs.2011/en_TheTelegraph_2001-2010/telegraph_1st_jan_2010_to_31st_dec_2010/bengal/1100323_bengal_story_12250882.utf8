The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | For poll, buzzword is backward
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      For poll, buzzword is backward
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, March 22: The Bengal budget today spelt out proposals that could involve an increased spending of Rs 3,000 crore on the minorities, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the urban and rural poor who had turned their backs on the Left.         
	Improvement in the condition of the minorities and similar facilities for other backward people, including a rise in special monthly grants for students (from Rs 600 to Rs 750) and the creation of more employment opportunities, form the core of the budget.        
	The effort comes months before 82 civic bodies go to the polls in what is being billed as a semi-final before next years Assembly elections.        
	The condition of the minorities needs improvement... and they should get more employment opportunities. They will have to be provided with more civic amenities. Minority community students require special attention. That is why I propose to increase the outlay on minorities and madrasah education from Rs 121 crore to Rs 300 crore, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said in his budget speech.        
	Such things apply to students belonging to the backward classes for their general welfare. Vocational training to such students needs to be strengthened so that more employment opportunities can be created. I propose to raise the budget for backward classes welfare from Rs 298.4 crore to Rs 379.4 crore.        
	The budget is tame on industry, which had been the governments mantra when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took over in 2006. The industries budget has merely been raised by Rs 50 crore to make it Rs 400 crore.        
	On the other hand, the promise of rice at Rs 2 a kilo from ration shops for the bottom 20 per cent in the above-poverty-line category is being viewed as a sop to placate the semi-urban poor. A scheme to provide the benefit to those living below the poverty line is already in place.         
	Efforts will be made to. also channel pulses, sugar and edible oil through ration shops, Dasgupta said.         
	According to government sources, the thrust of the budget was decided by the Lefts electoral debacle in the 2008 panchayat polls and the 2009 general election that saw four zilla parishads and as many as 26 Lok Sabha seats being snatched by the Opposition.        
	The minorities, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes deserted the CPM after the Singur and Nandigram turmoil. They feared losing their land because of the state governments aggressive land acquisition policy. The Sachar committee report exposed the pitiable condition of Muslims here. All this contributed to the electoral backlash from these sections. Now, the government is desperate to woo them back, a source said.        
	Minorities minister Abdus Sattar said: Infrastructure development for educational institutions is the biggest priority for us. A large amount has been earmarked for building a separate campus for women, and buildings and hostels for minority students. The increase in allocation has been made keeping in mind the overall development of minorities.         
	The rural poor will be cheered by the implementation of the Acquisition of Homestead Land Act, 1975, to confer ownership rights on farm labourers, rural artisans and fishermen who had possession of homestead land of up to 5 cottahs by December 31, 2009.        
	Earlier, the cut-off date was June 26, 1975, on the basis of which ownership rights were given to the rural landless people. Extending the cut-off by 35 years is definitely aimed at getting back a lost vote bank, an official said.        
	Dasgupta said: The land and land reforms department will soon initiate necessary legal and administrative steps in this regard. Over two lakh families will benefit.        
	The government today also announced that it was willing to pay up to 25 per cent higher than the market value for plots to be purchased from willing farmers for distribution among poor landless farmers.        
	For the urban poor, provisions have been made in the budget to offer employment in municipal work with an honorarium of Rs 100 a day. Supervisors will be paid Rs 120 a day.        
	The monthly financial assistance to workers of closed tea gardens has been increased from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500.

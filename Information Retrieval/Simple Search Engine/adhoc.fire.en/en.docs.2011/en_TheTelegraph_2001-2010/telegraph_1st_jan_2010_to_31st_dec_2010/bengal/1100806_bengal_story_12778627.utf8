	Calcutta, Aug 5: The decision of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities to attend Mamata Banerjees Lalgarh rally on August 9 has put her lieutenants in a dilemma: how to make the rally a success without allowing the committee to be too visible at the programme.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief does not want to be seen to be close to the Maoist-backed organisation but her party leaders concede that the committees participation can make a big difference to the rally.        
	Caught in this conflict, Trinamul leaders today said they would not allow prominent committee leaders to attend the rally and certainly not the outfits flags and banners.        
	However, party leaders privately admit that they cannot possibly prevent committee supporters or activists from joining the rally.        
	The committee today said it would lift its indefinite blockade from August 7 to 9 so that the rally could be held smoothly.        
	Mamata today sent Union minister of state for shipping, Mukul Roy, to Lalgarh to ask party functionaries in West Midnapore to ensure that no prominent committee leaders or functionaries attended the apolitical rally.        
	Committee chief Manoj Mahato had said yesterday that his outfit would attend the August 9 rally to hear what Mamata has to say about the people in Jungle Mahal. Committee leaders have also ordered villagers in Lalgarh and Salboni to attend the meeting.        
	Mrityunjoy Mahato, a Lalgarh resident, said committee leaders had asked villagers to mobilise people for the rally and, if necessary, hire trucks to ferry them to the venue.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata had held a meeting in Delhi yesterday with her close aides to discuss how her party could distance itself from the committee. The aides suggested that a message should be sent to Trinamuls political adversaries that the party was averse to entertaining any Peoples Committee leader or member at the rally.         
	Mamata readily accepted the suggestion and sent Mukul to convey our tough stand on the Peoples Committee to our party leaders in West Midnapore, a Trinamul leader said from Delhi.        
	After meeting the West Midnapore leaders, Roy said: We are holding an apolitical rally. Everyone can attend it. We dont know any Peoples Committee leader and we have no connection with any such organisation. We are holding the rally in a bid to restore peace in Jungle Mahal. All who want peace to be restored are welcome to attend the rally.         
	He also inspected the school ground where the rally will be held.        
	However, sources in Trinamuls West Midnapore unit said the party had today asked committee leaders not to make the presence of their supporters and activists at the rally too conspicuous.        
	A local committee leader confirmed that Trinamul had contacted the outfit. We have asked our supporters not to attend the rally with committee flags, banners or placards. Our supporters will also not raise slogans other than those related to the demands for development and the withdrawal of the joint forces, he said.        
	Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh today said if wanted committee activists were seen at the rally, they would be arrested.        
	PCPA not banned        
	State Congress president Manas Bhuniya said there was nothing wrong if the committee attended the rally because it had not been declared a banned outfit. He, however, said his party would stay away from the rally.

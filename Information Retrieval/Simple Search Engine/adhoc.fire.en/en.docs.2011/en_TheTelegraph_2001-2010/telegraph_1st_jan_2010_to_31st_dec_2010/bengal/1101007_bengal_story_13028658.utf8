                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hill fest to woo tourists
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Oct. 6: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha will use the platform of its foundation-day celebrations tomorrow to reintroduce a festival in Darjeeling after four years, in an apparent bid to reassure holidaymakers and the tourism trade in the agitation-hit hills.        
	The tourism festival coincides with the Puja season when 1.5 lakh tourists are expected to visit Darjeeling in the next one month.        
	Paragliders and school bands will perform at the opening ceremony of the month- long festival at the Mall.         
	The festival, which was earlier called Darjeeling Carnival, used to be organised by an apolitical citizens forum. However, after the Morcha was formed in 2007 and the statehood agitation gained momentum, the forum stopped organising the event, where various cultural programmes showcasing life in the hills used to be held.         
	The Morcha had earlier announced its plans to organise the festival, hinting it would be a strike-free Pujas this time.        
	The event, being organised this time by the hill party-backed Gorkha Kala Sanstha, has been planned at a time the Morcha is upbeat about inking a deal with the state government on the interim-set up for the hills.         
	The festival is also being seen as a Morcha effort to appease the hill people after the murder of Madan Tamang, for which it has been blamed.         
	Darjeeling has been decorated with green-yellow-white buntings, the colour of the Morcha flag, for the festival. The Mall area has been cleaned.         
	Paragliders have arrived from Himachal Pradesh. The Morcha has requested all Darjeeling residents to put up party flags on their rooftops. Party activists have been told to attend the opening ceremony in traditional Gorkha attire.         
	Over the next 30 days, cultural shows will be held at the Mall from 4pm to 7pm. Programmes, including paragliding shows, will also be held at Kurseong, Kalimpong and Mirik.         
	Tourists will start arriving in Darjeeling from next week. They are expected to stay till Diwali, a tour operator said.

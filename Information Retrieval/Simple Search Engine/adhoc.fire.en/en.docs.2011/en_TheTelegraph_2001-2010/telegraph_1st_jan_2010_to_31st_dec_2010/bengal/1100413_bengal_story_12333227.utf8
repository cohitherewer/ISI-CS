The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shut out defectors, Cong leaders cry
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Shut out defectors, Cong leaders cry
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, April 12: State Congress leaders will plead with Pranab Mukherjee when they meet in Delhi tomorrow to prevail upon Mamata Banerjee not to nominate for the civic polls those who had defected to her party from their ranks.        
	The Trinamul Congress chiefs alleged ins-istence on fielding Congress deserters is said to have emerged as a stumbling block for the alliance in the 81 civic bodies going to the polls next month.        
	Congress leaders fear it could become a precedent for next years Assembly polls and more and more people could flock to Mamata from their ranks for tickets.        
	 We want Pranabda (state Congress president) to address the problem concerning Trinamuls insistence on nominating Congress deserters across Bengal. Alliance talks have hit a roadblock because of this, state party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.        
	He added that it did not go down well with Mamata when state Congress leaders insisted at a meeting on Friday that she should not give tickets to seven Congress councillors of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation who had defected to her party.        
	Bhattacharya, who will leave for Delhi tomorrow morning, today took updates from the partys district units on seat sharing.         
	Nearly 60 Congress councillors, including several municipal chairmen, have switched to Trinamul in south Bengal since Mamatas stellar show in last years Lok Sabha elections.         
	The number may still not be much. But this dangerous trend has to be stemmed at any cost, said Nadia district Congress chief Shankar Singh. The deserters number the most in Nadia  20.         
	Congress leaders in North 24-Parganas, who on their own had started talks with their Trinamul counterparts about the danger of encouraging defections, said it did not help. On principle, the Trinamul leaders agreed that defectors should not be entertained. But in reality, they are sending feelers to party councillors in Basirhat and Barrackpore, complained district Congress president Debi Ghoshal, who will be part of the team to Delhi.        
	North 24-Parganas Trinamul president Nirmal Ghosh dismissed Ghoshals allegations. No responsible party can encourage defection. Who can guarantee that those joining us from the Congress will not one day desert us?        
	However, a Nadia Trinamul leader who did not want to be named said it was entirely up to Mamata to decide the candidates.

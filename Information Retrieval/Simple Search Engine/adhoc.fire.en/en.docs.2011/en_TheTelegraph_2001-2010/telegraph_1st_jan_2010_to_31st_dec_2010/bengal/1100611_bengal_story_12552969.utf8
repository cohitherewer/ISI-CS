	June 10: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today disbanded its Darjeeling town committee and removed its convener Dinesh Gurung as part of efforts to confront the growing resistance from rival outfits trying to emerge from the shadow of fear.         
	The Morcha also announced weekly torch rallies from June 17 and directed its Darjeeling leadership to hold ward-level meetings regularly so as not to lose touch with the people.        
	Morcha chief Bimal Gurung hopes that these measures will help stem the backlash against the party in the wake of the murder of ABGL leader Madan Tamang last month. The Morcha has been accused of masterminding the murder.         
	The CID, which is probing the murder, has found that 60 people were involved in the May 21 assassination. However, the agency has identified two, including Dinesh, for having delivered the killer blow. Both Dinesh and Naresh Thang are at large.        
	The Morcha announcement came a day after director-general of police Bhupinder Singh said most of those involved in Tamangs murder had been identified.        
	Gurung today said an ad hoc committee had been formed to replace the Darjeeling town committee.        
	He said Dinesh had been removed because he was unwell. However, Morcha sources said the actual reason for dropping Dinesh was Gurungs desire to distance the town committee from Tamangs murder.

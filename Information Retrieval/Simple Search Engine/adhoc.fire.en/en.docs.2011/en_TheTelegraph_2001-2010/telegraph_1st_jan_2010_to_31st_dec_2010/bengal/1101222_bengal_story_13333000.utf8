                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Halt plea on airport spiked
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          A part of the site where the airport project will come up                                   
	Calcutta, Dec. 21: Calcutta High Court today declined to pass an order stopping work for the construction of the proposed airport and township project at Andal in Burdwan.         
	But it admitted the petition challenging the legality of the process adopted for acquiring the land for the project, and fixed January 6 as the next date of hearing.        
	Justice Jayanta Biswas, in his interim order, asked the state authorities to furnish details of the acquisition of the 3,500 acres.         
	This court is not restraining the authorities concerned to proceed with the development of the proposed project but they will have to abide by the results of the case (the ruling on acquisition process), the judge said.        
	The petition was filed by Moira Madhujore Coal Ltd and other companies claiming the land on which the project was planned had already been leased out to them by Coal India Ltd (CIL).         
	Two coal blocks spread over 7.89sqkm have already been handed over to us by the CIL for lifting of coal, the companies said.        
	They also said that it would not be safe to construct an airport and township in an area under which the ground could have several hollows as a result of the coal mining. The petitioners demanded an order asking the state to axe the project.        
	Early this year, the state government handed over the 3,500 acres to the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) for construction of the Aerotropolis Project, where an airport and township would come up.         
	The WBIDC had handed over the land to Simplex India Ltd for developing it. At present, work for area mapping is going on, Pratik Dhar, the lawyer appearing on behalf of the state, said. The WBDIC will finally hand over the land to Bengal Aeroprotrolis Project Ltd for construction of the project.        
	The interim order of the court will allow Simplex to proceed with the developmental works. Many farmers, who have lost land for the proposed project. The farmers are not even allowing the employees to enter the area. After todays court order, things will be easier for us, a WBIDC official said.

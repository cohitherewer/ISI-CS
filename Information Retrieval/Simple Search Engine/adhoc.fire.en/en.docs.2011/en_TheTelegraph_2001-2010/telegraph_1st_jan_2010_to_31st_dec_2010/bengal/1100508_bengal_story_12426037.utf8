The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong terror slur on Trinamul
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong terror slur on Trinamul
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, May 7: Congress candidates have allegedly been forced to pull out from 79 of the 382 North 24-Parganas wards from which they had filed nominations because of a reign of terror and threats by estranged ally Trinamul Congress.        
	All 79 withdrawals took place today, one of them after the candidates husband was allegedly abducted.        
	District Congress presi- dent Tapas Majumdar said the husband of a candidate for the Barrackpore municipali-ty had gone to the bazaar this morning when seven Trinamul supporters on motorbikes took him away and called his wife to say he would be harmed unless she withdrew.        
	Later in the afternoon, the candidate, whose name Majumdar requested The Telegraph not to reveal as she could be killed, went and withdrew her nomination.         
	Armed Trinamul men criss-crossed the Barrackpore area since morning, intimidating our candidates and forcing them to withdraw, Majumdar said.        
	As many as 65 of the Congress candidates who withdrew today  the last day for doing so before the May 30 polls  were from the nine municipalities in the Barrackpore area.         
	Many Congress workers in the district called it Trinamuls reign of terror, borrowing a phrase Mamata Banerjee loves to use to describe the Left rule in the state.        
	Mamatas party is on a high in North 24-Parganas since the panchayat polls in 2008. Last year, it consolidated its grip, winning all five Lok Sabha seats in the district.         
	The fear of a split in anti-Left votes apparently made the party pull out all stops to ensure there were fewer Congress candidates in a district where as many as 21 municipalities are going to the polls.        
	As candidate after candidate went to strike off their names, complaints poured into the North 24-Parganas Congress headquarters about armed Trinamul activists moving around on motorcycles and threatening them.         
	Majumdar said the party had lodged specific complaints with Barrackpore subdivisional officer Ajay Paul. The officer said he had instructed police to inquire into them and take appropriate action.        
	Many of the candidates did not lodge complaints fearing the consequences.         
	District magistrate Vinod Kumar said: I have asked the returning officers and sub-divisional officers to give me a report tomorrow.         
	But the Trinamul chief brushed aside the charges. Baseless, Mamata said when asked about them at a news conference this evening.         
	These are canards being spread by the CPM. They (the Congress nominees) have withdrawn because they want to work for a grand alliance.        
	Former Barrackpore Trinamul MLA Nirmal Ghosh blamed the Congress for failing to keep its flock together. Some Congress candidates withdrew after realising that they might lose their deposits.

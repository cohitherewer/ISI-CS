                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Abused, Suman texts Q word
- MP messages Mamta and chief whip										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Suman and Mamata (top and bottom): Compatibility problem?                                 
	Calcutta, March 29: Kabir Suman tonight texted Mamata Banerjee his desire to quit as member of Parliament and from the Trinamul Congress.        
	The Jadavpur MP, who has repeatedly criticised the party in public, sent the text message after he was heckled and abused today at Narendrapur by some Trinamul supporters who accused him of being a CPM stooge, a source said.        
	Suman later told STAR Ananda: I was insulted by party members again today and I decided to resign from the party. But I still want the CPMs rule to be over and hope Mamata Banerjee will be the next chief minister of West Bengal.        
	He added: I was not the type of person who was comfortable to have around and the party should have realised that before taking me in its wings. I was asked by many members of the civil society to carry on till 2011 at least but I am sorry I could not keep their request.        
	The dissident MP also sent a text message to the Trinamul chief whip in the Lok Sabha, Sudip Bandopadhyay.         
	I got a one-line SMS from Kabir Suman expressing his desire to quit as MP and from the party, Bandopadhyay said.        
	 I am certain that the SMS was sent to me from Sumans cellphone as he had spoken to me from the number on earlier occasions, he added.        
	The Trinamul chief whip, however, said he would not read too much into the one-line text message until he lets us know everything in writing.        
	Mamata, who left for Delhi this afternoon after attending a railway event at Sealdah, could not be contacted till late tonight.        
	Asked if Sumans decision would push the party into an uncomfortable position at a time it is facing elections to 82 civic bodies across Bengal in the next two months, Bandopadhyay replied in the affirmative.         
	There is no denying that a party is pushed into an un-comfortable position after an MP offers to resign from his post as well from the party, he said.        
	He admitted that the party was embarrassed by some of Sumans recent statements, particularly those concerning his soft corner for Maoists.        
	At a time Mamata and everyone of us are vehemently condemning Maoists for unleashing a spate of killings, Sumans soft corner for them has embarrassed us a lot. We, however, time and again requested him to go by the party line, Bandopadhyay added.        
	A Trinamul general secretary said Mamata had last week expressed her desire to take disciplinary action against Suman for consistently speaking against the party line.         
	Last week, Suman had accused his party colleagues of indulging in corruption at the local level and unleashing violence, the fifth time he had defied the leadership and spoken against Trinamul.         
	In 2009, Suman had spoken out against a section of par- ty leaders, including South 24-Parganas district president Sovan Chatterjee, for dictating to him how he should spend his MP funds for development.

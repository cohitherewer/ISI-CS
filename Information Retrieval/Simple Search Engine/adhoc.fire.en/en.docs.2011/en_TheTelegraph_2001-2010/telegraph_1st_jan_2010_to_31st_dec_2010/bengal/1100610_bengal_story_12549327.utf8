The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hill rally at murder spot
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hill rally at murder spot
                            
	Darjeeling, June 9: The Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League has decided to hold a public meeting at the spot where its leader Madan Tamang had been hacked to death while overseeing preparations for a rally.         
	Observers said it indicated the outfits resolve to remain the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas most vocal rival in the hills.        
	Fridays rally will come close on the heels of an ABGL demonstration in front of the Darjeeling police station demanding the arrest of Tamangs killers. We wont be browbe-aten, ABGL leader Laxman Pradhan said. We want the arrest of Tamangs killers, who are all Morcha men.        
	In Calcutta, state police chief Bhupinder Singh said most of the assassins had been identified. I cant say who they are as that will harm the probe.         
	Some of them may have fled to Nepal and the police will seek Interpol help to trace them, Singh added.

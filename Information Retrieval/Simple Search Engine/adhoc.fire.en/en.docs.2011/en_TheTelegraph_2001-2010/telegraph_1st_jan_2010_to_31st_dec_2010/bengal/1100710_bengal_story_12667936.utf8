	Calcutta, July 9: Pranab Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee today shared a Bengal stage for the first time since the civic polls and later discussed the states law and order with governor M.K. Narayanan.        
	The two leaders presence at a programme to oversee the signing of an MoU for the beautification of the Hooghly riverfront and their subsequent Raj Bhavan meeting with Narayanan is being seen as a step towards shoring up the Congress-Trinamul ties.         
	The allies had failed to strike a deal for the May civic polls.        
	Mukherjee appeared to highlight the importance of his appearing alongside Mamata when he said he had cancelled a key meeting to make it to the riverfront event.         
	A key state Congress functionary later suggested later that the twin events could set the tone for warmer vibes in the days ahead. Let this bonhomie last so we can together take on the ruling communists in next years Assembly polls, he said.        
	Mamata, too, did her bit to reach out to her ally by inviting Mukherjee, the Union finance minister, to a Trinamul Youth Congress rally at Esplanade on July 21. The Trinamul chief organises the event every year to mark the killing of 13 Youth Congress activists in alleged police firing in 1993.        
	Mamata invited Pranabda and Union law minister Veerappa Moily as special guests. State Congress president Manas Bhuniya is also expected to be present, said Trinamul senior vice-president Subrata Mukherjee, who broke away from the Congress to rejoin Mamata before the civic polls.        
	Congress leaders appeared happy about Bhuniya being invited. K. Keshava Rao, the in charge of the partys Bengal affairs, was the only Congress leader with a state role to have been called last year. We are really happy to know Manas would be one of the invitees, said state Congress general secretary Maya Ghosh.        
	Bhuniya and Trinamul Union minister Mukul Roy had addressed a joint rally for the Congress candidate ahead of Mondays Durgapur I bypoll. The CPM won the seat yesterday.        
	State Trinamul Youth Congress chief Subhendu Adhikari, overseeing preparations for the July 21 rally, said Congress workers were working with them to counter the CPMs alleged atrocities.

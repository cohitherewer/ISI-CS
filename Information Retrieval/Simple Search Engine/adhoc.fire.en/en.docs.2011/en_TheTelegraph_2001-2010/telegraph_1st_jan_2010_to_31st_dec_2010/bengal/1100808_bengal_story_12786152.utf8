                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Operators to review strike
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 7: Transport operators have said they will meet tomorrow to review their decision to call a three-day strike from August 10 to press for an increase in fares after the state government today ruled out a hike.        
	Representatives of bus, minibus and taxi unions met transport minister Ranjit Kundu this afternoon at Writers Buildings. Although Kundu ruled out a fare hike, he promised to look into the problems transport operators were facing because of a rise in fuel prices.        
	The state government had earlier offered a subsidy of Re 1 for every litre of diesel bought by transport operators.         
	Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association, said after todays meeting: We have no comments on what the minister has said. We will discuss the matter at a meeting on Sunday and take a final call on the strike.        
	Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, echoed Bari. We will decide whether or not to proceed with the strike after we meet all the major bus, minibus and taxi unions tomorrow, he said.         
	We have been told that there will not be a fare hike. The only option left, in that case, is removal of the cess on fuel, Das added.         
	Kundu said after the meeting: We have already done enough for them (transport operators). However, we will look into their problems if they comply with our request to call off the strike.

	Nanoor, April 25: Alleged CPM supporters hurled bombs 300 metres from Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee when he visited party supporters in Birbhums Nanoor whose huts had been torched yesterday.        
	Four bombs exploded outside the primary school at Sherpur village that had been converted into a shelter for the homeless. No one was hurt. The bombs allegedly came from adjoining Shirajpur, a CPM stronghold.         
	A Trinamul Congress supporter was killed and over 450 huts were torched or damaged during clashes yesterday.        
	The CPM is scared of us. They know the Left Front government will be thrown out in 2011, Chatterjee said. The Birbhum district police chief claimed credit for being able to ensure that there was no further trouble today.        
	Mamata dusts off NDA project        
	Mamata Banerjee today opened a 4km railway line that is part of a project she had launched as railway minister of the BJP-led government 10 years ago. Once completed, the 82km line will connect Tarakeswar in Hooghly with Bishnupur in Bankura. I had this project in mind ever since I took charge this time, Mamata told the opening ceremony.

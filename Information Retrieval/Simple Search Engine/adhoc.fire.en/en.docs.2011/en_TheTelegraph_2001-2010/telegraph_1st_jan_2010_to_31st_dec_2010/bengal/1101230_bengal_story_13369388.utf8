The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Poll rush to fill study vacancies 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Poll rush to fill study vacancies 
          MITA MUKHERJEE                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 29: The state government is scrambling to find candidates for key educational posts lying vacant for a long time, with officials saying the rush has been prompted by the need to fill up the positions before next years Assembly elections.        
	Although some of the posts have been lying vacant for as long as four years, the government started the procedure of hunting for candidates only a fortnight back, sources in the state higher education department said. The government is, however, yet to shortlist candidates for all the posts, except that of the pro vice-chancellor (finance) of Calcutta University.        
	Considering the winds of change blowing across Bengal, the government does not want to take the risk of keeping these key posts vacant because they would be filled up by candidates picked by the Opposition should they come to power after the polls, said a higher education department official.         
	The sources said the government could find it difficult to fill up so many vacancies before the polls, which have to be held before June 11.        
	The post of the pro vice-chancellor (finance) of Calcutta University, which has been lying vacant for almost a year, has to be filled up before January 31. According to the university act, the post cannot remain vacant for more than a year.        
	The higher education department sources said Mamata Ray, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, was the frontrunner. However, the sources said that with the Madhyamik exams just two months away, the government could ill afford to shift Ray to Calcutta University unless it found a suitable candidate to replace her.         
	The sources said the government was working overtime to find candidates for at least four other vacant posts. The posts of the president of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education and the chairpersons of the Calcutta and North Bengal regions of the West Bengal School Service Commission have been lying vacant for four years. The post of the chairman of the West Bengal Madarsa School Service Commission has been vacant for the past two years.         
	The higher education department official said the post of the primary education board chief had to be filled up immediately as the board was instrumental in implementing schemes under the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act.        
	Besides, the sources said, the terms of the incumbents in several other key posts will end by January.         
	For example, Swapan Pramanik, the vice-chancellor of Vidyasagar University, will retire on January 13. The post of the chairman of the West Bengal College Service Commission will also fall vacant as the incumbent, Himangshu Ghosh, will retire on January 3.         
	The government also needs to find suitable candidates for filling up important administrative posts in the newly formed Presidency University.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Nov. 10: Residents of four Murshidabad villages have found an untutored way to press for development: they have stopped their children from attending school.         
	The 1,200 children residing in Domkals Ghoramara, east and west Nishchintapur, and Ghatpara have not been attending school since September 20 under instructions from village elders. The teachers of the four primary schools and one junior high school in the region have been signing the attendance register and going home.         
	Nishchintapur resident Bodiul Khan, one of the leaders of the movement, said: The four villages dont have metalled roads, safe drinking water facilities, electricity and health centres. We had submitted several mass petitions to the Domkal subdivisional officer, the block development officer and the Murshidabad zilla parishad but no steps were taken to solve the problems.        
	We had hoped that by the time the schools reopened after Puja, our problems would be addressed. But nothing was done. So we did not send our children back to school after the holidays ended yesterday, Khan said.        
	Several residents complained about the lack of basic amenities in the four villages. The approach roads are dirty. Even two-wheelers cannot ply during monsoon. The water from tube wells contain arsenic and is not safe for drinking. There is no electricity, said Amirul Haque of Ghoramara. He said the nearest hospital from his village was 20km away.        
	State panchayat minister and Domkal MLA Anisur Rahman said he was not aware that the children of the four villages were staying off school.         
	He said a proposal for metalled roads had been submitted to the Centre and he was looking into the delay in setting up drinking water facilities. The villagers may have to wait for electricity as work under the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme was on, he added.

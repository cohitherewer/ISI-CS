	Burdwan, June 21: Six passengers on the Howrah-bound Kalka Mail fell unconscious last night after drinking drug-laced mango drinks offered to them by some youths who had befriended them.        
	Co-passengers alerted railway police when the train reached Burdwan station today morning. The six, who were travelling in two compartments, were taken to hospital. Four have regained consciousness but are so dazed that they cannot speak properly.         
	The police identified the six as Aalhant Mondal, 28, a Nadia embroider working in Delhi, Jitu Valmiki, also an embroider in the capital, Manoj Kumar Singh, 28, a welder from Howrah who had boarded the train in Bihar, Sudha Pandit, 35, from Burdwans Katwa, Mohammed Alam and Sahidul Maika, 40. Pandit, Alam and Maika had boarded the train from Delhi.         
	It is not clear if the six know each other.

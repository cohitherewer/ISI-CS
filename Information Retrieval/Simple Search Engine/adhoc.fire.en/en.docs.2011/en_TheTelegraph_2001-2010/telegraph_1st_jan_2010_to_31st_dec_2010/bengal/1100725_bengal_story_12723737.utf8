          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 24: Sourav Gangulys car was attacked at night by a mob protesting the death of a youth in an accident near the former cricketers Behala residence.         
	The mob banged on the door of Gangulys black Honda City and slapped his bodyguard when he told them to clear out.        
	However, when Sourav stepped out of the car with daughter Sana, the protesters immediately stepped back.        
	They apologised to Ganguly and he drove off.

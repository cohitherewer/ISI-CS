          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The damaged tracks (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, April 27: Suspected Maoists triggered a blast and damaged railway tracks around the time a Howrah- bound train was supposed to pass through that stretch, 4km from Midnapore station, this morning.        
	For once, the usual late running of the Chakradharpur-Howrah Passenger proved a blessing.        
	A level crossing gateman heard the blast from a distance and alerted Midnapore station around 1.20am. An hour behind schedule, the train was stopped at Godapiashal station, 8km from the blast site.         
	The train would have been thrown off the tracks had it passed through the damaged stretch, said Sandip Rajbangshi, seniority security commissioner of the Railway Protection Force at Adra division.        
	It had a providential escape, said a South Eastern Railway official.         
	The explosion broke some of the Pandrol clips, which affix the tracks to the sleepers, and created a long crack on one side of the Down line.        
	Besides the gateman, a locomotive driver patrolling the tracks on an engine had felt a a jerk while passing the area around 1.20am.         
	Railway officials and police arrived at the spot in an inspection train around 2.30am and found another improvised explosive device (IED) in a steel can on the Up line.         
	We also found some electrical wire, which we think was used to trigger the first blast, said Rajbangshi.        
	Tuesday was the second day of a two-day bandh called by the Maoists in Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh to protest Operation Green Hunt, the Centres proposed offensive against the guerrillas which is already under way in Chhattisgarh.        
	A district police officer said the blast occurred 1,200 metres from where Maoists had triggered an explosion targeting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy on November 2, 2008.        
	The railways repair team reached the blast site around 5am and it took over four hours to complete the job. The train that was to have reached Howrah by Tuesday dawn was brought to Midnapore station at 9.30am.         
	There, it lay stuck through the rest of the day, thanks to the bandh.        
	On March 22, suspected Maoists had blown up the tracks between Jhargram and Gidhni stations.

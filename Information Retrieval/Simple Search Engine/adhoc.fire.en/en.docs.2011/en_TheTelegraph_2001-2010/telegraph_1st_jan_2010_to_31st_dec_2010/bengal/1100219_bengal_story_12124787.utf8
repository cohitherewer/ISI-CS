          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 18: The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has made special arrangements for the smooth conduct of the Madhyamik examinations in the trouble-torn Darjeeling hills and West Midnapore.        
	The exams will begin on February 23 and continue till March 8.        
	Board officials have reached the three hill subdivisions and West Midnapore and are holding meetings with all sections of people, including locals, to ensure that the examinees can reach the exam venues on time.        
	The district administration and the local police have made arrangements to deploy additional forces in and outside the exam venues. The state transport department has been urged to ply special buses and maintain vigil on the vulnerable routes.         
	We are also prepared to bring the examinees to the centres and send them back home if they face any trouble while returning after the exam, a board official said.         
	The ongoing troubles in the hills and in West Midnapore is a matter of concern for us as we have many examination centres in those areas. The police and district administrations have given us assurance to provide all kinds of assistance to conduct the exams peacefully, said Mamata Ray, the board president.        
	Nearly 15,000 students from the hills, torn by agitation over a demand for a separate Gorkhaland state, and West Midnapore, a Maoist hotbed, will appear in the Madhyamik examinations this year.

	Bolpur, Sept. 29: Sixteen children and two teachers were injured when police allegedly resorted to a lathicharge inside a primary school in Birbhum today while trying to arrest two persons who were part of a mob that had thrown stones at the cops.         
	Yesterday, some residents of Rajnagar village had demonstrated in front of the local police station and allegedly heckled officers after a youth was mowed down by a bus. The villagers had demanded that the bus be seized. The police last night raided Rajnagar and arrested five villagers.         
	A local traders association today observed a bandh in the village and took out a procession around 9am to protest the raid.         
	When the procession was passing by the police station, some of the participants hurled stones at it. The police chased us with batons and two of the participants ran into the school. The police followed them and resorted to a baton charge inside the school, said Mahadeb Dutta, a trader.

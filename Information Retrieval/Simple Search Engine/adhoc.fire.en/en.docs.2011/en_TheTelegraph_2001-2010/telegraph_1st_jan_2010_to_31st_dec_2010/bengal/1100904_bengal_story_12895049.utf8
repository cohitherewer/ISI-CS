                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Outsiders back to roost

	Dharampur, Sept. 3: Several CPM outsiders who had fought the Maoists in Dharampur and were driven out by the rebels last year returned yesterday as the party reclaimed the Lalgarh village, residents said today.        
	We saw the same people marching with red flags in the procession. They dont belong to our village. These are the people who had taken up arms on behalf of (CPM functionary) Anuj Pandey last year and now they have come back with him, said villager Ramesh Mahato.        
	The villagers now fear another confrontation with the Maoists and a bloodbath in the near future.        
	The CPM cadres have brought with them a huge cache of arms, said Durga Mahato, a villager.        
	The CPM activists sounded aggressive today.         
	Purna Chandra Mahato, the deputy chief of the CPM-led Dharampur gram panchayat, made it clear that the humiliation suffered at the hands of the Maoists and the Peoples Committee a year ago was still raw in our minds.        
	We will not easily forget the circumstances under which we had to run away from the village. Now, our main task is to identify the villagers who had sided with the Maoists. We will punish them, Purna said, smoking a cigarette.         
	Purna supervised the cleaning of the party and panchayat offices that were opened today after a year.        
	Preparations were on to set up a barbed-wire fence around the party office. Work has started to erect concrete pillars for the fencing.        
	Today, CPM activists also returned to the neighbouring Bamal and Jeerapara villages.         
	Pandey, who held meetings at the villages today, refused to meet this correspondent.        
	Purna said party activists would now gradually recapture Ramgarh and other parts of Lalgarh.        
	The Maoists put up posters against me. They burnt down my house and threatened to kill me. I have not yet brought back my family to Dharampur. I will have to repair my house first. Now it is our turn. We will have to get even with them, Purna said.        
	The Maoists, backed by activists of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, had attacked Dharampur village on the night of June 13, 2009. The rebels defeated the CPM activists in a gun battle. The CPM activists and officials, including Pandey, fled the village the next day.         
	Pandeys house and the CPM party office were vandalised by villagers, egged on by the Maoists.

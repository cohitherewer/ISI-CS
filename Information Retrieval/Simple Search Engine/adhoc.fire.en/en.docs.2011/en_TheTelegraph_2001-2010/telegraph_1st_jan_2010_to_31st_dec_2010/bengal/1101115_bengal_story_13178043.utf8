          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 14: Maya Ray, Siddhartha Shankar Rays widow, has invited Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee among others to the late Congress leaders shradh on Tuesday.         
	Maya has also invited governor M.K. Narayanan, CPM state secretary Biman Bose, former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and state Congress chief Manas Bhuniya to the programme at the Rays Beltala residence. Ray, the last Congress chief minister of Bengal, died on Saturday following renal failure.        
	Rays confidential assistant Manoj Kabiraj today went to Alimuddin Street, Trinamul Bhavan and the offices of Left Front partners to invite the leaders. Several Front leaders other than Bhattacharjee and Bose have been invited to the shradh. Junior Union ministers belonging to the Trinamul Congress have also been called.        
	Rays relatives today called on Narayanan at Raj Bhavan and handed him the invitation.        
	Mamata last night visited Maya after wrapping up her Rajarhat rally. Maya, it is learnt, has requested Mamata to oversee the shradh arrangements with her aides.         
	Invites have been sent to all those who had either visited Rays residence to pay homage after his death or placed wreaths on the body during his last journey, said Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi. I feel everybody should attend the shradh rising above politics, he added.        
	Maya and other family members of Ray requested near and dear ones through an advertisement published in several leading dailies today to attend the shradh.        
	The state Congress will organise a condolence meeting at Calcutta Universitys institute hall on November 21. Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is scheduled to preside over the event.

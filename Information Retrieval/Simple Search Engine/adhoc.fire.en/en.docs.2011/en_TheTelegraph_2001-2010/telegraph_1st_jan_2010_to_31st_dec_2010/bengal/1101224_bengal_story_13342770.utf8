          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Nigal at the Burdwan hospital. (Mousumi Mukherjee)                                   
	Burdwan,Dec. 23: A Trinamul Chhatra Parishad activist was stabbed by alleged SFI supporters following an altercation between the rival unions just before an election at a Burdwan college this morning. Trinamul activists, however, did not retaliate after the attack, college sources said.         
	Saikat Nigal, 24, who passed out of Rainas Shyamsundar College  the site of todays incident  last year, was stabbed in the stomach. He was taken to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical. Later in the day, he was shifted to Calcuttas SSKM Hospital.         
	Elections today took place in six Burdwan colleges but the spotlight was on Shyamsundar College as the zilla parishad sabhadhipati, the CPMs Uday Sarkar, lives a kilometre from the institution.         
	The TMCP and the SFI had set up enquiry booths near the college this morning. The supporters and candidates at the booths, 500 metres apart, had been hurling abuses at each other since the morning, the college sources said.         
	But an hour before the 10am elections, a group of outsiders arrived at the SFI booth and instigated the supporters to attack the rivals, the sources said. Around 25 SFI activists attacked the TMCP booth and beat up the rival union members with rods and sticks.         
	Caught unawares, the TMCP supporters and candidates started running helter-skelter. In the commotion, some TMCP supporters noticed Nigal, a graduate, lying on the ground and crying that he had been stabbed.         
	Polling, however, started according to schedule. A huge police team was deployed at the college. The voting ended at 4pm without any other untoward incident. In the evening, Trinamul was declared the winner.         
	Debashis Sarkar, the additional superintendent of police (headquarters), said: We are yet to receive a complaint.        
	SFIs district secretary Arindam Chakraborty denied Nigal had been stabbed. TMCP activists taunted 10 of our supporters. Saikat and his aides snatched their ID cards. However, when local residents protested, the TMCP activists fled. While fleeing, Saikat fell on the ground and a brick pierced his stomach. SFI supporters did not stab him, Chakraborty said.        
	TMCP district president Nurul Hasan said the SFI activists attacked our supporters without provocation.

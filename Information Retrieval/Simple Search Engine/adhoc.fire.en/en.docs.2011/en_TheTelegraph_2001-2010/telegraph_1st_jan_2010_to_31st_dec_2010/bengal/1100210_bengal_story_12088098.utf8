	Calcutta, Feb. 9: The elections to the board of the Tamluk-Ghatal Co-operative Bank were nullified after the Left alleged the Trinamul Congress rigged the poll and won last August. The deputy registrar of state co-operative societies said over 40 per cent of the ballots were found invalid. He has ordered fresh elections.

	Howrah, April 7: A youth from Howrah died after he was allegedly thrown off a running train by a ticket checker in the early hours today.        
	The checker grabbed Sheikh Firoz, 25, by the collar, kicked him and took him to another compartment of the Chambal Express around 3am, four of Firozs colleagues at a company in Jhansi who were travelling with him told police. Sheikh Zulfikar, one of the complainants, said they followed the ticket checker and found him alone in the compartment. He told them Firoz had escaped. But calls to Firozs cellphone went unanswered.         
	The police found Firozs body near the tracks in Bihars Sasaram this morning.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hill Union territory plan
          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Centre is considering granting Union territory status to the Darjeeling hills on the lines of the Delhi model after the expiry of the proposed interim authoritys tenure.         
	The term of the interim authority, according to the Centres proposal, ends on December 31, 2011.         
	The Centre is trying to find a permanent solution to the statehood problem, particularly with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha unwilling to accept an extension in the proposed authoritys term.         
	The Centre feels there is little possibility of the Bengal government agreeing to the Morcha demand for additional territory  the party wants the Dooars and the Terai besides the Darjeeling hills  or statehood.         
	Granting Union territory status to the hills is being seen as a face-saver for the stakeholders with all sides compromising on their stand on additional territory, officials in New Delhi said.         
	The proposed plan, based largely on the National Capital Territory model of Delhi, will offer an elected Assembly with sizeable legislative powers to the hills. At present, only two of the seven Union territories  Delhi and Puducherry  have elected legislative Assemblies.         
	The Centre wants the Bengal governor to play the role of the lieutenant governor.         
	However the Centres plan needs to cross several hurdles, including convincing the new government at Writers Building after the Assembly polls next year.

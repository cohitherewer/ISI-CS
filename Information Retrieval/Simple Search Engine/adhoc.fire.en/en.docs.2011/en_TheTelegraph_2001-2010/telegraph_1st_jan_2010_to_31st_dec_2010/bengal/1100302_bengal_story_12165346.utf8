The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Halim farewell to polls for health
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Halim farewell to polls for health
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Calcutta, March 1: Hashim Abdul Halim, the Bengal Assembly Speaker for 28 years, reportedly said today that he would not contest elections any more because of his failing health.        
	Halim (picture beside), 76, who is the longest-serving Speaker in the country, spoke about his intention to stay away from elections at an all-party meeting in his Assembly chamber.        
	Halim sahab told representatives from the mainline political parties today that he would not contest elections any more on health grounds, said Syed Mohammed Masih, the government chief whip in the House.        
	On February 6, Halim was admitted to a hospital in Singapore, where he had gone for work, after he complained of respiratory distress.        
	He (Halim) told us to help him effectively manage the House by not being unruly and pleaded (with us to keep in mind) his ailing health. He said he would be able to attend three more sessions of the House, including the next years budget session. After that, he would retire and not contest any elections, said a Trinamul legislator who attended the meeting.         
	Both Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, and Congress party leader Manas Bhuniya urged him to contest the 2011 Assembly polls.        
	Halim is trying to skip next years Assembly polls fearing that the CPM, which has seen successive poll debacles, would be routed in the Assembly elections, said a Trinamul MLA.         
	When contacted, Halim said he would make an announcement on not contesting elections at a news conference tomorrow morning. It is true that I have not been keeping well. But whatever I have to say on staying away from the elections, I shall announce tomorrow, he said.

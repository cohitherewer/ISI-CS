	June 15: The Howrah-bound Amritsar Mail was today stopped barely 50 metres from potential disaster after a track inspector detected a fracture about 100km from Calcutta.        
	An alarm rang out on the train drivers wireless set and he slammed the brake.         
	A welded stretch of the track had developed a six-inch crack which, experts said, could have thrown the train off. The railways has ordered an inquiry and announced a Rs 3,000 reward for Rashid Khan, who spotted the crack between Burdwan and Gangpur stations.        
	Had the crack not been detected, there could have been a major mishap, said Manoranjan Bayen, the Gangpur stationmaster.         
	The railways ruled out sabotage, something that had caused the Jnaneswari Express to jump rails on May 28.        
	Usually, a railway track is about 40ft long and attached to another track with help of a bar called fishplate. However, in certain stretches, three such tracks are welded together to form a 120ft rail. This helps increase the speed of a train and reduce jerks, said a railway official.         
	Such a welded portion had come off this morning. This type of a fracture is rare and can lead to derailment. It indicates poor track maintenance, a Railway Board member admitted from Delhi.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, June 17: Santiniketan is emerging from romanticism to face the realities of hard economics.        
	Visva-Bharati has raised the fees for its 7,500 undergraduate and postgraduate students after three decades, the fivefold-to-sixfold hike drawing protests from the students.        
	The new fees come into effect from the academic session that begins after the summer vacation ends this month.        
	The tuition fee for undergraduate day scholars has been raised from Rs 18 a month to Rs 100, and that for postgraduate students from Rs 20 to Rs 120. Residential students belonging to both categories, who now pay Rs 600 as combined tuition and accommodation fees, will have to shell out Rs 3,000.        
	While the number of day scholars is 5,500, that of boarders is 2,000.        
	The principals of the universitys eight undergraduate wings met yesterday afternoon and decided to raise the fees.         
	University public relations officer Amitabha Chowdhury said the move was aimed at generating funds required to meet various expenditures.        
	We had written to the UGC (University Grants Commission) in March requesting it to release Rs 13 crore towards miscellaneous expenses such as renovation of hostels and maintenance of the Pearson Memorial Hospital. But in May, the UGC informed us it would give us only Rs 4.5 crore. So we have decided to increase the tuition fees to generate the funds on our own, he said.        
	Over 50 students today gathered at varsity registrar Mani Mukut Mitras chamber to lodge a protest. They handed him a memorandum urging the authorities not to hike the tuition fees considering the effect on the poorer students.        
	A good many of the poorer students, particularly boarders, will find it difficult to carry on with their studies if the tuition and accommodation fees are increased to Rs 3,000, said an undergraduate student.        
	A postgraduate student, whose father is a day labourer with a monthly income of Rs 3,000, said: My parents will find it difficult to arrange Rs 120 every month for my studies.

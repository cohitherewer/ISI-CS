The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha set to be back in business
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha set to be back in business
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 4: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is scheduled to attend a big industry chamber meeting on Wednesday for the first time since 2008 when the state government burnt its fingers on Singur.         
	The chief minister will participate in an interactive session with the national council members of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Calcutta. Industrialist Adi Godrej, CII president Hari Bhartia and business leaders from several parts of the country are expected to be present.        
	Bhattacharjee used to attend many of the important annual events of local and national business chambers till 2008. But he has mostly stayed away from such meetings since being hit by successive poll debacles in the aftermath of the Singur and Nandigram anti-land acquisition movement led by Mamata Banerjee.        
	A perception then grew that Bhattacharjees pro-industrialisation policies also played a role in alienating the Left from its rural vote bank, which turned to the Trinamul Congress.         
	The chief minister skipped most of the industry body meetings in 2009 and the best part of 2010, with a few exceptions such as the inauguration of a trade fair by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	However, with the Assembly elections approaching, Bhattacharjee seems to be grabbing the opportunity the CII meet will provide to speak about the state governments industrial policies like he used to do before the Tata Nano project was hounded out of Bengal in October 2008.        
	An executive of a city-based chamber said Bhattacharjee had developed cold feet after the poll setbacks. At times, his office took a long time to respond (to invites sent by industry chambers). We had to move on, he said.        
	Industry bodies also wanted to hear new voices. The Left had almost ran out of new ideas, an industry source said.        
	After Pranab Mukherjee became Union finance minister, many industry chambers wanted him to speak at their events. Trinamul also features high on the wish-lists of chambers.

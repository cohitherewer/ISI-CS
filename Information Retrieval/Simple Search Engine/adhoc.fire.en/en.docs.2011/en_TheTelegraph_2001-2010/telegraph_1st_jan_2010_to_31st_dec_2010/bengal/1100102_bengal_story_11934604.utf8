	Domkol (Murshidabad), Jan. 1: If Katrina Kaif is playing at a tea stall near you, the classroom is not the best place to be.        
	So it is for the students of a primary school in a Murshidabad village.         
	Almost a third of the 160-odd children in the school are missing every day since a couple of nearby tea stalls put up dish antennas and started beaming Hindi film channels to draw customers.        
	At Jotekanai village, about 300km from Calcutta, only the bazaar area has power and not many children, mostly from impoverished day labourers homes, can imagine a television set at home.        
	On an average, 50 of the 161 students skip classes daily. When we enquired about it, the parents told us that the children left home for school around 10.30am every day and returned only around 4.30pm. We probed the absence and found that they spent the entire day watching movies, said headmaster Sudhakar Mondal.        
	The teachers have lodged a complaint with the block development officer and the local school inspector about the tea stalls.        
	Ramzan Sheikh, whose daughter Champa is in Class III, said the four tea stalls in the bazaar started showing films on TV about two months ago. Most of us in this village are small farmers and labourers and we dont get the time to keep track of our children during the day. We took it for granted that our children were going to school, he said.         
	Jotekanai, a small village of about 2,000 people, has only seven who have passed Madhyamik. Most of the villagers are either dropouts at the primary level or have never been to school.         
	Champas classmate Habiba Khatoon said she bunked classes only if a Katrina Kaif-starrer was being shown. If she is not there, I go to school, said Habiba.        
	A stall next to Tafajuddin Sheikhs was the first to install a television set and a small dish antenna two months ago. I found people crowding there. So, I too bought a TV and my clientele grew, said Tafajuddin.        
	The other tea stalls played catching up. Now, they have VCD players, too.        
	A villager, Namazi Sheikh, said: In our area, there will be no more than a dozen TV sets. Only the traders in the bazaar have them.         
	Compared with the allure on the screen, the midday meals in school are ordinary. Teachers said the meals had been successful in drawing the children to school until being pitted against Bollywood.        
	Block development officer Avijit Sengupta said that after receiving the complaint he had asked the chief of the local Dhulauri gram panchayat to ensure that the children went to school. We cant take any direct action against the tea stalls as they are doing nothing illegal, he added.        
	Panchayat chief Esrafil Sheikh said he had convened a meeting with the tea stall owners and other villagers last week and asked them to keep the TVs switched off from 11am to 4pm.        
	The result will be known once classes resume next week after the Christmas break.

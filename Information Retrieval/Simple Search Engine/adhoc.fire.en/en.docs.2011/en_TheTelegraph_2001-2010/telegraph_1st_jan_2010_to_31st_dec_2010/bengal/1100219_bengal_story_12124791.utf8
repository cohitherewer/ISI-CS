          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Kushbani (West Midnapore), Feb. 18: Two improvised explosive devices left behind by the Maoists after the attack on the Shilda camp have been lying in the middle of an arterial road near Jhargram for the last three days because of a dispute between two police stations over jurisdiction of the area.         
	The IEDs have been disrupting traffic and halting police patrolling with the personnel at both the Binpur and Jamboni police stations claiming that the area where the explosive had been planted did not fall within their jurisdiction.         
	These IEDs, along with a banner which says Caution: mines planted here, do not proceed has been placed near the area where the Maoists had burnt two pick-up vans they had used to carry their weapons. The attackers had crossed over to Jharkhand after the massacre. The area falls between the Binpur and Jamboni police stations.        
	The spot does not fall under our jurisdiction, said Aloke Ranjan Munshi, the inspector-in-charge of Jamboni police station. I had informed Binpur police station on the first day itself, immediately after we heard about the IEDs. Now it is their responsibility to defuse the IEDs and remove the two cans.        
	Munshi said he had not reported the matter to West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma because the area does not fall under our jurisdiction.         
	His Binpur counterpart, Zulfiquar Ali Mollah, had pretty much the same thing to say.        
	We have examined the spot where the IEDs have been planted, Mollah said. The area is supposed to be looked after by the neighbouring Jamboni police station. We have informed them about it.        
	Police sources said neither police station wanted to take the hassle of informing the top brass and asking the bomb disposal squad to defuse the IEDs.        
	Locals, however, continued to suffer.        
	My son suffered burn injuries while playing near the oven at home. I had to carry him on my shoulder and walk 13km to the Jhargram sub-divisional hospital. All public transport has been suspended here since the explosives were planted, said Manoranjan Hembram, a resident of Jamda.

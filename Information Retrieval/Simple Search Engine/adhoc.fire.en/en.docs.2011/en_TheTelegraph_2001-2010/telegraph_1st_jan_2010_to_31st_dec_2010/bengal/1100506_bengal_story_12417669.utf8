                                                  Painter probe
                            
	Calcutta, May 5: The government has ordered an inquiry following a complaint against painter Suvaprasanna, his wife Shipra Bhattacharya and two others for allegedly filling up a canal in South 24-Parganas Bhangar.        
	Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said they had bought around four acres from farmers to build a centre for arts. But a resident had complained that the promoters had filled up a canal and added two acres to the plot.         
	Suvaprasanna said: The entire thing is politically motivated.

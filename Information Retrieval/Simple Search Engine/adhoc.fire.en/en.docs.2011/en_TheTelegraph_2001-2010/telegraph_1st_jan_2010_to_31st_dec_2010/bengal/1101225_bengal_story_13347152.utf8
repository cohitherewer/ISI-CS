The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM rues absence of consensus on industry
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM rues absence of consensus on industry
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Dec. 24: The absence of a consensus among political parties on industrialisation is stalling the states development, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at the opening of the Industrial India Trade Fair today.         
	Every political party has its own ideology. But when it comes to industrialisation and development, all the parties cooperate like in Gujarat and Maharashtra. But unfortunately, in this part of the country, the Opposition is opposing everything, the chief minister said on the Milan Mela grounds.        
	Although Bhattacharjee did not mention the Singur episode, he could have been referring to the exit of the Tata Nano project from Bengal in the face of sustained protests by Mamata Banerjee. The BJP governments in Gujarat and Karnataka, and the Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra had rolled out the red carpet for the Tata project with support from the Opposition. The Tatas chose Gujarat.        
	Rajarhat and a power project in Burdwan are among the other plans hit by Opposition protests. Mamata has alleged that the Left Front government forcibly acquired land from farmers for the New Town project in Rajarhat.         
	The power plant project in Burdwans Katwa is yet to take off as the state government failed to acquire the entire land required for the unit because of protests led by Trinamul.        
	Bhattacharjee said today that he was trying in my own way to reach a consensus on the fact that Bengal needs industries. He said the government and the Opposition needed to join hand on development.        
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee said his party was not opposed to industrialisation. He blamed the state government of not creating a congenial atmosphere for work.         
	The chief minister also spoke on the 2G spectrum controversy at Milan Mela. I personally believe that the Prime Minister is an honest man.... But something is seriously wrong in our system, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Anger over locked Queens terrace
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Anger over locked Queens terrace
          POULOMI BANERJEE                              
	Calcutta, March 27: Queens Mansion residents erupted in anger before a building inspector today and asked why the doors to their terrace had been kept locked by landlord Life Insurance Corporation of India even after an inaccessible roof was blamed for the large number of casualties in adjoining Stephen Court.         
	The building inspector came around 2pm and asked us about the kind of electricity we use, said Charles Mantosh, the president of the tenants association. The tenants asked him why the gates to their terrace were kept locked even after the death of so many people next door.        
	The inspector, Mantosh said, got irritated and told the tenants that the zonal manager of the LIC had instructed that the doors be kept locked because the lift rooms were on the terrace. One tenant suggested that at least the keys be kept near the doors. At this, the inspector said he hoped there was a fire at Queens Mansion and the people died or left, Mantosh alleged.         
	The building inspectors purported comments led to a more heated altercation and police had to be called in. They opened the gates to the Block I terrace, Mantosh said.        
	Residents said the doors to the terrace were locked after the lifts were installed a few years ago. Earlier, there used to be stairs leading to the terrace from my flat. But they have been sealed, said Madhu Khanna, a resident.         
	The current stairs to the terrace in Block I are more of a metal ladder. The steps are narrow and steep and without a proper handrail. I cant climb these stairs. I am so nervous ever since the fire at Stephen Court. What will we do if something similar happens here? Khanna asked.         
	The doors to the terraces in the other blocks of the building, one of which houses Leander Paess mother Jennifer, are still locked.

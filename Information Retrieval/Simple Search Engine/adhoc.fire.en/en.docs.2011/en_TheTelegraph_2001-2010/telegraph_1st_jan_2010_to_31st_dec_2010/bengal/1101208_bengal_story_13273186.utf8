The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | No-ban logic to attend rally
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      No-ban logic to attend rally

	Midnapore, Dec. 7: Supporters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCPA) today attended a Trinamul rally bearing their flags and banners, the first such open participation by the Maoist-backed outfit at a party gathering.        
	Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari addressed the meeting in West Midnapores Chandri village, a CPM stronghold where a makeshift lectern had to be ferried to the venue because no decorator dared to offer one.        
	Adhikari admitted PCPA members had showed up but sought to justify their presence by arguing that the outfit is not banned and has been fighting for change.        
	Only yesterday, Calcutta High Court had directed the state government to file an affidavit stating whether the PCPA was being treated as a banned organisation under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.        
	PCPA supporters had attended the August 9 rally of Mamata Banerjee but without their flags and other tokens of identity.         
	The CPM said the presence of PCPA backers at Adhikaris rally was another proof that Trinamul was in league with the rebels. We had known all along that Trinamul was encouraging the Maoists to carry out killings (of CPM leaders). This has been amply proved today, district secretariat member Dahareswar Sen said.        
	Adhikari said he would ask the PCPA to stay away from Trinamul rallies only if the state clamped a formal ban. They are not a banned organisation. But if the government declares that they are a banned outfit, I will tell their leaders not to send their members to our meetings.         
	But the CPMs Sen pointed to the alleged role of the PCPA members in the Jnaneswari Express sabotage, which killed 160 passengers, in May this year to argue that Trinamul held a meeting with such elements. The meeting dispersed early after bombs, allegedly planted by CPM supporters, went off on the edge of the Chandri village. We had said that the CPMs armed goons would try to disrupt the meeting, Adhikari said.

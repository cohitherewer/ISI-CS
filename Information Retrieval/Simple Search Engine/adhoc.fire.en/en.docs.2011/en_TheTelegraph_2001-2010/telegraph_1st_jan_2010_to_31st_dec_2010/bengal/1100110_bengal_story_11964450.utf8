	Calcutta, Jan. 9: A youth today snatched Rs 13,000 from a woman inside a bank in Behala and escaped when no guard was manning the gate.        
	Police said 53-year-old Arati Mukherjee had withdrawn Rs 50,000 from the Behala branch of Allahabad Bank and was counting the currency notes when the youth, posing as a customer, snatched one bundle of cash and ran out.        
	Suddenly a youth, who was also inside the bank posing as a client, snatched a bundle and escaped, said S. K. Chaudhury, additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas.        
	Branch manager Swapan Moitra said: I was inside my chamber when the incident occurred. I will inform my superiors.

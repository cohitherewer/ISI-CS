The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Centre told to pay for BSF torture
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Centre told to pay for BSF torture
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The National Human Rights Commiss- ion has told the Union home ministry to pay Rs 5 lakh to the family of a South Dinajpur boy who died after BSF soldiers tortured him in 2007.        
	The rights panel has also asked the ministry to give Rs 50,000 each to the three others in Masud Rana Sarkars family who were assaulted.         
	The Asian Centre for Human Rights filed the complaint on behalf of the family on March 20, 2007, a fortnight after 19-year-old Masud was thrashed in his house.        
	On March 4 that year, two groups from the villages of Palipara and Nadipara clashed over sharing of irrigation water. The losing side sought the intervention of BSF personnel in the area. But instead of trying to resolve the dispute peacefully, around 20 BSF personnel went to the village of Baudpur, whose residents had nothing to do with the row, and raided Masuds house.         
	His father Latifur, mother Mazeda Bibi and sister Fenciara Begum were also tortured by the personnel, who were allegedly drunk and were armed with guns and lathis.         
	All four were admitted to the Balurghat district hospital, from where Masud and Latifur were taken to North Bengal Medical College Hospital in Siliguri the next day. Masud, a first-year student of Balurghat College, died on the night of March 5.         
	The general security force court, which conducted an internal inquiry in the BSF, exonerated all five accused jawans.         
	The BSF chief had requested the NHRC to close the case without providing reasons on how they were let off.

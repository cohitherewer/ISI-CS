                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rebel-hit rail zone threatens to cancel trains
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, April 22: South Eastern Railway has told the state government that it will slow down or selectively cancel trains if security of railway tracks and bridges in Maoist-hit areas of Bengal was not stepped up.        
	A.P. Mishra, the rail zones general manager, has written to chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, requesting for more security.         
	The letter has been addressed to the chief secretaries of Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa, where services have been hit by Maoist violence. The rebels are also damaging railway property, a railway official said today.         
	Mishra said in the letter that the security of railway tracks and bridges are state subjects. The general manager has requested the state governments to alert all the police stations in Maoist-affected areas and arrange for extra vigilance to prevent sabotage, the official added.        
	A spurt in Maoist violence has hit train services on South Eastern Railway routes.         
	Last month, a blast triggered by the Maoists damaged a railway line in West Midnapore and prompted the suspension of service on the Adra-Midnapore section for about 10 hours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hill deal at next meet, says Gurung
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hill deal at next meet, says Gurung
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, Oct. 24: Bimal Gurung today told his supporters in Mirik that the interim set-up could be finalised at the next political-level meeting to be held in a few days, triggering speculation that backstage negotiations might be on.         
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha presidents statement has created a flutter in the hills because it was thought that quite a few political-level meetings would be needed to thrash out the contentious issues related to the set-up.         
	Addressing a crowd at the tourist festival going on in Mirik, 45km from Darjeeling, Gurung said: The interim set-up will be finalised at the first political meeting (after October 11) itself. If not the first, I am confident that the settlement will be signed at the second meeting.         
	During the October 11 talks in Delhi, representatives of the state government, Centre and the Morcha were of the opinion that all that could be discussed at the bureaucratic level had been done. They also decided that they did not have the mandate to take decisions on some issues, which they kept aside for the political round of talks.         
	The issues include the territorial jurisdiction of the new body, the mode of selection of the members of the interim council, the transfer of the tauzi department which keeps land records of the tea gardens, and the legislative powers to be conferred on the new body.         
	Gurungs claim that a settlement could be inked at the next meeting itself has raised speculation that perhaps backstage negotiations are under way to settle these contentious issues.         
	The issues which have not yet been settled are touchy. However, Gurungs claim suggests possible backstage negotiations between the three parties involved in the talks, said an observer.         
	The Morcha president is also confident that the interim authority will be a nominated body.         
	His claim is surprising as both the Centre and the state wants it to be an elected body. A nominated body cannot exercise legislative authority, an administrative official had said.

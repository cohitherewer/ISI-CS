The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata blow to monitor
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata blow to monitor
                            
	Calcutta, June 16: The Trinamul Congress will not attend a meeting on the formation of a panel to monitor unwarranted political influence on police.        
	Following a Supreme Court order, the State Security Commission is already in place in several states. But in Bengal it is likely to be a non-starter.        
	As the states leader of the Opposition, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee is a member of the panel but he will not attend tomorrows meeting. It is his partys policy not to participate in any state government activity. But since the panel is meant to look into an aspect ab- out which Mamata Banerjee has a constant grouse, many had hoped for an exception.        
	Chatterjee said the CPM-led government does not have the mandate to form the panel at this juncture. The court directive came four years ago. But the government had been sleeping, he added.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Nurse axed for cutting baby finger
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, March 20: A nurse who had accidentally cut off a portion of a 28-day-old girls finger while allegedly speaking to her boyfriend over the cellphone was sacked today for negligence.        
	We have sacked Shampa Saha for gross negligence in duty, said Apurba Ghosh, director of the Institute of Child Health in Park Circus .         
	The child had been admitted to the hospital on March 6 with respiratory problems. Saha had accidentally snipped off a portion of the little finger of the babys right hand while cutting a bandage. The baby had to be given blood after the incident.        
	The director told us that the nurse was speaking on her cellphone to her boyfriend, said Nandita Roy, the babys aunt. But Ghosh said that an inquiry conducted by the hospital did not find any concrete evidence of this.         
	Our doctors and nurses are not allowed to speak on cellphones inside the wards while attending to babies, Ghosh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Salim hole in vote list, CPM sobs
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Salim hole in vote list, CPM sobs
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                          Mohammad Salim                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 4: The names of former CPM MP Mohammad Salim and his wife do not figure on the draft voter list for Bengal, the omission prompting a refrain more familiar on Opposition lips but with an ironical twist for the Left.        
	The CPM has alleged an abnormally high increase in the number of names on the draft voter list for the 2011 Assembly polls  an insinuation of manipulation of the rolls that has long been the pet theme of the Trinamul Congress. Before all major elections in the past several years, the Opposition had accused the CPM of using its election machinery to manoeuvre poll lists.         
	If inclusion is bothering the CPM, omission is no less an irritant. The names of Salim, a CPM central committee member, and his wife Rosina Khatun do not find mention on the draft voter list prepared by the Election Commission. Salim has lodged a complaint with the poll panel. After delimitation, Salim and Rosina, a doctor, have become voters of the Calcutta Port constituency.        
	Salim, who was a Rajya Sabha MP in the mid-1990s and later held the post of the state minority affairs minister, told The Telegraph: Our party had sought the Election Commissions intervention to ensure that the electoral rolls were not falsified and genuine names were not deleted. Even after this, I find that my name and that of my wife have been struck off the rolls.        
	I have been an MP in both the Houses of Parliament. I have also been a minister once. If such a thing can happen to me, imagine the fate of (ordinary) people.        
	Last week, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury had met Election Commission representatives in Delhi and complained that gross attempts were being made to bypass poll panel stipulations for addition of names in the voter list for Bengal. He told the commission the net addition of names was abnormally high compared with the figures from the past four years.         
	There has been an addition of around 33 lakh names to the draft electoral rolls for next years Assembly elections. The number of voters has gone up to 5.49 crore, an increase of 6.4 per cent over the Lok Sabha polls of 2009.         
	For three years since 2006, the voter list had grown by 1.83 per cent, 2.38 per cent and 1.45 per cent respectively.         
	A CPM state secretariat member alleged the sudden increase this time was a clear indication that some manipulation has occurred.         
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee rubbished the allegation. Youths are coming in droves to get their names enrolled on the voter list. Thats why the CPM has got jittery.

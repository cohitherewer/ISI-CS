The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Potato claims farmer
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Potato claims farmer
          INDRANIL SARKAR                              
	Kalna (Burdwan), April 10: A farmer allegedly drank the pesticide he had bought for his large potato produce, unable to cope with the distress sale of the crop following bumper production across Bengal and his inability to repay debts.        
	In a Burdwan village about 160km from Calcutta, Ramkrishna Ghosh, 42, had borrowed around Rs 1 lakh and bought pesticides and fertilisers for his crop on credit. But his crop was selling at Rs 1.5 a kilo.        
	He would have had to sell at Rs 3 a kilo to break even.        
	An agriculture department official said potato yield across the state this year had gone up from around 70 lakh tonnes last year to 94 lakh tonnes this year.        
	Potatoes sold for over Rs 20 a kilo last year. But farmers apparently did not realise that the prices were driven by low availability after a fungal destroyed 40 per cent of the produce.         
	They cultivated potatoes wherever they could this year hoping to make a kill. But the leap in yield has pulled down prices alarmingly.         
	Bengal consumes only 60 lakh tonnes of potato in a year and the government is unsure of how to market the excess.        
	The agriculture minister blamed farmers for their plight. We have repeatedly told them not to cultivate only potato on their land. Whenever there is a bumper crop, what follows is distress sale. So, we have been organising awareness camps and asking farmers to grow cash crops like pulses and oil seeds. But they dont listen, Naren De said.        
	An official of his department said the state had sought the Centres permission to export 9.5 lakh tonnes of potato to the south-east Asian countries and Sri Lanka. But no one knows what to do with the lakhs of tonnes of potatoes that would still remain.        
	At Barua village, Ramkrishna had told his wife Dolly about his worries.         
	She said her husband had grown potatoes in the three acres he owned and the five acres where he worked as a sharecropper.         
	Last year, Ramkrishna had grown potatoes on only three acres and sold them for up to Rs 5 a kilo. This year, he had produced over a lakh kilos of potato.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Some of the cows in the field in Kolaghat on Tuesday. (Jahangir Badsa)                                  
	Tamluk, July 7: Kolaghat cops were literally on the horns of a dilemma: how to protect cows.        
	Fifty-eight cows seized while being smuggled were kept in a field for two days without food and water as a result of which five died. The police say they did not know what to do with the animals.        
	The police had intercepted a truck crammed with the cows on Sunday afternoon near Kolaghat bridge. The driver and four other persons accompanying him were arrested after they failed to produce valid papers.        
	However, the police were soon in a quandary over where to keep the animals.        
	Ashok Biswas, the East Midnapore superintendent of police (SP), said he had contacted the district magistrate. The district magistrate told us there were no cattle pounds in the district. He said it was not possible to arrange for a place to keep so many cows at such a short notice, Biswas said.        
	The cops said they were left with no option but to keep the cows in a field adjacent to Kolaghat police station.        
	The five accused, who the cops said were smuggling the cows from Orissas Baleswar to Bangladesh, have been remanded in 14 days police custody. The police said the five had told them they had not fed the cows for a couple of days, which meant the animals had starved for four days.        
	The police had also sought permission from the block development officer to auction the cows. But I refused because the matter was sub judice, said BDO Sudipto Chakraborty.         
	The police claimed they did not know what to feed the animals with. Two cows died on Monday night and three more on Tuesday.         
	SP Biswas said the police were helpless. We searched for a cattle pound but could not find one. That is why the cows were kept in the open. Moreover, the police are not experienced in handling cows. We did not know how to arrange for fodder, he said.        
	The deaths sparked a protest in the locality. Around 100 people demonstrated in front of the police station yesterday, demanding that the cows be taken to a place where proper care would be taken.         
	For two days, we have been watching the cows die one after the other, said Prasanta Maity, 35, the owner of a stationery shop.        
	Finally, the police arranged for a cow shed in Uluberia and sent the animals there yesterday.        
	Nabakumar Sarkar, a veterinarian in Kolaghat, said: It appears that the cows died because they were neglected and did not get adequate food or water.

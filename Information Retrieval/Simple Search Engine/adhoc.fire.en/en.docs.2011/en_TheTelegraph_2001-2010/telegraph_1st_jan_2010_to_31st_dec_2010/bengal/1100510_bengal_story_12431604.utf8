	New Delhi, May 9: Tagore the painter has made it to the nations capital, but it has taken 80 years and a Prime Minister to launch him.        
	Manmohan Singh today became a rare Indian Premier  and perhaps economist  to open an art exhibition but, as he jotted down in the National Gallery of Modern Art visitors book, he was honoured to do so for one of the worlds foremost cultural personalities.        
	Old-timers at the gallery, hosting The Masters Strokes: Art of Rabindranath Tagore to mark the start of the icons 150-year celebrations, said Indira Gandhi had been the last Prime Minister to open a painting exhibition there.        
	Soniaji visited a couple of times. But as a Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh is only next to Indira Gandhi to have come here, an official said.        
	Tagore, more a revered Gurudev than a restless ge-nius to Indian officialdom, would have let out a soft chuckle to learn that this is the first major display of his paintings outside Calcutta or Santiniketan. His first was held in 1930  at the Mecca of painters, Paris  with Calcutta taking a further year to come into the picture.        
	As Singh explained, Tagore had won worldwide acclaim as a poet, writer, educationist and composer but his genius with the brush was not as well-known (outside Bengal), perhaps because he began painting when he was well into his 60s.         
	Tagore had no formal training in art, yet, through his own efforts, he developed a highly imaginative and spontaneous visual vocabulary, Singh said. What began as a poet subconsciously joining his erasures, over-writings, corrections and doodles gradually materialised into a unique form of art. Rabindranath came to enjoy his efforts and found painting to be another expressive medium of his restless, creative mind.        
	Singh said the culture ministry was working with Visva-Bharati and the National Gallery of Modern Art to organise a Tagore exhibition next year in Paris, the very city where he displayed his art for the first time before a discerning and appreciative audience.        
	The culture ministry plans to translate Tagores works in various Indian and, if possible, foreign languages.        
	The Prime Minister has advised us to translate his creations to reach out to the modern generation, nationally and internationally, culture secretary Jawhar Sircar said.        
	The gallery is showcasing some of Tagores best works: heads, masks, mystic landscapes and whimsical birds and flowers. Rare photographs detailing his life and work are also on display.

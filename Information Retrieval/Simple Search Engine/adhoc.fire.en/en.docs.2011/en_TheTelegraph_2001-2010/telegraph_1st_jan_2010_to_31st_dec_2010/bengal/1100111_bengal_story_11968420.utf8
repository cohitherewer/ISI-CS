	Balurghat (South Dinajpur), Jan. 10: A young man from Bangladesh has virtually courted arrest so he can get free treatment for a brain tumour.        
	Ariful Islam, 24, who had allegedly crossed over to India illegally because his family could not afford treatment, was picked up last evening while roaming aimlessly at Balurghat station.         
	Queried, he said he was trying to work out how to get arrested. The police found on him Rs 2,300 in Indian currency and medical test reports, including a CT scan done at Dhaka Medical College.        
	The police said Ariful claimed to be a third-year arts student of Rajshahi University and said he lived at Kendua Byaparitola in Bangladeshs Dinajpur district.         
	The inspector in charge of Balurghat police station, Dhiman Sarkar, said he had been arrested for entering India without travel documents. Ariful told us he had sneaked into South Dinajpur through the border at Hili, Sarkar said.        
	Ariful managed to give the BSF the slip at the unfenced border and travelled 26km from Hili to reach Balurghat.         
	At the police station, he said: I was roaming around, wondering how to give myself up. I wanted to be noticed and I was relieved when the police caught hold of me. But now, strangely, I am feeling scared.        
	If an undertrial reports sick in an Indian jail, he is given free medical attention.        
	Police sources said courts usually sentenced infiltrators to a jail term of three months. However, sometimes years pass before these people can be sent back to Bangladesh.        
	In Dhaka, doctors had told Ariful that surgery to remove his tumour would cost around 2 lakh takas (Rs 1.32 lakh), an expense far beyond his farmer fathers means. I was told by the doctors at Dhaka Medical College that it would take around 2 lakh takas to get the tumour removed. I am fairly good in studies and I dont want to die a lingering death, Ariful said.        
	He was produced in court today and remanded in jail custody till January 22.        
	Jails and social welfare minister Biswanath Chowdhury, who is from South Dinajpur, said: There are medical facilities that jail inmates are entitled to, whether they are Indians or foreigners.

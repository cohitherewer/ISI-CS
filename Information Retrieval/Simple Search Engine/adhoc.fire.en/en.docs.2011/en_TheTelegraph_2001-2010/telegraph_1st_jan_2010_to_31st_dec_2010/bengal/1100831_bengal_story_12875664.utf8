The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha 30 on CID list
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Morcha 30 on CID list
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, Aug. 30: The CID today named 30 Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders in its chargesheet for alleged involvement in the murder of Madan Tamang but left out senior leaders, including chief Bimal Gurung, who had been named in an earlier FIR.        
	The chargesheet, submitted today before a Darjeeling court, names among others Nickole Tamang, the prime accused in the murder of the ABGL leader. However, Nickole, who had escaped from CID custody on August 22, is absconding. His remand ended today but the CID failed to produce him in court.         
	Assistant public prosecutor Govind Chhetri said: The CID has said it may file a supplementary chargesheet if other names crop up during investigation.         
	This means that the senior Morcha leaders who had been named in an ABGL FIR after Madan Tamangs murder on May 21 could still be put on the list.        
	The FIR had named Gurung, his wife Asha and central committee members such as Roshan Giri, Harka Bahadur Chhetri, Pradip Pradhan and Binay Tamang for conspiring to kill Madan Tamang. However, none of them was mentioned in the CID chargesheet today. But seven other persons named in the FIR have been mentioned.         
	The chief judicial magistrate accepted the CIDs plea to to issue arrest warrants against those who have not yet been picked up.

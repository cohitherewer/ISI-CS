          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            The Telegraph photographer Amit Datta shows his bruised arm; the smashed windscreen of one of the cars carrying the journalists in Pirakata on Friday. (Picture on right by Amit Datta)                                       
	Calcutta, Sept 3: The chief minister today said he did not know of the attack on journalists at West Midnapores Pirakata but government sources said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was kept posted throughout the day on the happenings in Jungle Mahal.         
	He was also informed of the manner in which his party activists were gradually making inroads into areas over which the Maoists held sway till the other day, they added.         
	Home department officials today kept the chief minister informed about the developments in Pirakata and Lalgarh. He was also told about the police arrangements there to ensure that the villagers could return to their homes, a source said.        
	The chief minister had specifically instructed the home department to ensure that trouble or clashes did not occur. We dont know why he said he wasnt aware of the attack on journalists. Maybe, he didnt want to get into this tricky issue as it was a CPM attack, he added.        
	Echoing his boss Bhattacharjee who holds charge of police affairs also, state home secretary Samar Ghosh said: I am not aware of it (the attack).        
	An exception to the row of unaware superiors appeared to be inspector-general of police (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha.        
	The IG said: We are taking down their (journalists) complaints. Specific cases will be initiated. Steps are being taken to identify and arrest those responsible for the attack on them.        
	Journalists had also been attacked by armed CPM cadres during the November 2007 recapture of Nandigram. Artistes and eminent people had held a huge procession in Calcutta then to protest the CPM onslaught.        
	CPM state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty condemned todays attack but evaded questions on the involvement of CPM activists.        
	Theres no doubt that the incident of journalists being beaten up calls for condemnation. But I will have to check whether CPM men were involved in the attack, he said.        
	Apparently trying to defend the attackers, Chakraborty said: Actually, the ground realities will have to be understood. For the past two years, Maoists have killed hundreds of party workers, supporters and sympathisers in Jungle Mahal. Several people were forced to flee their homes in the face of rebel attacks.        
	The leader urged the media to consider the condition of those who had been hounded out of their homes and were trying to return.         
	After a long time, these affected people have now got an opportunity to go back to their villages. Many of them have developed a preference for the CPM for standing by the villagers when Maoists were killing people. They want to build a strong resistance against the Maoists. Their mood is upbeat, he said.        
	Chakraborty wondered whether the journalists were attacked by our party men or by overzealous villagers desperate to return to their homes. We will have to check with our district leaders, he added.        
	Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee condemned the attack. Whats going on in Jungle Mahal? It seems to be an Indo-Pak war! she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Adivasi Dooars talks
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Adivasi Dooars talks
                            
	Calcutta, July 1: An Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad delegation today met state chief secretary Ardhendu Sen at Writers Buildings to discuss the demand for autonomy for the Dooars but was told that only the chief minister could address such issues.         
	The Parishad said it was yet to decide whether it would accept the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas invitation for talks. The hill party has asked the tribals to join its statehood movement.         
	Although the Dooars unit of the Parishad is ready to meet the Morcha, the state leaders are still hesitant.

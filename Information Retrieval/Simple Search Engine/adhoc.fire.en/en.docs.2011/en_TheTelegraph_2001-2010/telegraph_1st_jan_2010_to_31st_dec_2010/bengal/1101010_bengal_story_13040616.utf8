	Calcutta, Oct. 9: A bomb scare at the Wipro SEZ at Salt Lake Sector V halted work for over four hours today as police and security guards evacuated employees from the offices and searched the premises but found nothing suspicious.        
	According to the police, a security guard received an anonymous call at 11.13am, saying there was a bomb on the premises. Wipro authorities immediately informed the Electronic Complex police station, which sent forces to the campus within half an hour.        
	The police and the security guards then evacuated the 1,000 employees who had reported for work today. Most of those present were BPO employees while a few belonged to Wipro Technologies.        
	We were suddenly asked to leave the building and brought to the main lawn. It was only after arriving at the lawn that we came to know there was a bomb threat, an employee of Wipro BPO said.        
	Many of the employees had initially thought that it was one of the mock drills held regularly at the office. They stayed back in the building until the police told them it was a real bomb threat.        
	A team from the bomb squad arrived around 1.15pm. The personnel searched the entire property, which includes four towers, a cafeteria, a guesthouse and some administrative buildings. A second team arrived half an hour later and joined the search.        
	There was more confusion than panic as we had no idea what was going on, an employee said.        
	The employees were not allowed to leave the premises. Those who had stepped out or had arrived after the bomb threat were not allowed to enter.              
	The police said the records at the offices main telephone database showed the last received call was at 3.24am. The database, which records only calls coming from outside, did not show the threat call made at 11.13am. Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar, said: That is why we are suspecting that the call was made by someone inside the office.         
	Wipro employees said they suspected someone from the office had played a prank.         
	The police completed the search around 5pm and declared the buildings safe. The employees then returned to their workstations.

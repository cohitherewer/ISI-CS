	Purulia, Oct. 23: Maoists have taken hostage an inspector of Bengal polices intelligence branch in Purulia, a little over a year after West Midnapore police officer Atindrnath Dutta was kidnapped by the rebels.        
	Inspector Partha Biswas, 40, who has been working in Purulia for the past two years posing as a NGO worker, was held captive last evening along with a friend, Saumajit Basu, 32, who is attached to a voluntary organisation in Hooghlys Pandua.        
	Senior officers claimed today that Biswas  the first intelligence sleuth to fall into rebel hands since the joint forces began operations last June  had not informed his immediate bosses when he went with Basu to Ayodhya Hills, the area where the duo were last seen. They are feared to have run into a group of Maoists. They were working independently and had not informed the district police, a senior officer said.        
	No clues had emerged till tonight about the duos whereabouts. But police said the Maoists called up Biswas home in North 24-Parganas Naihati, on Calcuttas fringes, this morning and told his wife Barnali that he was fine.         
	Basus wife Sankhatua  they have a two-and-half-year old son  said he had gone to catch a glimpse of the full moon last night from the scenic Purulia spot, over 300km from Calcutta, that has been the rebels hunting ground.        
	Purulia police said a rebel leader had contacted local newspersons that they had taken the two hostage but wouldnt specify what they wanted. They said they would inform the media what their demands were for their release.        
	According to senior officers, the duo had gone into the area from Borgora village near Ghatbera in the Balarampur area under the guise of salesmen. The duo probably came face to face with a group of Maoists. During conversations with them, the rebels somehow got to know that Biswas was a policeman who had been gathering information about their activities with Basu and took them into captivity, the officer said.        
	Once word reached the intelligence branch headquarters in Calcutta, efforts were made to contact Biswas on the phone. Police sources said his mobile, traced to Tilgora village in the Ayodhya Hills, went unanswered till 11.58 last night and was switched off after that.        
	Biswas had been working in Purulia for the last two years and villagers knew him as NGO babu who worked for the tribals, organising blood donation camps and distributing garments. Saumajit, a childhood friend of Biswas, is a full-time teacher at Khanyan High School near Hooghlys Bandel but is also attached to an NGO.        
	At Basus home in Pandua, wife Sankhatua could not understand why her husband, who also worked for tribal welfare, had been held captive by the rebels. My husband is a nature lover. He had gone to Ayodhya hills to sight the moon on the night of full moon. I dont know why the Maoists took him a hostage? I appeal to them to set him free, Sankhatua sobbed, with her two-half-year-old son Aranyak by her side.        
	Basus widowed mother Sumita, 67, was inconsolable.         
	The crisis comes just a year after Dutta, the officer in charge of Sankrail in West Midnapore, was released on October 22, 2009, after 55 hours in captivity. But senior officers pointed out that Biswas and Basu have not been hostage in a planned operation, unlike the case of Dutta who was taken away from the police station.

	Tamluk, Sept. 28: A woman died after being given local anaesthesia ahead of a routine birth-control operation at a government health centre today, sparking mob fury that saw the gynaecologist thrashed and the facility vandalised.        
	Dilip Bera was kicked, punched and confined to a room in the three-hour mayhem at East Midnapores Nonakuri block heath centre this morning before police rescued and later arrested him for alleged negligence.        
	Bindu Ghara started having convulsions and became unconscious after being given the anaesthetic. The 25-year-old mother of two was declared dead a little later at the Tamluk district hospital to which the doctor had referred her. His move to have her shifted stoked suspicion that he knew the woman had died but wanted to dodge responsibility.        
	The Nonakuri mayhem mirrors the paralysis at Calcuttas SSKM and other government hospitals where doctors have struck work after being attacked by patients relatives over alleged negligence.         
	Bindu, who was to undergo a ligation operation around 6.30am today, was given a lignocaine injection. Chief medical officer of the district Baren Guha suggested that was usual before such surgeries. Bindu was administered a Lignocaine injection which is a common local anaesthetic. We are investigating what really caused her death, said Guha.        
	Bindu has two daughters, one six years old and the other born only a fortnight back. Both were born at the Nonakuri centre through normal deliveries.         
	We have arrested the doctor on the basis of a complaint by the deceaseds husband, said district police chief Ashok Biswas. Bindus husband Uttam is a farmer from nearby Prasadchak village.        
	Bindus mother Srimati Ghara said Bera had given the injection in her daughters waist and, when she lost consciousness, claimed the patient was alive but needed to be shifted to the Tamluk hospital, 7km away.        
	The health centre tried to escape responsibility. The doctor even arranged for an ambulance. But the doctors at the Tamluk hospital told me at 7.15am that my daughter died some time ago, said Srimati.        
	As word about Bindus death spread, nearly 2,000 villagers from Prasadchak, 1km away, stormed the Nonakuri centre. One group barged in, broke the furniture and thrashed Bera. Another blocked the nearby Haldia-Mecheda Road. The nurses and other staff fled.        
	A team from Tamluk police station arrived and pleaded with the mob with folded hands to turn Bera over. The villagers relented after some time. Bera was taken to the police station and arrested there.        
	Nurse protest        
	Nurses at Purulia district hospital stopped work for a few hours today demanding security after one of them was allegedly slapped by the relative of a patient who died.

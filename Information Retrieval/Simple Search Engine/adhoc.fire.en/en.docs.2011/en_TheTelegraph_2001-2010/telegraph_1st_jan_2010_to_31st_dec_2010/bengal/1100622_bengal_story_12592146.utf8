The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bayern carrot for battle zone
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bayern carrot for battle zone
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bayern star Bastian Schweinsteiger                                  
	Calcutta, June 21: From the battlefield of Lalgarh to the football field of Bayern Munich, if a Bengal police promise comes true.         
	The best player of a tournament the police will organise in Lalgarh may be sent to train with the German club. Wed like to send the most outstanding player to Bayern Munich, director-general of police Bhupinder Singh said today.        
	Men from Maoist-hit West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura will participate in the contest to mark the first anniversary of the operation by the joint forces. The original plan was to start the tournament on June 18 but the encounter last week in which eight Maoists were killed delayed it.        
	Seven-eight teams will take part, Singh said, beaming. You can call it the World Cup of Lalgarh.        
	His grin was not so broad when asked whether the police had worked out an arrangement with Bayern.         
	Sports minister Kanti Ganguly said the police would have to approach Bayern on their own. We had tried to stitch a deal with the club a couple of years ago to set up an academy in Burdwan but it is now in the freezer. If the police want to make such an arrangement, they will have to approach Bayern Munich on their own.        
	In 2008, the club had come to Calcutta for an exhibition match, led by star goalkeeper Oliver Kahn.        
	If the police promise holds good, a man from the violence-racked region will be on the ground where the likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery train.

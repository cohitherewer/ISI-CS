The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | PCPA lies low after resistance
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      PCPA lies low after resistance
          NARESH JANA                          People hoick their cycles over a portion of a road dug up by Peoples Committee activists in Lalgarh on July 19                                  
	Midnapore, Aug.4: The hotbed is turning too hot for the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities to handle.        
	So it has decided to lie low.        
	Peoples Committee activists have not dug up roads or blocked them by placing tree trunks in the past week despite the organisation calling an indefinite blockade from July 19 to demand the withdrawal of the joint forces.                     
	Praveen Tripathi, the superintendent of Jhargram police (district), said that after July 22, no incidents of sabotage and explosions had taken place. The Peoples Committee is maintaining a low profile in Jungle Mahal. They have not taken out any procession since the Radhanagar incident, Tripathi said.        
	He said the rebels were afraid that the villagers would inform the police about their whereabouts if they were forced to take part in rallies.        
	Between July 19 and 22, Maoists and Peoples Committee activists had dug up and blocked roads in at least 25 places at villages in Jhargram, Binpur, Kotowali, Lalgarh and Jamboni.        
	But over the past week, emboldened by the resistance to the Maoists, district transport operators such as owners of trekkers and trucks have plied their vehicles normally. Only bus operators have kept their vehicles off the roads.         
	At least 40 trekkers have been plying each day between Jhargram and Jamboni, Gidhni and Feko since July 23. Earlier, we did not dare bring out our vehicles during Maoist blockades. They had burnt at least 10 trekkers in the past year for defying blockades, said Jhargrams Satya Shau, who owns a trekker.        
	However, no vehicles plied in West Midnapore during the 48-hour bandh called by the Maoists on Monday.         
	Bangshi Singh, a grocer in Jhargram, said: During earlier rebel blockades, we used to keep our shops open but as there was no supply of goods from Calcutta, Kharagpur and Midnapore town, there was little business. But since July 23, we have got a steady supply of provisions despite the Peoples Committee blockade.

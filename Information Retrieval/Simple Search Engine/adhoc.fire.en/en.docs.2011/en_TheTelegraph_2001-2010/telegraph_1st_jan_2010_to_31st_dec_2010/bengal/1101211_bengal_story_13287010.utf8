          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Khoirashol (Birbhum), Dec. 10: Police probing yesterdays murder of a Birbhum CPM leader by suspected Maoists were today greeted with brickbats by supporters who alleged he had been left unprotected despite being on the rebels hit list.        
	The protesters were seething also because Shasthi Bauri was shot dead last evening inside a party office in Khoirashol just opposite the local police station.         
	The killers left behind posters condemning the arrest of rebel kingpin Kanchan and four others in Calcutta last week and called for a mass resistance to the CPM.        
	Bauri had been staying in the party office since his name appeared along with some other local leaders on Maoist posters in 2008.        
	The police were not pro-active enough. The party office where my brother was killed is located just across the road from the police station. I dont understand how the killers could come and escape so smoothly, Bauris younger brother Durga said.         
	The CPM workers had taken out a procession in Khoirashol this morning in protest against the killing. When the protesters were passing the police station, some of them hurled brickbats.         
	A few bricks landed on an escort vehicle of inspector general of police (western range), Z. Hassan, who had arrived to inspect the crime scene. But the cops chased away the marchers soon. The CPM observed a 12-hour bandh in the area today.

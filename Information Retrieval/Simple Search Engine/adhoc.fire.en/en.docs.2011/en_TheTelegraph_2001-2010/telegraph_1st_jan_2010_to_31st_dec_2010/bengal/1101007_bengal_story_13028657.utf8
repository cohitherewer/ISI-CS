The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Explosives scare at Calcutta airport
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Explosives scare at Calcutta airport
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 6: Two unclaimed bags containing what looked like a wire and unidentified metal objects at Calcutta airport this evening sparked fear among passengers that they contained explosives and sent security staff into a tizzy.        
	The bags, which airport sources said looked like soft suitcases, aroused the suspicion of the authorities while passing through an X-ray machine shared by Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet around 5.30pm.         
	A CISF sniffer dog apparently found nothing wrong with the bags but the authorities put them in a cooling pit for a 24-hour observation.        
	After airport officials noticed the objects inside the bag, we immediately cordoned off the scanner area and called for the bomb-disposal squad, said Jayati Ghosh, the airports senior CISF commandant.        
	Another CISF officer said: We looked for the bags owner but there was no claimant. We then alerted our security officials. We will check the security cameras for any recorded image of a person carrying the bags while entering the terminal building.        
	Sources at Calcutta airport said late in the evening that a woman who had boarded a Calcutta-Ranchi Kingfisher flight had complained about missing baggage after reaching the Jharkhand capital. The claim could not be confirmed till late tonight.        
	A SpiceJet employee said: I was handling a passengers baggage when the person manning the scanner raised the alarm. We were asked to clear the area and we rushed back.        
	However, normality returned soon as a posse of security personnel arrived and took the bags away. The bags will be opened tomorrow evening.         
	Kingfisher Airlines said the baggage had not been tagged and it could not be ascertained whether it belonged to one of its passengers because SpiceJet shared the scanner.        
	It cannot be said if the person who had kept the bags in the scanner was to board our flight, a Kingfisher spokesperson said. SpiceJet officials declined comment.

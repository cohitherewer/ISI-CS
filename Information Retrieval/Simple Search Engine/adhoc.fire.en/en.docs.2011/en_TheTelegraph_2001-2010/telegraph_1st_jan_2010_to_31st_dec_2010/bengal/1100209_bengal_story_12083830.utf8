          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Feb. 8: Police today claimed to have arrested one of the prime accused in the Maoist police station attack last October in which two cops were slain and officer-in-charge Atindranath Dutta was kidnapped.         
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said Prasanta Mahato was among 20 people arrested from various parts of Lalgarh, Salboni and Goaltore over the past 10 days.         
	Maoists allegedly led by a young woman had attacked Sankrail police station on October 20. Their military wing chief Kishanji had dubbed OC Dutta a prisoner of war and held him hostage for two days before releasing him in exchange for the release of 14 tribal women arrested for alleged guerrilla links.         
	Among those said to be in custody is Amiya Kundu, a close Kishanji associate.        
	In a Lalgarh forest last night, the forces came across two tents pitched 300 metres from each other. While one could accommodate 30 people, the other could house 10. From the bigger tent, we found two drilling machines, two vice machines and six files among other things. We think the Maoists had repaired their weapons in these tents, Verma said.

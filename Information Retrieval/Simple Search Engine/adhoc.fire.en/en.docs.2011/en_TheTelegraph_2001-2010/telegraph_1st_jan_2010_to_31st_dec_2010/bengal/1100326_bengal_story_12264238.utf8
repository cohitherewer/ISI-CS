The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shortage of IAS officers: Buddha
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Shortage of IAS officers: Buddha
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 25: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today admitted that there was a lack of IAS officers in the state but added that it was a national problem and not specific to Bengal.        
	There is an inadequacy in the number of IAS officers in the state. We had 237 direct IAS officers in different posts till January 31, 2010, as against the required number of 296. The problem is, however, a country-wide phenomenon, Bhattacharjee said in the Assembly, replying to a question from Congress legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya.        
	The chief minister told the House a team of officers would visit Delhi to talk to the committee the Centre had formed to increase the number of IAS officers in the states.         
	We have nothing to do if it (the recruitment of IAS officers) is done from Delhi. We are sending our officers to the capital to talk about expediting the recruitment process, he said.        
	Bhattacharjee said departmental secretaries had to assume dual charges because of the shortage of IAS officers.         
	He admitted that the state government-run Administrative Training Institutes (ATI) attempt to impart quality training to IAS aspirants did not yield positive results.         
	The chief minister dismissed a Congress legislators allegation that many IAS officers were seeking transfer to Delhi. The IAS is an all-India cadre. If the Centre requisitions them, we will have to release them, particularly when requests come from the central ministers, he said.        
	Without naming panchayat secretary Manabendra Roy and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen, Bhuniya asked Bhattacharjee if there was stagnancy in the service because the two officers had been holding their posts for the past nine years. The chief minister said the government would shortly replace them with new incumbents.         
	Bhattacharjee said the government was promoting WBCS officers to IAS ranks to cope with the shortage of IAS officers. A considerable number of promoted IAS officers are at the helm of many departments, he added.

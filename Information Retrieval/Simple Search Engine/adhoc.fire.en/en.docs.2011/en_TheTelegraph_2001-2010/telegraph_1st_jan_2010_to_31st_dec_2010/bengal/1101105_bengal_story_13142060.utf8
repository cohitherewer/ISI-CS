                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Elephants destroy crops
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bankura, Nov. 4: A herd of 32 elephants that had entered the Jungle Mahal area of Bankura through the Dalma forests in Jharkhand 10 days ago has been destroying crops in at least three blocks.         
	Forest department officials said they had tried to chase back the animals to Jharkhand but failed. We used conventional ways such as bursting crackers but to no avail, said Subir Kumar Das, the divisional forest officer (south Bankura). Das said the herd was now in the Simlapal forests and might move towards West Midnapore.         
	Forest officials said the animals had strayed away from the traditional elephant corridor that runs through the Fuluknama, Narbanda and Pirolgari ranges in Bankura.        
	Another herd of elephants today came out of the Suri forest in Birbhum and destroyed crops in a field.         
	One of the elephants also chased a farmer, who fell down while escaping. One of the hind legs of the animal grazed past his waist.

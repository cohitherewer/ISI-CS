                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Tata hope on Sens lips
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 31: Industries minister Nirupam Sen today said the state government was hopeful of a Tata comeback in Singur, two days after the companys counsel spoke of plans for a larger project there.         
	We had chosen the land in Singur to set up industry. Thats why the land was acquired. It would be good if the Tatas set up a factory there, Sen said on the sidelines of a CPM state committee meeting.        
	Asked when the Tatas could return, Sens reply was as tentative as the companys reference in the Supreme Court to the possibility of a bigger car rolling out of Singur.         
	Not now. They (the Tatas) have said they will be considering the issue in one or two days. We are hopeful of their comeback to Singur, the industries minister told reporters. A source later clarified that the minister was speaking in general terms and did not mean one or two days in the literal sense.        
	Our government wants investment in Singur. But the ground conditions and the environment ought to be conducive to such investments. I appeal to the people of Singur to ensure the creation of the right atmosphere for that to happen, he added.         
	The Tatas had sent a letter to the CPM-backed Nano Bachao Committee, which had requested them to return to Singur, saying that a comeback would be possible only when the atmosphere was conducive.         
	CPM sources said that at the state committee meeting, a leader from Hooghly had briefly mentioned Singur. A source said: The leader said it would be nice to have Tata Motors back in Singur.        
	A section of the party leadership said more party meetings should be addressed by the chief minister in the districts, particularly those affected by Maoists.

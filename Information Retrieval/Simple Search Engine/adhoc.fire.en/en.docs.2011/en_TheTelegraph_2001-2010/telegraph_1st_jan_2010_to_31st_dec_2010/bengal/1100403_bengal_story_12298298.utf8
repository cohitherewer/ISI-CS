The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Fear after bid on executive
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Fear after bid on executive
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Roy Chowdhury. (Gour Sharma)                                  
	Durgapur, April 2: Many of the 700 executives of the various companies working at the IISCO Steel Plant expansion site in Burnpur are feeling insecure following two shootings in less than two months that killed a manager and injured another.        
	While Satish Pillai, 36, the project manager of a Kerala-based construction company, was shot dead outside his rented flat on February 12, Avijit Roy Chowdhury, 48, the joint general manager of a Hyderabad-based construction company, was shot at last night while returning home after dinner at a restaurant.         
	Police have yet to crack the Pillai murder case, let alone make a breakthrough in the attempted murder.        
	A civil engineer, Roy Chowdhury was shot in his left abdomen by one of the two people on a motorcycle around 10.45pm yesterday. Local people came running hearing the shot and took him to hospital.         
	From the CT scan, we found the bullet stuck in his left abdomen and he needs immediate surgery, said Sudip Banerjee, a surgeon at the Durgapur hospital from where he was shifted to Calcutta today.        
	His wife and son, a Class IX student, stay in North 24-Parganas Agarpara with the rest of the family.        
	Roy Chowdhurys colleague at Nagarjuna Constructions Company, Balvindar Singh, alleged that the administration and the police had failed to ensure their security. The expansion of IISCO is a big project. But what about the security of those working on it? said the man from Amritsar, a stores manager who stays here with his wife and daughter.         
	Nagarjuna is building a blast furnace. C.H. Sova Raju from Hyderabad, an assistant general manager of the company who stays alone, said: We return home from work late. We get very little time to socialise. Dont understand how people like us can make enemies. We are scared.        
	A young manager of Kerala-based General Industrial Builders is planning to seek a transfer. The two incidents have unnerved me. Id like to return to my hometown, Chennai, he said.        
	The police admitted being clueless about the motive behind last nights shooting. Asansol circle inspector Gour Mukherjee also had no qualms admitting lack of clues to the murder. We have arrested his (pool-car) driver but did not get any clue from him. His bosses were too busy to talk a day before the Union home ministers visit to Burdwan.        
	The guard of the apartment building where Roy Chowdhury lived told the police three youths on a motorcycle had come looking for him when he had gone out for dinner.        
	IISCO general manager (personnel and administration) M.K. Rauth said the police had done little despite requests to step up vigil, which, if nothing else, could instil confidence among the executives.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, June 28: A Trinamul Congress delegation called on the Congress mayor of Siliguri today and accused her of failing to fulfil peoples expectations.        
	We told her that the new board has not been able to fulfil the expectations of the people. Wards held by the Congress councillors and, in some cases, those of the CPM have been getting more funds than the ones held by us, Darjeeling district Trinamul president Gautam Deb alleged.         
	He led a team of nine party councillors to Gangotri Duttas office in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation and spent almost two hours there.        
	Last year, the Trinamul-Congress combine had captured the 47-ward civic body, dislodging the Left for the first time since 1981. Trouble erupted when Trinamul, which had 14 councillors and the support of an Independent, demanded the mayors post. The Congress, which had 15 councillors, went one up, bagging the chair with Left support.         
	But the rift appeared to have disappeared this March when Trinamul announced it would join the Congress to run the board, creating a curious case of a Congress mayor propped up by the CPM as well as Mamata Banerjees party.        
	The first sign of the Congress-Trinamul relationship taking a beating here came on Friday when Deb walked out of a board meeting alleging misbehaviour by Congress chairperson Sabita Devi Agarwal.         
	Today, again hinting that all was not well, the Trinamul councillors told the mayor to improve services, take steps against the corrupt and make the use of funds transparent.         
	Reacting to the allegations, mayor Dutta said: We have allotted funds for all the wards impartially. He (Deb) should keep his flock together before trying to find fault with us.         
	She was referring to the resignation of a Trinamul councillor, indicating that there was infighting in the party.        
	Trinamuls Chaitali Sen Sharma submitted her resignation to the chairperson, citing ill health.         
	Her leader, Deb, said he did not know about it.

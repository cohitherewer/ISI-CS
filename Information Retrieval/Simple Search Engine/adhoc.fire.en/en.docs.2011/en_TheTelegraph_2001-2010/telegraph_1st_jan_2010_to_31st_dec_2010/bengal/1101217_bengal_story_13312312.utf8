          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 16: An FIR was filed today accusing the Mamata Banerjee-led railways of filling up water bodies at the site of an engine component unit in Dankuni without prior permission from the state government.        
	The land at the spot, just outside Calcutta, belongs to the railways but approvals have to be taken under the West Bengal Inland Fisheries Act, 1984, before water bodies are filled, irrespective of who owns the plot.        
	Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda, whose department filed the FIR at Dankuni police station against the Howrah divisional railway manager, claimed such unauthorised filling of ponds was a non-bailable offence.         
	But railway minister Mamata Banerjee, without naming Nanda, dubbed the complaint politically motivated.        
	The FIR follows a visit to the site yesterday by Left members of an Assembly standing committee. They claimed that the pond-filling would leave Dankuni with severe drainage and ecological problems. The House panel has five Trinamul and Congress members but they werent part of the delegation.        
	Rail deaths        
	Three people were killed when a train rammed into their vehicle at an unmanned crossing near Howrahs Bagnan.                           
	The railways have announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of the dead.

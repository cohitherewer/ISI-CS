          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The damaged culvert in Salboni. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, May 12: Suspected Maoists last night triggered a blast in West Midnapores Salboni and damaged a culvert on the road connecting Midnapore town to Lalgarh.        
	The road is one of the two taken by joint forces to move between Midnapore town and Lalgarh, the other being via Dherua.         
	District superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the aim of the blast was to hinder the movement of the joint forces.         
	But it would not be a problem as we have an alternative route, he added.        
	Vehicle movement has not been affected by the blast as in the dry season, cars can also ply on walkways through the fields on either side of the road.        
	The blast came a day before a 24-hour bandh called by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities today to protest alleged CPM atrocities at some villages in Jungle Mahal.         
	Shops, offices and other establishments in the area remained closed today because of the bandh and public transport remained off the roads.        
	The Peoples Committee has also announced it will block roads in the tribal-dominated areas in the Jhargram subdivision for an indefinite period from tomorrow.        
	CPM activists are entering our villages, torturing our supporters, ransacking and looting their houses. Some of our supporters were also forced to flee their homes. The CPM goons have taken shelter in a high school in Salbonis Sitanathpur, Asit Mahato, a committee leader, said.         
	He said the outfit could also block trains and NH 6.

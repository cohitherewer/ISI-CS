The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | In Renaissance town, change is small change
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      In Renaissance town, change is small change

	Theres little Serampore doesnt know about winds of change, now supposedly blowing across the state. It was one of the cradles of the Bengal Renaissance, the biggest agent of transformation in the regions history.        
	If thats in the past, Serampore has tasted the future too: its municipality has been in Congress or Trinamul hands since 1990, holding the Left at bay for almost two decades before Singur and Nandigram entered the picture.        
	Change has come and gone, again and again, in this district town in Hooghly.        
	What was a cluster of sleepy villages till the middle of the 18th century had turned into a trading hotspot under Danish rule. The St Olaves Church still stands as a relic from Fredericknagore, as Serampore was quaintly named by the Danes after their king Frederick.                  
	Then the Danes left and the British came, and the town turned into an industrial hub - before declining into just another densely populated suburb post-Independence.        
	In between, while Serampore was busy riding the waves of East-meets-West economic change, an English priest decided to make it his home, and transformed Bengal for ever.        
	William Carey helped set up a modern library here in 1800, a college in 1818  just a year after Hindu College (todays Presidency College) was born in Calcutta  and launched the first Bengali newspaper, Samachar Darpan, the same year.        
	Change is small change in Serampore.        
	So how has the town done under Opposition rule?        
	It has become more congested; the civic amenities are nothing to talk about; water bodies have been filled up to allow apartment blocks to come up. The municipality has done nothing to check the rampant rule violations, said Sujit Mukerjee, 37, who was born and brought up here.        
	A walk around the narrow lanes, dodging the armies of rickshaws and bicycles, bore him out. Theres hardly any breathing space, any open ground or pond.        
	Except the riverbank. The uncluttered road running parallel to the Hooghly past Serampore College is the best place to be here, even though the town fathers have done nothing to spruce up the riverfront the way next-door neighbour Chandernagore has with its famed Strand.        
	Its little surprise, therefore, that when Carey and fellow missionaries Joshua Marshman and William Ward decided to settle in Serampore over two centuries ago, they picked this neighbourhood. According to Baptist Press accounts, Carey borrowed Rs 6,000 from a ships captain and bought a house.        
	It had a large verandah and a hall with two rooms on each side. There were two other rooms on either side in the back and two in front, on the edge of the river. Enough space for three families, a printing press, a chapel (the hall was converted into one), a school, a storehouse and a few pages of history.        
	A lot of it still remains today except the press that printed Samachar Darpan, although the first edition of the weekly paper has been preserved in the Carey Museum on the Serampore College campus. Its not too far from the Mission Church, as Careys establishment is known today.        
	It was in this month of May  on its 23rd day, a Saturday in 1818  that the first edition of the paper appeared, its front page bearing the news of an upcoming auction of a ships goods.        
	By then, Carey had set up the library with help from Ward  a master printer and Marshman. When the three missionaries opened a college too, the library moved there. In the 18 years in between, they established schools, some of them for girls, and translated many books in Indian languages.        
	Residents regret the municipalitys failure to do anything to preserve the heritage. Civic chairman Amiyo Mukherjee, who joined Trinamul earlier this year from the Congress, said he had no money. This has to be done by the state government or some other agencies, he said.        
	So far, only the Serampore court has won heritage status and is being rebuilt to its earlier pomp. The state tourism department had planned to beautify the riverbank but nothing has happened so far, though Mukherjee claimed six ghats had been taken up for development.        
	The riverside road is testimony to how industry and culture are intertwined in Serampores history. Indias second jute mill came up here in 1866. Today, despite the gloom in the sector, India Jute Mill continues to operate, though on a low scale, employing around 3,700 people who earn Rs 180-odd a day.        
	The palatial guesthouse next to the mill is a reminder of the towns heyday, as is the 350-year-old Rajbari.        
	Kalyan Goswami, a descendent of Serampores royal family, rued he did not have enough money for the Rajbaris upkeep. We are trying to get it heritage status, which will bring the funds, he said.        
	Most of the palaces sprawling property, which got divided among many descendants, has been sold off. As a result, the Rajbari is surrounded by apartment buildings.        
	If Serampore is about cultural awakening, neighbouring Baidyabati can boast about how its boy had put science over superstition and removed a hurdle preventing many Indians from training as doctors.        
	Madhusudan Gupta was the first Indian to have dissected a human body to study anatomy at a time upper caste Hindus balked at the idea of touching a corpse.        
	On January 10, 1836, Gupta had followed British surgeon H.H. Goodeve to an outhouse at Calcutta Medical College with four other students and was the first among them to put scalpel to skin. The news made a stir, inspiring a generation of students to switch from Ayurveda and Unani to medical science.        
	Baidyabati was also a place of faith, an outpost of the Vaishnav movement. Mahaprabhu Chaitanya is believed to have spent a few days at the Nemai Tirtha Ghat 500 years ago. The dirty and encroachment-ridden place doesnt even have a plaque to commemorate the event.        
	But residents are not entirely unhappy with the municipalitys work. I dont know whos doing it but streetlights have been put up and the roads improved. The water connection too is better now, said Ranjan Maity.        
	Many are ready to credit Naren Chatterjee, Forward Bloc leader and chairman of the State Agri Marketing Board. The Bloc and the CPM share power in the civic body.        
	Few expect a home run for the Left on May 30, though. The winds of change are blowing. It will not be easy, Maity said.

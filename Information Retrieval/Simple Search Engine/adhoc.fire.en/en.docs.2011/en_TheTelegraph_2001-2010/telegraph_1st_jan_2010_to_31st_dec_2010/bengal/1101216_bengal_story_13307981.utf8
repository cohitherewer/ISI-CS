	Sagardighi, Dec. 15: Stick to take on the CPM, carrot to send a message to the Congress.        
	Mamata Banerjee today took her familiar battle cry against the CPM to Murshidabad but at the same time announced that she would nurse and keep coming to the district that has been a bastion of the Congress for decades.        
	Our friends were here. For the coalitions sake, I didnt come to Murshidabad often. But there was a time when I used to visit Murshidabad every week. From now on, Ill keep coming, Mamata said after laying the foundation of a double-line project in Sagardighi, around 30km from Murshidabads hub Behrampore.        
	The crowd had waited to hear her for nearly six hours as the railway minister arrived five hours behind schedule without finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was scheduled to attend the event but couldnt make it because of a chopper snag.        
	In Murshidabad, local Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury, also the district party chief, has led the battle against the Marxists. If Mamata has to take on the mantle, she has to lock horns with Chowdhury, who wants the Congress to fight the CPM alone. He stayed away from the event, claiming he had not been invited.        
	Neither Mamata nor her party colleague, Union minister for shipping Mukul Roy, named Chowdhury.        
	Chowdhury, away at a party meeting today, was among the handful of Congress leaders who were against an alliance with Trinamul before the civic polls this May that ultimately led to both the parties going their separate ways.         
	With the Assembly elections round the corner, a hard bargain on seat-sharing is expected as leaders like Chowdhury are certain to stick to their guns. Murshidabad has sent the largest batch of Lok Sabha Congress MPs from Bengal.        
	Chowdhury gave enough hints that he wouldnt soften his stand. Not only did he stay away from the Mamata show, his supporters also organised a rail roko in Behrampore this morning.        
	Trinamul leaders like Kalyan Banerjee had accused Chowdhury of helping the CPMs cause by continuing his tirade against Mamata.        
	The Trinamul chief too dropped such hints in her 20-minute speech. I am challenging the CPM. Dont play dirty politics with me. I am for the people, not goondas, she said. Choosing a parallel inextricably linked with the land, she added that there was no need to repeat the tale of Mir Jafar.         
	After delimitation, Murshidabad will have 22 seats in the Assembly, up from 19 at present. Mamata would not like to have the Congress calling the shots in this part of Bengal when the talks start for seat-adjustment.         
	Mamata played the development card to the hilt, accusing the CPM of disrupting railway projects in the state, including Murshidabad. They are blocking the railway bridge at Azimgunj. Congress leaders can ask Pranab-da. He told me that the state government was not taking up construction of a railway flyover at Jangipur.        
	Her gifts for the residents of Sagardighi were extension of the Howrah-Azimgunj Ganadevta Express to Sagardighi and a passenger train from Howrah to Azimgunj via Sagardighi from early 2011. In the coming days we will get the opportunity to do more for Murshidabad, Mamata said.         
	Many of those who turned up for the rally returned to the venue after a couple of hours, not for politics but for song and dance: Tollywood actors Dev and Payel Sarkar performed in an unrelated show.

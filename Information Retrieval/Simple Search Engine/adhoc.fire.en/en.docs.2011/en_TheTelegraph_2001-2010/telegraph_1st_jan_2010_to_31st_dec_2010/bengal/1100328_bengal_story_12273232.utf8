The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM faith in women power
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM faith in women power
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Calcutta, March 27: The CPM is gearing up to woo women voters before the May civic polls across the state by promising the gender 50 per cent reservation in municipalities and panchayats.         
	The move comes in the wake of the partys bid to regain lost turf by replacing unpopular incumbent councillors.        
	The women wings of the CPM and its allies RSP, CPI and Forward Bloc will meet the chief minister on Monday to formally put forward the demand before him.         
	The party state committee, which began its two-day session today to fine-tune strategy for the civic polls, is expected to approve the move before the womens delegation meets Bhattacharjee.         
	We will ask the state government to increase reservation for women in panchayats and municipalities from 33 per cent to 50 per cent. We will request the chief minister to make a policy statement to that effect in the Assembly soon. The government can move the bill to enact the legislation before the ongoing budget session ends, CPM state secretariat member Shyamali Gupta said.         
	The newly inducted Gupta is the first woman in the state secretariat.         
	Even if the bill cant be placed before the polls in the fag end of May, party leaders hope to harvest the effect of the chief ministers policy statement. Buddha-deb Bhattacharjees promise of a 10 per cent job reservation for the weakest sections among backward Muslims will also have a similar effect, the party hopes.        
	The Centre had approved a proposal to reserve half the seats in panchayats for women last year and several states, including Orissa and Tripura, have already enacted their own legislation to implement the plan.        
	In his special note on the guidelines for the civic polls, state party secretary Biman Bose today asked district units to field more women in the civic polls over the existing 33 per cent quota.         
	Gupta said the district units were not averse to the idea.         
	The guidelines also ask them to ensure more Muslim candidates. The erosion of Left support among Muslims is believed to be a key reason behind its poll slide.        
	Wary of anti-incumbency, Bose asked the district leaders to pick fresh candidates from among those young, popular and active in public service.        
	In Calcutta, some of the leading councillors will have to vacate their wards be-cause of reservation for women and Scheduled Castes. Gupta hoped that the women mayor-in-council members would be accommodated elsewhere.

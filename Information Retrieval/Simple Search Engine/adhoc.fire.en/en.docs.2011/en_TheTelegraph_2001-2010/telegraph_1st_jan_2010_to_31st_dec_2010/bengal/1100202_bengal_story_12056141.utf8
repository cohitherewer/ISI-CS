The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata unity show tomorrow 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata unity show tomorrow 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 1: Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to hold a day-long dharna in Dharmatala on Wednesday in an apparent effort to regroup allies after a season of squabbles and ahead of the municipal elections.        
	She has called upon the Congress and like-minded Left associates (a euphemism for anti-CPM communist sympathisers) to take part in the protest against alleged state-sponsored terror.        
	The sit-in at Dharmatala will begin at 10am and continue till 7pm. This will be followed by dharnas and street-corner meetings across the state on February 6 and 7. The agitation will end on February 12.        
	The programme will mark a return to full-fledged politics for Bengal after a pause and subsequent detour brought about by the hospitalisation and death of Jyoti Basu.        
	Mamatas relations with the Congress had turned frosty in the intervening period, largely because of the Centres perceived overtures to the Left in Bengal in the form of offers of medical aid to Basu and readiness to greenlight a state funeral.        
	We are ready to join forces with Mamata starting Wednesday, said state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.        
	The Congresss participation in the dharna will help Mamata send a message that her alliance is intact.        
	Another reason for announcing the sit-in is the CPMs scheduled rally on the Brigade Parade Grounds on Sunday to kick off the Lefts campaign for the polls to 82 civic bodies.        
	Mamata cited the statements of two CPM ministers to take a veiled swipe at the Centre.        
	Yesterday, at a public meeting where the chief minister was present, ministers Abdur Rezzak Mollah and Kanti Ganguly had said CPM cadres would take up arms to cou-nter attacks by Trinamul supporters.        
	Mamata today said: CPM ministers are boasting about putting up armed resistance. Such unconstitutional statements could be a ground for the Centre to dismiss the government. Imagine, if ministers of any other state spoke such language! Would the Centre keep silent?         
	But she also used the opportunity to give a call for unity. Now is the time to get united. This is why I am appealing to my alliance part-ner and other like-minded Left associates to hit the streets with us.         
	Former cop joins        
	Former director-general of police H.A. Safwi today joined Trinamul. I believe she (Mamata) alone can usher in change in Bengal, said Safwi, who retired as DGP, fire services, in 2005.

	Calcutta, Jan. 1: Jyoti Basu was hospitalised today with pneumonia.        
	A CT scan of his chest and a series of blood tests revealed that Basu is suffering from moderately severe pneumonia. He is under observation, said an official of AMRI Hospital in Salt Lake, where the 95-year-old CPM leader has been admitted.         
	Doctors said his condition was not critical, but neither is he stable.         
	However, he is conscious, the official said.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called up chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees office at Writers Buildings around 6.30pm to enquire about the veteran leaders condition. The chief ministers secretariat informed Bhattacharjee, who was already in the hospital, about the call. He called the Prime Minister back, CPM sources said.         
	Since Thursday, Basu had been suffering from chest congestion and having trouble breathing. He also had a cough and had been put on a semi-solid diet.         
	Today, doctors visited him at Indira Bhavan in Salt Lake where an X-ray of the chest was done.         
	Later, around 5.45pm, he was shifted to the hospital and a CT scan and blood tests were done.         
	The scan and blood tests confirmed the pneumonia, a doctor said.         
	He is on oxygen support and heavy doses of intravenous antibiotics in a deluxe room and not the ICU.        
	According to doctors, Basu will have to be in hospital for a few days.         
	A five-member medical board has been formed with Basus personal physician A.K. Maity, neurologist Trishit Roy, cardiologist Subhanan Roy, pulmonologist Sumit Sengupta and critical care expert Rajarshi Roy.        
	Moderately severe is a category of pneumonia which can turn critical considering his age. But we expect his condition to improve with heavy doses of antibiotic, said Sengupta.         
	Son Chandan said Basu had been suffering from cough and cold for the past three days. My father is very weak. We admitted him to the private hospital this evening following Dr A.K. Maitys advice, he said.         
	Chandan said that his father lacked immunity at this ripe old age. My father is over 95 and has to be well looked after, he added.        
	Basus son and daughter-in-law Rakhi were present when he was taken to the hospital.        
	In July 2009, Basu was admitted to the same hospital after suffering from transient loss of consciousness while brushing his teeth. The attending nurse, Madhabi Biswas, could not find his pulse or blood pressure and provided cardiac massage to revive him.        
	After his release, Basus bedroom was converted into a virtual ICU with several life-saving equipment.         
	In 2008, he had to stay in hospital for several days after he fell at home and a haemorrhage was detected in his brain.

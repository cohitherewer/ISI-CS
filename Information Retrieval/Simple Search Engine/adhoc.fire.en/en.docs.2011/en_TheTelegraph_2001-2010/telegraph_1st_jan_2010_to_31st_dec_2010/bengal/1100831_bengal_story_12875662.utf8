	Purulia, Aug. 30: At least eight passenger trains stopped today at an unmanned station in Purulia whose staff had fled following a Maoist threat last night, but tickets were neither sold nor checked.        
	As they headed to Urma station, the train drivers coordinated with the cabin and signalling staff of Kantadih and Balarampur, the two nearest stations on either side, 8km and 9km away.        
	The drivers of the trains going towards Urma from Kantadih collected a token from the Kantadih staff, signalling that the line was clear. The trains then crossed Urma and the drivers handed the token over at Balarampur. The same procedure was followed in reverse by trains travelling towards Urma from Balarampur, a railway official said.        
	The trains ran at speeds between 10kmph and 15kmph between Kantadih and Balarampur, he added.        
	Urma station has remained closed since 10 last night after Maoists warned the staff against working during a bandh called by the rebels today to protest the encounter killing of Umakanta Mahato, prime accused in the Jnaneswari Express sabotage.        
	Urmas 15 employees, who had spent the night huddled inside a room at the station, left for their homes this morning. No replacements could be sent because of the bandh. The station office remained locked, Adra divisional railway manager A.K. Garkare said.        
	Last night, several passenger trains that were scheduled to stop at Urma were either diverted or rescheduled. No trains will pass through Urma station tonight either, Garkare said.        
	Maoist raid        
	A group of 50 Maoists ransacked a forest beat office in Kotshila in Purulia, about 45km from Urma, late last night. They also took out furniture from the adjoining staff quarters and set fire to them.

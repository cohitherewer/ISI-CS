	Labhpur (Birbhum), March 12: A schoolboy was found dead in a cabbage field at a Birbhum village this morning with his throat slit.        
	Sheikh Habibur, 12, a resident of Habibpur in Labhpur, had been missing since yesterday.         
	The boys father, Soleman Sheikh, 37, a daily labourer, said Habibpur had gone to graze their cattle yesterday afternoon but did not return.         
	When my son did not return till evening, we started to look for him but could not trace him. This morning, villagers discovered my sons body, Soleman said.         
	Soleman, a Trinamul Congress supporter, alleged that two sharecroppers of the field had murdered his son, a Class IV student, because they might have caught him stealing cabbage. He has lodged an FIR against them.         
	The Habibpur panchayat is controlled by the CPM.        
	Birbhum superintendent of police Rabindranath Mukherjee said the incident was being probed. We are yet to make any arrest, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Alcohol in driver viscera foxes cops and rail
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Alcohol in driver viscera foxes cops and rail
          OUR BUREAU                      The Uttar Banga Express and the Vananchal Express that were involved in the accident. File picture                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 19: The Bengal CID will contest viscera reports that one of the two Uttar Banga Express drivers in the Sainthia crash had alcohol in his body, and seek a second opinion as the assessment contradicts some of its own findings.        
	Railway officials expressed surprise at the conclusions of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Hyderabad, saying it had thrown up more questions than it answered. However, the reports said no drugs were found in the samples.        
	We have not got the viscera report as yet but we will ask for it. If, indeed, it says that the driver had consumed alcohol, we will ask for a re-examination, a Railway Board member said from Delhi.        
	Sixty-six people were killed after the Uttar Banga Express jumped a signal at a speed of 80kmph and rammed into the Vananchal Express on July 19. No attempt was made by either of the two Uttar Banga drivers to slow down, even though the Sainthia station was a scheduled stop, or apply the emergency brakes. The lapses had left railway officials baffled and led them to suspect that the drivers had been drugged.        
	Senior CID officials appeared to question the viscera findings, saying they were at variance with reports of post-mortems conducted earlier by local authorities on the Uttar Banga duo. The reports provided no indication that they had consumed alcohol.        
	Experts can determine from the smell of a stomachs contents or even the liver if there is any trace of alcohol but in this case, the autopsy surgeon who conducted the post-mortem said he could not find any, a CID official said.        
	Department officials said they would now approach other forensic experts for a second opinion. The CID had sent the samples of driver Madhav Chandra Dey  in whose viscera alcohol has been found  and assistant driver Nirmal Chandra Mondal to the lab in Hyderabad in early August.         
	The institute is the nodal centre for all CFSL laboratories, which are under the Union home ministry.        
	Railway officials questioned the report, saying it had not helped clear the mystery around the crash. For instance, they said, if there was nothing wrong with assistant driver Mondal, why didnt he try to stop the train.        
	The assistant driver had access to the emergency brake which he could have applied even if the senior driver had passed out. But no attempt was made by either of the drivers to do so, a rail official said.        
	Other officials said that the records of the two drivers were extremely clean. They were both A-grade drivers against whom we had never received any complaints. Also, till Gadadharpur (the previous stop), barely 8km from Sainthia, no abnormality had been detected in the behaviour of either of the drivers. It is hardly possible for senior driver Dey to have got drunk in the 10 minutes that it takes to get to Sainthia from there, the rail official said.        
	CID officials said alcohol had also been found in the sample of the Vananchal Express guard who died after it was rammed from behind, but appeared to shrug it off. Were not attaching any importance to this as he was not driving the train and was simply in his compartment at the rear, an official said.        
	Preliminary railway investigations had made it clear that the signalling system at Sainthia was working and that the Uttar Banga Express had jumped it, officials said. However, they said the interlocking device, which would have diverted the train onto an unoccupied platform, had not been put in place. The final report of the commissioner of railway safety is yet to be completed, one official said.

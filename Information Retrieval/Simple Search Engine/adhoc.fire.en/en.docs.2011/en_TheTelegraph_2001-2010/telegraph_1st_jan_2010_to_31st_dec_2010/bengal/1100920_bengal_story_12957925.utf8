          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Berhampore, Sept. 19: Five customs employees, including a superintendent and an inspector, allegedly snatched lakhs of rupees from two traders yesterday after stopping buses on a Murshidabad highway on the pretext of checking.        
	Superintendent Nitai Chandra Das, 55, inspector Shilananda Tigar, 42, and constables Susanta Maity, 45, Fani Ghosh, 50, and Pradyut Goswami, 45, first stopped a private bus on NH34 in Ahiran. All five have been arrested.        
	While checking, they found Rs 2.35 lakh in the bag of bidi trader Zaheer Ahmed. They asked me to get off the bus. Although I told them I was carrying the money to buy bidi leaves, they refused to listen. They confiscated the bag, Ahmed said.        
	The officials stopped another bus and tried to snatch Rs 13 lakh from jute merchant Shamsul Haque. After Haque refused to part with the money, an argument ensued and other passengers joined in.         
	The officer in charge of Suti police station, Biswabandhu Chattoraj, who was passing by, stopped after hearing the commotion. He asked the customs officials to accompany him to the police station. Ahmed and Haque also went to the police station and lodged an FIR against the officials.

	Calcutta, May 4: The closing date for submission of the provisional registration form for this years Haj has been extended by 15 days to May 15.        
	There are many who have not been able to apply by April 30 because of the heat wave in south Bengal and storm devastation in the north, said Sayed Mohammad Masih, the chairman of the West Bengal State Haj Committee.         
	All Haj applicants are re- quested to apply for their passports as Saudi Arabia has made them compulsory for pilgrims, he added.

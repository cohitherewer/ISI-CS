          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 3: The suspension of night trains will continue till June 7 and probably beyond, the South Eastern Railway has said.        
	The railways had earlier decided to suspend till today the movement of passenger trains on the Maoist-affected Kharagpur-Rourkela and Kharagpur-Adra sections and the bordering areas of Jharkhand and Orissa at night.        
	The decision was taken after the Jnaneswari Express was sabotaged last Friday.        
	The state intelligence branch has issued an alert to the railways on the possibility of further Maoist attacks on the routes.        
	The intelligence officials have informed the railways that the Maoists have stocked arms and ammunition.         
	The intelligence department has informed us that because of heightened operations against the Maoists, they could strike back by attacking trains, a senior railway official said.        
	The Railway Board has reviewed the security situation in the areas and directed us not to operate passenger trains at night till June 7, a South Eastern Railway official said.         
	Passenger trains have not been plying on these routes from 10pm to 5am since the May 28 Jnaneswari Express crash.         
	A number of trains from Howrah to western India are running on changed timings. The Jnaneswari Express now leaves Howrah at 4.30am instead of 10.55pm. The Howrah-Mumbai Mail via Nagpur has been leaving Howrah at 5am instead of 8.15pm.         
	The Howrah-Adra Chakradharpur Passenger, Howrah-Adra-Bokaro Passenger and the Kharagpur-Tata Passenger will remain cancelled till June 7, railway officials said. The Howrah-Hatia Express and the Howrah-Koraput Express are running on diverted routes.

	Siliguri, Nov. 8: Orange growers in the hills are expecting a good season this year with production going up because of adequate rainfall and bright sunny days that kept pests away.        
	We had a bad season last year as the fruits fell from the trees prematurely because of fungal attacks. The oranges were also damaged by insects. But this time, with favourable climate and adequate rainfall in the hills, we expect a good season, said Narbahadur Limbu, a grower from Bunkulung in Mirik.        
	There are around 350 orange growers in Mirik busty, Orange villa, Nagri and Magarjung villages in Mirik block, 55km from here, and the area is one of the major orange suppliers for the plains, said Limbu.         
	The fruits start flowering in March and the oranges mature after Diwali, by the end of November. There are around 120-125 orange plants in each orchard measuring 1-1.5 acre. Last year, the highest price at which an orchard was booked was Rs 10,000. But this time, the farmers are getting around Rs 50,000 for an orchard, said Limbu, who is also the co-ordinator of the Farmers Coordination Committee.        
	Traders at the Siliguri regulated market, from where the fruit is supplied to the state and also to neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Nepal, are hopeful.         
	The season usually starts from the first week of December and continues till the first week of February. Oranges usually reach the market by November end. But this time, it has already started arriving and we are expecting good business, said Tapan Saha, the president of the Siliguri Regulated Market Fruits and Vegetables Commission Agents Association.         
	There are 60 members in the association involved in orange trade.         
	Mehfuse Ahmed, the assistant director (plant protect division) of the district agriculture department, said: Adequate rainfall was recorded this year and bright sunny days and favourable temperature at night (between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius) have helped the fruits grow in time. The weather condition is perfect to protect oranges from fungal or insect attacks. Powdery mildew, a fungal infection, and attack of fruit flies are some of the common hazards that damage the crops at a premature stage. But a good climate has helped the fruits to develop better this time.

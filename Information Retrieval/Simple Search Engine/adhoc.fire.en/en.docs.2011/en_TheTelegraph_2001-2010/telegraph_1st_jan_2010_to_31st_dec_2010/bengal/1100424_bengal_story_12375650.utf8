The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pressure on Cong not to bow to ally
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Pressure on Cong not to bow to ally
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 23: Nearly a hundred Congress activists from across the city thronged the state party headquarters today to pressure the leadership not to accept the Trinamul Congresss humiliating terms on seat-sharing for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections.        
	The Congress had asked for 51 of the civic bodys 141 wards, but the ally agreed to give it only 21 at a meeting held between leaders of the two parties yesterday.         
	It is impossible for us to accept this, state party working president Subrata Mukherjee said today. Our leader Pranab Mukherjee should intervene and talk to Mamata Banerjee.        
	So far, the Congress has stuck to its demand for 51 seats, but the party realises that an honourable settlement would have to be worked out to keep its alliance with Trinamul afloat.        
	The party is faced with a dilemma: if it agrees to Trinamuls terms and settles for 21 seats, it knows it would not have a leg to stand on when the time comes to bargain for seats for next years Assembly polls. On the other hand, it realises that without Trinamul, which now appears to be riding a popularity wave, it would fare poorly in the polls.        
	Justifying the party workers resentment, Pradip Ghosh, a Congress leader in the city civic body, said they were worried about a larger political fallout.        
	If we accept what Trinamul is offering as leftover, our political existence will be at stake. Trinamul will gradually gobble up whatever political base we have in Calcutta. The situation may come to such a pass that we may not have the backbone to assert our claim for a considerable number of seats during next years Assembly polls, Ghosh said.         
	He explained that Trinamuls terms were humiliating because, of the 21 seats that it had agreed to offer, the Congress had won only eight in the last polls. It had lost the remaining 13 to the Left by huge margins.         
	Ghosh, who was among the Congress leaders at yesterdays meeting, said there must not be any repetition of the 2009 Lok Sabha polls in which we had made an abject surrender to Trinamul accepting its terms in toto.        
	Mamata Banerjee was closeted with her aides tonight on her return to Calcutta to take stock of yesterdays meeting. A Trinamul source said there was a possibility of another round of talks with the Congress tomorrow.        
	Time is short. The filing of nominations starts on Monday. Everything has to be sorted out by next week, a Congress leader said.         
	The filing of nominations will continue till May 3.        
	In a show of bravado, Pranab Basu, the president of the Congresss north Calcutta district unit, said the party was getting ready with a list of candidates for all the 141 wards. If Trinamul remains rigid in its stand, we may be left with no option but to fight independently, he said.         
	However, like other state Congress leaders, he too realises that the consequences of this would not be too happy for the party.         
	Winds of change are blowing across Bengal in favour of Trinamul, warned a state Congress leader.         
	So, the decision to field candidates from all the 141 wards may not go down well with the electorate. We have to think twice before making such announcements.

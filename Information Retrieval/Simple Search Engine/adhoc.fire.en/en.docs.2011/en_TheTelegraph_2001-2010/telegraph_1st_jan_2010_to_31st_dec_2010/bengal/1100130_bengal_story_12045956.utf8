The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM banks on Basu
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM banks on Basu
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 29: The CPM hopes to recover lost ground by harvesting the admiration people showed for Jyoti Basu through the turnouts at his last journey in Calcutta and condolence rallies in the districts.         
	Many who had deserted us or were not active in politics any more joined the rallies. The party has to articulate how it plans to bring these people back into our fold, a member of the state committee said after the first day of a three-day meeting.         
	At the meeting, state party secretary Biman Bose announced plans to honour Basus legacy by setting up a centre dedicated to his memory. The party will also circulate CDs containing Basus speeches and visuals of his rallies.         
	The Basu factor and success in some school and college polls has made a section of the party hopeful of a turnaround ahead of the elections to 82 civic bodies in what is being billed by some as a semi-final before the 2011 Assembly elections. The situation is not as bad as it was after the Lok Sabha elections. The people are listening to us again, a state secretariat member said.        
	In a bid to refurbish the partys image, Boses note on organisational revamp focused on bringing up younger and dynamic leaders.

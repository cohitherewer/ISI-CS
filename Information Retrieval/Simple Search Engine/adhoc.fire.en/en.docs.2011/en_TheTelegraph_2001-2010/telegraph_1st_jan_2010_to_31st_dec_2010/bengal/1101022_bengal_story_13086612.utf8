The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rebel pocket won, eye on rival belt   CPM clamour   for Nandi return
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rebel pocket won, eye on rival belt     CPM clamour   for Nandi return
          ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR                      Police guard the CPM office at Tamluk where about 500 party workers are staying after fleeing their homein Nandigram and Khejuri.                                      
	Tamluk, Oct. 21: One former stronghold reclaimed from rebels, time to march back into another held by rival.        
	CPM workers and supporters who fled Nandigram and Khejuri in East Midnapore since Trinamul Congresss 2008 rural poll sweep have become restless and are urging the leadership to organise a return, the demand spurred by the Left partys reclamation of Lalgarh and Dharampur in neighbouring West Midnapore.        
	But the CPM leadership is wary, as the ground realities in Nandigram and Khejuri, where Trinamul is in complete control, are different from the Maoist-infested Lalgarh-Dharampur belt where the joint forces backed the Left partys re-entry.        
	A member of the CPMs East Midnapore unit suggested that despite the odds stacked against the party, the recapture of Lalgarh and Dharampur had raised hopes among the ranks.         
	There is no doubt that Trinamul is in complete control of Nandigram and Khejuri and nearly 5,000 of our supporters and workers have fled their homes. But our workers in camps set up in party offices in Tamluk and Haldia are getting restless. If we can reclaim Nandigram and Khejuri, their morale will get a boost, the CPM leader said.                  A Trinamul camp nearby from where party workers keep watch on the CPM office.

	But along with the optimism came a realisation of the challenges. There are no joint forces in Nandigram-Khejuri to give us a backup, the CPM leader conceded.        
	Tamluk is about 60km from Nandigram and Khejuri. Haldia is across Haldi river, which flows by Nandigram. While party offices serve as camps, some workers have been staying in relatives homes too.         
	Patience is wearing thin among those rendered homeless in their own land. Farmer Mahadeb Maity (name changed), a CPM branch committee member, had fled home at Amdabad in Nandigram with his wife and two children in the wake of alleged Trinamul threats after last years Lok Sabha polls.         
	But now, the 35-year-old is restless, as are the 500 others put up with him at the camp in the Tamluk party office. My two-bigha plot is being cultivated by Trinamul supporters. They are enjoying the fish in my pond and milking my cows. Our party leaders are telling us that arrangements will be made for our return but nothing is being done, said Mahadeb.        
	He also complained about basics at the camps, saying initially the food was good and milk was given to his eight-year-old son and four-year-old-daughter. Even clothes were bought for them. But now we are fed rice, dal and boiled potato. We never had to live this way at home. Now I am desperate to return.        
	Netai Giri had also run away after the Lok Sabha elections  when Trinamul won the two East Midnapore seats  from his home in Nandigrams Bhekutia, leaving his wife and two daughters behind.         
	 How long will I stay away from my family? I have told my leaders that I want to return. I could not meet my family during Puja. My eldest daughter had gone to visit the family but Trinamul workers did not allow her into the village, the 50-year-old, who has been staying at the CPM office in Haldia, said.        
	The Trinamul is not unaware of the churning in the CPM camps and has started taking precautionary measures. Every evening, party activists scan the two roads leading to Khejuri and Nandigram, checking cars and buses. If new faces are spotted, the people are asked whether they have CPM links.        
	We have information that the CPM plans to recapture Nandigram and Khejuri. That is why we are keeping a close watch on the roads as well as on the CPM offices in Tamluk and Haldia where the party is making preparations for a recapture, said Mahmud Hossain, the Trinamuls East Midnapore general secretary.         
	But CPM district secretariat member Ashok Guria claimed Trinamul had unleashed terror to prevent the workers from returning home. Our party workers are eager to return home but Trinamul is creating an environment of terror to prevent them from coming back.        
	East Midnapore police chief Ashok Biswas said several meetings had been held to find ways to help those who had fled their homes. Trinamul did not attend any of the meetings. We are ready to provide protection to those who want to return.

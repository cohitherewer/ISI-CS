                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Shadow of fear in boy death 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rouvanjit                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 13: Rouvanjit Rawla, the Class VIII student of La Martiniere for Boys who hanged himself at home yesterday, had possibly done so out of fear of asking his father to meet the school principal over a case of indiscipline.        
	The principal confirmed that he had asked the boy to bring his parents on Monday.        
	There was a case of indiscipline yesterday and his parents were called for. A note had been written in his diary asking his father to meet me on Monday afternoon, Sunirmal Chakravarthi told The Telegraph.         
	Chakravarthi refused to conjecture about whether calling the parents to school had anything to do with the boys suicide. We are all in a state of shock. He was a vibrant boy and was one of our own. His father told us it was an accident and we havent heard any differently, he said.        
	The last time the principal saw the boy, Rouvan to friends, was at 10.45am yesterday. The school gave over at 11.         
	He was found hanging from a rope, attached to a hook in the ceiling of a storeroom on the terrace of his Alipore home, around 4pm.        
	The preliminary medical examination of the body clearly indicated suicide. We are yet to ascertain the reason that made the boy take his life, said Mohammad Kalimuddin, the officer in charge of Alipore police station. A post-mortem was done today.        
	The family refused to talk about the incident. Father Ajay Rawla, who owns a furniture and furnishing shop on Theatre Road, only said: It is a matter of personal grief. I dont want to talk about it.        
	Rouvanjit was the youngest of Rawlas three children.        
	The family has not filed any complaint with the police and the cops, on their part, have only registered an unnatural death case.        
	The police said that when Rouvanjit could not be seen for some time yesterday, their sweeper started looking for him and found the storeroom locked from inside. When repeated knocking went unanswered, he, along with another domestic help, pushed open a second door.        
	Rouvanjits friends were shocked. God, cant believe this, read a post on social networking site Facebook. ... You were too young for this and definitely didnt deserve this.        
	The school observed a minutes silence for Rouvanjit and his family before a sports event today.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Nov. 8: Suspected Maoists and Peoples Committee activists killed four people in West Midnapore and engaged police in an encounter in Bankura over the past 24 hours as the rebels today organised a country-wide bandh to protest Barack Obamas visit.        
	Peoples Committee activists allegedly hacked to death three persons, including the mother of a CRPF jawan and the brother of a police officer, in Kismat-Ganakkata village, 6km from Jhargram, last night.        
	This is the first time the rebels have targeted relatives of security forces in Jungle Mahal since the beginning of the Maoist movement in the state in November 2008. The activists also killed a former CPM branch committee member during the raid on the village.         
	This morning, motorcycle-borne Maoists allegedly shot dead Kanailal Roy, a CPI branch committee member, in Uttara village, around 20km from Kismat-Ganakkata.        
	Those killed in Kismat-Ganakkata have been identified as Sandhya Mahato, 55, whose son Gouranga is a CRPF jawan posted in Jharkhand, Sheikh Wahed Ali, 58, the elder brother of assistant sub-inspector Sheikh Jamshed, and former CPM member Rashbehari Mahato, 38.        
	The police said a group of four Peoples Committee activists arrived at the village around 8pm yesterday.        
	They first went to Sandhyas house. They were wearing black dresses and their faces were covered. They asked my wife to accompany them, said Manoranjan, Sandhyas husband. When I protested, they told me that if my wife did not go with them, they would shoot her immediately, Manoranjan said.        
	This morning, some neighbours told me that the bodies of Sandhya, Wahed Ali and Rashbehari were lying beside a road in the village, Manoranjan said.        
	Waheds wife Soydon said the couple were about to have dinner when four men in black entered their house. They took him away, she said. Wahed was a Group D employee at the Jhargram block development office.        
	The Peoples Committee activists then dragged Rashbehari out of his house. A villager, who saw Sandhya, Wahed and Rashbehari being taken away, said the activists were accusing the trio of being police informers.         
	District superintendent of police Manoj Verma said Sandhya and Wahed had participated in an anti-Peoples Committee rally organised by the residents of Kismat-Ganakkata last week.         
	In Bankura, the police raided a Maoist camp in the Lithira forest. The afternoon encounter continued for half an hour but no one was arrested.

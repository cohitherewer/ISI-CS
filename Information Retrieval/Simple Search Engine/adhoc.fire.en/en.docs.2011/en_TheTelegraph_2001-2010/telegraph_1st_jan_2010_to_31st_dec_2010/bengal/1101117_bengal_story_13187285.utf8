          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bankura, Nov. 16: A 21-year-old woman Maoist apparently promoted up the ranks by rebel spearhead Kishan gave herself up in Bankura today and accused her rebel colleagues of physically and mentally torturing her after having tricked her into joining them.        
	Rumpa Mahatos surrender is the first such case in Bankura since the Bengal government announced a rehabilitation package in May for rebels who wish to return to the mainstream. The woman, a deputy commander of the outfit, hails from Salboni in neighbouring West Midnapore but said she chose Bankura because she felt safer there.         
	This August, West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma had claimed that another Maoist woman squad member, Sova Mandi, had surrendered but The Telegraph had found she had been in police custody since April.        
	According to Bankura superintendent of police Pranab Kumar, Rumpa, also known as Ashtami and Sujata, had contacted them about four days back saying she wanted to surrender.         
	Replying to questions with her head down and face covered with hands, Rumpa said she had joined the Maoists a year and a half ago. I was lured by a job offer and tricked into joining. They coaxed me to stay on and trained me. But recently, they had begun to physically and mentally torture me. So I decided to leave.        
	Rumpa said she had been made a deputy squad commander about seven months ago after I met Kishanji.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 2: A fake appointment handed to a man by the office of the Basirhat additional district inspector of schools (ADIS) has ripped the lid off what could be a job racket involving non-teaching posts in schools across North 24-Parganas.         
	Basirhat ADIS Sharmistha Das told Calcutta High Court on Tuesday that around 100 people had received appointment letters for non-existent clerical posts at various schools in the district. She said she suspected some employees at the district inspector of schools office and the offices of the ADIS in the subdivisions were running a job racket.         
	The issue came to light after one Jayprakash Mahapatra moved the high court in September last year saying the Basirhat ADISs office had handed him an appointment letter for the post of a clerk in Gabberia Kalicharan Sibani High School in the district but when he went to the institution, he was told there was no vacancy.         
	The high court had then directed the Basirhat ADISs office that Mahapatra be given the job. The Basirhat resident filed a contempt petition in the court in November this year after failing to get the job despite the order.         
	Das on Tuesday told the court she had received the contempt notice but pleaded helplessness in Mahapatras case because no memo had been issued by her department regarding the appointment.         
	She filed a petition in the court, requesting that an appropriate investigating agency conduct a probe into the issuance of false appointment letters. The court will consider Dass appeal on December 15.        
	According to Dass petition, on January 15 last year, a fake memo was issued from the district school inspectors office announcing the appointment of clerks to some schools in North 24-Parganas.         
	Accordingly, Das said, a panel was made on February 8 last year, in which Mahapatras name figured on top.         
	But later, it was found none of the posts for which the appointments had been given had vacancies, the Basirhat ADISs petition says.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dance to celebrate deaths
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Dance to celebrate deaths
          PRONAB MONDAL                                            
	Calcutta, June 28: Bapi Mahato and his men danced to I am a disco dancer and drank to their merriment after derailing the Jnaneswari Express, CBI sleuths have concluded from his orders to arrange for a bottle and the music in phone intercepts.        
	The party to celebrate the carnage that left 150 people dead took place somewhere at Indraboni, a village about 6km from the place where the train was thrown off the tracks on May 28.        
	A CBI officer said the intercept had left them stunned. The party went on for hours after the tragedy.         
	The CID, which had recorded Bapis purported conversations, has handed the intercepts over to the CBI. The central bureau has taken over the probe into the sabotage that led to the tragedy.        
	Bapi, one of the prime accused in the case, was arrested from a lodge on the fringes of Jamshedpur last Sunday.         
	In one of the intercepts, he allegedly gloats over the successful operation after being told about several casualties.         
	CBI sources said Bapi had sent a man around the dawn of May 28 to see the impact of the operation. The conversation, recorded around 6am, ran like this:        
	Caller: It was major accident, the passenger train rammed into a goods trainseveral people died... many of them are screaming for help.        
	Bapi: Really? The goods train hit the passenger train?        
	Caller: Yes dada. A number of policemen are here and media people.        
	Bapi: Ok, let it pass. Our jobs done.        
	In one conversation, Bapi is said to have threatened to turn the Manikpara area into a shashan (burning ghat).        
	The village, 8km from Jhargram town, is apparently where the strike on the tracks was finalised. But the meeting could not be completed because of a police raid and Bapi suspected there were moles among the villagers. This phone chat was held a day after the raid and Bapi was in a very foul mood, a police officer said.         
	The first suggestion of celebrations emerged when the cops intercepted a call on May 28 afternoon. It went like this:        
	Bapi: Where are you?        
	Aide: In front of Kaladas shop.        
	Bapi: Whats happening there?        
	Aide: Police are swarming the area.         
	Bapi: Oshob chhar boro ekta jogar kor khaoa daoa hobey (Let that be arrange for a big one well eat and drink).        
	Aide: Kothay pabo (where will I get the big one) the police are all over the place.         
	Bapi: I dont want to hear all that. Youll have to get the bottle.         
	By then the police were constantly monitoring the phone conversations of Bapi and his associates. If the police version is true, Bapi was oblivious of the fact that his phone could be tapped.        
	The celebrations came to light when Bapi received a call during the party. We heard the chartbuster from the Mithun Chakraborty film. They possibly used loudspeakers, a CBI officer said.        
	Bapis phone was under the scanner till May 31. It was found switched off after that. It appears that he was not allowed to use his phone after Maoists leaders reached the area to seek an explanation from him why he had carried out the operation without informing them? He was taken away by the leaders after that. But we never heard him express any remorse in the three days after the incident in his interactions over the phone, the officer said.        
	Bapi was today produced in the CBIs special court in Calcutta, which sent him to a days jail custody. The court will record his statement tomorrow.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Test relief for ragging trio
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           The girls being led to a Durgapur court on Thursday. (Gour Sharma)                                  
	Durgapur, Dec. 10: Three girls of a Durgapur engineering college arrested for allegedly driving a junior to the brink of suicide will be allowed to take their ongoing exams and be brought back to their lock-ups.        
	The relief was granted today by a local court, a day after the trio from the National Power Training Institute (NPTI) were denied bail and remanded in judicial custody for five days.         
	Subhasree Dhar, Arpita Das and Deblina Haldar will be produced again in court on December 14, but no exams are scheduled that day.        
	The final-year students, all from Calcutta, had been found guilty in an internal probe by the institute of torturing first-year student Satarupa Das, who tried to commit suicide by slashing her wrists last month.        
	Today, the accused were driven to the campus from jail in a Scorpio with police escort around 1.45pm, 15 minutes before the exam was scheduled to start. They were brought back to jail after the test three hours later.        
	According to the courts directive, we had made arrangements for the three girls to appear for the ongoing seventh semester exam which will continue till December 22. The girls were taken to the examination hall with police escort and left for jail after the test was over, said M. Arunachalam, the director of the institute.         
	Satarupa, who also hails from Calcutta and had been staying with her parents for some time after the suicide attempt, returned recently to the college. She has appeared for the tests.        
	The college authorities are planning separate punishments and said the action would affect the girls academic future. Another institute official said scholarships could be denied to them if they applied for it in the future.        
	Our own inquiry found them guilty and we informed the police. We will take stern action against them but they will be allowed to appear in the semester exam. However, the suspension order still remains and they will not be permitted to stay in the hostel, Arunachalam had said yesterday.        
	The girls had been asked to vacate their hostel on November 19 after Satarupa brought the charges against them and her father lodged a complaint with the institute. The college filed an FIR after its probe, leading to the arrests.

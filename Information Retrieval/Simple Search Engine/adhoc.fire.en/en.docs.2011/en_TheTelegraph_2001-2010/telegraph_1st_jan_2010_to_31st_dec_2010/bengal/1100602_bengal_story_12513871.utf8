The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cops sleeping: Ghisingh
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cops sleeping: Ghisingh
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, June 1: Subash Ghisingh today said it was frustrating to see Buddhadeb Bhatta- charjees police sleeping but reminded the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha that the state was unlikely to ever agree to carve up Bengal.        
	During Jyoti Basus regime, the police force was alive, but now the force (under Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) seems to be sleeping and its activities have come down to zero. It is because of the pathetic condition of the police that despite so many atrocities, law and order cant be restored in the hills, said the Gorkha National Liberation Front leader who had been forced by the Morcha to leave the hills two years ago.        
	We mourn the death of Madan Tamang (murdered by suspected Morcha supporters). We fear more political murders if the hill police continue to remain spectators, he added.         
	Ghisinghs writ ran in the hills until the Bimal Gurung-led Morcha pushed him into a corner. Today, sitting in his rented house in Jalpaiguri, he accused Gurung of using terror tactics. (Madan Tamang) was my political rival. But I had never threatened any rival leader or organised an attack on them. It is a new terror tactics in the hills and the police have to take steps to bring back normality. Otherwise, the situation will deteriorate.        
	The GNLF wants the state and Centre to confer Sixth Schedule status on the hills.         
	The Morcha leaders must understand that neither the state nor the Centre are interested in meeting its demand for Gorkhaland, Ghisingh said.        
	Under the Sixth Schedule, additional legislative, administrative and financial powers would have to be given to a new council meant to run the hills. The only solution to resolve the hill impasse, according to Ghisingh, is increased powers for the hill body and local elections in which the GNLF will participate.         
	He added that the Morcha move to rename the Gorkhaland it wants as Gorkha-Adivasi Pradesh did not make much sense.

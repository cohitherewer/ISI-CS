          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 28: A college teacher who had allegedly molested a girl student in 2007 has confessed to having slapped and abused her in public for making the accusation and has tendered an unconditional apology.         
	Sources said Indubhusan Mondal, a reader at the Viharilal College of Home and Social Sciences in New Alipore, had made the confession yesterday before the Calcutta University syndicate, the varsitys highest decision-making body.         
	The teacher had been suspended in May after the universitys sexual harassment cell and a one-member committee comprising a former high court judge found him guilty of molesting the student.         
	He could face harsher punishment if she refuses to pardon him. He can be sacked if the victim refuses to forgive him, a syndicate member said.

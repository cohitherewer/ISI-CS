The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Coal thief shot dead
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Coal thief shot dead
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, May 9: An alleged coal pilferer was shot dead and another injured when Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel opened fire on a group of about 100 people stealing coal from a washery near the Santaldih power plant in Purulia this morning.        
	Theft from the coal washing unit, about 270km northwest of Calcutta, is common but villagers had poured into the facility today after getting wind that some of the sentries posted there were unarmed.        
	The scale of the raid was such that the plant authorities were forced to rush in armed reinforcements around 6am.        
	In the looting frenzy, the villagers overlooked the guns and tried to drive the jawans away with stones. The force retaliated.         
	The Telegraph had carried an expose on how daylight looting of coal from wagons and mines in the state resulted in below-capacity generation by power plants and long and frequent power cuts.         
	Todays crackdown was the first of its kind in the region in recent memory. A police officer said he could not recall another incident of a coal pilferer being shot dead in the Purulia and Bankura districts.        
	Anil Pandey, the CISF commanding officer based in Dhanbad, said: Between 100 and 150 people had trespassed into the washing plant compound through an opening in a wall.         
	Pandey said pilfering by groups of two to 10 people took place every day. But the villagers got news that two of our men were unarmed today and tried to use the opportunity.         
	Of the two villagers hit by bullets, Janardhan Mahata, 22, was killed. The resident of nearby Ushir village took a bullet in his neck.         
	The washing unit, which handles over 20,000 tonnes of coal every day, is run by Eastern Coalfields Ltd. The coal arrives by train from mines in Orissa and Jharkhand, is washed, and sent off in trucks to power plants  Santaldih and nearby Mejia among them  as well as steel plants in Jamshedpur and Durgapur.        
	About 250 villagers blocked the plants gates today in protest, not allowing work. One of them, Gopal Mahata, alleged that CISF and washing plant personnel themselves stole coal every day by loading 50 per cent more on the trucks than what the invoice says.

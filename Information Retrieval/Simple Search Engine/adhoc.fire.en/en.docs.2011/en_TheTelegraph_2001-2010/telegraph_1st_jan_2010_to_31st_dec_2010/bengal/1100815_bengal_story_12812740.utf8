The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Students caned for speaking to girl
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Students caned for speaking to girl
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Saheb, who was left with a broken finger after the caning. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Howrah, Aug. 14: Two students of a Howrah school were caned by the headmaster yesterday for talking to a girl who happened to be the sister of one of them. While one boy was left with a fractured finger, the other suffered bruises on his arms and his back.         
	Saheb Naskar, 15, a Class IX student at Joynagar Pallisree Vidyaniketan in Howrahs Panchla, said he was speaking to his sister, who studies in Class VI, on the terrace during the lunch break yesterday. Ranajit Ray of Class X had accompanied him.         
	After the headmaster spotted us, he started caning me and Ranajit. I told him we were speaking to my sister but he did not listen, Saheb said. He has lodged a complaint against headmaster Biplab Manna at Panchla police station.         
	Saheb has suffered a fracture in the little finger of his left hand. Both the boys have been left with cane marks on their back and hands. Saheb was taken to a local hospital where an X-ray confirmed the fracture. His finger has been put in a plaster.        
	Manna, however, said the boys had broken school rules. The students are not allowed to leave their classrooms during the lunch break, except for going to the toilet. But I saw the duo speaking to a girl during the break, he said.        
	We strictly enforce the rule because it is not easy for just 20 teachers to keep an eye on 2,000 students, he added.        
	Manna shrugged off Sahebs claim that he was speaking to his sister. It is difficult to know in the crowd who is a sister and who is not.        
	The police have charged the headmaster with sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha rivals
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Morcha rivals

	Darjeeling, June 7: Around 40 of Madan Tamangs supporters today demonstrated in front of Darjeeling police station demanding the arrest of his murderers, the protest more symbolic of hill opposition parties trying to regroup and make their presence felt than a show of numerical strength.         
	People are still terrorised and they have not dared to come out in our support. However, we are confident that they will support us, said Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League leader Mohan Sharma.         
	Suspected Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters had ki-lled Tamang on May 21. The Morcha has in the past been accused of bludgeoning attempts by its rivals to assert themselves. Defiance overcame fear at Tamangs funeral with some people even telling Morcha chief Bimal Gurung to leave Darjeeling. But Gurung responded by leading a 100-car convoy to the town.        
	A conglomeration of seven outfits plastered posters this evening, appealing to people to support democratic forces.

  - Trinamul attacks could jeopardise ties: Cong leader        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata with Mukherjee at his Dhakuria home on Friday. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Calcutta, Nov. 19: State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya today warned the Trinamul Congress leadership that its repeated invectives against the Congress might jeopardise the alliance.        
	At a time lakhs of youths are joining the state Congress under the stewardship of Rahul Gandhi, some people have started attacking our party and our leaders. They are jealous and upset that the state Congress is getting back on its feet, Bhuniya told a news conference.        
	Such invectives and remarks against the Congress will hurt and jeopardise the (Congress-Trinamul) alliance before next years Assembly polls.        
	Bhuniya took no names but the immediate provocation for his outburst could be Trinamul MLA Madan Mitras calling him a CPM agent yesterday. Some people may call me a stooge but please dont attack my party, Bhuniya said. Please stop this war against us. The elections are not too far away. Launch your fight against the CPM.        
	Taking a swipe at Trinamul, he said those who have left the Congress and were criticising him had earlier used the same words to tarnish Somen Mitra and Subrata Mukherjee. They had called both leaders CPM stooges when the duo were in the Congress. But now Mitra and Mukherjee have joined their party, Bhuniya said.        
	Her (Mamata Banerjees) party leaders have gone to Sabang (Bhuniyas constituency) and called me a makaal phal (useless person) on her instructions, he complained.        
	The slanging match apparently figured in talks between Mamata and Pranab Mukherjee when the two met at his Dhakuria home late tonight. The two leaders made no mention in public of the spat but said they discussed the 2G spectrum controversy  a matter over which she had assured the Prime Minister of her support yesterday itself.        
	Bhuniya also came down heavily on the younger Trinamul leaders too. In an allusion to MP Subhendu Adhikari, he said: Another phochke (young, immature person) joined politics the other day with his fathers backing and is now calling me a CPM stooge.        
	Madan Mitras barb about Bhuniya being a CPM agent had come after the state Congress chief had said on Wednesday that Rajarhats development should not suffer because of political battles. His comment came at a time Mamata has accused the state government of forcibly acquiring land from Rajarhat farmers.        
	Today, Bhuniya claimed his remarks on Rajarhat had been distorted. I never spoke in favour of (housing minister) Gautam Deb or the state government on this issue.        
	The way the price of the land and the compensation were fixed has not been satisfactory at all. The government should conduct a high-level probe and find out whether Gautambabu is guilty. If found guilty, he should be punished.        
	Congress sources said state party leaders would complain to Mukherjee about Trinamuls repeated attacks.        
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee refused to comment on Bhuniyas diatribe but Madan Mitra stuck to his guns. The people of Bengal know how close he (Bhuniya) is to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, he said.        
	K. Keshava Rao, who minds the Congresss Bengal affairs, expressed unhappiness that a leader of our alliance partner had called Bhuniya a CPM agent. It is in bad taste to call Manasda a CPM agent.

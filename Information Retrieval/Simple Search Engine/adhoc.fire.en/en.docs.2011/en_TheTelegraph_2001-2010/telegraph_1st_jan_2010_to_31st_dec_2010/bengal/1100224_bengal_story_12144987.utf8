          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met governor M.K. Narayanan this evening to update him on steps the state had taken in the wake of the Maoist strike at Shilda.         
	The two were closeted in the governors study for about an hour from around 6pm.         
	A source close to the chief minister said the one-to-one took place after the district magistrates and police chiefs of Maoist-hit West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia had briefed Bhattacharjee. He (Bhattacharjee) went prepared to brief the governor, a former national security adviser, the source said.         
	Raj Bhavan officials said the governor wanted to know if development projects were being carried out in the Maoist-hit areas along with the offensive by the joint forces.         
	The governor appeared satisfied after the meeting, a Raj Bhavan official said.         
	The governor had summoned the state home secretary and police chief last Wednesday amid reports that intelligence about a guerrilla build-up at Shilda had been ignored.

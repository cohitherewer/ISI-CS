          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 12: Mamata Banerjee is likely to seek an explanation from Jadavpur MP Kabir Suman for his public utterances against the partys avowed stand on Maoists.         
	A Trinamul source said from Delhi tonight that the move followed a flurry of calls from party workers and leaders demanding action against the MP.         
	Suman had declared on live television yesterday that had he attended a news conference with his party chief a few days ago, he would have had no option but to stand up and oppose her view on sending the army to crush Maoists.        
	Mamata, who met Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina tonight, is expected to return to Calcutta tomorrow.         
	A defiant Suman said in close circles today that he would soon write to Union home minister P. Chidambaram requesting him to stop sending forces to combat the Maoists and instead lay emphasis on eradicating poverty.        
	A Trinamul junior minister said from Delhi Mamata had made it clear to some of them that she would not tolerate indiscipline.        
	Trinamuls chief whip in Parliament, Sudip Bandopadhyay, said he tried to speak to Suman today but was told that the MP was seriously ill and had been advised bed rest for two weeks. I got a call from Sumans niece, who told me her uncle would not be able to speak.... I was also told that he would not be part of a parliamentary team for Turkey and Egypt, he added.

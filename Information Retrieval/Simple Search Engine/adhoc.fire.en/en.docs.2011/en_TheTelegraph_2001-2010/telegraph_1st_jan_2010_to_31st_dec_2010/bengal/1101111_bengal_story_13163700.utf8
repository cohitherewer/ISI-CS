	Calcutta, Nov. 10: Top government officials and police today agreed at a meeting that steps should be taken to seize illegal arms stocked by political parties in the districts.        
	At the meeting, chaired by chief secretary Samar Ghosh at Bhabani Bhavan, the officials expressed concern over the growing incidents of political violence in the state.        
	It was decided that the superintendents of police in the districts, especially those affected by Maoists, should be more proactive in seizing illegal arms, an official who attended the meeting said.        
	The police have been asked to identify the places from where illegal arms were being smuggled into the districts.

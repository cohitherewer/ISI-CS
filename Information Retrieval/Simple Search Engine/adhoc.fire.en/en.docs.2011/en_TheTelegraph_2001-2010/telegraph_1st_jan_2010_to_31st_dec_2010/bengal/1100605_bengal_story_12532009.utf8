The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sand politics turns bloody
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Sand politics turns bloody
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, June 4: Three CPM supporters, who were cousins, were beaten to death allegedly by Trinamul Congress supporters in a Birbhum village last night.        
	Police said the killing was possibly the fallout of rivalry over lifting of sand from the bank of the Ajoy in Labhpur, 250km from Calcutta.        
	The murdered trio  Dhanu Sheikh, 55, Koton Sheikh, 48, and Oishoddin Sheikh, 45  had been opposing the entry of a man from nearby Murshidabad to lift sand from the riverbank. There are already two others who do the job with valid permits.        
	The cousins used to buy sand from the two permit-holders and were apparently worried about their pitch being queered with the arrival of the third person. Sources at Buniadanga village said some Trinamul supporters, who are backing the Murshidabad man, were opposed to the trio.         
	The sand trade is worth over Rs 70,000 a day.        
	Kotons wife Fujila Bibi said a group had called her husband and his cousins to a house last night to resolve a village dispute. She told us the brothers had been called to the house of a Trinamul supporter, a police officer said. However, they were found dead on a field 150 metres from the house of the Trinamul supporter.         
	The CPM accused a Trinamul leader of masterminding the murders. He had called them last night to discuss matters related to the trading of sand, said Paltu Konar, the CPMs Labhpur zonal committee secretary.         
	Trinamul leaders said vi-llagers had attacked the trio after they raided local party worker Monirul Islams house. The three had attacked the house of our worker, Monirul. The villagers resisted that attempt and beat them up, said Trinamul Congress district president Anubrata Mondal.        
	The police raided the area today and detained six people for interrogation.         
	We have detained six people and we hope to make some arrests soon, Birbhum superintendent of police Rabindranath Mukherjee said.        
	Cong man killed        
	A Congress panchayat member was shot at and hacked to death in a village mart in Murshidabads Hariharpara this afternoon.         
	Block Congress chief Mir Alamgir alleged that CPM-backed goons had killed Nurul Islam, 55, because it was under his leadership that the party had been able to topple the local CPM-ruled panchayat board. Two CPM members had defected to the Congress, triggering the change. Nurul was a strong contender for the post of pradhan, said Alamgir.

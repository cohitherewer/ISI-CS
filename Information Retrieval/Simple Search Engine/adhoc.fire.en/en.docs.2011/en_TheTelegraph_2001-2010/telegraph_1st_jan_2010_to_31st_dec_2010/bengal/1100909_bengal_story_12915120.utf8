	Jamuria (Burdwan), Sept. 8: If you cant stop them from pilfering coal, levy a pilfering tax.        
	Unemployed villagers in Asansols Jamuria are extorting money from coal thieves after their attempts to stop them from smuggling failed. The villagers have formed syndicates whose members stop trucks and bullock carts carrying smuggled coal and extort money.        
	Although police claimed they had no knowledge of such extortions, the practice has been continuing for the past six months in around a dozen Jamuria villages, including Bijoynagar, Ikra, Baijayantipur, Nandi, Chakdola, Belbandh, Sheikpur, Janbazaar and Pariharpur. Illegal mining is rampant in these villages.        
	The villagers said they had tried to draw the authorities attention to the pilfering by blocking roads and stopping vehicles carrying smuggled coal but no action was taken.         
	We gradually understood that neither the police nor the political parties are interested in stopping the theft. After all our efforts went in vain, we decided to extort money from the pilferers. Several syndicates have been set up over the past six months to stop trucks and bullock carts carrying coal from illegal mines, said Madan Singh (name changed), a resident of Pariharpur.        
	The members of the syndicates wait under trees beside the roads the pilferers take to transport the coal. The tax for transporting smuggled coal is between Rs 30 and Rs 50 for every bullock cart and between Rs 100 and Rs 300 for every truck. The amount depends on the amount of coal transported.        
	According to villagers, about 100 bullock carts and 20 to 25 trucks are stopped daily in each village.        
	The money collected by each syndicate is deposited in a box and distributed among its members at the end of the day.         
	We collect between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,000 every day. Each of us earn around Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 a month, said Saikat Roy (name changed), a resident of Bijoynagar.        
	During the football World Cup in June, I bought a 21-inch colour TV, he added. Madan Singh of Pariharpur said he was saving money to buy a DVD player.        
	Sheikh Dildar (name changed), a coal smuggler in Jamuria, said the pilferers had to pay the villagers to ensure smooth transportation of stolen coal.         
	We cannot avoid the villagers as they dont allow our vehicles to move until we cough up the money, he said.        
	On August 17, some residents of Bijoynagar stopped 40 Eastern Coalfields trucks, mistaking them for vehicles carrying pilfered coal. The trucks were allowed to leave after the drivers called up the police.        
	We sent a force to free the trucks. The villagers were demanding money from them. However, I dont know whether they collect money from coal smugglers on a regular basis. Jamuria is a big place and it is difficult for us to stop illegal mining there, said R. Rajshekharan, the Burdwan superintendent of police.         
	Pilfering is common in the Durgapur-Asansol coal belt, which includes Jamuria, often triggering fear of subsidence in residential areas because of the pits dug up by illegal miners.        
	Convoys of coal-laden bullock carts and trucks regularly pass through villages in the belt. The coal thieves allegedly pay money to the police to look the other way. The Telegraph had carried a series of articles exposing the rampant theft of coal in the belt.        
	A headmaster in Jamurias Bakshimulia recently wrote to the district administration, asking it to either transfer him or close the school if it could not stop illegal mining around the institution.

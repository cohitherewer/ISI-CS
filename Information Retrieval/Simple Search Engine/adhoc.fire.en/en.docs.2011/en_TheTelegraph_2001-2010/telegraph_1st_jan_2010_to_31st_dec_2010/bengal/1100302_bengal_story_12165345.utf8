The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tudu body unclaimed
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Tudu body unclaimed
          PRONAB MONDAL                           Tudu                                  
	Lalgarh, March 1: The body of Lalmohan Tudu, the president of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, will be declared unidentified in another 72 hours if none from his family claims it.        
	According to polices account, Tudu was killed in retaliatory fire when Maoists attacked the Kantapahari CRPF camp in West Midnapore. The police claimed that they found Tudus body at the edge of a forest.        
	But the tribal outfit and Tudus neighbours in Narcha village, 3km from the Kantapahari camp, have alleged that the Peoples Committee leader was taken away by cops from his house and shot dead in a paddy field nearby.        
	Since no one in the family has come forward to identify the body and sign the paper saying this is Lalmohan Tudu, he will be buried as an identified person, West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said.         
	A police officer said the period of waiting before disposing of an unidentified body is seven days, but in Tudus case, the police have allowed three days more. Tudu was killed on the night of February 22.        
	Sources said this evening that even the three-day longer deadline could be extended if the situation required but Tudus family is believed to have performed the last rites using an effigy of the tribal leader for his body.         
	His widow Lakshimani told The Telegraph: How can we trust them (the administration)? They staged a fake encounter and killed him. We fear the police will arrest us saying we are hardcore Maoists if we go to collect the body.        
	Lakshimani said her husband always suffered from cold and fever and was unfit to run even a hundred metres. How could he have been fighting along with the Maoists, she said.        
	West Midnapore police refused to hand over Tudus body to the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights that sent a team from Calcutta on Thursday. The outfit today filed a petition in Calcutta High Court seeking an order for the bodys handover so that a proper cremation can be done. The group filed the petition along with Dhaniram Kisku, who claims to be Tudus relative. But the police have said only blood relations can claim the body.        
	Maoists kill one        
	Suspected Maoists today killed the brother of a CPM leader in Purulia. Biswanath Mondal, 35, a grocer and brother of Yudhistir, the CPM deputy chief of the Balarampur panchayat samiti, was shot four times in the head inside his shop at 6pm.

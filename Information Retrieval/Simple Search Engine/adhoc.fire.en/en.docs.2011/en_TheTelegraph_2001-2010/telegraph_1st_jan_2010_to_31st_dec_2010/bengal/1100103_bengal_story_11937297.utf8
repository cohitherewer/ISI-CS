The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Basu stable after early scare
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Basu stable after early scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 2: Jyoti Basu had to be shifted to the intensive care unit early this morning after his condition deteriorated.         
	Doctors said in the evening that he was stable.         
	The 95-year-old CPM leader, suffering from pneumonia, has been put on non-invasive respiratory support.         
	His rate of breathing had gone up late last night, which means the respiratory distress had increased. He had also become drowsy and the urine output had reduced and so he was shifted to the ICU around 1.30am, said a doctor at the Salt Lake hospital where Basu was admitted last evening.        
	His condition remains the same and there has not been much of an improvement from how he was when he was admitted, said an official.         
	But he is responding to treatment.        
	A BiPap machine is being used to pump air into Basus lungs. It is a step short of a ventilator, which is invasive because a tube from it is inserted through the windpipe to help in artificial respiration, said a doctor.         
	BiPap is used for patients who can breathe on their own but need more air in their lungs. Patients are put on the ventilator when they cannot breathe on their own.         
	Doctors said Basu was conscious. They quoted him as saying: I want to go home. I dont want to stay in hospital.        
	According to sources, Basu was reluctant to go to the hospital yesterday. When doctors decided to shift him after some basic tests at his home, he told them: I cant see nor hear properly, so why are you taking me to the hospital?         
	Today, Basu was on a liquid diet and heavy doses of antibiotics. A series of blood tests was done through the day, which revealed that he still had the chest infection.        
	However, the clot in his brain, which had formed after he fell at home in 2008, has shrunk significantly. The clot has shrunk significantly and has become negligible now, a doctor said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee went to see Basu at the hospital. President Pratibha Patil sent flowers.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Sainthia duo own up to diversion mistake
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, July 23: The two booked off officials at Sainthia station have admitted that they had not applied the interlocking system that could have diverted the speeding Uttar Banga Express and prevented the July 19 tragedy, a railway source said today.         
	The cabin operator and the assistant station manager were on duty when the Uttar Banga Express rammed into the Vananchal Express, killing 62 people.        
	They had committed a mistake by not applying the system to divert the train to another track. They have admitted their mistake in front of the inquiry committee. They have already been temporarily taken off duty, the source said.         
	Today, CID officials probing the tragedy said they had found a broken brake-shoe beside the tracks near Mayurakshi bridge, which the Uttar Banga Express had crossed before hurtling into Sainthia station. The bridge is 1km from the station.        
	The sleuths are yet to ascertain whether the brake-shoe had split off the wheels of the Uttar Banga Express.         
	Experts from the forensic department will examine the brakes of the Uttar Banga Express to ascertain whether the drivers had applied them to try and bring the train to a halt.         
	They will also examine whether the brakes were functioning properly, a CID officer said.        
	Railway officials, however, said one brake-shoe falling off would not have created any problem.        
	Each coach has eight pairs of wheels with one brake-shoe for each wheel. If one of the 16 brake-shoes fall off, it wont affect the braking system, a railway official said.        
	The post-mortem report of the two drivers of Uttar Banga Express has confirmed that they were not drunk.         
	The police are also waiting for the viscera report of the two drivers. The report will reveal whether they had been drugged.

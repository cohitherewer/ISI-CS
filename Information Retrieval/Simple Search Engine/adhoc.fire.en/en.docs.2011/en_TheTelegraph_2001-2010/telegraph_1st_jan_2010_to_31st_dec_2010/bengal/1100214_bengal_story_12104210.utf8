	Feb. 13: Mamata Banerjee today echoed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee when she called Maoists cowards who would scoot in the face of resistance.        
	The Maoists are out to stop development work by resorting to the use of arms. They are cowards and, if you (the people) resist, they will be forced to get back into their hole, she told a railway programme in Maoist-hit West Midnapore.        
	The chief minister had branded Maoists cowards who operate under the cover of darkness and flee into the jungles after committing murders. Bhattacharjee had also accused Mamatas party of working together with the guerrillas to eliminate CPM activists.        
	A spate of attacks on railway tracks, however, appeared to have angered Mamata, the railway minister. I dont know why the Maoists are targeting railway tracks. Almost everyday tracks are being blown off, causing severe disruption. This is resulting in huge losses for the railways and the people should resist the menace, she said.         
	At a rally in Jhargram on January 15, Mamata had declared her willingness to touch the feet of Maoists to nudge them towards the talks table. In her 25-minute speech today, she targeted Maoists more than the CPM, said a Trinamul general secretary who attended the programme at Midnapore town.         
	The railway minister flagged off three local trains today and signed a memorandum of understanding with IIT Kharagpur for a centre for railway research.        
	In Calcutta, state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the chief minister would speak to his counterparts in Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa next week to chalk out plans for a joint operation.

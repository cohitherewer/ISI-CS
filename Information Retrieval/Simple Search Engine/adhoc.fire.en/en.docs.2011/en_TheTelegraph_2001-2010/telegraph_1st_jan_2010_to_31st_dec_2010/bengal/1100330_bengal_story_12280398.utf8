          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, March 29: A pen company manager from Howrahs Andul was found hanging in a hotel room in Bolpur town today, with police saying he had left behind several notes blaming some senior officials of the firm for his suicide.        
	Kali Prasad Maji, working for the Mumbai-based Montex, was found dead by the police who broke open the door to his room after repeated knocks by the hotel employees went unanswered.        
	Maji, whose office is on Chetla Road in Calcutta, had checked in on Saturday, and mentioned his purpose of visit in the hotel register as official.         
	He is survived by his wife Pratima and 11-year-daughter Sneha.        
	Majis younger brother Mukti Prasad arrived from their house in Andul to identify the body. After seeing the notes left behind by my brother, I believe he was being mentally tortured. After the rituals are completed, we will think about lodging a complaint against those whose names are mentioned in the notes, said Mukti Prasad.        
	Raja Acharjee, a deputy general manager in Majis office, said his colleagues were shocked.         
	We cant believe that he (Maji) has committed suicide. We dont know why he would do something like this. We are shocked, said Acharjee.         
	Asked about the notes blaming company officials, Acharjee said: We dont want to talk about it as the case is under investigation.

	Kharagpur, June 15: The CBI team investigating the Jnaneswari Express sabotage has made its first arrest, picking up a Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities member who used to work as a supervisor for railway contractors.        
	Hiralal Mahato was said to be hiding in a relatives house at a Kalaikunda village where the sleuths swooped down last night. The village is around 20km from his home at Rasua, where Hiralal is a neighbour of Bapi Mahato, the alleged leader of the gang that sabotaged the railway tracks on May 28 and caused the death of 150 people.        
	CBI sources said Hiralal, aged about 21, used to recruit labourers to repair tracks. The Maoists are believed to have used such hands to remove the clips that tie the rails to the sleepers.        
	Hiralal was said to be a close friend of Bapi and, like him, a member of the Maoist-trained Rasua village defence committee. A police officer assisting the CBI said he had played a key role in the sabotage. Hiralal knew whom to recruit: they had to be experts in removing the Pandrol clips. It was Hiralal who contacted them.        
	The CBI today questioned him at the camp it has set up in Kharagpur town. The Jhargram court has sent Hiralal to CBI custody for 10 days.        
	The CID, which had started the probe into the case, had earlier arrested Khagen Mahato and Samir Mahato. They have apparently named 17 people, including main accused Bapi and Umakanta.         
	Sources said over 30 people were involved in that nights sabotage. Khagen had allegedly ferried some of them to the sabotage site at Rajabandh and brought them back after the operation.         
	Samir had been accused of recruiting young men for the job. He has apparently told the police able-bodied people were needed to remove the clips fast.         
	The CBI will take the arrested trio to Rajabandh and try to reconstruct the events of May 28. Sources said they would try to find out what it took to sabotage two 50-metre stretches of tracks  Up and Down  within 40 minutes. There were only 40 minutes between a passenger train and the Jnaneswari Express that night, an officer said.         
	One railway official said just the removal of Pandrol clips was not enough to derail a train. Tracks have to be removed or put out of alignment by forcing them off the sleepers by blasting or cutting.        
	Siblings killed         
	Brothers Sambhu Singh, 45, and Sunil Singh, 37, were dragged out of their homes and shot dead last night.         
	Posters strewn around their bodies, on a road in Belpahari, around 265km from Calcutta, dubbed them police informers.

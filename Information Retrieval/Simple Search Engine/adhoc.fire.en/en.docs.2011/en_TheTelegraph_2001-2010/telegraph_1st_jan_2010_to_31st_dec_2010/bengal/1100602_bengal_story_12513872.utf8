The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong braces for failed test
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong braces for failed test
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                    
	Calcutta, June 1: State Congress leaders will have to choose between going back to Mamata Banerjee and going bust if television exit poll predictions about their failed survival test turn out to be true.        
	The results that have emerged from the poll conducted by STAR-Ananda and AC Nielsen for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Salt Lake municipality give an outright majority to the Trinamul Congress, thus enabling the party to form the civic boards without Congress help.        
	So, it will no longer be a matter of choice but that of compulsion for the state Con-gress to rebuild bridges with Mamata before the 2011 Assembly elections.        
	The poll has given the Congress seven seats in the 141-ward Calcutta Municipal Corporation and none in the 25-ward Salt Lake civic body.        
	Asked about the road ahead if the party fared as poorly as the predictions suggested, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said he would make sincere and honest efforts to rebuild ties with Mamata. I will make every effort possible to have seat adjustments with Mamata for the Assembly elections. Thats for sure. We like her fighting spirit and want to jointly overthrow the CPM next year.        
	He is not so sure about how Mamata will respond. After winning Calcutta, Salt Lake and a good number of municipalities alone, she may think the CPM can be toppled without the Congress. That will be unfortunate for us. An alliance will be most desirable, Bhattacharya added.        
	At campaign meetings , state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee had scoffed at Mamatas claim that only two parties  Trinamul and CPM  were battling it out and that the people should not waste their votes by supporting CPM agents (Congress). Without naming Mamata, he had said: It is being said that only two parties are fighting here. But what about the Congress? Is it here to cut grass? Alliance doesnt mean folding up the Congress.         
	Reminded about Mukherjees assertion, Bhattacharya said: What Pranabda said is true. We cannot fold up our party if it fares badly. But the fact is that our party is organisationally very weak in Calcutta and vast areas of south Bengal. We should have the alliance back on track.        
	When the Congress had struck an alliance with Trinamul for the 2001 Assembly polls, it had been offered only 57 seats. But after the Congress-Trinamul combines success in last years Lok Sabha elections, Congress leaders began to feel that Trinamuls tally had jumped from one to 20 piggybacking on their support.        
	We were thinking of asking for at least 100 of the 294 Assembly seats from Trinamul as we thought the Congress had contributed handsomely to its victory. But if Mamata gets Calcutta on her own, she will become firm in her dealings with us. She wouldnt want to part with too many south Bengal seats. In that case, we will have to surrender to her totally for the alliance, said former MLA Nirbed Roy.

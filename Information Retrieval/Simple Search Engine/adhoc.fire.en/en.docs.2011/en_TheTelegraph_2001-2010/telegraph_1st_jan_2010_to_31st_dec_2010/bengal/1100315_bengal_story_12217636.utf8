The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Peace purr after action roar
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Peace purr after action roar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 14: Mamata Banerjee today spoke of silent protest against the CPM, a day after warning the ruling party that her supporters would retaliate if attacked.         
	We shall not resort to bandhs and blockades at the drop of a hat because these inconvenience people. Instead, write slogans on old newspapers and paste them on your chests to launch a silent protest against the CPMs atrocities, the Trinamul Congress chief said in Bhowanipore, Calcutta, on the third anniversary of the Nandigram firing.         
	Yesterday, Mamata had told a party convention in Hooghly to retaliate against the CPMs attempts to unleash violence on them. If the CPM thinks it will carry on its politics of violence against us, it will make a big mistake. Our two crore Trinamul workers will be ready to retaliate by aligning with like-minded parties, she had said.         
	Trinamul leaders said the reason for Mamatas change in tune was her desperation to establish an image of a responsible leader in the run-up to elections to 82 civic bodies, possibly in May-June.        
	Realising that yesterdays remarks may have sent the wrong message to party workers, Mamata today had to make it clear that she is opposed to violence and she favours silent protests the Gandhian way to oust the CPM from Bengal, said a Trinamul functionary.        
	He said a lot of misunderstanding was created in party ranks over her remarks yesterday.         
	Before the meeting in Bhowanipore today, Mamata walked in a procession with party workers from Ballygunge Circular Road to the venue of the memorial service, opposite the Jadubabu market.         
	On March 14, 2007, 14 people died in police firing in Nandigram, East Midnapore.        
	Mamata said: Let the CPM adopt its politics of violence. But you (the Trinamul supporters) should not go for violence to retaliate against the CPMs terror. Instead, launch peaceful protests in every block across the state at weekends to influence public opinion in your favour.... In a democracy, it is the people and not the bullet that has the last word.        
	In Nandigram, Trinamul leaders  among them Union ministers of state Mukul Roy and Sisir Adhikari and MP Subhendu Adhikari  placed wreaths on the martyrs columns erected at Bhangabera and Gokulnagar where the police had fired on the villagers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Heist spree in industry belt, police clueless
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Heist spree in industry belt, police clueless

	Durgapur, Aug. 2: A trader was robbed of Rs 7.5 lakh at gunpoint on a busy Asansol street this morning, taking the number of robberies in the Asansol-Durgapur belt in the past six months to 20, including two bank heists.         
	However, police have failed to make headway in any of these cases, except for the theft at the Durgapur mayors house. Not only have the police recovered the stolen items, they have also arrested one person.         
	Around 10.30am today, Rajesh Agarwal, the owner of a hardware shop, was returning after withdrawing Rs 7.5 lakh when two motorcycle-borne youths accosted him at the busy Rangania crossing, 1km from the bank. I got scared and handed the money to them, Agarwal said.         
	On Friday afternoon, a gang of robbers on motorcycles had snatched Rs 90,000 at gunpoint from a police constable outside a bank in Ranigunj.         
	Two banks, one each in Asansol and Durgapur, were robbed of around Rs 75 lakh in the past six months. At least ten cases of house burglaries have also been reported.         
	On May 16, valuables were stolen from Durgapur mayor Rathin Roys house. The police cracked the case within two days. The swiftness stands in sharp contrast with the polices failure in all the other cases, a fact that has raised eyebrows even in CPM circles. Roy is a CPM state committee member.        
	This shows how insensitive the police are about solving crimes if the victims are not VIPs, said Uma Ghosh, a CPM councillor from Durgapur.         
	Several residents of Durgapur said they were afraid to leave home on business trips and holidays. We are scared to leave our houses empty because they might be burgled in our absence. Items stolen from the mayors house were recovered promptly. But we cant expect the same promptness from the police, said Debasish Chowdhury, a Durgapur Steel Plant technician.        
	Burdwan SP R. Rajsekharan said: A local gang is targeting empty houses. Gangs from Jharkhand are targeting banks, houses and individuals carrying money. We will arrest the culprits.

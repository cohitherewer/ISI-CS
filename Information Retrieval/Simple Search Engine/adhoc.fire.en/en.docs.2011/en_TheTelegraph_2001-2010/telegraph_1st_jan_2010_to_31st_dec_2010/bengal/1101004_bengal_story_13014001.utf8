  - Mutiny finger at IRB men before Purulia posting        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          An IRB jawan stands guard at the Balarampur camp as Trinamul activists demonstrate outside on Sunday. (Mita Roy)                                        
	Balarampur (Purulia), Oct. 3: Police authorities are considering relocating the India Reserve Battalion personnel from their camp at Purulias Balarampur town following Thursday nights alleged firing in which a Bokaro youth was killed and another grievously injured.         
	Inspector-general of police (western range) Z. Hassan today held a two-hour meeting at the camp, the headquarters of the six companies of Nagaland Armed Police that are part of the IRB in the district. The IRB commandant, the deputy inspector-general (Midnapore range), Anil Kumar, and other senior police officers were at the meeting.        
	After examining all angles, we are considering relocating the IRB companies based in Balarampur, the IG said. This is subject to further deliberations and we will take a decision keeping in mind the interests of all concerned.        
	Three of the six companies are stationed at the Balarampur camp whose personnel allegedly fired at Vikas Mishra and Ganesh Gupta after they ignored the forces order to stop their car. While Mishra died, Gupta is still in hospital.        
	Around 3.30pm today, minutes after Hassan and other officers walked into the IRB camp at Balarampurs Chowkbazar, half a dozen trucks and a bus trudged out of the complex with personnel and provisions, fuelling speculation that the IRB companies were being transferred.        
	But Hassan later clarified that some of the Nagaland Armed Police companies not posted in Balarampur had come to collect their ration.        
	Sources said that the IRB batallion, which was earlier posted at Nagalands Zhadima, had mutinied when they were told in August that they would be sent to Maoist-hit Purulia. They had apparently refused to go there unless given sophisticated arms to combat the rebels.         
	A CID team arrived in Purulia today to investigate and collected details of the FIRs lodged by T. Imchek, the deputy commandant of the Balarampur camp, and Mishras father.        
	Over 100 Trinamul Congress activists demonstrated in front of the camp this afternoon, condemning the shooting. They demanded that the IRB companies be withdrawn immediately.         
	Some of the eight town residents who had been picked up by the IRB personnel after the shooting recounted the high-handed behaviour of the jawans.        
	Pawan Agarwal and Bijoy Gope said they were returning home on a bicycle around 10.30pm after having dinner at a restaurant when they were stopped by the jawans and dragged into the camp.         
	One of them grabbed me by the collar and shouted, goli kaun mara (who fired the shots)?. When we pleaded ignorance and asked them to let us go, they thrashed us, Agarwal said.

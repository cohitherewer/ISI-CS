                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rebels kill informer
                            
	Midnapore, May 2: Suspected Maoists have shot dead yet another Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities member after accusing him of passing on information to police.        
	The murder in West Midnapore early today takes the total number of People Committee members killed by the rebels since April 19 to six.         
	The police are believed to have broken into the committees ranks and tasted success in several raids. The Maoists are now avenging the leaks about their movements.        
	Dayal Mahato, 51, of Jambeda village in Jhargram, had quit the CPM last September to join the committee. They tied his hands and dragged him away. As they took him, they hit him with rifle butts, said Dayals son Kanchan.

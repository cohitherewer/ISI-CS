	Durgapur, May 13: Around 500 villagers hurled stones and beat up policemen who had come to pick up the body of a man run over and killed by a truck at Budbud in Burdwan, injuring 11 cops.         
	The mob snatched the policemens batons and gheraoed them for an hour before additional forces cane-charged them, burst tear-gas shells and fired in the air to disperse them. Seventeen villagers were injured.         
	The policemen have suffered injuries to the head, back, hands and legs. Some villagers said three protesters had suffered bullet injures, a claim contested by the police.        
	The trouble started at 9.30am today when Swapan Bagdi, 37, a cycle van-puller, was run over and killed by a speeding truck on NH 2 .         
	Angry villagers blocked the highway, demanding a flyover or an underpass so that accidents can be avoided while crossing.

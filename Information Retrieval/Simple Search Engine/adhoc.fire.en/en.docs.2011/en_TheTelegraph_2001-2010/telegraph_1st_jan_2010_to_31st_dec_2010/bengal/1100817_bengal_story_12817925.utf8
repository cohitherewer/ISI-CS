The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Drought cloud on 11 districts
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Drought cloud on 11 districts
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 16: The Left Front government today identified 11 districts as drought-hit and allocated Rs 50 crore to tackle the situation.        
	Announcing the decision this afternoon after a meeting chaired by the chief minister, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said the 11 districts, including 10 in south Bengal, had received 30 per cent less rainfall this season so far than what had been predicted.         
	We have identified eleven districts as drought-hit. The district magistrates will make the announcement of drought soon, Dasgupta said.        
	CPM sources had said the government acted promptly to come to the aid of the farmers with an eye on the Assembly elections next year. The government, the sources said, is keen to stem any further erosion of its vote bank in south Bengal where the Trinamul Congress has been on an upswing.        
	The state governments timely move will benefit a huge chunk of farmers who have been demanding that a drought be declared in south Bengal districts, a CPM state committee member said.        
	Dasgupta, however, said that because of sufficient stocks, there would not be a food crisis.         
	The finance minister said: We have allocated an initial amount of Rs 50 crore for these districts. The fund, Dasgupta said, will be used to repair and re-sink tubewells and make arrangements for pump sets for farmers.        
	The minister said the fund allocation will be Rs 4,000 per hectare for under-irrigated areas, Rs 2,000 per hectare for areas with no irrigation (areas where crops requiring minimum water are cultivated) and Rs 6,000 per hectare for areas yielding perennial crops (crops cultivated throughout the year, such as paddy).         
	The government also doubled the Re 1 subsidy it had announced for farmers for every litre of diesel purchased to operate pumps for irrigation.         
	Dasgupta said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would write to Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to send a central team of specialists to Bengal to assess the situation in the 11 districts.        
	Agriculture department officials said the drought announcement would enable the Centre to offer aid to the farmers. The Centre can now assist (the farmers) if it thinks it is necessary, an official said.        
	Dasgupta said the state government was considering the conversion of short-term loans taken by farmers to long-term ones with instalment waivers for the current fiscal year.        
	There has been severe damage to the kharif crop in these 11 districts. Of the 44 lakh hectares cultivated during the monsoon season, there is a question mark over 11 lakh hectares, Dasgupta said. The government will try to protect crops cultivated on at least 6 lakh hectares, he added.        
	State agriculture minister Naren De said a drought had been declared in the state in 1995. The declaration had come after August 15 that year too. Every year, we monitor the monsoon rain till August 15 and then decide whether there is the possibility of drought, De said.         
	Trinamul said the governments declaration of drought was an eyewash aimed at regaining lost ground.

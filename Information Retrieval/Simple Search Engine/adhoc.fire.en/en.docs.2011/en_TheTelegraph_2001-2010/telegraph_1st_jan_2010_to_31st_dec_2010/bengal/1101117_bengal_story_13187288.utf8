	Calcutta, Nov. 16: The ruling Left is looking to distribute among the poor plots lying unused or being held in excess of the ceiling by firms, a move aimed at countering Mamata Banerjees land plank ahead of next summers polls.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today discussed ways to retrieve and hand out such land with cabinet colleagues Nirupam Sen, Abdur Rezzak Mollah and Asim Dasgupta.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cooch Behar, May 10: Thousands of Trinamul Congress supporters went on the rampage in Toofanganj town this morning, ransacking at least a dozen CPM offices.         
	Mamata Banerjees party alleged that CPM supporters led by MLA Tamsher Ali had started the violence by attacking a Trinamul office and stabbing five of its members. But police said there was no confirmation of the stabbing and no complaint had been lodged.         
	Prohibitory orders under Section 144 were clamped on the subdivisional town in Cooch Behar district after five policemen were injured when alleged Trinamul supporters attacked them with stones and sticks in the afternoon.         
	Trinamul made a foothold in this Left bas- tion snatching both the panchayat samitis in 2008. With the party keen to consolidate its gains, clashes have been frequent since.        
	As word about the alleged stabbing spread, thousands of Trinamul supporters from the panchayat areas adjoining the town arrived on pick-up trucks. Armed with sticks, bows and arrows and spears, they went around ripping off CPM flags and posters and ransacking the offices, many of them makeshift structures set up for the May 30 civic polls.         
	Many CPM candidates fled in fear. One of them, Dhirendranath Saha, the sitting councillor of Ward 2, said over the phone: Im too scared to stay at home. I wont tell you where I am.        
	The police said the genesis of the violence lay in last nights attack on CPM candidate Kartik Karmakar. Alleged Trinamul supporters beat him up and threw stones at his house, injuring his 10-year-old daughter.        
	The CPM retaliated by calling a six-hour bandh and attacking a Trinamul office this morning. MLA Ali had allegedly led the attack.        
	The Trinamul supporters stoned Alis car and chased him to the CPM zonal office, where he took shelter. They kept him confined there from 8.30am to 3.30pm, all the time asking the police, on guard outside, to hand him over.        
	District Trinamul chief Rabindranath Ghosh said: Ali led the attack on our office and his supporters stabbed five of our men. However, he could not provide the whereabouts of those allegedly stabbed. Fifteen Trinamul supporters have been arrested.

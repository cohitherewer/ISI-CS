          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Sept. 12: A 70-year-old farmer and his accomplices hacked to death four members of a family, including his former son-in-law, after a feud over a plot of land in a Murshidabad village today.         
	Police said tension had been brewing between Mahatab Sheikh and Ajibur Sheikh, 52, both residents of Bhudhiapara village in Khargram, after Ajibur divorced his younger daughter six months ago. Ajibur had married Mahatabs elder daughter 30 years ago but she committed suicide 12 years back, following which he married the younger daughter.        
	But after the divorce, Mahatab had demanded that Ajibur return the one-and-a-half-bigha plot he had received as dowry during the first marriage, a police officer said.         
	However, when Ajibur refused, saying he was the legal owner of the plot, Mahatab began cultivation on the field a month back. Ajibur lodged a police complaint and a week later, he hired a tractor and destroyed the seeds Mahatab had sown. He then began cultivating rice on the plot.        
	A week ago, Mahatab lodged a counter-complaint with the police. Abul Kasem, the chief of Khargram panchayat samiti, said village elders had arranged a meeting between the duo but no solution was found.         
	Around 8am today, Mahatab went to the plot with a group of 20 armed people to destroy Ajiburs crops.         
	As soon as Ajibur learnt about this, he rushed to the field with his younger brothers Bazalu, 45, and Jummat Hossain, 35, and nephew Salam, 25. They were armed with sticks. A clash ensued but Ajibur and his relatives were outnumbered. All four of them were hacked to death, said B.L. Meena, the district superintendent of police.        
	Mahatab has fled the village with his wife and other family members. His accomplices have also escaped, the police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | A schoolbag too far
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      A schoolbag too far
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, April 13: If his longing for a pair of trousers drove Haripada Pal to death on Friday, a schoolbag killed one of his classmates on Monday.        
	Sourav Nayek committed suicide after being caught stealing Rs 100 from home to buy a schoolbag.        
	The Class VII boy used to carry his books in a plastic packet because his parents could not afford a bag. His father, a cook, said a bag, which would cost over Rs 100, was way beyond his means. I earn Rs 100 per cooking assignment but I dont get work for more than 15 days a month, said Gurupada, 38, who has another son, only two years old.        
	From Amarpur village, Sourav had to walk half a kilometre to Heeralal Vidya Niketan. It took him less than 10 minutes. So, I had tried to explain to him that a schoolbag wasnt absolutely necessary, said Gurupada.        
	Sourav went to school in shorts, but he did not apparently have a problem with that. And Haripada walked almost 2km to school without a proper bag.         
	Calcutta-based psychiatrist Ranadip Ghosh Roy attributed the childrens varying needs and drastic decisions to a social disorder.         
	The two suicides also invite the question that when governments are bent on sending children to school, are they taking enough care of those who have already been enrolled?        
	On Sunday evening, Sourav took Rs 100 from a bag where his mother, Usha, 35, had kept money for the familys expenses.        
	He was preparing for school on Monday when Usha had a suspicion and searched his pockets. The 15-year-old had not had the thiefs brain to hide it better. I scolded him severely and he told me he had taken the money to buy a schoolbag, Usha said, tears streaming down.        
	When Sourav returned home, his mother was busy with his baby brother. A while later, she rushed into the next room hearing a groan and found Sourav foaming at the mouth.         
	Heeralal Vidya Niketan had a long weekend. If it was closed on Saturday to mourn Haripada, it was shut on Monday for Sourav.        
	Headmaster Biman Poyra said he realised that students needed counselling. But we lack the resources.

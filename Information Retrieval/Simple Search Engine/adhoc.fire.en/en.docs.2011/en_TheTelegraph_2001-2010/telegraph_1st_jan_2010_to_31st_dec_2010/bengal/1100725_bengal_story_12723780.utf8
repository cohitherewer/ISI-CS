                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Kid kills self for Rs 5
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Babushona Shaw                                   
	Calcutta, July 24: A Class III student today allegedly hanged himself at his New Alipore shanty after his parents refused to give him Rs 5 to buy kites.         
	Babushona Shaw, 8, was found hanging from the bamboo ceiling of his P.N. Mitra Lane home by his mother Anjali, a domestic help.        
	A neighbour said Babushona, a student of the local Siriti Prathamik Vidyalaya, had demanded Rs 5 from his parents to buy a kite last night. He had also asked for a cake which his father brought him, the 40-year-old homemaker said.         
	This morning, the child had gone to the house where his mother works to ask for the money. But instead of giving him the money, his mother scolded him and sent him back home, the neighbour said. After he returned home, Babushona appears to have hanged himself with one of his mothers sarees, she added.        
	The childs father, Moti, who earns his living by stitching torn jute sacks, was not at home either when Babushona allegedly committed suicide.         
	None of us had a clue that he would kill himself. He seemed quite normal when we saw him returning from the house where his mother works, another neighbour said.        
	Neighbours said Babushona, who was 4ft tall, had possibly used a stool to climb onto the bed before hanging himself from one of the bamboo poles along the ceiling.         
	Anjali and some of the neighbours took the child to M.R. Bangur hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. Police said that from the nature of the knots, it seemed that the boy had committed suicide.

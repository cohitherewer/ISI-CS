	Calcutta, Oct. 30: Members of the BJP-affiliated Yuva Morcha today blocked a road outside Jadavpur University to protest anti-national sentiments being expressed at a seminar at the varsity.        
	The seminar, titled Freedom of Kashmir, was attended by Delhi University professor Syed Abdur Rehman Gilani, who had been arrested in connection with the Parliament attack and later acquitted by the Supreme Court.         
	The activists shouted anti-Gilani slogans and blocked the road at Bengal Lamp. They said the seminar participants had spoken of a Kashmir that did not belong to India.

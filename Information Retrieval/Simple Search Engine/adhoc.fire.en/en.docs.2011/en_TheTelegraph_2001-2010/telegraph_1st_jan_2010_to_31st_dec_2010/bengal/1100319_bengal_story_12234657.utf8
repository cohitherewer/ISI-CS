	New Delhi, March 18: Bangladesh was today hopeful of reaching an interim agreement with India after the two countries resumed ministerial-level talks on the sharing of the Teesta waters following a five-year hiatus.        
	Water resources minister Pawan Bansal and his Bangladeshi counterpart Ramesh Chandra Sen met in a five-star hotel in the capital today.        
	Despite the diplomatic intent to strike a deal, Delhi will have to seek the Bengal governments concurrence for the Bangladeshi delegation to return with something to show from the two-day meeting.        
	The expectation is high. We are here to grow the relations between the two countries further, Sen told PTI. Bangladesh water resources secretary Sheikh Mohammad Wahid-Uz Zaman said an interim agreement should be reached in the discussions but the Indian side is understood to have insisted on sorting out technical issues first.

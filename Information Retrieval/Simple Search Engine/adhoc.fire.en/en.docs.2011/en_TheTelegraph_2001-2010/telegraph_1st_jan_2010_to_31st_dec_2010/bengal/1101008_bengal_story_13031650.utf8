                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Schoolgirl thrashed over extra fee
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Oct. 7: A nursery student of a private school in East Midnapore was allegedly beaten up and mentally tortured by a teacher after her parents refused to pay a development fee of Rs 3,000.        
	The girls father, Manirul Islam (name changed), a lawyer, lodged a complaint with police yesterday against the class teacher, the principal and the secretary of the NGO that runs Tamralipta Public School in Tamluk.         
	Five-and-a-half-year-old Tania Khatoon (name changed), an upper nursery student, was slapped on the back and face by class teacher Mita Samanta, Manirul alleged.        
	My daughter was left with an injury mark under an eye caused by the teachers fingernails, Manirul, whose wife is a judge at a Tamluk court, said. I had to take her to Tamluk district hospital for treatment, he added.        
	The father alleged that the school authorities had earlier demanded that he pay Rs 3,000 as development fee.         
	We had paid Rs 6,000 during Tanias admission. So we did not pay the additional amount as a mark of protest. My daughter was tortured in class because we did not pay the money, Manirul said.        
	He said the teacher started torturing Tania after September 7, the due date for the payment. My daughter attends school regularly and finishes her homework without fail, Manirul said.         
	Tania said her class teacher used to regularly scold and humiliate her on one pretext or the other after September 7.        
	One day, the teacher made me stand on the bench for over an hour for speaking to my friends in class. On another occasion, she threw away my pencil box, saying I could not draw. But I know I draw well, Tania said.        
	She used to humiliate me in front of my friends and repeatedly told me to ask my father to meet the school authorities, the girl added.         
	During recess one day (September 22), the teacher dragged me by the hair inside a classroom and slapped me so hard on the back and face that I fell down, Tania said.         
	Samanta, the teacher, denied having beaten up Tania.         
	Manirul said he had met the principal, Debabrata Banerjee, after the thrashing but he did not pay any heed.         
	Khairul Islam, the secretary of the NGO that runs the school, said: It is true that we had asked the parents of the students of our school to pay Rs 3,000. However, we had told them that we would adjust the amount with the school fees. The allegation that the little girl was tortured because the money was not paid is baseless.        
	Principal Banerjee said the school had formed a three-member committee to probe whether the teacher had slapped the child.        
	Ashok Biswas, the district superintendent of police, said: A medical test has been done on the student. We are investigating her fathers complaint.

	The Malda administration had no clue that Bipahl Mondols body had been brought to his home in Kalchinis Fatehpur. The inspector in charge of Kaliachak police station, Rajib Bhattacharya, said he was not aware of any victims body arriving in the area.        
	Mondals wife Aruna said her husbands co-workers had called her up and informed her about his death.        
	The family members of the other migrants from Malda who used to live in the building that collapsed and are missing since the tragedy said the district administration had failed to provide any concrete information.        
	Kotwali resident Ashalata Devi said her grandson Biswajit had called her up on Monday night and told her that his father Niranjan Haldar and mother Maya had died.         
	However, the Malda administration said they had no official information on the death of Niranjan and Maya, who lived on the fourth floor of the building.        
	Khudiram, Niranjans elder son, his wife Anita and their two daughters are still missing. Niranjan and his two sons used to work in a glass factory in Delhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Gurung rushes to Delhi after call
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Gurung rushes to Delhi after call
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, Oct. 31: Bimal Gurung today rushed to Delhi following an emergency call from the home ministry for a meeting, purportedly to tie up loose ends before the next political-level meeting on the interim set-up for the hills.         
	A deal on the set-up is expected to be sealed during the next meeting, scheduled to be held in November.        
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has asked its local units in the hills to be on alert for the next 48 hours, hinting that some major decisions could be taken in the capital tomorrow.        
	The party chiefs sudden decision to skip a meeting with Gorkha delegates, who have arrived here from across the country, and instead leave for Delhi with general secretary Roshan Giri and central committee member Jyoti Kumar Rai came as a surprise to many local leaders.         
	The Telegraph had earlier reported that backstage negotiations on the interim set-up were probably on and that the resolution of certain contentious issues related to the set-up was not going to be limited to tripartite meetings.        
	Gurungs confidence that an agreement would be reached in the next meeting also hints at a backstage deal as the possibility of sealing an agreement in such a short span despite four major unresolved issues is highly unlikely.        
	We have a meeting at the ministry of home affairs tomorrow, said Giri, before leaving for Delhi.         
	Binay Tamang, an assistant secretary of the Morcha, said in Darjeeling later in the day that a party delegation had left for Delhi because of some political developments.         
	There were called by the ministry of home affairs and it was an emergency. We will organise massive rallies in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong, the Dooars and the Terai from 1pm to 4pm tomorrow. We urge our local units to remain on alert for the next 48 hours, Tamang said, heightening the suspense over Gurungs Delhi visit.         
	Although Tamang refused to elaborate, observers believe the need for the partys local units to remain alert was probably because Gurung could take crucial decisions in Delhi tomorrow.        
	So far, the issues of the territorial jurisdiction of the interim set-up, mode of selection of the interim body, transfer of the tauzi department that keeps land records, and the legislative powers of the new authority are yet to be resolved.         
	The Centre wants the next political-level talks to be a ceremonial affair and resolve all issues before the meeting, a source said.         
	Gurung had earlier hinted that a joint verification committee comprising representatives of the Centre, state and the Morcha could be formed to solve the territory issue. The committee could submit its report by 2011, following which areas dominated by the Nepali-speaking population in the Dooars could be incorporated in the new administrative arrangement.

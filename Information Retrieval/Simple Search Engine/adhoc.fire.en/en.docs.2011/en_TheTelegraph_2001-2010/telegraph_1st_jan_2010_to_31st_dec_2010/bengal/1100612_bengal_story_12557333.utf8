The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Injured train victims missing
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Injured train victims missing
          SANJAY MANDAL                                        Amritava Chowdhury, Hamir Swali, Indu Devi and her daughter Sneha                                
	Calcutta, June 11: Some of the injured passengers of the Jnaneswari Express that jumped rails on May 28 have mysteriously gone missing after people apparently saw them being put on ambulances.         
	Their families have since been searching for them in vain in hospitals in Jhargram, Kharagpur and Calcutta.        
	At least four passengers went missing after being put on ambulances. Its not known where they were taken and we are trying to trace them, said Manoj Kumar, senior divisional commercial manager of South Eastern Railways Kharagpur division.        
	All the missing passengers The Telegraph has come to know about were on S3, which was two coaches away from the worst-hit S5.         
	Among them is an engineer from north Calcuttas Jorabagan, an MNC executive from Mumbai, and a mother and daughter from Howrah.         
	Engineer Amritava Chowdhury, 27, was going to Mumbai on an official tour. Since a few hours after the crash, we kept trying to call him, but his mobile went unanswered. Then someone took the call at 10.30am, identified himself as Pradip Bhua of Manikpara, and claimed he had put Amritava on an ambulance, his brother-in-law N.K. Pathak said.         
	The family searched all hospitals there and in Calcutta but could not find Amritava. They have lodged a complaint at Jhargram police station and written to railway minister Mamata Banerjee.         
	We also went to Manikpara (6km from the crash site) in search of the man who had taken the call, but could not find him. The mobile has been switched off since, Pathak said.         
	MNC executive Hamir Swali, 48, was returning home to Mumbai with his wife Asha after a visit to his in-laws in Calcutta. Asha is back home after orthopaedic surgery but not Hamir. His name is neither on the list of the dead nor am-ong those injured, a railway spokesperson said.        
	Another Mumbai resident, Jaya Mitra, had seen Hamir being put on an ambulance. I was in B5 with my sister and her husband. But a relative of mine was in S3. So, we rushed there. A man, lying on the ground with a bleeding head, was put on the Kharagpur-bound ambulance with my relative, she said.        
	Reaching Mumbai on a special train the next day, Jaya saw a young man carrying his fathers photograph and asking passengers whether they had seen him. It was Hamirs son Dhawal. I identified the man in the photo and gave his son the number of the ambulance, Jaya said.        
	Hamirs brother-in-law, Calcutta businessman Bharat Bhatia, said: We visited all hospitals and nursing homes in Midnapore and Kharagpur and even spoke to villagers but he cant be traced. He has also searched all the state-run hospitals in Calcutta.         
	Indu Devi, her daughter Sneha Batra and son Saurav, were going on a holiday. Saurav is in hospital, but his mother and sister are missing.         
	The passenger in the berth next to my wifes said they were put on an ambulance, said Liluah businessman Rajesh Kumar Batra. His wife and children were to visit a relative at Kalyan in Thane.        
	A railway official who has seen many train tragedies said there had been instances of the injured going missing in the past, too. Relatives had taken them away in most cases. Somebody vanishing after being put on an ambulance is strange, he said.

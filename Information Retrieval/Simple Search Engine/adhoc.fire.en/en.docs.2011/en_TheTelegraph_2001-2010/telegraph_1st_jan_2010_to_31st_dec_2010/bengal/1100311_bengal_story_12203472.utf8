The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Gurung bullet cry on dais
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Gurung bullet cry on dais
          OUR BUREAU                                             
	Calcutta, March 10: Bimal Gurung, the president of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, was prevented by his bodyguards today from carrying out a threat during a public meeting in Kalimpong to put a bullet to his head for failure to realise his vision.        
	However, in a twist of irony, some Morcha leaders told journalists not to file reports or photographs of the incident. Later, the Morcha said that a report could be published but not the photographs of the particular incident        
	In the interest of readers who cannot be denied information and a chance to be apprised of the extent to which Gurung was prepared to go for statehood, The Telegraph is reporting the event as well as carrying an illustration done in Calcutta based on information from the ground.         
	The Morcha president was in the middle of his speech on Leechi Ground when he expressed remorse for not being able to realise his vision (of getting Gorkhaland by March 10, 2010) and walked towards a table on the middle of the dais and tried to open a suitcase kept on it.         
	However, before he could open the box, one his bodyguards snatched it from him. I only want to put one bullet in my head. You cant prevent me by surrounding me, Gurung said, as the people seated on the dais circled him.         
	Around 500 people gasped and some screamed but Gurung returned to the microphone and continued his speech. Mero mun ma ekprakar ko bahi raheko cha (I am having a strange feeling), he said and wished his partys central committee and the people well before ending his speech.        
	As soon as Gurung was through with his speech, the partys assistant secretary, Binay Tamang, took the microphone and promised to ensure the safety of Gurung, as the audience shouted Jai Gorkhaland and Jai Bimal Gurung.         
	Some people wiped tears. Tamang then made a request to the people in the hills, the Dooars and Terai to pray for the next three days for a long life for Gurung. Gorkhaland will happen in the presence of Bimal Gurung, Tamang said.         
	Earlier in his speech, Gurung said he was aware that many people were waiting for today in order to see if he would act on his threat to kill himself. I have come to spend my last few moments in your backyard. I am a fathers son. In the past 30 months, I have struggled with many things, but I have never tried to undermine your issue, he said.         
	Gurung had in the past promised to deliver Gorkhaland by March 10, 2010.         
	We had tied up with the BJP because it promised to create new states within 100 days of coming to power. Had the BJP come to power, Gorkhaland would have happened much before 2010, he told the gathering.

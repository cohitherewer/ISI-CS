                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bravery prize brings village regret

	Bartala (Rampurhat), Dec 11: Alone in torment, not in hour of glory.        
	The Birbhum village that had a watched a tribal girl allegedly paraded naked for talking to a youth from outside her community today expressed regret and applauded the teenager  a day after she won the National Bravery Award.        
	Sunita Murmu, who will receive the prize on January 26 from the President, has been chosen for identifying six of the 10 youths who had stripped her and walked her down an 8km stretch in their Bartala village this May.        
	Asked how she felt at having been picked for the honour, the 15-year-old said: Bhalo lagchhe (I feel good). On her future plans, she spoke of wanting to study. I had to drop out after Class II. I want to study more.        
	Birbhum district magistrate Saumitra Mohan said the administration had recommended her name last month. Sunita had shown exemplary courage in co-operating with police and identifying six of the 10 youths we had detained for interrogation on the basis of her fathers complaint. Its good she has been selected.        
	Sunitas ordeal came to light in August, almost three months later, when clips of her being paraded surfaced. The girl was sent to a welfare home to ensure her safety.        
	The award appears to have jolted Bartala into remorse. What Sunita had to face for simply talking to a youth was inhuman. No one had protested when she was being made to walk nude on the road. No one dared to protest against the treatment being meted out to the poor girl, said neighbour and friend Rima Hansda.        
	Others want to say sorry. Motru Murmu, 58, a farm labourer, said what had been done to Sunita was inhuman and brutal.         
	Ever since Sunita has been lodged in the home, we have been discussing with our village elders that she should not have been treated in such an inhuman manner. Now we all want her to come back home, Motru said.         
	Anadi Hansda, 45, said the villagers should apologise to Sunita and her parents. We should send a joint petition to the district administration expressing regret for what we have done.         
	But Sunitas family isnt sure she will be safe in Bartala and want to keep her in the welfare home till they are convinced that the villagers mean what they say. We want Sunita to return home. But we fear similar attacks on her. Who will take the responsibility if something happens to her? asked Sunitas elder brother Gopin, 20.

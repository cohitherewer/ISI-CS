          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 4: Kshiti Goswami, the RSP veteran and a known CPM critic, has begun mending fences with the bigger partner as he is about to lose his Assembly constituency, Dhakuria, because of delimitation.        
	To contest the polls next year, Goswami needs a seat close to the city  a matter which the CPM can ensure.         
	Burtala in north Calcutta, another seat that the RSP contests, will also be lost to delimitation.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Behrampore, July 23: A Class VIII student in Murshidabad today took a bomb to school, apparently to teach a senior a lesson for beating him up yesterday.        
	Manirul Sheikh (name changed), 14, said he had bought the bomb for Rs 100 from a man in his village, Chandrasinghabati in Kandi.        
	Manirul had had a fight with Class X student Tapesh Ghosh (name changed) while returning home from Chatinakandi Gurupada High School on Thursday, police said.        
	Before the prayer meeting today, Manirul asked some of his friends if they had seen Tapesh. He bragged that he had a bomb in his schoolbag and would blow up the older boy. Tapesh, however, had not come to school today because he was unwell.        
	Some of Maniruls classmates informed life science teacher Dhananjoy Mondal about the bomb. I took Manirul to a classroom and fetched a bucket of water. I asked the other students to leave the room and told Manirul to hand the bomb over to me. He took the bomb out of his bag and gave it to me. I immediately put it into the water, Mondal said.        
	The boy was made to sit in the staff room till the police arrived and took him into custody. We are investigating how such a young boy could get a bomb so easily, said B.L. Meena, the district superintendent of police.        
	Intelligence officials said bombs were smuggled into Murshidabads Khargram, Islampur and Samsergunj from neighbouring Jharkhand. Priced at Rs 80-100, they were used during political clashes.        
	Tapesh said he had beaten up Manirul but never thought he would try to kill me.        
	An officer said Manirul had proposed to a classmate who had complained to Tapesh. The senior boy had accosted Manirul outside school.        
	 After taking a few blows from Tapesh, Manirul said he would teach him a lesson the next day, the officer said.

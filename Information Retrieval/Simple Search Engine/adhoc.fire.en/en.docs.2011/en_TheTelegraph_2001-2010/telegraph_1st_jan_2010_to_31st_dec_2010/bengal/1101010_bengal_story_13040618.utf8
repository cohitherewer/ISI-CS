The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | AC trains delay Metro service on Day II
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      AC trains delay Metro service on Day II

	Calcutta, Oct. 9: Calcutta Metros air-conditioned trains ran late on the second day of its commercial run today, delaying other trains and passengers, with the authorities pointing the finger at overcrowding.        
	Two AC trains made four round trips between Dum Dum and New Garia today, double the number of trips than yesterday. However, all the AC trains ran behind schedule today, officials said.        
	The AC trains were five minutes behind schedule on average, thus delaying the other trains by three to four minutes, a Calcutta Metro official said.        
	We are trying to find out if the delays were because of technical glitches or overcrowding as a result of which there were problems in closing the doors, the official added.         
	Somnath Bhattacharjee, a daily commuter, said: It took me 45 minutes to reach Chandni Chowk from Rabindra Sarovar. Usually it takes around 15 minutes.        
	At every station, I heard announcements that there was a delay because the previous train was stuck at the next station, the New Alipore resident who had boarded the train at 2.05pm said.         
	A Metro official said the AC trains were overcrowded because several commuters did not board the non-AC trains and waited for the AC ones.         
	As the AC trains were overcrowded, there were problems in shutting the doors, which delayed them. The authorities had to request passengers to get off so that the doors could be closed, the official said.         
	Metro sources said 5.5 lakh people took the Metro today, a lakh more than on a normal Saturday. Several of the commuters were Puja shoppers.        
	The number of passengers increased by around 30 per cent in the afternoon because of the delay since morning, causing the trains to run further behind schedule and intensifying the door-operation problem, an official said.        
	Arundhuti Mukherjee, an executive at a private firm who took a non-AC train from Tollygunge, said: It was like travelling on a local train. I felt so suffocated that I had to get off much before my destination, Park Street.         
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee had announced last Friday that the AC trains would run only on the extended stretch between New Garia and Tollygunge. However, the authorities yesterday decided to run the trains for the entire stretch.         
	Officials said the only solution to handle the problem of overcrowding was to increase the frequency of trains. However, sources said that with the limited number of rakes, such a step was impossible.         
	Calcutta Metro has 19 rakes for the 25km stretch. More AC trains are expected by December.

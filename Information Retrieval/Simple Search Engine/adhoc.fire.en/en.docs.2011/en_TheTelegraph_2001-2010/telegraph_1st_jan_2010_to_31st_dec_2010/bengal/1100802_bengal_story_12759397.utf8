          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Aug. 1: Four contract workers were left fighting for life and 13 others injured when molten iron spilled on them following a blast-furnace explosion at a private factory here this morning.        
	The injured workers were taken to two private hospitals. The four seriously injured persons have been kept on ventilation. A doctor said they had 80 per cent burns.        
	The workers and trade unions alleged that Amit Metaliks iron ingot factory did not have any medical unit for rescue operation after the 9.30am blast. About 40 workers later ransacked the security guards office.         
	Plant MD Amit Singhs mobile was switched off. No other factory official was available for comment.

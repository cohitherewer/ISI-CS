The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Key posts bear Trinamul boycott brunt
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Key posts bear Trinamul boycott brunt
          BARUN GHOSH AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                               Partha Chatterjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee				                                 
	Calcutta, Sept. 29: The politics of non-cooperation has apparently thrown the process of nominating the heads of two key government posts into uncertainty.         
	Leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee, of the Trinamul Congress, has decided to stay away from two meetings on Friday to finalise the appointment of the state chief information commissioner and the chairperson of the state human rights commission, apparently because the chief minister will be present.         
	According to rules, a three-member committee consisting the chief minister, a cabinet minister nominated by him and the leader of the Opposition selects the chief information commissioner. The head of the human rights commission is nominated by the chief minister, the Assembly Speaker and the leader of the Opposition. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will chair the meetings to nominate the two commission heads in his Assembly chamber.        
	But in keeping with Trinamuls avowed stand of boycotting meetings and events attended by Bhattacharjee, whom Mamata Banerjee has dubbed the architect of state-sponsored terrorism, Chatterjee has decided not to attend Fridays meetings.        
	However, Chatterjee, who has been sent an invite to attend the meetings, said he would not be present because the Assembly elections were round the corner and the task of nominating the officials should be left to the next government.         
	I will not participate in either of the two meetings because I think the task should be left to the government that will assume charge after next years Assembly elections. With less than seven months to go for the elections, Buddhababus government should not do anything in haste, Chatterjee said.         
	He seemed unfazed when told a delay in making the key appointments would jeopardise the functioning of the two commissions. Only seven months are left for the next Assembly polls, he iterated.        
	A state home department official said: It will be impossible to appoint the heads of the two commissions without the presence of the leader of the Opposition.         
	The tenure of the former chief information commissioner, Arun Bhattacharya, ended on August 31. The term of the acting chairman of the state human rights commission, Justice Narayan Chandra Sil, a former Calcutta High Court judge, ends on October 5.        
	Chatterjee had also boycotted a meeting convened in July to appoint the chief information commissioner. Governor M.K. Narayanan had suggested another meeting after the government informed him about the Trinamul leaders decision.         
	A state information commission official said around 30 appeals were submitted daily to the panel. Over 1,000 cases are yet to be disposed of, he added.         
	We receive applications from people every day, but they are not being disposed of, the official said.        
	Several applicants complained they were facing problems getting information on various government activities.         
	At present, the information commission is not legally valid because the post of the commissioner is vacant, said Saroj Khettry, the president of an NGO that deals with right to information issues.         
	Similarly, if the chairman of the humans rights commission is not appointed before October 5, people will not be able to get justice in cases concerning violation of human rights by the law-enforcing agencies, an official said.        
	State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said several development projects, including those under the centrally sponsored Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, could not be implemented in the Opposition-run civic bodies because of Trinamuls non-co-operation.        
	The Opposition runs nearly 90 of the 126 civic boards. Development work in all the 90 boards is being affected because of the Oppositions non-cooperation. They refuse to attend meetings to discuss the implementation of development schemes, he said.

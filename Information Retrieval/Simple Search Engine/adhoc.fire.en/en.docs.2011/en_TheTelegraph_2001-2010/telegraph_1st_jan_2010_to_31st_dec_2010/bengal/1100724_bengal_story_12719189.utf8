          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, July 23: Police in West Midnapore today arrested four Maoists who were wanted in connection with the Shilda massacre and the abduction of a police officer.        
	Those arrested include Rajesh Munda, who is said to be close to Maoist leader Kishan and is also accused of being involved in the murder of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MP Sunil Mahato in 2007. The three other arrested Maoists are Gopinath Mandi, Rajesh Singh and Mangal Soren.        
	The four, arrested from Ranja forest in Salboni, were allegedly involved in the rebel attack on the Shilda Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in February in which 24 jawans were killed. They were also wanted in connection with the abduction of Atindranath Dutta, the officer in charge of Sankrail police station.         
	District superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the joint forces today raided Ranja forest after being informed that a group of 20 Maoists were camping there.        
	We surrounded the forest and slowly reached the spot where the rebels were camping. Finding themselves heavily outnumbered, the four surrendered but the rest of them managed to flee, Verma said.        
	The police have found a .303 rifle that had been looted from Sankrail police station, 25 cartridges, eight gelatine sticks and 10 detonators.        
	The four Maoists were interrogated today at the Eastern Frontier Rifles headquarters in Salua. Verma claimed that the rebels had confessed that they were involved in the Shilda massacre and the abduction of the Sankrail OC .        
	They have also named some of the others who were involved in these two cases. The arrest of Rajesh Munda is important for us because he had been working closely with Kishan for the past three years. We can get information on Kishan from him, Verma added.        
	Headmaster killed        
	Suspected Maoists today dragged the headmaster of a primary school in West Midnapores Indraboni out of his office and shot him dead in front of teachers and students.         
	Police said Rabindranath Mahato, 59, was killed probably because he had on Tuesday stopped a group of Maoists from forcing the students of his school to take part in a rally.

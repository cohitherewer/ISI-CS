	Calcutta Dec. 9: Bengals showpiece township  New Town  is turning into a hotspot for a political battle.         
	From the protest meeting held outside the Hidco office today, the Trinamul Congress pressed for a CBI inquiry into the land acquisition process and the dealings at Rajarhat. Around the same time, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state housing minister and Hidco chairman Gautam Deb made it clear that the government will not let Rajarhat turn into a Singur or Nandigram.        
	With the battle lines drawn, the political heat is set to scorch Rajarhat in the run-up to the Assembly polls.         
	They are obstructing work at New Town. This is a big township and will be home to many people. Are we going to take all this lying down? Never, thundered chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee while addressing a rally organised by the West Bengal Ministerial Officers Association on Rani Rashmoni Road.         
	Even as the government seems determined to nip any Singur-style land protest in Rajarhat in the bud, Trinamul has decided to organise a rally on December 21  the second such gathering in a little over a month  to press for a CBI inquiry into the plot allotment at New Town.         
	With the elections a few months away, Trinamul has decided to highlight the plight of farmers in Rajarhat to focus on the land issue that has been giving the party rich dividends since the 2008 panchayat polls.         
	But Deb vowed to hit back at Trinamul.         
	While the Trinamul leaders were railing against the housing minister and his party at the rally attended by 30,000 party supporters and farmers, Deb threatened to take on the Trinamul in his fief.         
	Rajarhat is no Nandigram or Singur. We know how to tackle.What will come up in the next six months in Rajarhat will be bone-chilling for Mamata, Deb fumed, sitting in his Hidco office.         
	Top Trinamul leaders  including central ministers Saugata Roy and Mukul Roy  and a clutch of MPs and MLAs attended the meeting but Mamata Banerjee, who had announced the programme, was away in Delhi.         
	With Trinamul supporters laying siege to the area outside his office, Deb had to be taken in through a back gate  first time in 12 years  encircled by policemen.         
	Deb, who had offered to be present at the Trinamul meeting to clear their misgivings on Rajarhat, spent around two-and-a-half hours in his office before leaving for a party meeting at around 5pm.

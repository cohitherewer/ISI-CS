The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha asks teachers to canvass guardians
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha asks teachers to canvass guardians
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee at the meeting of primary teachers at Esplanade on Wednesday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today told a gathering of Left-backed primary teachers buoyed by a recent victory in the district primary school council elections to spread among guardians the Lefts ideologies and principles and also tell them about the Oppositions anarchy.         
	I must congratulate you for your victory in the elections. Such a win shows that you have succeeded in explaining to the teaching community the Lefts ideology and principles. But dont stop at that, the chief minister told the gathering of the All Bengal Primary Teachers Association (ABPTA) at Esplanade this afternoon.        
	He said it was the duty of the primary teachers, the original foot soldiers of the Left Front government, to reach out to a larger audience to the general public through the guardians.         
	Next years Assembly polls apparently playing on his mind, Bhattacharjee told the teachers: Go to thousands and lakhs of people and tell them what the main Opposition (Trinamul Congress) is doing in schools how they are aiding and abetting the murders of teachers... how they are trying to help Maoists spread in the state. Try to explain to the people what this indisciplined party is doing to destroy education in our state.        
	The chief minister said he understood the primary job of teachers is to teach but reminded them of their additional, bigger responsibility. He tasked the primary teachers with the job of launching a widespread campaign among the masses.        
	Praising the ABPTA for its organisational might, Bhattacharjee said: Your organisational spread and efficiency are beyond question. The election victory has proved that. Use that to create awareness in the society. The Opposition party in our state is opposed to any sort of development be it construction of roads, power plants, townships, factories. The people should be told what would happen if such a party comes to power.        
	He said the only solution to the unemployment problem in Bengal was the setting up of industries. He said farming could not be the cure to economic ills. Our most important objective is to create jobs. Youths passing out of schools will start looking for jobs in two-three years. For that, factories and industries are needed. What will educated youths do? Can we ask them to cultivate land? the chief minister said.        
	Trinamuls Mukul Roy, however, accused Bhattacharjee of destroying primary education by politicising the teachers. The Union minister for shipping said the CPM won the district primary council elections because the teachers owe allegiance to that party.         
	Roy said the chief minister had already got a stern message from guardians and the people in general who voted against the Left in successive elections since the 2008 panchayat polls.         
	In the November 28 district primary council elections, the Left-backed ABPTA had won 185 of the 192 seats. However, political observers had attributed the Lefts victory to the absence of any credible Opposition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | DNA test for train victims stalled
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      DNA test for train victims stalled
          AMIT UKIL                              
	Calcutta, June 13: The Central Forensic Laboratory has sought another set of blood samples from the next of kin of those assumed dead in the Jnaneswari Express tragedy, sparking fears of a further delay in identifying as many as 46 bodies.        
	In a letter to West Midnapore police, the laboratory in Calcutta has said that this time the sample has to be from the other side of the deceased. That is, if the earlier sample was from the fathers side, it would now have to be from the mothers side.        
	A doctor attached to the labs DNA profiling unit explained that 50 per cent of the genome of any person was made up of the fathers DNA and 50 per cent of the mothers. To get precise results for identification, we need samples from both sides.        
	Inspector-general of police (western range) Zulfikar Hasan confirmed getting the request. He said the police had already got in touch with the relatives. They have been asked to come down as soon as possible to hasten the identification process.         
	However, not all the victims next of kin may be able to rush down, given that some of them live as far away as Maharashtra or Gujarat.        
	In all, 150 people had been killed when the Mumbai-bound train got derailed on May 28. Of them, 104 bodies have been identified and taken away by the victims families.         
	The 46 unidentified bodies are in various morgues in Calcutta. There are 37 claimants for them, which means nine have no claimant.        
	The health department has sought from the home department a cut-off date after which it can dispose of the unclaimed bodies.

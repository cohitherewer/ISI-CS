	Calcutta, June 2: Down in Calcutta, but very much a player out there in Bengal. That could sum up the state of the Bengal Congress after the verdict in the civic polls.         
	And no one would know this better than Mamata Banerjee.         
	Mamatas massive win in Calcutta may not show it, but the results in the districts tell a different story about the Congresss performance.         
	There were two aspects of the Congresss battle in these polls after the break-up of its alliance with the Trinamul Congress  how much of its own territory it could retain and what difference it could make to Trinamuls fortunes. Together, they added up to a battle for Indias grand old partys survival in Bengal.         
	In Calcutta, the Congress may not have done anything to stop Mamatas unstoppable march for complete domination of the battle. But even in the city, its tally of 10 seems to suggest that its calculated risk of going it alone was worth taking. The alternative available to it was to accept Mamatas offer of 23 seats, of which at least 15 were unwinnable because of the huge margins by which the Left had always won them.         
	The results have proved the Congresss fears about these seats were entirely justified. According to Congress sources, the party could barely win five or six seats if it had accepted Mamatas dishonourable offer. Forced to fight on its own, the party has managed to win 10.         
	But the partys big satisfaction comes from the results in the districts. It has not only been able to retain its bases in districts like Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, Malda, Murshidabad and some parts of Nadia and Burdwan but also improved on past performances.        
	It has not been even across the districts, with unforeseen ups and downs, but the overall tally keeps the partys hopes of survival alive. In Jalpaiguri, for instance, the party not only retained control of the civic board, but actually improved on its score of 2005, picking up 16 of the seats, as against Trinamuls one.        
	In the English Bazar municipality in Malda, it is the same story of the Congress of bettering its own record of 2005.         
	In Murshidabad, where the party has its strongest base among the districts, thanks to the combined efforts of Pranab Mukherjee and Adhir Choudhury, the partys score rose from two to three.         
	These are clear results and the Congresss performance is openly visible. What is not so open but politically significant is the Congresss help to Trinamul in municipalities that the latter won. Of the 25 bodies which Trinamul won on its own, there were official and unofficial seat adjustments with the Congress.         
	In several others, Congress nominees withdrew their candidatures by issuing leaflets, making Trinamul wins easier.         
	For example, Trinamuls successes in the traditional Red belt of Burdwan were due to the Congress in no small measure. In at least three civic bodies in Burdwan  Kalna, Memari and Daihat  and in Kharar in West Midnapore, there were official seat adjustments between the two.        
	In two other places in East Midnapore  Chandrakona and Khirpai  unofficial adjustments with the Congress helped Trinamul win them for the first time.         
	In Kharary, where there are 20 seats, the Congress did not put up any candidate. In many other places, especially in south Bengal, the Congress did not win but made Trinamuls wins possible.         
	But the success of the Congresss gamble showed best in the 29 hung boards, where the party proved it was still very much a player in Bengal politics. To put it from another angle, if Trinamul got only 27 boards out of the 79, barring Calcutta and Salt Lake, it had a lot to do with the Congress vote.         
	The Congresss show confirms that the party may be irrelevant in Calcutta but not in all Bengal. And it can help the party quote its part of the deal with Mamata in the 2011 Assembly polls. That the partys alliance with Trinamul would be revived for the state polls was not much in doubt.         
	The crucial question for the party in Bengal, said a senior leader, is whether its high command will emulate the state leaders example of standing up on their own against a humiliating offer from Mamata again.         
	The partys leaders, including PCC working president, Pradip Bhattacharyya, today made it clear that they would help Trinamul in forming boards in all the hung municipalities.        
	What they didnt say in public but hoped was that Mamata would reciprocate the gesture not just now but also for the Assembly polls.

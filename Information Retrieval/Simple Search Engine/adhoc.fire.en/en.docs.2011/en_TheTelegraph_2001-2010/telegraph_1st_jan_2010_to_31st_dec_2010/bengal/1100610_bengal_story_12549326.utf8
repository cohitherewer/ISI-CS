          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 9: A Howrah-bound Duronto and Tatanagar-bound Steel Express were stopped midway tonight after Bengal police alerted the railways about a possible Maoist attack near Jhargram.        
	Two passenger trains between Tatanagar and Kharagpur were cancelled.         
	We learnt from the police around 5pm that suspected Maoists with equipment to plant mines had gathered at two villages close to the tracks in Jamboni. We were told that the Maoists were planning to target the Duronto or the Rajdhani, said Dilip Mitra, additional director-general of police, railways.        
	The Duronto was stopped at Ghatshila station and sent back to Tatanagar for better security and comfort of the passengers, Mitra said. Steel was taken to Kharagpur.        
	The police went to the two villages this evening. After a search, we told the railways no Maoists had been found and they could run the trains after an inspection of the tracks, said Jhargram superintendent Praveen Triptahi.        
	However the railways decided not to take a chance. Since a full check is difficult at night, we will run a check in the morning with a bomb disposal squad, said Mitra.        
	Night trains        
	The railways has extended till June 13 the bar on night trains on the Kharagpur-Rourkela and Kharagpur-Adra sections. The 10pm-5am restriction was imposed after the Jnaneswari tragedy on May 28. The Howrah-Chakradh- arpur, Howrah-Bokaro and Kharagpur-Tata trains will remain cancelled till June 13.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      School rod for absentee
          ALAMGIR HOSSAIN                              
	Naoda (Murshidabad), July 28: A Class X student in Murshidabad has landed in hospital after the headmaster allegedly beat him up with a stick for remaining absent for five days.         
	Ujjwal Das, 15, a resident of Naoda, has been admitted to hospital with fever and pain in the chest and the waist.        
	The 15-year-old said that after he reached Sahajadpur High School yesterday, headmaster Moloy Kumar Roy reprimanded him for not bringing a letter explaining his absence. I told him that I could not come because I was sick. I said I would bring my uncle the next day. My father died 13 years ago and my mother is mentally challenged. I stay with my uncle, Ujjwal said.        
	However, the headmaster refused to listen and beat him up with a stick. He then grabbed Ujjwal by the hair, dragged him to the school gate and threw him out, the boy alleged. Ujjwals uncle Susanta Majhi has lodged a police complaint against the headmaster.

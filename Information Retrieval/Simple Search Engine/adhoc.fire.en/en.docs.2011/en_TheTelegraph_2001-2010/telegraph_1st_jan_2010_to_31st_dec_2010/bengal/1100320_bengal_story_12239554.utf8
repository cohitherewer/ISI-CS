          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, March 19: A road accident in which three people were killed turned into a political game with CPM and Trinamul Congress leaders turning up at a Hooghly hospital and claiming that the victims were their supporters.        
	The accident happened at 2.30am at Mogra when a bus carrying 100 labourers of a cold storage in Burdwans Memari overturned and fell into a roadside field. Fifty-four people were injured. Local people took the injured to the Imambara Hospital in Chinsurah.         
	As word about the accident spread, former CPM MP from Arambagh, Anil Basu, rushed to the hospital with about 50 party supporters, only to find Trinamul MP Mukul Roy speaking to the injured people. Roy had reached the hospital a few minutes earlier.         
	Basu shouted at Roy: What are you doing here? This is a hospital and patients are feeling disturbed. Get out of here.        
	Roy did not react and walked out with his followers. Basu misbehaved with me. I had gone to the hospital because those killed and injured are our supporters. We went to see if the injured were receiving proper treatment, Roy said.         
	Basu, however, claimed that the victims were CPM supporters. Trinamul leaders had come to politicise the mishap and ransack the hospital.

	Bansberia (Hooghly), Oct. 11: A Trinamul Congress-run municipality in Hooghly has cited environment pollution to stop a Durga Puja backed by a CPM leader.        
	The Nabamilan Mahila Samiti, a womens body that has been organising the Pujas at a childrens park in Bansberia for the past five years, has as its chief patron CPM councillor Bina Majumdar, who was the chairperson of the Bansberia municipality in the previous term. Trinamul snatched the municipality from the CPM in May this year.         
	The organisers had started erecting the pandal a fortnight ago. However, when they sought the customary permission for organising the Pujas inside the park from the municipality last week, the chairman, Rathin Modak, refused. Modak said the park would be littered if the Pujas were held there.         
	CPM councillor Majumdar said the denial was a bolt form the blue.         
	Our pandal is complete and the idols are scheduled to arrive tomorrow. Now it is impossible to stop the Pujas, she said.        
	On instructions from the municipality chairman, police have put up a notice inside the pandal, saying the Puja cannot not be organised because it was illegal.        
	The park belongs to the civic body. If it does not give permission, it will be illegal to organise the Puja, said Debashis Chakraborty, the officer in charge of Mogra police station, under whose jurisdiction Bansberia falls.        
	Modak said the park was a playground for children. The former chairperson (Majumdar) did not allow Pujas to be organised at any other park but this one. She had given permission to the Nabamilan Mahila Samiti because the park is near her home.         
	Majumdar said she had raised the issue of organising the Puja at the park at a meeting of councillors on September 30. But the Trinamul councillors started shouting and hurling abuses at me. I had to walk out of the meeting with the other CPM councillors, Majumdar said.        
	Today, nearly 200 supporters of the womens wing of the CPM, the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti, marched to the municipality office, led by Majumdar, and staged a demonstration, demanding that permission be given for the Puja.        
	Modak iterated that permission would not be given and legal action would be taken if the organisers defied the municipalitys order and held the Puja.

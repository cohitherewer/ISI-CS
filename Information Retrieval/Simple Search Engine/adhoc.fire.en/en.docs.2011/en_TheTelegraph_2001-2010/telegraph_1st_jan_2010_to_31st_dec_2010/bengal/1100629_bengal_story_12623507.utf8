The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | State go-slow on schools no-fail policy
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      State go-slow on schools no-fail policy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 28: The Bengal government will not immediately introduce the policy of not detaining students till Class VIII as stipulated in the Centres right to education act.        
	School education minister Partha De told the Assembly during Question Hour today a final decision to do away with the screening of students between Classes V and VIII would be taken after a survey on its pros and cons and an understanding of how to negate any possible adverse impact.        
	The survey will be held to examine the progress of students under the present system in which laggards are held back (after Class IV). We will also find out to what extent the students will benefit if there is no annual screening. A decision on scrapping the annual exams and detention of students will be taken on the basis of the surveys findings, De said in response to a question from the RSPs Jane Alam Mian.         
	Schools  government, government-aided and private  across boards cannot detain students till Class VIII under Right of Children for Free and Compulsory Education Act, which was recently passed in Parliament. The law has become effective from April 1.         
	One of its clauses states no child shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till the completion of elementary education at the age of 14, a source in the education department said.         
	It is a central legislation and it cant be rejected. But before we accept the provision dealing with no-detention till Class VIII, we must know what measures need to be taken to ensure that the new policy works out successfully and students can really benefit from it. We need time to adopt the new law, the minister said.        
	De did not mention a timeframe within which the existing system  of no detention till Class IV  would be scrapped. Nor does the law specify any deadline for the implementation of the new policy, education officials said.        
	Many teachers feel the state is delaying the process because of its lack of education infrastructure. Once the no-detention policy is implemented, the demand for junior high schools (Classes V to VIII) will considerably increase. The policy will not work if the state government does not set up enough such schools, a primary school teacher said.         
	There are about 12,000 junior high and secondary schools in Bengal but that may not be enough to accommodate the possible increase in the number of students if the no-detention policy is implemented.        
	Annual exams are not held in Bengals 59,000-odd state-aided primary schools (till Class IV). But many students drop out after failing to clear their Class V annual exams.         
	What the teacher meant was that if these students didnt drop out, the state would find it difficult to give them room to sit.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Land rows, rail to airport
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Land rows, rail to airport

	Dec. 13: CPM-backed villagers today laid siege to the Howrah rail land at the centre of on-off protests over the past week, days after a Trinamul-led group first blocked work and then agreed to let it continue.        
	Land filling and construction of the coach factory will be allowed only after rail authorities promise job and higher compensation in writing, said Mangal Bar, a local CPM leader at the forefront of todays blockade at the site in Sankrails Bhagabatipur. The 630-acre plot was acquired in 1981 for a coach unit.        
	Leaders of the Trinamul-led Save Farmland Committee, which had halted work on December 7 before agreeing to let it go ahead following assurances from the local party MLA, appeared resigned to the U-turn.         
	If the land-losers do not accept this decision, what can we do? said committee leader Ashis Malik.        
	Later, Citu workers had blocked fly ash-laden trucks heading to the site amid allegations that they wanted all of the unloading job given to them.        
	In Durgapurs Andal, farmers chased away officials of Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Ltd (BAPL), which is setting up an airport and a township, after they went to erect a fence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Asim insists on coal dues
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Asim insists on coal dues
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 24: Asim Dasgupta today insisted that the Centre owed the state government Rs 4,833 crore in coal cess.         
	I have spoken to him (Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee) over the phone. There has been no decision (yet) on Bengals claim of Rs 4,833 crore, the state finance minister said this afternoon.        
	Dasgupta said the state was suffering because there had been no revision in coal royalty since 1991-92.         
	He said he had full faith in Mukherjee and was certain that the issue would be resolved through discussions.        
	The coal royalty dues form a major chunk of the Rs 7,000 crore the state government claims the Centre owes it.         
	Union finance ministry officials had said the coal royalty arrears could not be given to Bengal as the state was charging a cess of 25 per cent from companies that mine coal.         
	There are several states which levy cess and are entitled to the royalty dues. Our claim is founded on the provisions of the Constitution and the Supreme Courts directives, Dasgupta said today.         
	We have offered to lower the cess rate to 5 per cent once the dues are cleared, he said.

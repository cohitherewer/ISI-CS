                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Manas asks Didi to join protests
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 3: Manas Bhuniya today urged the Trinamul Congress to organise a joint movement with the Congress against the unprecedented violence taking place in Bengal at the behest of the CPM.        
	We strongly condemn the cycle of violence in the state. The series of political killings and the increasing instances of law-and-order violation are unprecedented and cannot continue, the sate Congress chief today told a news conference in Calcutta.         
	Alleging that the violence was being patronised by police and the administration, Bhuniya urged the leading Opposition party to launch a joint movement against the Left Front government. He said he would wait for Mamata Banerjees reply.        
	Bhuniya denounced the death of two Trinamul supporters in police firing in Burdwans Raina on Wednesday. The Congress leader announced a protest programme in Burdwan on December 14.         
	He also announced a series of protest programmes all over Bengal. He said party activists would gherao the superintendents of police and the district magistrates.         
	On December 6, the SP and the DM of East Midnapore will be gheraoed for the CPM violence in Khejuri last week.         
	The party will organise a protest rally in Purulias Balarampur on the same day. On December 7, barricades will be put up in Birbhums Suri. The next day, a similar mode of protest will be undertaken in Howrah against police apathy in taking up the case of the gangrape of a minor girl.        
	Bhuniya said the Chhatra Parishad had been instructed to organise a massive rally in Calcutta and march to Writers Buildings on December 15 to protest the death of a student in police firing at Murshidabads Nabagram last month.         
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee said his party welcomed any move by anyone to stem the violence unleashed by the ruling party.        
	The inspector-general of police (western range), Z. Hassan, today visited Rainas Jyotsadi village with other senior police officers to probe if the two Trinamul supporters had been killed in police firing.

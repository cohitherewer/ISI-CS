The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Blaze onus triggers highrise outcry
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Blaze onus triggers highrise outcry
          KINSUK BASU                                            
	Calcutta, July 3: The probe committee formed after the Stephen Court blaze has said in its report that occupants are as much accountable for fires in their apartments as the builders, sparking a debate.        
	While some residents of city highrises agreed with the committees observation, others asked why the promoters should not be held mainly responsible.        
	In its report submitted to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee yesterday, the 12-member S.N. Roy Committee said that merely holding Stephen Court Limited, the buildings lessee, responsible for the fire that killed 43 people in March would amount to justifying the negligence on the part of its residents.         
	Although the lessee was responsible for the buildings upkeep, the residents of Stephen Court were equally accountable for the lack of basic fire-fighting facilities there, the report says.        
	If you are living on the 12th floor of a highrise and enjoying the cool breeze and the sunshine, then its also your responsibility to see that fire-safety measures are in place, said Nibir Dasgupta, the secretary of the residents association of Ruchira Residency, a highrise near Ruby Hospital.         
	All the residents of the 576 flats here belong to the high-income group. Almost everyone is aware of the Stephen Court disaster. Yet when we organise mock fire drills, we struggle to get participants. You cant blame only the promoter.        
	The committee observed that Stephen Court did not even have basic fire-fighting facilities, not even fire extinguishers, when the blaze broke out though there was a separate committee for each block to look after the buildings maintenance.         
	Office cubicles  which were stacked with highly inflammable articles like plywood and synthetic fibres  were allowed to mushroom at the highrise.         
	The report blames the residents for neglecting the electrical wiring along the staircases. Fire-detection systems were not installed, the report adds.         
	The Park Street building did not have an alternative escape route for occupants in case of emergencies even though the number of tenants had kept on increasing with each passing year.        
	The lapses on the part of the buildings residents obviously constitute a part of our report, S.N. Roy, the committees chairman, told The Telegraph.         
	Dipak Bibra, a resident of Stephen Court, said the occupants of the building had failed to come together even after the fire.        
	The mayor has told us he cant cater to the individual needs of the residents and that we should have an association. But that is still to happen, Bibra said.         
	Many highrise occupants argued that promoters should be held more accountable for the facilities  or the lack of them  in such apartments.         
	We dont always get to see how the buildings are constructed before taking possession of a flat. How would you know if the electrical wires are fire-resistant and whether adequate care has been taken while installing them, said Rupayan Chaudhury of Avishikta II, a cluster of high-rises off EM Bypass.         
	In most cases, the promoters dont even provide us with a map of the internal wiring and the connections. So how does one go about tackling an eventuality like a fire? he asked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Teacher hounded out of home
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Teacher hounded out of home
          INDRANIL SARKAR                          Khan                                  
	Burdwan, Nov. 5: A Burdwan headmaster fled his home with his family yesterday after local CPM activists allegedly ransacked his home and threatened to kill him.        
	Korban Ali Khan said the attackers accused him of delaying the reinstatement of the party-controlled managing committee at his school in Raina.        
	The elections at Golam Imam High School had led to a court case, which meant the new managing committee could not be allowed to start functioning, and an administrator had been appointed.        
	The administrator, Prasanta Mukherjee, asked the headmaster in a letter dated October 26 to reinstate the newly elected managing committee within a fortnight, a source in the office of the district inspector of secondary schools said.        
	Headmaster Khan, who is in his 40s, said he received the letter on October 28 and began the process to reinstate the committee the next day.         
	On October 29, some CPM activists entered my office at the school and threatened to kill me if I failed to complete the process within three days. I immediately lodged a police complaint and stopped going to school, Khan said.        
	He alleged the police did not take any action.        
	On Wednesday evening, as he returned home from the market, he saw a group of people waiting in front of his house with sticks.        
	They were calling my name and shouting abuses, he said. The mob did not notice me. Suddenly, one of my neighbours called me into his house. I saw my wife sitting there with our two-and-a-half-month-old daughter.        
	He added: When the demonstrators left after half an hour, I returned to my home. It had been ransacked; furniture had been broken and windowpanes shattered.        
	Khan said he again lodged a complaint with Raina police station but the officers told him to sort out the problem through discussion.        
	I felt so insecure that I left my house last night. I am staying at a relatives home with my family. I have not been going to my school, Khan said.        
	Sources in the district inspectors office said Trinamul Congress-backed candidates had boycotted the school managing committee elections of January 2009, held to elect guardians representatives to the panel.         
	The CPM-backed candidates won all the six seats uncontested. The Trinamul-backed candidates then alleged that the CPM had stopped the guardians from voting.

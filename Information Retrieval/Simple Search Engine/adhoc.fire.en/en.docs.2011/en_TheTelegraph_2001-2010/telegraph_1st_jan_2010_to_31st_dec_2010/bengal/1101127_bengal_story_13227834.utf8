The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Wage protest at factory
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Wage protest at factory
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Nov. 26: Citu-affiliated workers demanding a wage hike allegedly stopped production at a private rolling mill in Durgapur last night and forced company officials and workers to leave the compound, prompting the management to suspend work.         
	Sundar Singh, the plant manager of steel-bar manufacturer SRMB Srijan Ltd, said that around 8.30pm yesterday, the protesters barged into the factory waving red flags and forced the workers to stop production and leave.        
	They also allegedly pushed 60 officers, including two assistant general managers, out of their offices.         
	The Citu-affiliated workers have been demanding immediate implementation of a draft agreement on a daily wage hike of Rs 35 for contract workers.         
	The plant authorities said the agreement had been prepared following four meetings with the labour department where both union and management representatives were present.         
	Singh said the company had only unofficially agreed to increase the daily wages by Rs 35. He added: We cannot immediately accept the unions hike demand as the draft is yet to be finalised.         
	Singh said at present, the contract workers got Rs 115 per day according to the old agreement, which expired in February.         
	We told the protesters the draft would be finalised only after it was ratified by the managements of all the rolling mills of the company in the state. We also promised to pay arrears to the workers after the implementation of the draft. But they refused to listen.        
	Sukhen Sarkar, the Citu vice-president in Burdwan, said the wage agreement was supposed to be signed on November 24 but the mill owners were delaying the process.        
	Sarkar said he had requested the factory authorities last night not to issue a suspension-of-work notice without informing the union. But my request fell on deaf ears, he added.

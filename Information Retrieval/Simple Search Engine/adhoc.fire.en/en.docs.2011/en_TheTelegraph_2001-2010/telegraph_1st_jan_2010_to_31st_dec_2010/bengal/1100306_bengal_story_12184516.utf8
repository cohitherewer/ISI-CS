	Calcutta, March 5: Telugu Deepak, the Maoist arrested in Calcutta this week, is believed to have told his interrogators that Khobad Ghandy, a politburo member of the banned outfit, was one of the brains behind the rebel attack on the chief ministers convoy in 2008.        
	The decision of attacking chief ministers convoy was taken during the CPI (Maoists)s politburo meeting. Ghandy, a 62-year-old leader of the outfit, was one of those members who adopted the decision. He is the only politburo member of the organisation who was arrested after the attack. So, we have at least one of the architects who chalked out a plan to kill the chief minister, said an officer.        
	According to sources, Deepak said he was not one of the decision makers, but played an important role in implementing the plans.        
	Once the decision of attacking Bhattacharjees convoy was taken, the military commission was given the task to implement it. It was the outfits guerrilla wing chief, Kishan, who assigned Deepak the task to carry out the politburos plan. Deepak was given the task because he was overseeing the Bengal guerrilla wing, said an officer.        
	The CID will file an application before a local court for Ghandys production warrant and forward it to Delhi.        
	State director-general of police Bhupinder Singh said an intelligence branch team from Delhi would come to Calcutta to interrogate Deepak.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, July 11: Suspected Maoists have asked two local CPM leaders at a Murshidabad village to pay Rs 50,000 each to the families of two persons the rebels had allegedly killed on July 6.         
	The suspected Maoists hung a poster from the clothesline of a house in Dudhsar village yesterday, ordering Asgar Ali, a CPM local committee member, and Badruddin Biswas, a branch committee member, to pay the money to the families of Mohar Ali and Saidul Sheikh. The poster was written in red ink and signed CPI (Maobadi).         
	Police have removed the poster.         
	Mohar and Saidul, who used to live in Dudhsar village, were shot dead by suspected Maoists on the charge of being police informers.         
	The killings were possibly the first Maoist strike in Murshidabad.        
	A scared Asgar said he had informed the officer in charge of local police station and my party leaders. How will I pay Rs 50,000? I dont have so much money. The poster has created panic in the village, he said.        
	A dozen policemen armed with rifles have been deployed to guard the village for a few days.         
	District superintendent of police B.L. Meena said the police were investigating who had put up the poster.         
	The district CPM leadership said the police should first find out if the poster was genuine.        
	How do we know that the poster was genuine? Let the police investigate, said Nripen Chowdhury, the district CPM secretary.

	Tamluk, Nov. 9: A 500-strong Trinamul mob allegedly snatched a party worker with suspected Maoist links from an East Midnapore police station soon after he was held last night in a Calcutta arms haul case, triggering arrests of local leaders and a siege-and-blockade backlash.        
	Surajit Jana, in his forties, had been held in connection with the arms haul from Calcuttas Baguiati in January last year.         
	The district authorities have suspended the officer-in-charge of Bhupatinagar police station, Madanmohan Roy.        
	The OC had kept the arrested person inside his chamber instead of the lock-up. That is why it became easy for the mob to snatch the prisoner. We have suspended the OC for dereliction of duty, said H. Meena, additional superintendent of police of Contai.        
	The police had been looking for Surajit, a Trinamul worker and a resident of Patashpur in East Midnapore, in the arms haul case.        
	Around 7,000 rounds of bullets, 12 firearms and a bullet-proof jacket were recovered from a traders house in Baguiati.         
	Apart from the arms haul case, Surajit has been charged with having Maoist links and buying illegal arms from Bihar and selling it to criminals, said the additional SP.         
	Acting on a tip-off, CID officials waited at a bus stop at Kalinagar in Marishda area, 8km from Contai town.        
	Surajit got down from the bus with his wife Aparna around 9pm. The CID team immediately arrested Surajit, put him in a car and left for the CID headquarters in Calcutta, an officer said.        
	Aparna informed local Trinamul leaders on the cellphone. When the car reached Heria on Digha-Calcutta highway, about 25 Trinamul workers blocked the road. The CID officials then turned left and drove to the nearest police station at Bhupatinagar.         
	But a kilometre before the police station, nearly 200 Trinamul workers again blocked their path and tried to drag Surajit out of the car.         
	But police had been informed and the OC led a force there shortly. The CID and police officials then took Surajit to the police station.        
	A police officer said Surajit was initially kept inside the lock-up.         
	But nearly 500 Trinamul activists gathered in front of the police station around 11pm and demanded that Surajit was a political prisoner and should be kept outside the lock-up. Yielding to pressure, the OC brought the prisoner and made him sit in his chamber. Soon, Trinamul activists forced in to the police station and snatched Surajit away, said the officer.        
	After the escape, additional SP Meena picked up 11 Trinamul leaders and supporters, including Bhanucharan Maity, the chief of the local panchayat, in raids through the night and took them to Contai police station.        
	But the police could not produce those arrested in court as about 4,000 Trinamul activists surrounded both Contai and Bhupatinagar police stations demanding their release. Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari held a protest rally in front of Bhupatinagar police station. The police have framed Surajit in a false case, he said.

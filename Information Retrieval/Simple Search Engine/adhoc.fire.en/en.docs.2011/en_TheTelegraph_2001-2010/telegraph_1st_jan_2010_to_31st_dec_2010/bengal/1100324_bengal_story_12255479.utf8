  - New lease of life for invalid training certificates          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta, March 23: A Calcutta High Court division bench today said the certificates issued by 120 primary teachers training institutes before being declared illegal for not having a national councils approval should be considered valid.        
	The order means that the 30,000 primary teachers who had got their jobs on the str-ength of certificates from these institutes no longer run the risk of losing them.         
	While passing the order, the division bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice P.C. Ghosh dismissed a petition demanding the sack for the 30,000 teachers who had invalid certificates.        
	On March 3, 2006, another division bench of the high court had said that 120 of the 138 primary teacher training schools across the state were illegal because they did not have the mandatory approval from the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE).         
	In that judgment, the court had also said that the certificates issued by the 120 institutes were invalid.         
	Soon after, questions were raised about the future of those who had already been appointed by the school education department on the basis of their training certificates.         
	But todays order made it clear the services of these teachers would not be affected.         
	It also came as a relief to the department, which was worried about the possible fallout if so many teachers had to be sacked.         
	Arguing against the sack plea earlier, advocate-general Balai Ray had told the court that since the council had in 2004 given the institutions time till December that year to get themselves regularised, the certificates issued till 2004 should not come under the purview of the 2006 order. He had also said the court should not pass an order against these teachers without hearing them.         
	The division bench accepted the advocate-generals arguments and said the certificates issued between 1998 and 2004 by the institutes should be considered valid.        
	The division bench added that after going through the NCTE rules, it had no hesitation in dismissing the plea.        
	The lawyers for the petitioners  led by Hiranmoy Bhowmik of Bagnan in Howrah  said they would move the Supreme Court against the order.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Out of polls, says Halim
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Out of polls, says Halim
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 2: Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim today announced that he would retire from parliamentary politics and instead concentrate on party work.        
	I have decided to retire from parliamentary politics on health grounds. I have been contesting elections for 34 long years since 1971. Now, the time has come to take rest. I am not going to contest elections any more because of my failing health, Halim told a news conference in the Assembly while speaking about the budget session beginning March 9.         
	The budget will be presented on March 22 and the session will end on March 31.        
	Halim had spoken about his intention to stay away from elections at an all-party meeting yesterday.         
	Asked if he had informed the CPM of his decision, Halim said today: I have informed my party that I am no more in a position to contest elections. But the party will have a final say.         
	The 76-year-old, who has been the Assembly Speaker for 28 years, added: I believe in Marxist ideals. I am ready to take up other responsibilities that the party assigns to me.         
	Asked if he was unwilling to contest the Assembly polls after seeing the CPM suffer successive debacles, Halim flared up. I dont attach any importance to victory or loss. In every poll, some people will win, some will lose.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Villagers stall work on clean-fuel project
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Villagers stall work on clean-fuel project
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                           Drills and rigs for the exploration of methane in Asansol                                  
	Durgapur, Jan. 10: Residents of a CPM-dominated Bankura village have stopped a companys exploration for methane, demanding jobs in case it strikes the gas.         
	At Bauripara, they have also demanded roads, tube-wells and even a temple.        
	The Delhi-based Great Eastern Energy Corporation Ltd has a licence from the state government to explore for coal-bed methane in Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia districts and produce compressed natural gas (CNG).        
	It has already struck gas in Asansol, and 800 autos in the area now run on the environment-friendly CNG.        
	On December 29, Great Easterns engineers and officials were heading to Bauripara from Asansol with their equipment in a convoy of 20 trucks and trailers when the villagers stopped them.        
	They wanted jobs as labourers and contractors. The villagers told our officials that they had nothing to gain from the gas exploration if it did not fetch them jobs. They wanted jobs as labourers, contracts to engage labourers and construction of temples, a Great Eastern official said.        
	Assistant general manager Debashis Mahanta lodged an FIR with the local Saltora police station after some of the villagers stoned the trucks and held back six of them.        
	We havent been able to start work yet as a result of the agitation and our machinery are lying idle, said a Great Eastern official.        
	The CPM chief of the loc- al Bamuntor panchayat, Ujjal Mondal, voiced support for the villagers demands. How can we ignore them? They need jobs, he said.        
	The CPM-backed agitation comes at a time the Trinamul Congress is spearheading protests against industrial projects in several districts and reaping electoral gains from them. Mamata Banerjees party has opposed a nuclear power plant, a chemical hub, a shipyard and a knowledge park in East Midnapore and a thermal power plant in Burdwan. It owes its political resurgence to the agitation in Singur that drove Tata Motors out of Bengal.        
	The district CPM leadership tried to distance itself from the Bauripara protests.        
	We do not support such arm-twisting because we want a healthy working condition in Bengal. I have asked our local leaders to speak to the villagers and persuade them to withdraw their agitation, said Bankura CPM secretary Amiya Patra.         
	District magistrate Mohammad G.A. Ansari said he had asked the subdivisional officer to inquire into the resistance to the gas exploration.        
	In Asansol, about 35km from Bauripara by road, Great Eastern had repaired village roads and sunk deep tube-wells as part of their social responsibility. But we never realised that villagers demands would assume such proportion, an official said. We will not be pressured in such an illegal manner.        
	However, the villagers are adamant. The company will explore for gas in our village and make money but what will we get? We want jobs for at least one member of each family in the village or they will have to leave, said Gopal Bauri, 30, a day labourer.         
	Another labourer, Madan Bauri, 28, said: Villagers across Bengal are demanding jobs whenever a factory is coming up. Why shouldnt we?        
	A Great Eastern official said it would be almost impossible to promise jobs to villagers because neither gas exploration nor extraction was labour-intensive. We only need skilled personnel and machines.         
	In Asansol, the company has set up 25 wells, which draw methane from the coal bed for CNG production. The green fuel is sold through Indian Oil pumps in Asansol, Raniganj and Durgapur towns.

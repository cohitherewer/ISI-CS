          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, March 14: A couple have been detained by Calcutta police on the charge of poisoning to death their four children in Hooghly.        
	Kaushal Chowdhury, a 45-year-old who worked in a cloth store on Park Street, and his wife Preeti were traced in Posta, Burrabazar, at a relatives house tonight. Police said Kaushal, who hailed from Sahebganj in Jharkhand, was jobless for the past three months as the shop had shut down.         
	The four children  Divya, 20, Prerna, 18, Govinda, 15, and Tiya, 11  were taken to Serampore Walsh Hospital. The girls were declared brought dead. The boy died later.        
	Divya and Prerna were students of Digambar Jain Balika Vidyalaya in Burrabazar in Classes XII and XI respectively. Govinda was a Class IX student of Radhika Town School in Rishra. Tiya, in Class IV, also went to the same Rishra school. The family stayed in a rented flat in Rishra.        
	After preliminary investigations, we have gathered that Kaushal was frustrated because of his joblessness, said Nirupam Ghosh, officer in charge of Rishra police station.        
	The police said Kaushals brother-in-law Madanlal Lohia, also a Rishra resident, got a call from him around 10.30am today. Kaushal told Madanlal that he had mixed poison in soft drinks that he had given his son and daughters. He also said that he and Preeti, 37, were going to commit suicide, Ghosh said.        
	Madanlal rushed to Kaushals flat and found the three girls on the floor and foaming at the mouth. The son was in a similar condition on the bed. I informed the neighbours and called the police, he said.        
	Kaushal and Preeti did not commit suicide. They went to a relatives house in Posta. As soon as the relative learnt about the crime from TV, he called the police, said an officer of Posta police station.

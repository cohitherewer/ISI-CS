	Calcutta, July 17: A middle-aged businessman, Kishore Daan, allegedly jumped to his death from the first floor of his north Calcutta home this afternoon, apparently unable to cope with loneliness and depression.        
	An hour or so earlier, an unidentified man had ended his life under the wheels of a Garia-bound train at Park Street Metro station, the sight of him leaping onto the tracks causing a woman commuter to fall unconscious on the platform.        
	Neighbours found the body of Daan, who was in his fifties, in the courtyard of his two-storey house off Tamer Lane, near the MG Road-College Street crossing, around 12.30pm. Blood was oozing out of his nose.        
	A divorcee and the owner of a small courier company, Daan used to live with his son Krishnendu.        
	Police and neighbours said Daan was a recluse. Kishorebabu hardly mixed with anybody and we know very little about him, a neighbour said.         
	Some neighbours suggested Daan had been depressed because Krishnendus job with a publishing house used to keep him out of the city most of the time. Krishnendu was not in Calcutta today.        
	The 11.15am suicide on the tracks stalled Metro services between Esplanade and Kavi Nazrul stations for over half an hour.        
	The police said the man, believed to be in his forties, wore brown trousers and a grey shirt. Two phone numbers were found inside one of his trouser pockets but, the police said, the numbers did not exist.

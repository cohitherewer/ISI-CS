          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Calcutta today bagged a promise of 82km of Metro tracks at an estimated cost of Rs 11,000 crore, but railway officials were left wondering where the money would come from.        
	The funding process has not been decided yet, a member of the Railway Board said. We will discuss the projects funding with the Planning Commission. Let us see what emerges.        
	The state government had provided a third of the funds for the extension of the Metro from Tollygunge to Garia.         
	But we dont know whether the railways will approach the Bengal government for a similar joint venture, a railway official said. That is up to the railway minister to decide.        
	Bengal officials said even if the railways approached them, they would in all probability have to say no as the state government had no funds for this at the moment.        
	Mamata Banerjees budget mentions four major Metro projects  Joka-BBD Bag through Majherhat, Noapara-Barasat through airport, Dum Dum-New Garia through Rajarhat and Baranagar to Barrackpore and Dakshineswar.        
	According to railway ministry sources, the Planning Commission has sanctioned all the projects and work will start in the coming financial year.        
	 The Joka-BBD Bag line will cover 16.75km and will be mostly elevated. It will be a stand-alone system, not connected with the existing Metro, a senior Metro official said.         
	The tracks will be elevated between Joka and the Maidan. We dont want to spoil the skyline of the Maidan area and so the tracks will go underground up to BBD Bag, the official added.         
	At a meeting the Metro authorities had with the state transport department recently, the state government is said to have requested them to follow the alignment of the tram tracks for the project.         
	Although a stand-alone project, it will have passenger interchanges with several modes of transport with the suburban train services at Majherhat, the existing Metro at Esplanade and East-West Metro at BBD Bag.         
	The Dum Dum-New Garia project will be 32km long and touch the airport.         
	However, an official said the project had yet to be planned in detail because a number of flyovers are coming up in the airport area.        
	The Noapara-Barasat line via airport will cover 18.3km. The Baranagar-Barrackpore route will cover 12.5km while the one to Dakshineswar will be 2km long.        
	Noapara will be the main hub. Tenders for the construction of the station have already been issued, he said.         
	Noapara will have three platforms for trains of different routes. The train from New Garia will run to Barrackpore while passengers for airport and Barasat will have to hop onto another train at Noapara.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Park St concern in CPM
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Park St concern in CPM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 26: The CPM state committee will meet for two days from tomorrow to assess the partys preparations for the polls to 82 civic bodies across the state in May-end amid concerns in the city unit about the possible fallout of the Park Street fire.        
	State party secretary Biman Bose had described the polls as exceptional in view of their political significance a year before the Assembly elections. The blaze in the city has added another dimension to it.        
	The chief ministers indictment of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and admission of connivance of some in the administration with the illegal construction racket has landed the party on the back foot as it had been at the helm of the CMC for three decades barring five years of Trinamul rule. The party is already facing an uphill task in the city, having lost to Trinamul in all three Lok Sabha constituencies here last year.         
	The CPMs Calcutta district committee secretary, Raghunath Kushari, however, tried to clarify Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees statement. He did not indict anybody or any board specifically. We never said there is no corruption in the administration. Let the government investigate the fire and find out who were responsible, he said.         
	Despite the efforts to disown the increasing number of real estate promoters and building materials suppliers with interests in illegal construction among its ranks, the party has virtually admitted its failure to stem the rot in internal documents, including the city units recent report.         
	However, Kushari said the CPM alone should not be blamed. Some of the mud is bound to stick to our partymen. But all political parties have a role (in illegal constructions). The probe into the Park Street fire will find out which partys members were involved.         
	As Trinamul tries to extract political mileage out of the blaze and demands the CPM mayor and municipal affairs ministers scalps, the CPM plans to fight back by focusing on the Oppositions role in preventing the demolition of illegal constructions.

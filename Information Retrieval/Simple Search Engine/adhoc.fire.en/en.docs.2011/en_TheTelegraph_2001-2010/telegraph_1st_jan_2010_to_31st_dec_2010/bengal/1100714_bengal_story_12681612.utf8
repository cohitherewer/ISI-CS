          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 13: Four alleged Trinamul supporters have been arrested for yesterdays attack on a Khejuri-bound Youth Congress convoy, but Mamata Banerjees party denied they were its activists and blamed the attack on hooligans trying to exploit its sway over the area.        
	The Congress was unhappy with the arrests, saying more people were involved in the attack.        
	State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya said he had taken up the matter with Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee and Mukul Roy and told them the incident could hurt alliance efforts.         
	Both Partha and Mukul promised me they would take action if partymen were involved, Bhuniya said over the phone from Delhi.        
	The Youth Congress team, led by general secretary Usha Naidu, was heading to the East Midnapore pocket as part of an all-India membership drive for the partys youth wing, headed by Rahul Gandhi.        
	Police claimed Sambhu Singh, 30, Narayan Singh, 40, Sheikh Ujir, 41 and Sheikh Jainal, 42, all residents of Kulota village near Khejuri, had admitted they were Trinamul supporters. All the four accused admitted during interrogation that they are Trinamul Congress supporters, said East Midnapore police chief Asok Biswas. The four were granted bail by a Contai court later in the day.        
	Mamood Hossain, the Trinamul general secretary of Khejuri, claimed the party had nothing to do with the four. Some local hooligans had masterminded the attack.         
	Another senior Trinamul leader in Khejuri pleaded helplessness, saying his party had no control on the infiltration of anti-socials out to take advantage of our (rising) political fortunes.         
	The Congress didnt appear convinced. We saw a dozen Trinamul Congress activists, holding party flags. But the police, in connivance with the local Trinamul leadership, are shielding the real culprits, alleged Congress district chief Manik Bhowmik, who was in the convoy and whose car window was smashed.

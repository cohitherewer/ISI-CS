          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          The abandoned child at the Digha police station. Jahangir Badsa        
	Tamluk, Feb. 20: A two-year-old girl who had been abandoned by a young man at a shop in Digha and taken to a police station cried out ma when she saw the body of a woman there.        
	Police said the woman, found strangled with her hands and feet tied, might be her mother.         
	Villagers spotted the body of the young woman dumped in a marsh in New Digha. There were black marks on her throat, said Sanjay Srivastav, the officer-in-charge of Digha police station.        
	A police officer said that around 8.30pm last night, a man, aged about 30, had come to the shop near the beach with the child in his arms.        
	He asked the shopkeeper to keep an eye on the child for a few minutes while he went to the toilet. But he did not return, the police officer said.        
	When the child started crying, the shopkeeper went in search of the man.        
	When I could not find him, I contacted the police. They told me to take the child to the house of a local resident for the night and bring her to the police station today, said Kanchan Mondal, the shopkeeper.        
	Sometime after Mondal had brought the baby to the police station, the body of the woman, believed to be in her 20s, was wheeled in on a cycle van.        
	The police said the child started crying when she saw the body, draped in a blue sari.        
	She cried out ma and started sobbing uncontrollably. As soon as we took the child near the body, she tried to jump out of the arms of the woman holding her. The way she cried and tried to go near the body, we are almost certain the dead woman was her mother, Srivastav said.        
	Tamluk sub-divisional police officer Tarun Haldar said: We have registered a murder case. We will send the photographs of the child and the dead woman to neighbouring police stations for identification.         
	We will have a sketch of the man drawn. The woman could have been a tourist who had come to Digha with someone, he added.

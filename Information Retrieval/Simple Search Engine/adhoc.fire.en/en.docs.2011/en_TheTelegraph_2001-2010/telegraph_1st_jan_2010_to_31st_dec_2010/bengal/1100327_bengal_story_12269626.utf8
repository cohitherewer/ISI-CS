	Durgapur, March 26: An ammunition depot housing enough explosives to blow up a highrise went up in flames at the army base in Panagarh early this morning.        
	Villagers woken up by the sound of deafening explosions said they saw shooting streaks of light like fireworks on Diwali night. Many residents of Budbud and Mankar villages, about 150km from Calcutta, fled homes in fear.        
	An army spokesman said the fire broke out around 1.15am at the sixteenth shed of the depot that had small arms, ammunition and explosives.         
	The armys own crisis management team, headed by Colonel A.D. Sethi, led the firefight and the blaze was brought under control in about two hours. It was completely doused around 4.30am.        
	There was no loss of life and no one was injured. A team led by a major general (in charge of ordnance) has gone to the spot to ascertain the cause of the fire and extent of damage. We kept small arms, ammunition and explosives in that shed, Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani, the chief public relations officer of the army in the eastern region, said in Calcutta.        
	Residents of the two adjacent villages said they were jolted out of sleep by the explosions and came rushing out of their homes. Budhon Gorai, a farmhand in his mid 30s, thought a war had broken out. The night sky was lit up by the flames. In its light, we saw thick black smoke billowing from the army base. Blasts followed one after the other and I thought it was a war, he said.        
	Budhon was among those who fled. Streaks of light went up into the sky like fireworks. We felt very scared. My wife took our baby girl in her arms, I took a bag and we ran out of the house.         
	They walked up to the Mankar railway station, 2km away, and spent the rest of the night in the waiting room there.         
	The Gorais had company there. Scores of people had taken refuge at the station, which comes 45km ahead of Burdwan on the way to Howrah.        
	An army insider said in Calcutta: There were enough explosives in this shed to blow up a highrise.        
	Sheikh Bulbul Ahmed, 35, a farm labourer from Tildanga, was alone at home and sleeping in the courtyard when the explosions woke him up. The sky had become flaming red. People were running in fear. I followed them to the stations, said Ahmed.        
	A more affluent farmer hired a car and bolted to a relatives place in Panagarh town, about 5km away. I did not want to take chances. We feared heavy damage to our village because of the explosions. I fled with my wife and two sons, said Ramen Ghosh, 42.        
	The officer in charge of the local Budbud police station, Ranabir Bag, said the villagers informed him about the fire around 1.35am. But when Bag reached the army base with a force, he was not allowed entry. Four engines arrived from Durgapur (30km away) around 2am and they were allowed inside, the OC said.        
	Durgapur divisional fire officer Ujjal Banerjee said the armys firefighters were already on the job when his team reached the blaze. They were spraying water and foam and we joined with them.        
	Two firemen were injured when their fire tender collided with a truck on the way to Pa-nagarh .

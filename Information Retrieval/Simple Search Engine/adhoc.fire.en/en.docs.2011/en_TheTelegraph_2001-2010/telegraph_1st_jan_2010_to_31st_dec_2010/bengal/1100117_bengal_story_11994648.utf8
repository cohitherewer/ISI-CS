          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Jan. 16: Trinamul Congress-led villagers today blocked the approach road to Haripur in East Midnapore where the Centre intends to build a nuclear power plant.        
	A bamboo-pole barricade was erected 2km from Hari- pur on the road linking it with Junput, 25km from Digha.        
	The convener of the resistance group, Trinamul leader Sukumar Bhunia, said the villagers would prevent the nuclear power plant at any cost. We wont allow even a survey of the land. The Union environment ministry has cleared the project and we fear a survey will be carried out soon, he said.        
	The barricade has been put up in such a way no four-wheeled vehicle would be able to pass. A little gap has been left for two-wheelers to pass through.        
	In January 2007, Nandigram villagers had dug up roads to prevent the administration from entering the area.         
	At a rally in Haripur on Monday, local Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari had threatened a Nandigram-style agitation if the Centre decided to go ahead with the project. No power in the world will be able to make it a reality, he said.        
	Intelligence reports have said that as in Nandigram, Maoists are active in the area to build public opinion against the project.        
	The blockade means a Congress team scheduled to visit Haripur tomorrow will have to go on cycles or motorcycles.        
	State Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya said the team was not visiting Haripur to advocate or oppose the project. We want to assess the ground situation and inform the Pri-me Minister about it.

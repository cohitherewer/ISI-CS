The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Body rots, police fight
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Body rots, police fight
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhadreswar (Hooghly), Jan. 31: As flies swarmed over the naked body of a little girl, two police forces fought for more than four hours today over who should lift it.        
	A measuring tape and a rulebook came out and curious calculations, arguments and more arguments followed off the railway tracks at Bhadreswar station in Hooghly.        
	Six-year-old Puja Das, who lived in a shanty off the station and begged on platforms with her brother, appeared to have been raped and killed. Her body lay without clothes, but neither railway police nor local police would even cover it with a cloth. One of the many assembled onlookers threw an old sweater on the body, giving it a semblance of respectability.        
	The station superintendent had called the local police as well as the Government Railway Police unit posted nearby after the body was spotted at 8.30am.         
	The GRP personnel refused to touch it, saying it was beyond the 10ft limit from the tracks up to which their jurisdiction extended. The Bhadreswar police station said it was on railway land.        
	A GRP constable called up officer-in-charge Ashis Majumdar. He reached the spot around the same time as Bengal police circle inspector (CI) Sibdas Mukherjee. The OC directed his constables to measure the distance of the body from the tracks. It was 24ft away.         
	Sir, according to police regulations, if a body is found more than 10ft away, it is a case under the district police, the OC told the inspector. But the CI knew for certain that the railway act mentioned 24ft. The act applies to the Railway Protection Force, not the GRP, argued OC Majumdar.        
	The GRP is a force controlled by the state government and tasked with managing law and order at stations. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) is under the railway ministry and has the job of protecting railway property.        
	Okay, I will check with my superior, inspector Mukherjee told the OC and called up the district superintendent of police around 1pm.        
	Satyajit Bandopadhyay was shocked when he got the call. I told the circle inspector to immediately send the body for a post-mortem, the SP said.        
	Puja had been missing since last evening, her nine-year-old brother Gopal said. Preliminary investigations suggest she was raped and murdered, the district police chief said.         
	His forces conduct prompted a crucial question. If the police want to pass on responsibility like this, how will the murder be solved? asked Manoj Saha, 32, a grocer.

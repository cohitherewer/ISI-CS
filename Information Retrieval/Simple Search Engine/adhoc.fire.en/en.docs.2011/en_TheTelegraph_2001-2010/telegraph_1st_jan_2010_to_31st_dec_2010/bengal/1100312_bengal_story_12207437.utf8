	Bankura, March 11: A police camp from where security forces had been withdrawn after the attack on the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in Shilda last month was set ablaze by suspected Maoists on Monday.        
	Although police learnt of the incident on Monday itself, they could visit the spot in Sutan village and carry out raids only on Tuesday because of inadequate forces.        
	The police said 60-odd Straco (specially trained company) personnel used to be stationed at the camp, providing security to the villagers and keeping an eye on the movement of the Maoists.        
	 The building in Sutan was originally a forest bungalow for tourists but had been handed over to the police, said Bankura superintendent of police Vishal Garg. The camp was abandoned as the forces had moved out after the Shilda attack to a more secure location nearby. Suspected Maoists, possibly with local help, set fire to it on Monday.

	Siliguri, Sept. 7: Tourists planning to visit the forests of north Bengal during the Durga Puja holidays might have to change their itineraries as an elephant census scheduled for the last week of this month has been postponed to late October.        
	The decision to defer the census has thrown a spanner in the plans of all those involved with tourism. Forest lodges and bungalows in the Dooars have already been booked for a month from the middle of October but as a rule, visitors are not allowed to enter the forests when an animal census is on. Tour operators and resort owners now fear that the bulk of the bookings would have to be cancelled.        
	Earlier, we had decided that the elephant census in north Bengal forests would be held from September 27 to 29 and accordingly, preparations were in progress. However, we had to give a second thought to the decision as the monsoon was getting prolonged in the region, said S.B. Patel, the chief conservator of forests (wildlife), north Bengal.         
	It has been decided now that the census will be conducted at the end of October as we expect that the rainy season to be over by then.         
	Sumita Ghatak, the divisional forest officer (wildlife II), said guests wouldnt be allowed in the departments properties during the census period. Visitors also wont be allowed to enter the forests as their presence can affect the census.         
	Patel said the forest department was yet to fix the new dates for the census, but indicated it would be after puja. Although I am yet to receive further instructions on the matter from higher-ups, the census is likely to take place at the end of next month.        
	Resort owners in the Dooars, who had expected brisk business this Puja, are keeping their fingers crossed. Kamal Bhowmik, secretary of the Lataguri Resort Owners Association, feared block cancellations.        
	We had come to know earlier that the forests would remain closed in September end. But we were not worried as the Puja season begins in the first week of October and continues till mid-November. But now that the census has been postponed to October-end, tourism will be hit hard in the Dooars. We are receiving bookings on a large scale and all of them have to be cancelled now. This is one of the best business seasons for us and our earnings would be hit, Bhowmik said.        
	The elephant count is done once in two years. The last was in April 2008, when the number was put at 350-400.

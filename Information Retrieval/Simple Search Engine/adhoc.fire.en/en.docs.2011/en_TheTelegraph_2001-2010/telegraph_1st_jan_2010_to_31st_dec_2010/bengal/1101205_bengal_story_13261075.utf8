The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Arrest after place name dilemma 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Arrest after place name dilemma 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 4: Maoist leader Kanchan was second-time unlucky.        
	Police had been keeping tabs on his movements over the past fortnight. About 10 days ago, they came to know from tapped phone conversations of Maoists that Kanchan would visit Barasat.         
	But the police missed the chance to arrest the Maoist leader because of an error of judgement caused by the place name and past experience. Barasat, the headquarters of North 24-Parganas, shares its name with a lesser-known pocket in South 24-Parganas.         
	The police sent its special task force to the latter place because two other Maoist state committee members  Telugu Deepak and Narayan Sanyal  had been arrested from South 24-Parganas.         
	However, the task force later received information that Kanchan had actually visited North 24-Parganas Barasat.        
	A police officer said the failure made us more determined to nab Kanchan. He added: We knew that we had messed up a golden opportunity. We knew we would not be getting too many chances.        
	The police said that to arrest Kanchan, they used the same tactics they had employed while trailing Deepak and Sanyal: tracking the cellphone calls of his aides.        
	Kanchan used more than one cellphone. So tracking him became a difficult task, an officer said. Instead, we tracked the cellphones of his contacts and operatives in Calcutta.        
	The police said that Kanchan would often get his aides to call his contacts in Calcutta instead of calling them himself. So, the police were not sure whether Kanchan himself would visit the city.        
	But a few days ago, the police came to know from telephone intercepts that Kanchan would be coming to Calcutta with four of his comrades, including a woman. An officer said: We learnt that they were coming to collect a consignment, which they planned to use for their activities in Purulia and Bankura.        
	The information turned out to be correct. The police today seized laptops, antennas and compact disks besides AK-47 bullets and circuits for explosives in city-wide raids.         
	An officer said the arrested Maoists used to frequent Calcutta to recruit cadres and motivate their well-wishers.         
	The officer added: We have realised that tapping cellphones still is the most effective way of arresting people we are after. Sometime or the other, people make mistakes or are careless.        
	Maoists in net        
	Two Maoists have been arrested in West Midnapore too in the past two days.        
	While Kajol Mahato was picked up from Belpahari yesterday, Ajit Sith was arrested from Belasole today.        
	Sith is the main accused in the murder of a CPM gram panchayat pradhan in July.         
	The police said Mahatos car was used by Maoists who had attacked the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in Shilda in February.        
	The duo have been remanded in four days police custody.

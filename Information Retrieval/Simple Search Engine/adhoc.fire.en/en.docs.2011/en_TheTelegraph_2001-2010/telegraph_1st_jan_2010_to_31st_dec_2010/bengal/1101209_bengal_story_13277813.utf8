The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM keeps retail FDI door shut
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM keeps retail FDI door shut
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 8: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the US selling vegetables in Bengal was not desirable, reaffirming the Left Fronts stand of not allowing foreign direct investment (FDI) in farm product retail .        
	We do not want FDI in agri-retail right now. America selling vegetables here is not desirable. We will strengthen the infrastructure for agriculture marketing in the interest of farmers, the chief minister said at Writers Buildings today.        
	Bhattacharjee was speaking while laying the foundations  through video conference  of 30 multipurpose cold storages in 16 districts. The storages are being set up in most districts. But in South 24-Parganas and South Dinajpur, land is yet to be identified.        
	According to Bhattacharjee, there is no cold storage facility for farmers, particularly for those growing flowers, fruits and vegetables in major production centres in rural areas. Officials said around 20 per cent of fruits, vegetables and flowers produced in Bengal go waste for want of storage facilities.        
	 We are doing very well in production of fruits and vegetables. But much needs to be done in agriculture marketing, said Bhattacharjee.

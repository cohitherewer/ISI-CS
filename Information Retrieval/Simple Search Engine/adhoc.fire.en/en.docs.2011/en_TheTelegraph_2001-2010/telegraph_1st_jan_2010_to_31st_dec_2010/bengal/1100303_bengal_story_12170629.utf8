          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Deepa, Mamata                          
	, Calcutta, March 2: Congress MP Deepa Das Munshi and her associate Shankar Singh today hit out at railway minister Mamata Banerjee for taking to the streets on the fuel price hike and then writing to the Prime Minister demanding its rollback.         
	Deepa, whose relations with the Trinamul Congress chief are strained, said she may agitate on the streets against the railway budget that Mamata presented on February 24. She, being a part of the government, should not have allowed her party supporters to take out a procession against the hike. She should have raised her voice at the cabinet meeting, Deepa said.         
	Over 500 Trinamul workers had marched in Calcutta on February 27, a day after fuel prices were raised.

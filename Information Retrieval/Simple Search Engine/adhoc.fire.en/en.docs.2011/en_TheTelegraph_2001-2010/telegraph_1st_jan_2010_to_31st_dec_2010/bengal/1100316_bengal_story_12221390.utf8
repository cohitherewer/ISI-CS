          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 15: The Congress today raised an uproar in the Assembly, questioning why Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had not attended a meeting on internal security called by the Prime Minister on February 7.        
	Congress Legislature Party leader Manas Bhuniya raised the question. Here we have a chief minister who is imprisoned in the state administration as well as in the party. He is like the imprisoned Shah Jahan. He cannot do anything on his own. He doesnt attend a meeting as important as that on internal security convened by the Prime Minister. What is happening in this state? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has become defunct. He is sending health minister Surjyakanta Mishra to Delhi on his behalf.         
	Bhuniyas remarks led to an uproar in the treasury bench. Chief minister Bhattacharjee, who was present in the House, said: Listen Manas babu, you are saying all sorts of things. I was present at the first meeting on February 6.        
	Sources at the Writers said Bhattacharjee attended the meeting on price rise on February 6. The meeting on internal security, on February 7, was attended by Mishra.

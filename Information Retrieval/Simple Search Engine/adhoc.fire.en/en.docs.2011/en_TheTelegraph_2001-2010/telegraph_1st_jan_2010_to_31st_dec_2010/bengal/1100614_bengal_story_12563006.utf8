          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            (From top) Munna Shaw and his son Raja                                 
	Chinsurah, June 13: A man was shot dead in front of his son on a local train from Howrah last night after he refused to give away to robbers the Rs 300 he had earned selling fruits behind Writers Buildings.         
	With a revolver staring at him, Munna Shaw had told the robbers yeh paise hum nahi denge. Is se kal mere biwi aur bachchon ho khana milega.        
	Teenager Raja stooped to hold his bleeding father, the others in the vendor coach, most of whom had been robbed, looked on petrified and the robbers jumped off the train, chugging slowly while entering Chandernagore station.         
	The midnight murder on Saturdays last Bandel-bound local shows how unsafe pass- engers are on short-distance trains.         
	Raja, 18, said they had heard screams from an adjoining coach when the train was about to enter Bhadreswar station but had not realised that there were robbers on the train. At Bhadreswar, seven young men entered our compartment. As soon as the train left the station, two of them took out guns and started robbing people at gunpoint. One of them came to my father. The man ordered my father to hand over all his money, but he refused, the boy said today, struggling to control his tears.        
	Police sources confirmed that the robbers had looted two compartments last night. Such was their dare they got off one compartment and hopped on to another.        
	Two Government Railway Police (GRP) constables were to have guarded the 12-bogey train. But they said they came to know about the attack after the traders in the vendor coach raised a hue and cry at Chandernagore, about 3km from Bhadreswar.        
	Munna, 50, was the only resistance the robbers had met. The 50-year-old man was holding one of the goons by the collar and trying to pin him down when the bullet pierced his abdomen. There was a boom and there was smoke around the nozzle of the gun... my father was on the floor with blood streaming out. I cant recall a thing after that, Raja said.        
	GRP deputy superintendent Mohammad Rehman today questioned the two constables on duty on the train.         
	They said they were in the second compartment from the drivers cabin after checking the coaches in the rear (where the vendor is located), Rehman said.        
	Although the youngest of Chandernagore resident Munnas three sons, Raja used to the be one to accompany him to the roadside stall at India Exchange Place.         
	He may soon have to take the same train home with his days earnings.

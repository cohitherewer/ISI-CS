The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buck stops at CM table
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buck stops at CM table
                                          
	Excerpts from what P. Chidambaram told a news conference in Lalgarh        
	Meeting with CM        
	My meeting yesterday with the chief minter was not only concerning the Maoist problem, it was about other issues as well. It was a good meeting. There are different perceptions. I have conveyed my perception to the chief minister. I have requested him to take stern measures so that law and order is maintained in the state....         
	Eventually, the buck stops at the chief ministers table. It should not go beyond the chief ministers table. If the buck goes beyond the chief ministers table, it is a failure of the administrative machinery.        
	Police role        
	The good point is that the state police and the paramilitary forces have been able to arrest a number of people as well as neutralise a few key Naxalites. The weak point is that the Naxals are still getting away with killing civilians. For example, in 2010 so far, 55 civilians have been killed. I have advised the state DGP and the home secretary to address these weak points.        
	Support for rebels        
	Very poor people live in this part of West Bengal. They understand the difference between the Naxalites and the government. They understand that the government sometimes can be good, sometimes ineffective. When I asked them, they said we dont have electricity, we dont have proper ration, we didnt have medical care until the PHC (primary health centre) was upgraded. I asked them, are the Naxalites going to bring you this? They are very clear that the Naxals are not going to bring development.         
	All the media writing that the people are supporting the Naxals is the writers own romanticised version.        
	PCPA        
	If there are police atrocities, if the PCPA (Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities) wants to have a dialogue, wants the central governments help to deal with the police, which may or may not have committed atrocities, Im open to talk to them. But why is the PCPA behaving or acting like a front organisation of the Naxals? What has the PCPA got to do with the Naxals if their problem is police atrocities?        
	The Naxals are cowards. Why are they hiding in forests. If they really want development, if they really want to express the problems of the people, they are welcome to talk. Ive said we can talk about anything in the world, just give up violence. Why does the PCPA.... support the Naxals?         
	Advice        
	I told the local people dont extend moral or material support (to the Maoists). I know you are doing it out of fear. (The) government can improve its performance, I am not denying that. I am not here to defend the government, but the Naxals are not going to bring you development.         
	The Naxals are killing you, the Naxals will only continue to kill you. Naxalism has no place. I think they understand that.... But they are equally agitated that they dont have education... medical care.        
	Maoist strategy        
	They are constantly revising their strategy. Their strategy is LIC  low-intensity conflict. They are regrouping, so we cant come to a conclusion that they have been tamed or they have gone into hiding.        
	We are not contemplating military action. The state armed police.... and the central paramilitary forces alone will be deployed to fight Naxals.        
	Maoist combat        
	In Bengal, its a mixed record... should improve.... All over the country, there is a mixed record, but (there has been a) significant improvement in the situation in Gadchiroli (Maharashtra), Chhattisgarh, certainly in Andhra Pradesh (where) the situation is virtually under control. But the situation is causing concern in Orissa, Jharkhand. Its a long-drawn struggle, it will take two to three years....        
	Political clashes        
	I think it is the duty of the government to ensure that the inter-party clashes come to an end. I was very unhappy with what had happened in Mangalkot in Burdwan. The chief minister had identified to me half a dozen police stations  Mangalkot, Nanoor, Khatrakul (he meant Khanakul), Canning, Khejuri, I cant remem-ber all of them right away  where the law and order is ineffective. I have told him the buck stops with you and you must ensure that the buck stops with the DM or with the SHO of the police station.

  - Party lines blur as protests stop work on rail land        A STAFF REPORTER                          The land earmarked for the coach factory in Sankrail. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                        
	Sankrail (Howrah), Dec. 7: Mamata Banerjee, the veteran of many a land protest, today faced one from her own supporters.        
	Trinamul Congress supporters today stopped work on a Howrah plot acquired by the railways almost three decades back complaining that the compensation was inadequate and demanding jobs for the land-losers. But the railway minister termed the protest a handiwork of outsiders.        
	The protest comes at a time Mamata has stepped up her campaign against alleged forced land takeovers in Rajarhat, the showpiece Calcutta township the ruling CPM is holding aloft as a potential job-generating business hub.        
	The 630-acre plot in Sankrails Bhagabatipur, meant for a coach factory, was taken over in 1981 when the Congress, now Mamatas ally, was in power in Delhi. Rail officials couldnt immediately explain why the project got delayed.        
	Around 9am, a railway contractor arrived with two pay-loaders and workers to level the land when 200 residents from Bhagabatipur and about three neighbouring villages blocked their path and forced them to leave eventually.         
	When the land was acquired in 1981, we were given only Rs 9,000 per acre, which we think was inadequate. We demand market prices for the land and jobs to one member of each land-loser family, said Ashis Malik, a local Trinamul activist spearheading the protests that also had some CPM supporters.        
	We received only Rs 12,000 for our plot. Now we feel we gave up our land at throwaway prices. We were promised jobs but not given any, said Susanta Bar, a Trinamul supporter.        
	Although Mamata claimed outsiders were behind the protest, she seemed willing to honour local sentiment and hinted at a rethink. The proposed factory will come up if the local people want it, she said.        
	But the Trinamul chief, without whose orders work on the plot could not have begun, promised jobs if the project went ahead. The state government had acquired the land and handed it over to the railway around 30 years ago. All this while the plot was lying unused. Once the factory comes up, locals will get jobs. If the people want it, then the factory will happen, otherwise not. I am not going to quarrel about this.        
	At the same time, Mamata expressed readiness to honour any legal order for higher compensation. Some of the land losers have filed petitions asking for more money. We will abide by any court decision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Adhir ups seat ante   with ally
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Adhir ups seat ante   with ally
  - District unit wants to contest in all constituencies        BARUN GHOSH                        Adhir Chowdhury                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 16: Murshidabad Congress leaders today decided to contest all 22 Assembly seats in the party bastion, a day after local strongman Adhir Chowdhury boycotted ally Mamata Banerjees event and a chopper snag kept out Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Although seat-sharing deals for the polls due next summer will be finalised by the high command, Congress sources said the Murshidabad hard talk would help the party drive a hard bargain with Trinamul.        
	If we are able to highlight before people Trinamuls misdemeanour towards us, we will be able to bargain hard for a substantial number of seats, said a Congress general secretary.        
	By misdemeanour, the leader was alluding to claims that Chowdhury, also a local MP, had not been invited to the rail programme Mamata presided over at Sagardighi, in Murshidabad, yesterday evening.        
	Mamata Banerjee humiliated our MP by not inviting him. We have decided to field our nominees in all the 22 seats because Trinamul does not exist in the district. We shall stick to our guns, regardless of whether the alliance is struck with Trinamul in other parts of the state, warned Asoke Das, a district general secretary.        
	The Congress won all three Lok Sabha seats in Murshidabad and was ahead of its rivals in the 22 Assembly segments  which form the parliamentary constituencies  up from 19 in 2006 because of delimitation.        
	Sources said Mukherjee, in whose Jangipur Lok Sabha constituency Sagardighi falls, may have dropped out at the last minute to avoid upsetting Chowdhury and his supporters. Deepa Das Munshi, the Congress MP from Raiganj said: Adhirda is right to protest. Even I was not invited to todays railway events at my doorstep in South Dinajpur.        
	Deepa, who like Chowdhury, has had uneasy equations with Mamata, underscored the importance of the regions satraps. We have over 80 seats in six north Bengal districts. Party ranks wont accept a seat-sharing deal at the cost of our dignity.        
	The words appear to echo Rahul Gandhi who had asserted during his Bengal visit three months back that the alliance with Trinamul could not come at the cost of the Congresss self-respect and dignity.        
	Malda leader and MP Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury, who had once spoken of contesting all 12 seats in his district, said: One should not consider us insignificant. Our partner should treat us with some dignity.

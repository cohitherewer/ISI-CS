The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Suman slams rebel-fight law
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Suman slams rebel-fight law
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kabir Suman                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 2: Kabir Suman today publicly expressed his anger at the Centre for en- forcing the undemocratic Unlawful Activities Prevention Act to combat Maoists, keeping up his penchant for embarrassing Mamata Banerjee.        
	After paying tributes to the publisher of the Maoist periodical Peoples March who died at SSKM Hospital today, the Jadavpur MP said: The death of Swapan (Dasgupta) has again brought to light that the UAPA, under which he was arrested, grossly violates human rights. I believe he was wrongfully arrested.         
	The singer-MP made it clear he did not support the central law. Just because the government has power and the law-enforcing agencies are at its disposal, it cannot brand anyone a traitor or anti-national and put him behind bars under the UAPA.         
	Dasgupta had been arrested from Calcutta on the night of October 6. He was hospitalised in December with cancer.        
	Sumans observations about the UAPA left Mamata red-faced as her party is part of the government that took the decision to enforce the law to fight Maoists.        
	Asked if he had violated the party line, she flared up and said: I shall take a decision about him and not you. Kabir Suman is our party man and this is our internal matter.        
	Ironically, the outburst should please Suman. Every time he had embarrassed her in the past, Mamata described him as a guest in the party.         
	Asked about the change, a Trinamul general secretary said: She wants to give him more time to mend his ways.         
	Only last month, Suman had declared on live television that had he attended a news conference with his party leader a few days before, he would have had no option but to stand up and oppose her view on the deployment of army in the offensive against the Maoists.         
	The defiance had stunned some in Trinamul, who urged the brass to crack the whip.         
	In a CD Suman has circulated, he has sung paeans to Chhatradhar Mahato, the arrested Lalgarh spearhead from whom the Trinamul chief has been trying to distance herself. He had also publicly said there was no democracy in the party and accused some leaders of trying to scuttle his constituency development plans.

	Bankura/Purulia, Oct. 30: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee today found a common arrow to pierce each other before the Assembly polls next year: Maoists.        
	At a rally in Maoist hotbed Bankura, the chief minister accused the Trinamul Congress chief of colluding with the rebels. An hour later, at a public meeting in another rebel zone, Purulia, Mamata accused the CPM of killing people in the garb of Maoists.        
	The two rebel-hit districts together have 21 Assembly seats. The CPM currently holds 20 of them.        
	At the CPM rally in Bankuras Satighat around 3pm, Bhattacharjee said: Earlier, the Trinamul Congress used to carry communal forces on its back. Now, the party is carrying the Maoists. The Opposition had no toehold in the Jungle Mahal areas of Bankura and Purulia. But now, Trinamul is trying to make inroads here by using the rebels.        
	The chief minister said the Maoists had wrought more havoc in Bankura than Purulia. The rebels have killed 14 people in Bankura so far this year and torched panchayat and party offices, he said.         
	Be cautious about the Trinamul-Maoist nexus. They are out to destroy everything as their only intention is to see the lady (Mamata) as chief minister, Bhattacharjee said at the rally.        
	The killings had temporarily made the people of Bankura nervous and panicky. But things are changing now. People are gradually making a turnaround. We have been able to combat the Maoist menace to a significant extent, the chief minister said.        
	An hour later and around 90km away, Mamata took potshots at the CPM at a Trinamul rally in Purulia.         
	Ekhane na achhe sech, na achhe shilpo, shudhu achhe Maobadider galpo (There is neither irrigation nor industry here. There is only talk of the Maoists), the Trinamul chief said.        
	She accused the CPM of not giving anything to the people of Purulia in the 34 years that they have been in power.         
	No BPL cards, no ration cards, no employment. The only things they managed to give to the district are Maoists. CPM goons are killing people and putting the blame on Maoists, Mamata said.        
	She had an answer to the CPMs Trinamul-Maoist nexus allegation too. In all the rebel-hit districts, the CPM is electorally strong. In Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore, most of the elected representatives are of the CPM. The MPs, MLAs and the zilla parishads belong to the CPM. But their party is making allegations (of a nexus) against us, she said.        
	Mamata is scheduled to address a party meeting in Bankura tomorrow, at a venue not far from the place where the CPM rally was held today. Tomorrows meeting will be a challenge to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Trinamul junior minister Mukul Roy said.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Left eyes migrant labourers before polls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 19: The poll-scarred Left Front has launched a nation-wide drive to ensure that migrant labourers from Bengal, whom it considers traditional Left voters, return to the state to vote in next years Assembly elections.         
	The front is highlighting the state governments achievements in land reforms, industrialisation and minority education to woo the migrant labourers, the majority of whom are Muslims, said CPM leader Hannan Mollah.         
	Mollah and the CPMs Anarul Haque, the minister of state for health, today addressed a meeting of migrant labourers in Delhis Govindpuri.         
	Mollah said that in the past few elections, most migrant labourers have shown reluctance to come back to the state to cast their votes. He said the fronts initiative was to change this mindset.         
	At todays meeting, Mollah said, over 500 migrant labourers, who mostly hail from North Dinajpurs Islampur, were greatly impressed when they were told about the states success in land reforms.        
	He did not explain why the labourers had to leave home in search of work if the Bengal government had indeed done so much for them.         
	Mollah said Muslim migrant labourers from Murshidabad, Malda and North Dinajpur had developed a notion that the Left Front government had done nothing for them.         
	He said the front wanted to highlight, among other things, the recent move to reserve 10 per cent government jobs for poor and backward Muslims.        
	The CPM leader said similar programmes would be organised in Mumbai, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and some other states.

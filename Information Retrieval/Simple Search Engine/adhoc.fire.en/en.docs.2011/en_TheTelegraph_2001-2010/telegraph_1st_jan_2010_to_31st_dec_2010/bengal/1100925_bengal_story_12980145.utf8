The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Andal heat on govt
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Andal heat on govt
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Sept. 24: Over 300 farmers whose plots have been acquired for the Airport City project in Burdwans Andal today held a rally there demanding more compensation and jobs.        
	The farmers, owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress and the SUCI, demanded 50 per cent of the land value for sharecroppers against the 25 per cent offered by the government. They also demanded that affected farm labourers be given five years wages. The government has offered 250 days wages.        
	The farmers asked for a job for one member of every family that has given land for the project, in line with Mamata Banerjees job offer to families that have given land for railway projects.         
	The rally was attended by farmers from Andal, Bhadur and Dhupchururia. The administration is yet to hand over the 400 acres of land acquired in these three mouzas to the promoter, Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Limited (BAPL). Local Trinamul leaders and the SUCI MP from Joynagar, Tarun Mandal, addressed the rally.         
	The farmers said the BAPL had not invited the land losers to the bhumi puja on September 17, the day the company began work on the 1,800 acres it has received for the project so far.         
	Ashoke Ganguly, whose six-acre plot in Andal has been acquired, said: Eastern Coalfields and the railways had earlier acquired land in Andal but they had given more compensation and also offered jobs. I want the government to pay me Rs 21 lakh for each acre.        
	Mandal, the MP, said the BAPL should have acquired the land directly from the farmers. He criticised the government for acting like a land broker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Front in corruption drive
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Front in corruption drive
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 29: The Left Front today announced a state-wide campaign from December 5 against corruption at the Centre and at the Trinamul-run zilla parishads.        
	Front chairman Biman Bose said today: Rampant corruption is the order of the day in Delhi. The Commonwealth Games scam has been a matter of shame for our country while the 2G spectrum scandal has caused colossal revenue loss.        
	Bose said the front would highlight these issues through small meetings, rallies and processions from December 5 to 19.        
	He said the front would expose the Congress-headed governments corruption. He added: Trinamul is similarly guilty of corruption in running the zilla parishads in East Midnapore and South 24-Parganas. The front chairman claimed the Union rural development ministry had written to its state counterpart, saying they would not send funds to the two zilla parishads as they had not received utilisation certificates (UCs).        
	Bose said the zilla parishads of the two districts had not submitted the UCs for funds disbursed earlier.         
	He alleged the Trinamul-run zilla parishads are steeped in corruption and are doing little or no work.

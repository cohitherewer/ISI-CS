The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Force misuse grouse to PM
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Force misuse grouse to PM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 25: Mamata Banerjee today said she would personally hand over to the Prime Minister a full-fledged document on how the CPM was misusing the joint forces in Maoist-hit Jungle Mahal.        
	A Trinamul Congress leader today quoted Mamata as telling her aides at a meeting: We will stick to our demand for the withdrawal of the joint forces from West Midnapore as the ruling CPM is grossly misusing them for its own interest.         
	Manmohan Singh had told a National Development Council (NDC) meeting yesterday that the Centre and states would continue to meet the Maoist challenge together, days after Mamata said she would request the Prime Minister to withdraw the central forces from Lalgarh.        
	Trinamuls renewed clamour on the CPMs misuse of the joint forces betrays the fact that Singhs advice has dampened the partys spirit.         
	We are aware of what the Prime Minister said at the NDC meet. We are preparing a report on the situation in Jungle Mahal to justify Mamatas demand, Sisir Adhikari, the Trinamul junior minister for rural development, told The Telegraph over the phone from Delhi this afternoon        
	We will give examples of how the CPM has set up camps of its armed cadres in West Midnapore with the help of the joint forces. We will also inform the Prime Minister how CPM cadres, posing as Maoists, are terrorising our supporters and innocent villagers in Jungle Mahal.        
	Adhikari, who oversees the partys organisational network in the two Midnapores, alleged that the CPM was running 41 camps in Salboni, Goaltore, Jhargram and Binpur. The CPM has not only stockpiled arms in these camps but is also providing arms training to its cadres with the help of the joint forces, he added.        
	Adhikari said the document was being prepared under the supervision of Mamata. She would hand over the report to the Prime Minister when she comes to Delhi to attend the monsoon session of Parliament tomorrow, he said.        
	Adhikari said that though his party agreed with the Prime Ministers suggestion that the states and the Centre should jointly fight the Maoists, we would request him to treat Bengal differently, given the ground realities here.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Guerrillas torch bus
                            
	Purulia, June 20: Maoists tonight stopped a bus going to Sarenga in Bankura from Asansol town, asked its passengers to get down and torched it.        
	The passengers walked 8km to Sarenga from the fo- rested area, about 280km from Calcutta, where the bus was stopped around 8pm.         
	A passenger said the rebels were protesting the recent arrest of Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities members in connection with the derailment of the Jnaneswari Express.        
	We were passing through a sal forest in Tantidanga when the bus suddenly stopped because of a blockade with tree trunks. Then a group of people, some with rifles, boarded the bus and told us to get off. They sprayed fuel on the bus and set it on fire, another passenger said.

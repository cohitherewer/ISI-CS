                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Air hostess kills herself
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 6: An air hostess of Kingfisher Airlines was found dead today in her rented apartment in Baguiati.        
	Police said Priyanka Tiwari, 23, had hanged herself with her yellow dupatta from the ceiling of her third-floor flat in the Panchabati housing complex at Kaikhali.        
	Kingfisher officials refused comment. We are sad to hear about the suicide but we wont make any comment as it has nothing to do with the airline, an official said.        
	Priyanka, who was from Gangtok, shared the apartment with two of her colleagues. One of them, Prakrati Chanda, alerted neighbours this morning.        
	Prakrati called the security staff of the flat and other residents when Priyanka did not open the door of her bedroom in the morning, a neighbour said.        
	Priyanka and Prakrati were in their flat last night. The third colleague was on duty.        
	Rahul Srivastav, the North 24-Parganas police chief, said: The post-mortem report is yet to reach us.        
	A police officer said Priyankas father, K. Tiwari, had been informed. Tiwari is a deputy director in the Sikkim government.        
	The woman did not leave any suicide note. So we have to investigate all the angles. She may have been suffering from depression, the officer said.        
	Residents of Yamunotri apartments, where Priyanka lived, said the owner of the three-bedroom flat, measuring about 1,000sqft, was Pratap Ganguly. He had rented it out to Priyanka and her colleagues a year ago.        
	A resident said another person had committed suicide in the housing complex last year.

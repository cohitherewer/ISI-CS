	Santiniketan, Sept. 14: Rahul Gandhi today deftly sidestepped a question on his vision as a future Prime Minister, saying one need not be a Prime Minister to ameliorate peoples problems.        
	The question was posed at a closed-door interactive session the Congress general secretary had with students of Visva-Bharati. Students from Class IX  the varsity also has a school within the campus  to the doctoral level participated in the session.         
	The student wanted to know how Rahul would solve the problems of the people when he became Prime Minister and what his vision would be if he took the top political post.        
	Rahul promptly replied: Do you think a Prime Minister alone can take the responsibility of eliminating all problems? Others can, too.        
	Nilanjan Banerjee, the special officer of Rabindra Bhavan who was present at the session, told The Telegraph later that Rahul was very good.         
	Rahul Gandhi handled the question with maturity and did not get into the issue of him becoming the Prime Minister. He handled (other) questions very deftly.        
	According to those who attended the event, Rahul was equally at ease with questions on corruption. One such query was: If you were Prime Minister, how would you have removed corruption?                  Rahul Gandhi in Santiniketan on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta      
	The participants said Rahul had told them that there was no point only complaining. He said we should all work towards removing corruption from all walks of life. He said we would face resistance while doing so but it was nevertheless our duty to come forward to do so, one participant said.        
	Bannerjee said Rahul showed a lot of poise, handling even the uncomfortable posers with ease. It was clear there were occasions when he did not like the questions hurled at him, but he nevertheless went ahead and answered them tactfully.        
	But Rahul didnt only take questions, he posed some too. He asked the students, for instance, what in their opinion constituted wisdom, knowledge, information and education, and the co-relation between them. That led to a lively discussion with students offering divergent views. Rahul appeared pleased, Banerjee said.         
	Later, Rahul inaugurated Three Chancellors, a collection of articles and paintings associated with the three former chancellors of the university  Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. The exhibition contained rare photographs and the letters the three former Prime Ministers had written about Santiniketan.        
	According to university officials, Rahul appeared overwhelmed to see the photos of his greatgrandfather, grandmother and father  pausing before a picture of Rajiv before moving to the others. Before leaving, he wrote in the visitors book: It is an honour for me to come to Santiniketan. Am very proud to see that the spirit of our founding father lives on here.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Sonali at Behrampore General Hospital on Thursday. Telegraph picture                                         
	Behrampore, Sept. 9: Two schoolgirls were injured, one seriously, in their sleep when Congress supporters allegedly hurled bombs at their house during a clash with CPM activists that also claimed a life in Murshidabad last night.         
	Doctors said the condition of Sonali Khatoon, 12, a resident of Teghori village, was serious. Part of her abdomen had to be stitched up because her entrails had come out through her splinter wound. Her younger sister, Rupali, 10, suffered splinter injuries in her hands and legs.         
	The girls were with their grandfather, Zaher Ali, 60, on the veranda of their house when the bombs were hurled. Ali, a CPM supporter, suffered splinter injuries.        
	Their neighbour, Yakin Sheikh, also a CPM supporter, died of injuries he sustained in another bomb attack on his house. A Congress activist and a CPM supporter were injured in the clash.         
	Sonali, Rupali and the other injured persons were taken to the block hospital at Beldanga from where they were referred to Behrampore General Hospital early this morning.        
	Ananda Mondal, the superintendent of the Behrampore hospital, said: Her (Sonalis) entrails had come out through the wound in the abdomen. We had to stitch it up. She is still not out of danger. We have kept her under observation.        
	The girls father, Kadar Sheikh, said his daughter and their grandfather were sleeping on the ground-floor veranda of their house while he and his wife were sleeping inside.         
	Close to midnight, Congress supporters attacked our house. They hurled several bombs and the splinters hit my daughters and father, said Kadar, a farmer owing allegiance to the CPM.        
	Kadar said he could not come out of the house immediately because the attackers were hurling bombs. Half an hour later, I managed to take my father and daughters inside, he added.        
	Police arrived around 2am and took the injured to hospital. The clashes stopped soon after but started again after some of the cops left with the injured people.         
	After a blood-soaked Sonali was attended to at the hospital and her wound stitched up, her father dressed her up in her school uniform, the only good clothes she had.        
	A police officer said tension had been brewing in Teghori since the treasurer of the local Congress, Haider Mullick, joined the CPM last week.        
	The Congress workers have alleged that Haider had stolen Rs 1 lakh from the partys coffers before joining the CPM. Haider, who has the backing of the CPM, has refused to return the money, a police officer said.        
	District superintendent of police B.L. Meena said five persons had been arrested in connection with the clash.        
	We have deployed Rapid Action Force personnel at the village, Meena said.

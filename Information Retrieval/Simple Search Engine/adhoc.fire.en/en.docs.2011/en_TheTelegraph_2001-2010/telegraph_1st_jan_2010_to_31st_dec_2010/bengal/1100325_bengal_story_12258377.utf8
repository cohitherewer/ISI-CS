The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Biman tonic for inactive cadres 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Biman tonic for inactive cadres 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 24: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today urged party cadres to pull up their socks ahead of the civic polls in May which he said were a prelude to the Assembly elections next year.        
	Addressing the CPMs city unit leaders and cadres at Nazrul Manch this evening, Bose said: The impact of the civic polls in Calcutta will not be confined to the city. It is likely to be widespread, both at the state and national levels. The results of the polls will make it clear whether Calcutta will continue to be a bastion of the Left movement or be turned over to the forces of anarchy, Bose said.         
	The Left Front runs 54 of the 81 municipalities across 17 districts which will go to the polls in May.         
	Bose dubbed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) election exceptional because unlike the districts, all the 17 Assembly seats in the city would be covered in the civic polls.         
	Bose tried to boost the morale of the party rank and file and chided those who had allegedly become despondent.         
	I know the Lok Sabha results have frustrated a section of our comrades. They have become inactive and dispirited. But there are differences between the parliamentary and the civic polls. If our comrades refuse to come out of this feeling of despondency, it will be a disaster for the communists, both in Bengal and beyond, Bose said.         
	He claimed that the Left Front need not worry that much about retaining the CMC in view of the development work done during the partys regime.         
	We cant sit idle considering that defeat is inevitable. It is a life and death struggle for us. Those who are still indecisive cannot continue as party members, Bose said.        
	To win back the citys voters, Bose urged his party workers to focus on the Lefts pro-poor and pro-people credentials and harped on the UPA governments anti-poor policies. Bose said the CPMs poll campaign would focus on the central budget and its failure to offer any guidelines and political will to arrest the price rise, the dismal state of the public distribution system and the increasing unemployment rate.        
	He asked the party workers to highlight the pro-poor projects proposed in the state budget. The state government wants to introduce the West Bengal Urban Employment Scheme to provide jobs to the unemployed in towns under the municipalities at a daily wage of Rs 100, emulating the success of the Centres NREGA for the rural poor.

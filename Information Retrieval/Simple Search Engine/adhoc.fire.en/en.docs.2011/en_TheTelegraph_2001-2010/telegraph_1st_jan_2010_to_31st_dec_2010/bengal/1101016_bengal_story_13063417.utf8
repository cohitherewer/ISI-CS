	Calcutta, Oct. 15: Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee yesterday met the governor at Raj Bhavan and requested him to ensure peace in Sashan, hours after a party activist was killed in the North 24-Parganas block in a clash with the CPM.         
	A Raj Bhavan source said the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly met M.K. Narayanan around 1.30pm yesterday.         
	Chatterjee said he had sought Narayanans intervention in ensuring peace in Sashan and South 24-Parganas Canning, places where political clashes had become regular events.         
	Peace, not unrest, is the need of the hour, Chatterjee said.        
	Trinamul sources said party chief Mamata Banerjee today condemned the clash, which took place less than 48 hours after the governor made a Puja-eve appeal for peace.         
	The CPM is not even responding to the governors appeal. The party, which has lost the peoples mandate, is out to create trouble even during the festive season, she was quoted as saying at a meeting with her aides at her Kalighat home.        
	The sources said she had asked her aides to launch a sustained movement in Sashan soon after Puja, demanding peace and rule of law in the area.         
	We will gherao the offices of the district magistrate and the police chief. We will also demonstrate in front of all government offices in North 24-Parganas, said Jyotipriya Mullick, the Trinamul MLA from Gaighata who oversees the party affairs in Sashan.        
	The additional superintendent of police, S.M.H. Mirza, said one Mohammed Nizauddin was today arrested with arms in connection with yesterdays clash.

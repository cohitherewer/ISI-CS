The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Traffic horror across Calcutta
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Traffic horror across Calcutta
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Students stop a car at Hazra. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 30: A procession to honour a Dalit icon, a roadblock sparked by college politics and Calcuttas love for fairs on winter weekends created a traffic nightmare across the city today.        
	The snarls, endless as they seemed, continued well into the evening long after Sant Ravidass followers and the student troublemakers had turned homeward.         
	Escorted by police and accompanied by tens of vehicles, hundreds of Ravidass followers, carrying banners and placards, began their march from near Bondel Road at 1.30pm. While the young walked, the seniors sat on be-decked trucks, matador vans and cars. Bands played popular tunes.         
	The procession traversed a long distance, covering par-ts of Rifle Range Road, Darga Road, Moulali crossing, Lenin Sarani, BB Ganguly Street, Bentinck Street, Chowringhee Road and Park Street. Since there were many vehicles and a large crowd, it took a long time to cover each intersection, forcing traffic stoppage, said a senior officer of the Headquarters traffic guard.        
	As the police struggled to find alternative routes for tra-ffic diversion, the students of Shyamaprasad College (Asutoshs night wing) blocked Hazra crossing at 4.50pm.        
	Supporters of the CPMs student wing, SFI, squatted on the road till 7.30pm alleging irregularities in the college elections and a police baton-charge on their mates.        
	Once Hazra was paralysed, traffic across south-central Calcutta collapsed.         
	After the SFI students had withdrawn their blockade, a Trinamul Congress group held up traffic outside Bhowanipore police station. It was finally lifted around 8pm, said an officer of the Bhowanipore traffic guard.         
	If some people tried to skirt south and central Calcutta by sticking to the EM Bypass in the east, the surge of Book fair crowd at Milon Mela ensured the plan did not work.         
	The Park Circus Connector was chock-a-block, too.        
	The lights fiasco at the fair ground did not help matters outside. Thousands suddenly left the venue and chaos reigned. It was terrible. At every intersection from Sealdah to Gariahat we had to wait for at least 15 minutes, said Tanmoy Guha, who lives in Gariahat Road.        
	At Shyamaprasad, the polls had to be put off. I was forced to call the police as things were going out of control, said teacher-in-charge Purnendu Basak.         
	Over 50 students were detained. We had to use the baton to bring the situation under control, a police officer said.

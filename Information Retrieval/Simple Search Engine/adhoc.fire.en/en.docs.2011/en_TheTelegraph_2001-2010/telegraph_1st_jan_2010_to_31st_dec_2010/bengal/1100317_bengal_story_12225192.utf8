The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata here? Minister scoots 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata here? Minister scoots 
          BARUN GHOSH                          Anil Sarkar                                  
	Calcutta, March 16: A CPM minister from Tripura reportedly scooted from the All India Matua Mahasabhas office on Sunday after hearing of Mamata Banerjees imminent arrival.        
	On Sunday, the Trinamul Congress leader was made chief patron of the Mahasabha, which has 1.2 crore voters across Bengal and was earlier wooed by the Left Front.         
	Tripura higher educa- tion minister Anil Sarkar, who is also a state CPM secretariat member, was in Thakurnagar on Sunday with the Mahasabha chief since 10.30am.         
	Around 4.30pm, he probably spotted Gaighata Trinamul legislator Jyotipriya Mullick and local MP Gobinda Naskar on the premises of the Mahasabha in Thakurnagar, North 24-Parganas.         
	The duo had gone to Thakurnagar before Mamatas arrival to see if arrangements for the reception of the railway minister were on. Mamata took a special train from Sealdah and rea- ched Thakurnagar around 7.30pm.         
	We had gone to Thakurnagar around 4.30pm to see to preparations for Mamatadis reception. But once Anilbabu saw us, he hurriedly got into his car and left without talking to us. He almost fled, Mullick said today.        
	Sarkar, when contacted over the phone tonight, denied having cut short his stay in Thakurnagar.         
	I was with Baroma (the chief of the Mahasabha) all through the day since 10.30am. I had met Baroma to seek her blessings and spent over an hour at the Harichand-Guruchand temple where I offered my pranam, he added.        
	Sarkar claimed that he had no knowledge about Mamatas visit. I did not know about Mamatas visit and left Thakurnagar on my own.         
	But a Mahasabha member, who was with Sarkar, said: Tripuras Marxist minister looked disturbed after he heard about Mamatadis visit from us. He wanted to leave Thakurnagar immediately and said he had work in Agartala.        
	Alimuddin Street mandarins were, however, in the dark about Sarkars overtures to the Mahasabha and his visit to Thakurnagar.        
	We are generally opposed to visiting temples and religious places. We have to know why Sarkar had visited the Thakurnagar temple, said CPM central committee member Benoy Konar.         
	Asked about Trinamul Congresss consolidation of its base among the 1.2 crore Matuas across 74 Assembly constituencies in eight districts of Bengal, the Tripura minister admitted that they (Matuas) had of late switched their loyalty to Mamatas Trinamul.         
	Matuas, who once constituted our solid vote bank in Bengal, are fast getting out of our grip due to Trinamuls steady inroads among them. I saw Mamatas picture along with Baroma in the run-up to last years Lok Sabha polls and that cost us dearly, he added.

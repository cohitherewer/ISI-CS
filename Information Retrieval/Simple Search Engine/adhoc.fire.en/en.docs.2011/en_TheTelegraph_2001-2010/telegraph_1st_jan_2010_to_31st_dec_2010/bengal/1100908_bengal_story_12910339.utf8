                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Unions unite for strike, not in Bengal 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Calcutta, Sept. 7: Congress-affiliated Intuc today joined hands with Left trade unions Citu and Aituc to enforce the all-India general strike, marking a first in the history of such shutdowns.        
	Its the broadest unity ever. For the first time in its history, Intuc has participated in a general strike. The response to the strike has been beyond our expectations, Gurudas Dasgupta, the Aituc general secretary and CPI MP, said.        
	The 24-hour strike was called by the Left unions to protest against rising prices, the UPAs divestment policy and job security of contractual workers, among other things.        
	Other Left leaders claimed it was for the first time a strike call had elicited such an unexpected response outside Bengal, Tripura and Kerala. We must acknowledge that the strike got a momentum because of Intuc, Tapan Sen, the Citu general secretary and CPM MP, said.        
	The Bengal Intuc, however, did not support the strike, saying it wanted the shutdown in industrial units only.        
	Dasgupta also appreciated the personal role of Intuc leader and Congress MP Sanjeeva Reddy, who claimed he had withstood a lot of pressure from his party to join the strike.        
	I will meet the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi and apprise them of the strike. We want the Centre to take pro-worker measures, Reddy said. Inspired by the success of the strike, Left leaders have given a call for a march to Parliament next February. If the government does not sort out issues raised by the trade unions, thousands will march to Parliament, Dasgupta said.        
	Others said there would a Parliament gherao during the winter session if the Centre did not concede to the unions demands.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Mamata Banerjee leads the march in Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                
	Calcutta, Oct. 23: Mamata Banerjee today accused the Centre of ignoring her demands for the withdrawal of the joint forces and reminded the Congress-led UPA that her party was the second-largest constituent in the ruling coalition.        
	I have told the Prime Minister 10 times. I told the Union home minister a minimum of 20 times also told Pranab Mukherjee, the governor but nothing is yielding results. The CPM is misusing them (the central forces fighting Maoists) to unleash terror on innocent people in Jungle Mahal. I want to tell my colleagues in the central government that the CPM is misleading them and distorting facts, the Trinamul chief said.        
	Addressing a gathering at Beliaghtas Gandhi Bhavan this evening after a march to press for the exit of central forces from Maoist-hit Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore, Mamata said she had been forced to bring the matter to the peoples court as a last resort after the Centres continuous refusal to listen to her.         
	I have come to the peoples court when the doors have been shut on democracy. I assert once again that the joint forces should be withdrawn. Operations cannot be carried out by torturing innocent people. The Centre should realise that, the railway minister said. She announced a similar padayatra in the city on November 14.        
	Mamatas claim that her demand had gone unheard came with the assertion she was not out to take advantage of Trinamuls numerical strength in Parliament and blackmail the Centre. We wont blackmail the Centre for that. We only want it to listen to what we have to say regarding the presence of armed (CPM) camps in Lalgarh. Otherwise (if the Centre does not pay heed), our agitation will continue, she said.        
	Mamatas decision to take her case to peoples court is aimed at mounting pressure on the Centre and to keep up her anti-CPM stance ahead of the Assembly polls next summer. They (the forces) are being misused by the CPM to kill so-called Maoists so they (the CPM) can recapture the villages. As an important partner of the UPA government, we expected our party to be kept posted on the entry of joint forces but that didnt happen.        
	Mamata asked the Centre, like she has in the past, to send a team to verify her claims on the armed CPM camps. Let the Centre conduct its investigations through its own agency and cross-check our complaints. We will have not problems with that, she said.         
	Banners at the backdrop of the stage from which Mamata addressed todays meeting screamed out: Joutho bahini phire jao, CPM harmads ostro gotao (Go back joint forces, CPM cadres in give up arms). The reiteration of the demand came days after the CRPF boss visited Lalgarh and suggested the troops were here to stay.        
	A Trinamul general secretary later said that Mamata would keep on agitating against the presence of the joint forces to also send a message to party ranks that there would be no let-up in her anti-CPM stance.

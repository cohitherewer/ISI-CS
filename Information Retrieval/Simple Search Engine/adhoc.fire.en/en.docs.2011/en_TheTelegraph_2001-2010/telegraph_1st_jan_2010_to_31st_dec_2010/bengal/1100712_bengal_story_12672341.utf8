The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong rally at Mangalkot
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong rally at Mangalkot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 11: K. Keshava Rao, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, will lead the partys Mangalkot cholo rally on July 15, a year after an alleged CPM attack on a team of visiting Congress MLAs in the Burdwan town.         
	On July 15, I will lead a delegation of party MLAs, MPs, leaders and workers to Mangalkot, where CPM activists had attacked our MLAs on the same day a year ago, Rao told The Telegraph over the phone this afternoon. Rao said Bengal Congress president Manas Bhuniya had requested him to attend the event.         
	On July 15 last year, more than a dozen Congress MLAs were chased across marshy paddy fields by armed attackers in Mangalkot, which has been rocked by political clashes since the Lok Sabha polls. Some Congress MLAs were left nursing injuries after being hit by stones thrown by the attackers.        
	The Mangalkot rally is being seen as an acid test for Bhuniya. The success of the rally would help Manas establish his writ over the organisation. His recent appointment as state Congress chief had caused resentment among some in the party, a senior party leader said.         
	Bhuniya said he wanted everybodys presence at the event. The rally would be the partys first show of strength after the May civic polls.        
	However, Bhuniyas detractors view the Mangalkot rally as an attempt on his part to counter Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjees martyrs rally at Esplanade on July 21 to commemorate the death of 13 Youth Congress activists in police firing in 1993.

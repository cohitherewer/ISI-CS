          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 21: Governor M.K. Nar-ayanan, now on a vacation in Darjeeling, reacted with shock and sorrow at the gruesome murder of Madan Tamang and condemned the politics of violence in the hills.        
	Raj Bhavan sources said Narayanan was so disturbed at the killing that he called up chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and discussed at great length the hill situation. He said firm action should be taken to deal with the killers.        
	Later in the evening, he summoned north Bengal inspector-general of police K.L. Tamta, Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta, superintendent D.P. Singh and special inspector-general D.T. Lepcha.         
	In a statement issued in Darjeeling, Narayanan said: The government is determined to come down heavily on those indulging in violence. This state of affairs will not be allowed to continue.        
	Only three days ago, Narayanan had met Tamang when the ABGL leader visited the Raj Bhavan in Darjeeling as part of the fledgling Democratic Front to discuss the hill situation and complain about the high-handedness of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. Alleged Morcha supporters killed him today.        
	In todays statement, the governor did not mention the Morcha, whose leaders he met on Wednesday and whom he had appealed to see that peace and tranquillity in the hills is not disturbed.        
	In a tone that was sterner, the governor today said: The law-enforcement agencies of the state government have been asked to take all possible steps to restore order at any cost. Violence cannot be allowed to disrupt the life and livelihood of the peace-loving people of the hills.        
	Describing Tamang as a respected leader of Darjeeling, Narayanan said the attack on him could only be described as an attack on the democratic forces.        
	During the meeting with Narayanan on Tuesday, the Front leaders had complained about lack of democracy in the hills and how the Morcha was preventing them from carrying on with their political activities. They had also mentioned Morcha attacks on their offices.

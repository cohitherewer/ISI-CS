The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Fire mars festive mood
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Fire mars festive mood

	Calcutta, Sept. 18: The Puja decorations and banners announcing Sharad Utsav looked inviting. But the shutters remained down at the Pantaloons outlet at 22 Camac Street today.         
	Pre-Puja shoppers may have braved the Saturday morning showers but the fire that broke out at the building played damper to their plans, at least till the afternoon. Westside opened in the afternoon as did Pizza Hut, Ivory and Shisha. But Pantaloons and some other establishments remained shut.         
	Sisters Jinia, 18, and Tania, 21, arrived at the shopping block at 11am. We had planned to go shopping for the Pujas because we had a holiday today but now we are disappointed. We have come all the way from Tangra, now we will have to come another day, Tania said, before being beckoned by their father to hop into a taxi.         
	Rumela Banerjee, who lives in Malaysia, had come with her nephew to buy toys. I come down to this place every time I am in Calcutta. But this time Ill miss it as Im leaving tomorrow, she said.         
	With the Pujas less than a month away, the crowd was just building up at Pantaloons and Westside over the past few days and both stores were looking forward to a busy weekend.         
	The power in the building has still not stabilised. Let us see what happens tomorrow, said Manish Agarwal of Future Group, which owns Pantaloons. Normally, on a Saturday during the festive season, the footfall at the Camac Street Pantaloons is around 8,000. However, you cant plan for such things (the fire).        
	Divisional fire officer Tapan Ghosh said: Our job was just to douse the fire. Now its up to police and the CESC to give the go-ahead for the establishments to reopen.        
	A CESC spokesperson said the company had not disconnected the power lines of the building and the establishments could reopen whenever they wanted to.         
	The police said they had instructed only the first floor of Block B, which houses Bombay Shiv Sagar where the fire broke out, to remain shut.         
	The authorities of Amoda Spa Bar, on the ground floor, said the establishment remained shut today as the staff had gone home after the fire. We will open tomorrow, said Pushpesh Baid, director, Baid Group, the parent company of Amoda.         
	In the evening, the shoppers were back at Westside but with neighbouring Pantaloons still closed and policemen stationed in front of Block B, the mood was sombre.         
	A Pizza Hut employee said power supply was restored at 3.30pm and the restaurant opened at 5pm.         
	S. Talukdar, the CEO of 22 Camac Street Management, said he had given a clearance to all the establishments at 11.29am, but it depended on the individuals to decide when they would open.

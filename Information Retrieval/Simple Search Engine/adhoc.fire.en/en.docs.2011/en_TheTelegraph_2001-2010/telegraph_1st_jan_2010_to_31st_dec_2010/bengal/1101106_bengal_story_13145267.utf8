The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist guile and chink in batter-and-spare plot
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoist guile and chink in batter-and-spare plot

	Nov. 5: A police officer and some colleagues were beaten to pulp yesterday but spared death because Maoist minders wanted to create an impression that the attack was a spontaneous backlash by ordinary people, sources close to the rebels said today.        
	However, police sources said the Maoist-backed villagers wanted to kill the law-enforcers to signpost the first anniversary of the abduction of an officer-in-charge of the same station and were deterred only because the force opened fire.        
	Uttam Debnath, the officer-in-charge of Sankrail police station, was battered with bamboo clubs yesterday. However, the villagers who pounced on him did not use more lethal means, although they had managed to take away his AK-47 rifle.        
	The sources said the Maoists led Debnath to a trap at Chunpara village in West Midnapore and got him beaten up by villagers. The rebels had wanted to project the attack as a spontaneous outpouring of the villagers anger against the police, a source said.        
	At the same time, the attackers were not allowed to shoot Debnath dead as the killing could have triggered a police crackdown on the villagers. Crackdowns cut both ways: the police usually face the brunt of hostility initially but, beyond a point, victims tend to blame those responsible for setting the stage for brutality.        
	A police clampdown can further alienate the villagers, who are already feeling stifled because of the heavy presence of security forces in the region, the sources added.        
	The Maoists, who were obviously behind the attack on the policemen, could easily have shot dead Debnath if they wanted to since the villagers outnumbered the policemen and the security men were trapped, a source said.        
	But they did not because if they had done that, the repercussions on the villagers would have been terrible. The police would have mercilessly struck back at the villagers and this ultimately may have alienated them from the Maoists.        
	Besides, the Maoists do not appear to be too keen on a full-fledged confrontation now in the region. The CPM, helped by the joint forces, has reclaimed many areas that had fallen to the Maoists. Organisationally, the rebels in the area can ill-afford any overdrive by the joint forces now.        
	Other sources said the tactical disadvantage also might have prompted the Maoists to spare Debnaths life.         
	However, West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the Maoists wanted to kill the policeman but had underestimated their strength.        
	The Maoists had planned to have villagers surround the policemen, have them beaten up and have a couple of them killed. Their plan was also to loot the weapons. That is why the OC was singled out and dragged away. But the Maoists did not realise that there would be a big force of 45 policemen. The Maoists backed away when the police opened fire, Verma said.        
	A villager, Uttam Mahato, was killed in the police firing.        
	The SP explained that the police had gone to raid the village with about a dozen policemen on Wednesday afternoon. So, the rebels thought that the same number of policemen would go to the village on Thursday morning. But when they saw so many armed policemen, the Maoists did not come to the forefront. We believe the Maoists retreated because they feared the joint forces would cordon the area off, the officer added.        
	An officer said preliminary investigation revealed that Kalipada Mahato, son of one of the injured villagers, Deben Mahato, a homeguard, had snatched the AK-47 from the OC and later handed it over to a local leader of Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, Bhabesh Mahato, who in turn gave it to the Maoists.        
	Other officers said Maoist action squad leaders, Gautam Rana and Sahebram Murmu, were active in the area and the rebels wanted to do something to observe the anniversary of the abduction of a previous OC, Atindranath Dutta, on October 20 last year.        
	The police have so far arrested 62 villagers, including 19 women, in nightlong raids. The women were released on bail but the rest were remanded in jail custody for two weeks.

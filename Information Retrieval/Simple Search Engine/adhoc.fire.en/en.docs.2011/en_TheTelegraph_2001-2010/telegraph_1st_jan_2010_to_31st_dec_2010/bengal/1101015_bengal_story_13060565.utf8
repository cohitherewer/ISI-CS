                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Killer clash greets MK peace appeal
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 14: A Trinamul supporter died in a clash with CPM activists allegedly trying to mount a Nandigram-style recapture of a restive North 24-Parganas pocket today, less than 48 hours after governor M.K. Narayanans Puja-eve peace appeal.        
	Four persons, two each from both sides, were injured in the clash at Sashan, a known trouble spot on Bengals political map where Trinamul has been making deep inroads since the Lok Sabha elections last year.        
	The area falls under the Basirhat parliamentary constituency, which Trinamul won, but the local panchayat samiti had stayed with the CPM even when the Left suffered stunning reverses in the 2008 rural polls.         
	Eyewitnesses and Trinamul leaders painted the CPM as the aggressor, saying over 70 armed cadres stormed three villages  Sardarhata, Teghari and Khamarnaubad  home to Trinamul supporters this morning, and beat them up in an attempt to drive them away.        
	Villagers said the raiders were sent by CPM leaders from nearby Aminpur Bazar, where the party reopened its office only yesterday after a years closure in the face of alleged Trinamul threats since the Lok Sabha polls last summer.        
	A local Trinamul leader accused the CPM of trying to reclaim the territory Nandigram-style. He said the cadres in Sashan, 40km from Calcutta, had fired at the villagers from improvised revolvers and hurled bombs.        
	But as word about the attack spread, Trinamul workers came out of homes in droves to retaliate, sparking a bombing-and-firing duel that continued for over three hours till 11am. In the clash, Mahananda Sardar, 24, who Trinamul leaders claimed was a party supporter, was killed, felled by bullets in his head and chest.         
	Police arrived several hours after the clash despite the fact that the Aminpur Bazar outpost is only 4km away. Officers said the force was stretched on account of Puja security arrangements.        
	Armed Trinamul supporters attacked our party men when they were returning home from the Aminpur Bazar party office, said Amitava Nandy, former CPM MP and a member of the partys North 24-Parganas district secretariat.        
	But Trinamul leader and the junior Union minister for shipping, Mukul Roy, countered the claim. CPM men attacked our supporters in the villages where we have consolidated our base.

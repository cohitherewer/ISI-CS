  Lalgarh meeting to boost rebel fight          OUR BUREAU                          A jawan stands guard atop the Ramakrishna Vidyalaya as Mamata holds her rally on the Lalgarh schools grounds on August 9                                        
	Calcutta, Dec. 29: The CPM will hold a rally in Lalgarh after a year and a half on Friday as part of its efforts to consolidate its grip on the Maoist hotbed.        
	The public meeting, under the banner of the Santrash Mukti Sabha, will be held on the Ramakrishna Vidyalaya grounds, where Mamata Banerjee had held a rally on August 9.        
	Sushanta Ghosh, the minister of state for paschimanchal development, will address the meeting. West Midnapore CPM secretary Dipak Sarkar will also be present.         
	The CPM had last held a rally in Lalgarh before the Lok Sabha elections in 2009. Fridays rally is important for us as this will be our first foray into Lalgarh after a long time, a member of the CPMs West Midnapore district committee said.         
	Although the Marxists have recaptured Lalgarh and some neighbouring areas from the Maoists over the past four months, they have not yet organised a rally in Lalgarh.        
	The CPM district committee member said that several party activists and supporters had fled their homes in Lalgarh in the face of rebel threats. Many of them have returned. We have managed to reopen our party office.        
	The CPM official added that the party expected a huge turnout at Fridays rally. We will tell the people of Lalgarh not to be cowed down by the rebels terror tactics.        
	He said the party had in the recent past organised rallies in Salboni, Goaltore and Midnapore town in West Midnapore. Villagers came to the rallies in droves defying Maoist threats.        
	Determined to draw a crowd larger than the one at Mamatas rally, the district CPM leadership has started distributing pamphlets urging people to join the meeting.        
	Anuj Pandey, the CPMs Binpur zonal committee secretary, has appealed to the people to join the rally fearlessly and make the zone Maoist-free. Pandey alleges that the Maoists have killed 41 CPM activists and kidnapped 22 others in Lalgarh so far.        
	Intelligence sources, however, said that activists of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities have already begun warning people against attending the rally.        
	We have received information that some PCPA members are secretly threatening villagers against attending the rally, a district intelligence official said. The sources said the CPM might bring in party supporters from outside Lalgarh to the meeting. A CPM insider said party activists and supporters from neighbouring Salboni, Goaltore and Binpur would join the rally.

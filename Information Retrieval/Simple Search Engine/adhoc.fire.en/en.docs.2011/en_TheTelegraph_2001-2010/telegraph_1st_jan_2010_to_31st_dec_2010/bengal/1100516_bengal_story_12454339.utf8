The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ally vs ally: to survive or to expand
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Ally vs ally: to survive or to expand
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                            Mamata Banerjee and Pranab Mukherjee                                 
	Calcutta, May 15: Before they settle for peace, they have a battle on hand and neither side has any choice but to engage in it with all seriousness.        
	For the Congress, it is a question of survival while for Mamata Banerjee, it is the compulsion to expand her turf and reduce her former party to an insignificant player in Bengal as it is in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or Tamil Nadu.        
	That the break-up of the alliance before the civic polls was because of the politics of compulsion on the part of both the Congress and the Trinamul Congress came out clearly in the assertions made at respective election rallies by Bengal PCC chief and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and Mamata.        
	Mukherjee told a party gathering in North 24-Parganas that the alliance with Trinamul should not mean the folding up of the Congress in Bengal. On her part, Mamata said in politics there are no friendly fights, driving hard the message that she was bent on grabbing the anti-Left space at the cost of the state Congress before next years Assembly elections.        
	However, both Trinamul and the Congress may need each other after the municipal elections and also prior to the Assembly polls. Nothing remains static in politics. Things might change after the civic polls, Mukherjee told an election meeting in Bolpur today, referring to the absence of the alliance for the May 30 elections.        
	But the battle between the two parties will be the major point of discussion now with the CPM apprehensive of defeat in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation polls and in many municipalities across the state, political observers believe.        
	The Congress broke away primarily because this was its chance before the 2011 Assembly polls to find out how much strength it had after Trinamuls stunning victory in the Lok Sabha elections, and whether it could cling on to its 14 to 15 per cent vote share without Mamatas party as an ally.        
	The argument being floated by Congress leaders is that Trinamul did well in last years parliamentary polls because of the alliance as a result of which Congress votes went into her kitty.         
	The party also believes that a strong pro-Congress wave across the country played a role in garnering anti-Left votes for alliance partner Trinamul.         
	We are testing the waters despite knowing that our results may not be good without Trinamul as an ally. So, to some extent, it is a question of our survival. We want to see whether the Mamata magic is still there or not. If we succeed, the Congress will be able to flex muscles with Mamata before the 2011 Assembly polls, Congress leader Nirbed Roy said.        
	If Trinamul becomes dependent on us to form the CMC board, we will consider it a victory for us. The same will happen if Trinamul doesnt get outright majority in some municipalities because of anti-Left vote division and hence depends on us. That will rattle Mamata and make her a bit nervous in her future dealings with our party.         
	For Mamata, however, it is the question of assessing how deep an inroad she can make into Congress territories in north Bengal and Murshidabad without the alliance after having consolidated her base in south Bengal.        
	Calcutta was always a prestige issue for her given the extent to which she went to get both the Bowbazar and Sealdah Assembly seats for Trinamul after last years Lok Sabha polls. Her stubborn refusal to concede more than 25 seats to the Congress for the CMC polls stemmed from a desire to convey the message yet again that she would have the last laugh in Calcutta and that the Congress would be reduced to insignificance in the elections here.        
	As for the municipalities going to the polls in Murshidabad, Malda and large parts of north Bengal, Mamatas intention is to spread her reach there, which would have got nipped in the bud had there been an alliance. If that clicks, Didi will be able to reduce the bargaining power of the Congress as and when seat adjustment talks for the Assembly polls begin, said Trinamul MLA Jyotipriya Mallick.         
	In the last Lok Sabha elections, we made our presence felt in south Dinajpur, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar. We scored well in the Siliguri corporation polls too. So, Trinamul has the chance to fight it out in these areas. If we succeed, Mamatas political domain will increase considerably and that will be a cause of worry for the state Congress, Trinamul MLA and leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee said.         
	However, the breakdown of the Congress-Trinamul alliance may help the Left in the civic polls to some extent as even a minor split in the Opposition vote bank can cause upsets in municipal elections.        
	But there is the issue of vote polarisation too. People may not want to waste their votes by supporting candidates who dont have good prospects, said a CPM state committee member.        
	Even if vote division costs Trinamul, the prospects of a post-poll tie-up with the Congress are always there, the CPM leader added.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: An inmate of a Howrah jail today died of injuries suffered during a fight with another prisoner.         
	The fight started after Tapas Gharui, in his thirties, allegedly stepped on Md Rasul Shahs foot when the 28-year-old was going to the toilet after dinner on Thursday night.        
	Policemen at Howrah Correction Centre said Tapas, convicted two months ago for stealing cellphones, suffered injuries in his hands and legs.        
	Tapas was given some preliminary treatment inside the prison but we later shifted him to SSKM hospital after his condition deteriorated, a senior jail official said.         
	Jail and social welfare minister Biswanath Chowdhury has asked the superintendents of the 54 jails in the state to take steps to stop intermittent clashes among prisoners.

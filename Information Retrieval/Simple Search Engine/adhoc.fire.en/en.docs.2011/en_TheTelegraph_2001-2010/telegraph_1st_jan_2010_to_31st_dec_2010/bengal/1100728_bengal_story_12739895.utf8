The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | City schools to branch out in districts
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      City schools to branch out in districts
          MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	Calcutta, July 27: Several reputable Calcutta-based English-medium schools are planning to set up new branches in the districts, with the government encouraging private players to set up unaided institutions in the state.         
	The state government has set up a task force to frame guidelines for approving such institutions. The move is in keeping with a provision in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, which suggests that state governments should encourage private organisations to set up unaided schools.        
	A number of prominent Christian missionary, Anglo-Indian and other private English medium ICSE and CBSE schools have shown interest in undertaking expansion plans.         
	We have been told by school education department officials that the government intends to set up new unaided schools in places where there is a scarcity of good schools. We are ready to open branches of schools run by the Christian missionaries under our Churches if the government promises us the necessary clearance, said Father Faustine Brank of the Roman Catholic Church. He is also the president of the education cell of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, an NGO representing the Christian community.        
	Barry Brien, the MLA nominated from the Anglo-Indian community, urged the heads of associations of Anglo-Indian schools at a recent meeting to immediately respond to the government initiative and set up new branches outside Calcutta.        
	Rajarhat, Ranaghat in Nadia, Baruipur and Sonarpur in South 24-Parganas, Asansol in Burdwan, Jalpaiguri, Siliguri and Malda are some of the places where city schools are planning to open branches.         
	Calcutta Boys, Calcutta Girls, St James, Pratt Memorial, La Martiniere, Rammohan Mission and St Augustine are keen on opening branches in the districts. The Methodist Church, which runs Calcutta Boys, Calcutta Girls, Mount Hermon, Darjeeling, Methodist Church School, Dankuni, has already begun the process of identifying the locations for setting up their branches.         
	We intend to set up a Calcutta Girls branch in Nadias Ranghat and another of Mount Hermon School in Jalpaiguri, said Kamalakshya Sardar, the chairman of the Methodist Church. The Church of North India (CNI) has decided to revive its plan to set up branches of La Martiniere, St James and Pratt Memorial on the city outskirts.         
	The CNI had identified plots on the northern and southern fringes of the city. But it had temporarily shelved the project after the Singur agitation. Preparations for reviving the scheme have started after the government announcement, said Terence Ireland, St James School principal.

	Calcutta, Oct. 30: Yesterdays blaze at Presidency that burnt down two chemistry laboratories has revealed the institutions lack of fire-fighting preparedness  one of a slew of infrastructure deficiencies at the newly anointed university.        
	Yesterdays tragedy could have been averted had the authorities appointed staff trained in disaster management to maintain round-the-clock vigil at places on the campus that are vulnerable to fire, a professor said.        
	Will the institution be able to ensure proper fire-fighting measures in the future? There is no guarantee that this kind of an accident will not happen again. The authorities need to find a solution to this problem first.        
	Among the other places vulnerable to fire are the institutions main library, another professor said.        
	The library, which has over 3.5 lakh books and journals, is located near the students canteen. The library can be destroyed even by a small fire in the canteen, a third-year student said.        
	Principal Amitava Chatterjee had admitted yesterday that the institution lacked the infrastructure to tackle a big fire.        
	Sanjib Ghosh, a former Presidency principal, said the post of caretaker had been vacant for the past 10 years. The authorities need to appoint a caretaker immediately to ensure security, he said.        
	University sources mentioned a host of other problems afflicting Presidency, such as the space shortage that has hamstrung plans to expand its academic departments. More classrooms are needed for the new courses the university is planning, they said.        
	The other challenges include setting up a new library for postgraduate students and research scholars, recruiting teaching and non-teaching staff, and generating more funds.        
	A new library is a crucial requirement since the university plans to introduce more postgraduate and MPhil courses, a source said. We need a separate building to run a new library, a chemistry professor said.        
	Presidency now has four buildings, of which two  the main administrative building and the Baker Building  have been declared heritage structures. This means, a professor said, additions or alterations cannot be made to these two buildings to solve the space crunch.        
	Nor can new structures be built on the campus playground because that will violate environment norms, the professor added.        
	A higher education department official said the state government would provide all possible support to Presidency to help it flourish as a university.        
	Asked whether Presidency had the infrastructure to battle fires, higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri refused comment.

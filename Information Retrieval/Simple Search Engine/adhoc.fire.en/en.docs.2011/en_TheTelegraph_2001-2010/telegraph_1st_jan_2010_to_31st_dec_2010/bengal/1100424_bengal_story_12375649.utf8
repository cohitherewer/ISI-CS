	Malda, April 23: An alert driver applied emergency bra- kes and ensured the car skidded into a ditch when suspected KLO militants were trying to flee to Assam with an abducted Malda tractor dealers son.        
	Villagers alerted by the crash pulled out Rabin Agarwal, 35, his driver Paban Rajak and the kidnappers. Four of the militants managed to flee, but Gopal Barman, who was said to have been trained in Bangladesh, was caught and handed over to police.         
	The militants had demanded Rs 1 crore from Rabins father, said additional sup- erintendent of police Kalyan Banerjee. The kidnappers had lured Rabin to a deserted part of Gajole, about 35km from where the car fell, with the promise of a tractor deal.

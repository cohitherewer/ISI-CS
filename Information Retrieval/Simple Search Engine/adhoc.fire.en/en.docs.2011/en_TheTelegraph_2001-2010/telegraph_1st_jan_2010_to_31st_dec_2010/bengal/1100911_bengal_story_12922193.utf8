          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Sept. 10: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today browbeat the Darjeeling administration into indefinitely deferring a panchayat exam.        
	The exam for the promotion of panchayat department employees had been scheduled for tomorrow.         
	Morcha assistant secretary Binay Tamang said earlier in the day that the panchayat exams should be postponed till the interim set-up for the Darjeeling hills was finalised.         
	We have told the members of the Janmukti Karmachari Sangathan (an employees union affiliated to the Morcha) not to take the examinations, Tamang said.        
	District magistrate Surendra Gupta said in the evening: Certain objections have been raised by them (the Morcha). So the exams have been deferred. Another date will be announced later.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM to seek debacle report
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM to seek debacle report
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 10: The CPM state secretariat today decided to ask party units in North 24-Parganas, Hooghly and Burdwan to list the reasons for the partys poor show in the civic polls there.        
	The CPM leadership is in the process of collecting reports from all the districts where the May 30 elections were held. The Left has won just six of the 34 municipalities in the three districts, considered Left strongholds.         
	These districts are of special concern for us as our party couldnt retain 17 municipalities in North 24-Parganas, eight in Hooghly and three in Burdwan. That is alarming for us. That is why we need to give special focus on these districts, a CPM state secretariat member said.         
	Today, we had a preliminary discussion on the results in these districts. The party units there are being asked to submit detailed reports on why our results have been far below expectations, the secretariat member added.        
	Party sources said the units were expected to file their reports by June 21-22.         
	After going through the reports, the CPM leadership will submit them to the partys state committee, which will meet on June 26 to analyse the causes of the debacle. After todays meeting, CPM state secretariat member Goutam Deb said: We made a preliminary analysis of the results. There have been major reverses in two to three districts.         
	Deb said the Trinamul Congresss vote share had decreased by 5 per cent in the Barrackpore industrial belt, compared with what it had got in last years Lok Sabha polls.        
	In North 24-Parganas, the CPM bagged only Halisahar, Kamarhati and North Dum Dum municipalities out of the 21 that went to the polls. In Burdwan, the party lost four of the six municipalities. In Hooghly, the CPM retained the lone Arambagh civic board out of a dozen municipalities.         
	The civic poll results in the three districts are the worst this time, Benoy Konar, a CPM state secretariat member, said. Asked if he suspected a sabotage, Konar said: The defeat of our party nominees in the three districts cannot simply be attributed to the peoples desire for change. We have to examine all angles behind our defeat.         
	33-year bash        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose today said the Left Front would organise a programme at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on June 21 to observe the 33rd anniversary of the state government.

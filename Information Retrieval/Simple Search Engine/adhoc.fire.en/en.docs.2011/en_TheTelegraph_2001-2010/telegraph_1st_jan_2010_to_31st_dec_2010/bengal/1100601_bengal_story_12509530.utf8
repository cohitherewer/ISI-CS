CID on the job: Writers          OUR BUREAU                          Some of the passengers of the first Mumbai-bound Jnaneswari to pass through Rajabandh since Friday stand at the door of a coach on Monday morning for a glimpse of the disaster site. The night train has been rescheduled because of the Maoist threat. It left Howrah at 4.30am on Monday instead of 10.55 on Sunday night. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	May 31: The Bengal govern-ment has turned down a proposal for a CBI inquiry, mooted by Mamata Banerjee and suggested by P. Chidambaram, into the derailment of the Jnaneswari Express.        
	The move is apparently prompted by the CPMs apprehensions that the possibility of a delay in a CBI probe might stand in the way of cornering Mamata over alleged Maoist links and making the train tragedy an emotional plank in the run-up to the Assembly polls.        
	The government cited the progress in an inquiry by the state CID to reject the offer, made in a letter to chief secretary Ardhendu Sen yesterday.        
	The move came on a day the Union home minister said the needle of suspicion points to Maoists or frontal organisations but the identity of the culprit can be established only in the investigation.         
	Home ministry sources said it had asked the state for assent to a CBI probe following demands for a central inquiry from certain quarters.         
	Railway minister Mamata was among those who had sought the probe, though the state had insisted on a Maoist hand. Hours after the Friday disaster, told the state had ordered a CID investigation, she had blamed political conspiracy for the incident and asked for a probe by the Union home ministry. On Saturday, Mamata said the home ministry had conveyed to her that it had agreed to conduct a CBI probe.         
	However, the CBI cannot start a probe without the states consent.         
	The state government has always been uneasy with CBI probes, rejecting Opposition demands for central inquiry into Rizwanur Rahmans alleged suicide and the March 14, 2007, police firing in Nandigram that left 14 people dead. In both cases, it had been forced to accept the probe following Calcutta High Court orders.        
	Sources in the Union home ministry said Mamata could also approach the court in this case.         
	The ministry will soon inform her about the states refusal to accept a CBI probe and the Centres inability to order one on its own.        
	Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee said: Our leader had wanted a CBI inquiry to ensure that the probe was fair. In a CID inquiry, the CPM government will tamper with evidence and take it on the course Alimuddin Street wants.        
	Chidambarams suspicion and stress on the probe, when asked why the government was being circumspect at the presentation of the ministrys monthly report card, was in the same vein of caution with which he has been speaking in the apparent hope of obtaining an expanded mandate on fighting Maoists. The minister, who had earlier rued a limited mandate, evaded questions on the Trinamul Congresss divergent view.         
	However, the CPM latched on to Chidambarams needle of suspicion while rejecting the CBI probe. In so many words, Chidambaram has vindicated us and the state government by pointing fingers at the Maoists and their frontal organisations. This has exposed the hollowness of the Mamata camps efforts to blame us and exonerate the Maoists, state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said.         
	He blamed Chidambarams coalition compulsions for his agreeing to the demand for the CBI probe. But the way he laid stress on the states concurrence made it clear he didnt feel the need for it. We will again draw the Prime Ministers attention to the railway ministers persistent belittling of Maoist crimes in opposition to his policies on the biggest threat to internal security.        
	Writers took the decision at a meeting chaired by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and attended by finance minister Asim Dasgupta, chief secretary Sen, home secretary Samar Ghosh and senior police officers.         
	Television channels quoted Mamata as saying the chief minister must have had something to hide.         
	The state home secretary said: The CID... probe has progressed well. Thats why, the state government thinks a CBI inquiry is not required.        
	The CID does not usually probe railway accidents but was pressed into action this time as the disaster had a crime angle and sabotage was involved, Ghosh added.        
	Sources in the Union home ministry said the government was mulling a change of strategy on the Maoists. A cabinet note has been sent on the changed strategy, said a senior home ministry official. Chidambaram agreed when asked if the matter would come up at the next meeting of the cabinet committee on security.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Delhi off Somnath list 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Delhi off Somnath list 
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 20: Former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee may have no love lost for CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, whom he has dubbed arrogant in his forthcoming book, but he has no problems keeping in touch with the Bengal comrades of his former party.         
	He has personally invited chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and sports minister Kanti Ganguly for his book release in the capital tomorrow but did not bother to send invites to any of his erstwhile party colleagues in Delhi.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will release Chatterjees controversial book, Keeping the Faith  Memoirs of a Parliamentarian, in the presence of Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.         
	Chatterjee, who was expelled from the party for refusing to step down as Lok Sabha Speaker in July 2008 after the CPM withdrew support from the then UPA government over the Indo-US nuclear deal, took centre stage only last month when some excerpts from his book, targeting Karat, were published.         
	I have invited my former party comrades from Bengal such as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Halim and Kanti Ganguly. While I sent a letter to Buddha, I spoke to Halimsaheb and requested him to attend the programme. He (Halim) told me he would come to Delhi tomorrow for a party meeting and would attend my book release if he could make it. But I did not send invites to any of the Delhi politburo members, Chatterjee said.         
	By Delhi politburo members, he probably meant Karat, his wife Brinda and Sitaram Yechury. The trio had criticised Chatterjee for his harsh comments on the CPM general secretary in his book.        
	The former Speaker, however, was not sure that his erstwhile Bengal comrades would turn up. I have done my bit. But it would be embarrassing for my former party colleagues from Bengal to attend the programme of an expelled member, he said.         
	While the chief minister is expected to visit Nadia tomorrow to oversee the drought situation, Ganguly will be preoccupied with family matters. Somnathda requested me to attend his book release but I will not be able to make it, Ganguly said.         
	Halim said: Somnathda did request me to join him at tomorrows programme but I dont know if I will get time after attending a party programme in Delhi, he said.        
	No party comrade would dare to share the stage with Somnathda after he called the party boss arrogant in his book, a CPM state committee member said.        
	Chatterjee has also sent an invite to Mamata Banerjee.

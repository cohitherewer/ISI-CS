The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tatas cite rights to Nano land
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Tatas cite rights to Nano land
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: The Tatas today told the Supreme Court they were not giving up their rights to the Singur land and made a tentative reference to a larger project during a hearing that witnessed some moments of mirth.        
	The court posted the matter for further hearing in May 2011, by when the results of the Bengal Assembly elections are expected to be declared, saying such things (the Nano case) have a way of working themselves out.        
	The apex court had on March 13, 2008, issued notices to Tata Motors, the Bengal government and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) after farmers and NGOs appealed against the Singur land acquisition. The petitioners challenged a Calcutta High Court ruling, issued on January 18 that year, that upheld the legality of the acquisition.         
	The Tata counsel, Mukul Rohatgi, told the court today: The land had been leased to us. We still have a structure standing there. We have invested crores in the land. We are not giving up our rights. This (the acquired land) was for a smaller project (the Nano). Maybe we can use it for a larger project. Instead of a small car, we may build a larger car.        
	Tata officials were not available for comment after the hearing.        
	Rohatgis statement evoked a strong response from Kalyan Bandyopadhyay, the lawyer representing one of the parties challenging the acquisition of the 1,000 acres for the Nano project and ancillaries. Bandyopadhyay, a Trinamul Congress MP, claimed the Tatas had earlier agreed to return the land if they were paid compensation.         
	But Rohatgi contended that the Tatas had invested over Rs 500 crore in the project. We are still paying for the lease and suffering losses, he said.         
	Bandyopadhyay sought to know what kind of consideration had been paid for the land.        
	The two-judge bench first posted the matter for further hearing in March 2011. However, Bandyopadhyay sought a later date, saying the Assembly elections were due in March-April.        
	I am an MP, he told the bench, headed by Justice R.V. Raveendran.         
	Justice Raveendran and Justice A.K. Patnaik started laughing as soon as Bandyopadhyay made the request.        
	This case may not survive till then, Justice Patnaik said. The bench said Bandyopadhyay could even become a minister when the new government was formed.         
	No one knows how things will turn out, Bandyopadhyay replied. The court then posted the matter for further hearing in May next year.        
	Nandi compensation        
	The state government today sanctioned Rs 1.59 crore towards compensation for the 159 people injured in the police firing in Nandigram on March 14, 2007.

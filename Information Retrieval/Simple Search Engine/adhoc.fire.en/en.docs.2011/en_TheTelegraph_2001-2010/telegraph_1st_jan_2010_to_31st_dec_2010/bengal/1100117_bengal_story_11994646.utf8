                              Arvind Rao                            
	Howrah, Jan. 16: A first-year student went missing after he jumped into the Hooghly from a launch for fun on the way home from a cricket match on the Maidan today.         
	Arvind Rao, 18, who apparently did not know how to swim, took a plunge into the river with three of his friends. He was not with them when they clambered up the banks.

	March 1: A family of five from North 24-Parganas was killed in Orissa on Saturday evening when their autorickshaw collided with a truck.        
	The Jaiswal family from Kanchrapara was going to Puri, about 557km from Calcutta. They were identified as Kapilmuni Jaiswal, 52, his wife Sandhya, 46, their son Kunal, 26, daughter-in-law Mayuri and six-month-old granddaughter, Gudiya. The driver of the autorickshaw, Raghunath Das, was also killed.

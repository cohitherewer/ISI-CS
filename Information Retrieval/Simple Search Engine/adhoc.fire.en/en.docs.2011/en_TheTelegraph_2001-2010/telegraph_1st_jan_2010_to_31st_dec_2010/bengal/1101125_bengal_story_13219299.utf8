The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dutch firm to pull out ship
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Dutch firm to pull out ship
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Tiger Spring at Hooghly Point on Tuesday		    
	Calcutta, Nov. 24: Dutch firm Smit-Llyod BV has been engaged to pull the damaged Tiger Spring from the riverbed at the narrow Hooghly Point stretch and salvage the containers the ship is carrying.         
	The Rotterdam-based company specialises in maritime rescue work.        
	Green Valley, the other ship involved in yesterdays collision, has been taken to Diamond Harbour.        
	Shipping industry experts said the containers aboard Tiger Spring needed to be evacuated before the vessel can be taken to a port. The experts said a crane mounted on a vessel would be needed to empty Tiger Spring but it would be difficult because the strong current at Hooghly Point would make anchoring of such vessels difficult.         
	M.L. Meena, the Calcutta Port Trust chairman, said the owner of Tiger Spring had taken the responsibility of rescuing the ship, which had drifted from its designated course because of a locked steering wheel. But some port officials today did not rule out human error.         
	It is unclear how the two ships came so close. They should not have even tried to pass each other in that narrow stretch, a veteran captain said.        
	Ships are fitted with automatic identifying systems, which can not only locate other ships within a range of 40km to 50km but also show details such as vessel size and destination. Ships are also equipped with high-frequency systems that allow pilots to communicate with each other.        
	It is obvious that both ships knew about their precise locations and should have avoided crossing each other at Hooghly Point, another pilot said.

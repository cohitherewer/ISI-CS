  - Cong leader sees logic in demand for 51 Calcutta wards          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Pranab Mukherjee       
	Calcutta, April 25: Pranab Mukherjee today said he had asked state Congress leaders to continue their dialogue with the Trinamul Congress to end the impasse over their demand for 51 wards in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Bengal Congress chief Mu- kherjees instruction came a day after the partys four Cal- cutta district presidents met him in New Delhi for over two hours from 10.30pm.         
	They (Pradip Ghosh, Nirbed Roy, Santosh Pathak and Pranab Basu) explained to me the logic behind seeking 51 seats from the Trinamul Congress. Having heard them, I asked them to continue the dialo-gue with Trinamul leaders, Mukherjee said over the phone from Delhi.         
	Asked if he felt the demand for 51 seats was logical, Mukherjee parried the question. It doesnt matter whether it is 51 or 50. They have asked for seats that they are confident of winning. So, a further discussion with our alliance partner is necessary, he said.         
	The Calcutta Congress leaders had approached Mukherjee after Trinamul rejected their demand outright and offered only 21 wards. Of them, 13 are now under Left control.        
	The last meeting between the two parties took place on April 9. State Congress working president Pradip Bhatta- charya had spoken to Trinamul secretary-general Partha Chatterjee in the interim and requested him to arrange a meeting immediately to finalise the seat-sharing deal.        
	Time is crucial because the filing of nominations starts tomorrow. I had requested Partha to sit immediately. If the Calcutta tangle is cleared, seat-sharing for the 80 other civic bodies (going to the polls on May 30) would become easier, Bhattacharya said today.        
	Chatterjee said a meeting could be held tomorrow. I am trying to fix the meeting, he said.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata Banerjee would not want to meddle in the seat-sharing talks for Calcutta and had assigned the responsibility to Chatterjee and Union minister of state for shipping Mukul Roy.         
	The Congress leaders from Calcutta today iterated their demand for 51 seats and threatened to contest independently if Trinamul did not relent.         
	Pranabda backed our argument when we explained to him that the party had the potential to win all 51. He agreed that Trinamul should accept the demand because we had won 21 of the 51 seats and emerged second in the remaining 30 though there was no Opposition alliance in 2005. That is why he asked us to continue the dialogue with Trinamul, Pradip Ghosh said on his return to Calcutta.         
	South Calcutta Congress president Nirbed Roy said: We want to be flexible for the sake of the alliance. But Trinamul should not offer us seats in which we shall never win. Of the 21 seats the party has offered, 13 are now with the Left and even Trinamul candidates cant win those.         
	The Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, also spoke of a fair deal. We need the alliance with Mamataji but she shouldnt give us leftover seats in which our candidates have only a remote chance of winning, he said from Hyderabad.

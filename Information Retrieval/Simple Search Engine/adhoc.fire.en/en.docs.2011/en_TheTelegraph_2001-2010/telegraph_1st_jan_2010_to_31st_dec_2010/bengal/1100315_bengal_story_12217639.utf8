The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Explosives on bus seat
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Explosives on bus seat
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, March 14: Nine gelatine sticks with detonators attached and kept in a plastic bag were found in a bus at the crowded Durgapur terminus this morning.        
	Police suspect Maoist involvement. As the gelatine sticks were fitted with the detonators, a blast could have been triggered with the help of a flash gun fitted to a wire. The police said it was also possible the explosives were being smuggled to Bankura for the Maoists. The Bankura border is 2km from the Durgapur bus stand.        
	Around 9am, the bus plying between Barakar and Durgapur reached the terminus, close to the railway station, with about 30 passengers. After the passengers got off, cleaner Bablu Das was inspecting the bus when he found the plastic bag on a seat behind the rear gate.        
	Bablu peeped into the plastic packet and could not make out the contents but panicked after he saw the wires.         
	I did not know what they were but I got scared when I saw the wires coiled inside the bag. I got down from the bus and immediately informed members of the bus workers union, said Bablu.        
	Bablu also said he remembered a middle-aged man in a dhoti and shirt sitting on the seat in front of which the plastic bag was found.        
	Soon, the union members arrived and the packet was taken out of the bus and kept on the road. The police were informed.        
	A team arrived from Coke Oven police station and said the explosives were gelatine sticks. They took the bag away to the police station where it was kept surrounded with sandbags.        
	The police then informed the bomb-disposal squad of the CID in Calcutta. The squad arrived this afternoon and took the explosives to a forested area near the police station and exploded them.        
	The explosives together weighed about a kilogram and would have been powerful enough to blow up a two-storey building, said an officer in the squad.        
	Tapas Pal, the officer in charge of the police station, said: If someone had fitted a wire to the explosives and triggered it with the help of a flash gun then a big explosion would have occurred. The explosives might have been stolen from the various coal mines in the Durgapur-Asansol coal belt for Maoists in Bankura.         
	Sen visits Shilda        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen today visited the Shilda Eastern Frontier Rifles camp where Maoists last month killed 24 jawans.         
	Sen heads the committee that is probing the possibility of intelligence lapses that could have led to the attack. The committee will also find out whether the EFR personnel were alert and prepared at the camp when the attack took place.         
	We have visited the place and we will mention our findings in our report to the government, said Sen.

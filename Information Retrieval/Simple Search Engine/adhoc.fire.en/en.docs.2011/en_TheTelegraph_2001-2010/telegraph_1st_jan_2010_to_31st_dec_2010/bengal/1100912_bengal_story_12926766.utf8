The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Parents fear marks ban 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Parents fear marks ban 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: Over 900 parents whose children study in CBSE schools today expressed fear that the boards decision to abolish marks in favour of grades could handicap their wards in future.        
	At an interactive session with the Central Board of Secondary Education chairman Vineet Joshi at Birla High School in south Calcutta, the parents said their children might lose out to students of other boards.        
	Ones Class X exam marks are still taken into account while screening candidates for many government jobs, one of the parents said at the session.        
	Another guardian said that some of the IIMs too take candidates marks from their Class X exam into consideration during the admission process.        
	The CBSE had organised the meeting as part of a nation-wide drive to collect feedback from guardians on its reforms, introduced last year, including making the Class X exams optional. Under the new system, only grades are awarded to students taking the Class X exam.        
	Other boards such as the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the Council of Indian School Certificate Examinations award both grades and marks to students taking the school-leaving exam.        
	One parent asked Joshi: Since the students passing their exams from the other boards are awarded both marks and grades, can you assure us that our children would not suffer in the future because their mark sheets will show only grades?        
	Under the CBSE reforms, the Class X board exams have been replaced with continuous comprehensive evaluation (CCE). Under CCE, students are rated on their performance through the year in their studies, co-curricular activities and term-end tests.        
	Joshi assured the parents that the board was constantly in touch with all the stakeholders to ensure that the students did not suffer.        
	The school boards, universities and other institutes of higher education have accepted our reforms. I am confident that by the time these students reach the higher education level, the CCE will be an accepted system across the country, Joshi said.        
	The parents said the reforms had increased the pressure on students. They complained that many CBSE schools lacked the expertise to implement the reforms properly.        
	They said the new system of introducing class projects in each subject had burdened the students.        
	The projects are meant to reduce academic load and the students are supposed to do them in groups in classrooms. However, in most schools, the students are asked to do the projects at home. The load of homework has increased, a guardian said.

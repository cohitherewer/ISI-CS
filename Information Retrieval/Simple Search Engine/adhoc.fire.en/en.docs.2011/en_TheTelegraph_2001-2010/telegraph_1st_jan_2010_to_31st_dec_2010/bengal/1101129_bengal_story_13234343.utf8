          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, Nov. 28: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today set a December 20 deadline for the Centre and the state government to finalise the interim authority, failing which it threatened to start an agitation, including a two-day strike.         
	The party warned that the agitation would be for a final solution, alluding to a demand for statehood and not settling for an interim set-up.         
	Addressing a rally in Darjeeling, Morcha president Bimal Gurung said: I want to assure our people that we have not forgotten our ultimate goal. We respect the leaders who are governing the country. This is why we are accepting their proposal for an interim set-up for a period of two years.        
	The Morcha chief said his party would wait till December 20. He said the Morcha had not asked for the interim set-up. It was the governments idea. If they cant implement the set-up by December 20, we will opt for a final solution (statehood).         
	The agitation for the final solution, Gurung said, will start with a 48-hour general strike in the hills from December 21.        
	The Morcha also announced a series of rallies and public meetings from December 5 to keep up the pressure on the Centre and the state government. The party said it would shut down all government offices, except the chambers of the district magistrate and the superintendent of police, from December 6.         
	The rallies from December 5 will be held to demand the inclusion of the tauzi department, which keeps land records, in the interim set-up.        
	Gurung said at the rally that he would try and hold an all-party meeting to convince the rival outfits in the hills about the merits of the interim set-up.

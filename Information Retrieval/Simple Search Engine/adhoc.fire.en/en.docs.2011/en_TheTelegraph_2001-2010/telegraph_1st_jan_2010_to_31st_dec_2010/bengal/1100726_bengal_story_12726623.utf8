  -   Bhuniya TMC infiltrate barb
          OUR BUREAU                            Manas Bhuniya,Mamata Banerjee                                 
	July 25: State Congress president Manas Bhuniya today caught Mamata Banerjee unawares at silly point, accusing ally Trinamul Congress of allowing a steady infiltration of anti-socials into its organisation.         
	The provocation for Bhuniyas outburst was an attack on him by Trinamul activists in West Midnapores Khejuri yesterday.        
	Trinamul Congress-backed anti-socials have let loose a reign of terror in different parts of Khejuri. Going by this, it appears that the leadership has no control over the anti-socials who have infiltrated Trinamul since the party established its clout in Khejuri after ousting the CPM two years ago, Bhuniya told a news conference at the Congress headquarters in Calcutta.        
	Mamata today left a news conference at her Kalighat home in a huff when reporters asked her about Bhuniyas allegations. Dont ask me all these silly questions, she said before storming out.         
	Bhuniya was pushed by Trinamul activists and his car was stoned at Khejuri, where he had held a rally to protest a similar attack on Youth Congress leader Usha Naidu on July 12 near the West Midnapore village.        
	Party supporters today blocked roads and railway tracks in Calcutta and several districts to protest the assault on Bhuniya and other party workers.        
	Terming yesterdays attack barbaric, Bhuniya said he suspected that several CPM anti-socials had switched to Trinamul taking advantage of the changed political scenario.        
	But I must caution the Trinamul leadership against providing shelter to these unwanted elements, he added.        
	Bhuniya also made it clear that the Congress would not bow down to pressure tactics by Trinamul-backed musclemen. Trinamul is hell bent on establishing a one-party rule in Khejuri. But the Congress wont accept this. I will visit Khejuri again and address a public rally there.        
	Asked if the acrimony between the two parties would jeopardise the alliance, the state Congress chief replied in the negative and added that the issue could be resolved through a discussion between the two parties.        
	However, Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi denied the involvement of his party in the attack on Bhuniya.

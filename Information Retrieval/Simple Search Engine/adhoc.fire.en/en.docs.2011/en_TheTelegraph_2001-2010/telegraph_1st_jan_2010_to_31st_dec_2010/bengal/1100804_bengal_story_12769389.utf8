The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party skips Subhas day
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Party skips Subhas day
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: Somnath Chatterjee stayed away as announced, but so did top Bengal CPM leaders from a meeting on Subhas Chakrabortys first death anniversary today.        
	Not a single member of the powerful CPM state secretariat attended. Bengal party boss Biman Bose, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen are members of the body. All of them had been invited.        
	Some CPM ministers  Sudarshan Roy Chowdhury, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, Kanti Ganguly, Ranjit Kundu and Susanta Ghosh  did attend the event, as did Tripura minister Anil Sarkar.        
	The venue, Netaji Indoor Stadium, was less than half full. The sparse gathering seemed ironical given that the late transport minister used to take it upon himself to ensure CPM rallies at the Brigade Parade grounds were packed.        
	Our leaders were preoccupied. Our secretary (Biman) was busy with meetings. Subhasda was an important leader. But we couldnt make it because of prior engagements, a state secretariat member said.        
	Some couldnt help expressing their anguish. Eta niye rajneeti na korlei parto (the leaders shouldnt have politicised the programme). I know loyalists who wanted to come but stayed away because of the Somnath Chatterjee controversy, said Atin Sarkar, a party worker who had come from Ranaghat.        
	Chatterjee was to have presided over the event, organised by the Subhas Chakraborty Foundation. But many in the CPM had balked at the thought of sharing the stage with the expelled party leader after disclosures in his upcoming book that embarrassed Prakash Karat.        
	Sources said Chakrabortys widow Ramala, too, had informed the ex-Lok Sabha Speaker a few days back of the sensitivities involved in sharing the dais with him in the wake of disapproval by some CPM leaders.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Chinsurah, July 27: A Hooghly court today sentenced 11 CPM activists to life imprisonment for killing a Trinamul supporter 10 years ago by beating him up with rods and giving him electric shocks.        
	Susanta Sadhukhan, the pradhan of Nalikul panchayat now and a CPM activist then, his father Madan and younger brother Prasanta along with others had dragged Sukumar Dhok out his house accusing him of stealing poppy (posto) seeds from a grocer in their Malia village on the night of October 16, 2000.         
	No complaint of such theft had been lodged against Sukumar. Nalikul Trinamul chief Samiran Mitra said Sukumar had been singled out as he was working to expand his party in the area at a time the CPM held sway.        
	A police officer said the group took Sukumar, 32, to a local club and beat him up with rods, chains and sticks. Sukumar was beaten up for about half an hour. They even gave him electric shock, the officer said.         
	Seema, his wife, ran out of the house and pleaded with those beating up her husband to spare him.         
	But the doors and windows (of the club) were shut and my cries for help fell on deaf ears, Seema said. A neighbour informed the police about half an hour later. But the attackers escaped before the force arrived.        
	Sukumar was taken to Haripal block health centre from where he was taken to Imambara district hospital in Chinsurah. He was immediately referred to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries on October 19.        
	The sentence was passed by Paban Kumar Mondal, additional district and sessions judge of Hooghly special court in Chinsurah.        
	The police had started a case against 13 CPM supporters.         
	After eluding the police for two months, all surrendered before the Hooghly court. Two of them were, however, released during the trial.        
	CPM district secretariat member Sunil Sarkar admitted that all the 11 persons sentenced were supporters of his party.         
	However, CPM zonal committee secretary Dula Bhowmik said: Three of those sentenced today  Susanta Sadhukhan, Nityananda Das and Aurobinda Das  are branch committee members of the party. The rest are our party supporters. They are our assets and we will appeal in the high court.         
	Recounting that horrific night, Seema said they were sleeping with their three-year-old daughter when they heard someone banging on the door. My husband opened the door. About a dozen CPM supporters entered and dragged him out. They accused him of stealing posto and said he would be tried in the local club.        
	Seemas lawyer Pratim Singha Roy said we waited 10 years but got justice.

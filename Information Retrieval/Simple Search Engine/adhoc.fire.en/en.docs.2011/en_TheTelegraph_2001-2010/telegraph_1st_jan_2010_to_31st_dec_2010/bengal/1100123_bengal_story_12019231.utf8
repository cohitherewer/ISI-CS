                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cabinet clears over 50000 teacher jobs
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 22: The state cabinet today cleared the appointment of 53,000 schoolteachers over the next two months. Of them, 45,000 will be primary teachers and 8,000 will be secondary teachers.        
	We will fill up 53,000 teachers posts. We have also created 16,000 new posts and will fill up 12,000 vacant posts in different departments, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said.        
	The cabinet also cleared a 100-seat medical college at Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital in Kalyani, Nadia. Dasgupta said the medical college would function under the West Bengal University of Health Sciences and the government had already allotted 73 acres for it.        
	A health department official, however, said the proposed medical college was yet to get the Medical Council of Indias (MCI) clearance. An MCI team will visit the hospital for inspection but the date has not been fixed yet, said director of medical education S.N. Banerjee.        
	Calcutta High Court had recently refused to pass an interim order restraining the government from appointing primary teachers. Some candidates having degrees from primary teacher training institutes derecognised by the court had appealed to it seeking an interim order preventing the government from making fresh recruitment till the cases had been disposed of. But a division bench headed by Chief Justice M.S. Shah said: The court cannot stop this recruitment process. So we are not passing any interim order.        
	Dasgupta said the cabinet meeting also approved the allotment of 30 acres in Nadia to set up the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, which will come up with central assistance.        
	The cabinet approved three coastal police outposts at Kalash, Bonny Camp and Sitarampur in the Sunderbans.         
	All three will function under Moipith police station, South 24-Parganas. Each will have 30 policemen and one high-powered speedboat, Dasgupta said.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said a mock drill on coastal security would be held in some places in South 24-Parganas and East Midnapore on January 29. Union cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar had a videoconference with chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and Sen on coastal security today.        
	Dasgupta said a seven-member committee, headed by the chief minister, was set up today for the issuance of the unique identification number to citizens, a central project.

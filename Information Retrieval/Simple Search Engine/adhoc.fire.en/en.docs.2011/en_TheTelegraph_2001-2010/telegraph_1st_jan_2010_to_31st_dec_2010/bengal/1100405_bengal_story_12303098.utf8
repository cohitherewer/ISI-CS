	Lalgarh, April 4: When Arati Manna told P. Chidambaram lack of development was mainly responsible for Maoist inroads into the area, the Union home minister told the housewife in her late 30s: Do you know the tale of what came first  the chicken or the egg?        
	Chidambaram, talking to Arati in English and Hindi with West Midnapore district magistrate N.S. Nigam acting as the interpreter, had asked her if she, directly or indirectly, supported the Maoists.         
	Aamra oto jani na babu, aamra bijli, hashpatal, ishkul aar kaaj chai (We dont know all these things, we want electricity, hospital, school and jobs), Arati said.        
	Will the Naxals bring all this to you? No. Only the government can fulfil your demands. I will talk to the state government about them. But you will have to stop supporting the Naxals. You will have to tell them (Maoists) not to come to your village. If you help the security forces, I assure you, no Maoist will exist in Lalgarh after three months, Chidambaram told her during an unscheduled 40-minute interaction with local villagers, standing under the scorching sun on a kutcha road near Lalgarh police station around 10am.        
	Hundreds of villagers had assembled near the helipad adjacent to Lalgarh police station when Chidambaram arrived around 8am, accompanied by state home secretary Ardhendu Sen and police chief Bhupinder Singh.         
	According to schedule, he was supposed to head straight to a health centre but, while getting into the car at the helipad, Chidambaram asked Singh where the Lalgarh police station was. Lets go there.        
	It took the police by surprise. We had no inkling that he could be coming here. There is only one small decent room for the officer-in-charge, where he was taken and offered coconut water, said a Lalgarh officer.        
	Chidambaram spent nearly an hour at the police station, poring over records.         
	He then walked 600 metres to the health centre. When journalists started trailing him, he asked them not to. Ensure that they dont follow me, the minister told the police chief.        
	Chidambaram asked the police to cordon off the area with a rope but they could not find one. Your police station doesnt even have a rope? Strange, the minister told Singh.        
	The police finally got a rope but this correspondent managed to sneak inside and mingle with the villagers, towards whom Chidambaram strode. I am also from a village like Lalgarh, named Sivaganga, in Tamil Nadu. What I want to know is do you want peace in your area? he asked.         
	The villagers burst into a cacophony demanding development. Chidambaram raised his hands and told them: Shant ho jaiye (Please be quiet), and asked them sit on the gravelled road. I will listen to each and every one of you.        
	No development is possible without peace. You will have to throw away the Naxals from your area to bring peace. They are killing your own people. They have killed a number of people in the past three months. Once peace is restored, development will take place, I will talk to the state government in this regard.        
	Do not provide food to the Maoists, do not give them money. Tell them not to come to your locality and ask them to get out of Lalgarh. Never support violence, Chidambaram appealed to the villagers.        
	Kalpana Roy, in her mid-30s, raised her hand. We are in double trouble. We provide them food out of fear. And if we do, the police think we are Maoists. What will I do if 10 armed men come to my house at night and ask me to serve rice and curry at gunpoint?        
	Chidambaram paused. It wont be possible to do it alone. Everyone from your locality will have to come forward to refuse the Maoists, he said.        
	Young Montu Roy asked: How will I identify a Maoist? They look like you and me.        
	Young man, they carry guns, we dont. Why are they carrying guns? So please, do not get scared, just throw them away, Chidambaram said.        
	At the end of the 40-minute chat, Chidambaram told a villager: I am genuinely sorry that you are so poor. You are not getting proper ration, medicine. But Naxals cant be the solution to all these problems. There is no place for Naxals.

	Darjeeling, June 2: Employees of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway have threatened to start an agitation over the Northeast Frontier Railways reported move to open a camp office for the toy train in Siliguri.         
	The authorities, however, said such DHR offices already existed in the plains.        
	The DHR is supposed to function from the Elysia Building in Kurseong which was its headquarters before 1948. It was renovated for about Rs 80 lakh in 2006 to house the directors office. But till date the office is not fully functional.        
	It has come to the notice of our union that plans have been mooted for opening a camp office of the DHR in Siliguri. The opening of the office will lead to a situation where the Elysia Building, which was envisaged to be the DHR headquarters, will become redundant and will be permanently reduced to a museum, said Anand Rai, the Kurseong branch secretary of the Intuc-affiliated NF Railway Employees Union.         
	The railways decision to revive the Elysia Buildling was aimed to provide greater autonomy to the DHR in recognition of its World Heritage status. In 1999, the Unesco had accorded the status to the toy train, making the DHR the first railway system in India to be awarded such a status.        
	Even though the railways long-term plan was to go in for structural changes and to create a separate unit for the DHR, an adapted management plan for the toy train had been mooted in 2005-06 to be supervised through the Katihar division.         
	According to the plan, a senior manager was to be placed in Kurseong, who would be supported by a mechanical and a civil engineer.        
	The arrangement was aimed at providing more autonomy at the local level. Later, the railways made a change in its plan and instead decided to appoint a director for the DHR.         
	The employees union has sought an appointment with the DHR authorities on June 4. If a solution is not arrived at during that meeting, we will decide on our next course of agitation, which could even mean complete closure of the DHR offices, a source in the union said.         
	The union members have managed to whip up emotion in the hills. We cannot tolerate such a retrograde step, which is anti-hills and stands in violation of the original plan. We request the officials not to take any step which may ignite the regional passion in an already volatile situation in the hills, said Rai.         
	P.P. Roy, the DHR director, said over the phone from Dehra Dun: This is nothing new. There are offices of the DHR already in Siliguri and New Jalpaiguri. I also have my office at the Elysia Building. Since there are frequent strikes in the hills, a situation in which the entire DHR comes to a halt cannot be allowed. This is why there are offices in the plains.

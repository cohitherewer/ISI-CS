          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The Supreme Court today set aside a three-day jail term handed to Biman Bose five years ago for publicly criticising a Calcutta High Court order banning bandhs.         
	The court also cancelled a fine of Rs 10,000 imposed on the CPM state secretary.         
	Justice Amitava Lala had ruled in 2003 that bandhs should be banned in the state from 8am to 8pm on weekdays so as not to inconvenience people. Bose had demonstrated against the ban and led a movement to have Lala transferred out of Bengal.         
	The leader had moved the apex court against the punishment given to him. Appeal allowed, the court said today.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trade-off ball in cops court
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Duley (top) wife Kalpana in Sarenga. (Satyajit Goswami)                          
	March 6: The family of the headmaster abducted by suspected Maoists in West Midnapore today pleaded with police to release the six prisoners sought by the rebels, and the government said the abductors demand could be considered after it had been conveyed officially.        
	The district CPM has asked the police to do what the law enforcers think is best.        
	The family is pinning its hopes on the release of police officer Atindranath Dutta last year in exchange for bail to 13 women charged with minor offences. Two among the six prisoners whose freedom is being sought this time were arrested in connection with the killing of a police officer.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti today said at Writers Buildings that it was not possible for the government to indulge in a trade-off.        
	 However, asked why the government would not negotiate with the rebels or the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities when it had done so for the freedom of police officer Dutta, Chakrabarti said: Nothing has been conveyed to us officially. If it is, then we shall consider it. However, every case has its own importance and magnitude.        
	Chakrabarti called the incident very disturbing.        
	The Maoist-backed Peoples Committee, which has accepted responsibility for the kidnapping of 55-year-old Ranjit Duley from Shibram Satpathy Madhyamik Siksha Kendra in Sarulia, has demanded the release of six persons.        
	Tribal committee leader Sidhu Soren today said Duley was in good condition.        
	Duleys wife Kalpana and two of her sons went to Sarenga police station today and pleaded with the police to get the teacher back. Please release those they (the tribal committee) want freed. If you do that, they will release my husband, she told the officers.         
	The eldest son, Dipak, who is in the army, is posted in Siliguri.        
	He (Dipak) has been on the phone, asking us to look after ma and take whatever steps are required to see that she does not fall ill, said Golok, one of the younger sons.        
	CPM district secretary Amiya Patra said it had been decided to tell the Bankura superintendent of police and the inspector-general of police (western range) to do what they thought was best. It is up to them, he said.         
	Last evening, the secretary of the Gana Militia unit of the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities, Sidhu Soren, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and said the head teacher would be freed if six innocent persons were released.        
	Two of them had been arrested in Saluka on February 26 in connection with the killing of Sarenga inspector in-charge Robilochan Mitra the day before.         
	Maoist leader Kishan tonight claimed that his group had no role in the kidnapping.

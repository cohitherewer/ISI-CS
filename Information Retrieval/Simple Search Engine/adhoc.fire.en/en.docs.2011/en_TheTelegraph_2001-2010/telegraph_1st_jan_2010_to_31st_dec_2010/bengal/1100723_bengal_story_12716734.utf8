          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                                            
	Durgapur, July 22: The tale of Bulti Bagdis bravery has reached the hallowed precints of Rashtrapati Bhavan and elicited a helping hand from the President.        
	The Telegraph had on March 12 reported how the village girl from Burdwan had stormed out of her wedding venue though the ritual had been completed and, rubbing off her sindoor, said she did not accept the marriage because the barjatris had insulted her family for failing to meet their dowry demand.         
	President Pratibha Patil has expressed her wish to help the bold girl after reading the report.         
	Archana Dutta, the Presidents officer on special duty (public relations) said today: The President was impressed with what the bold girl had done. She told me to take all possible steps to help Bulti.        
	Dutta said the subdivisional officer of Durgapur, Mrinal Kanti Rano, had told her that Bultis family had a monthly income of Rs 2,500. Her father is a vegetable vendor. Dutta, who has spoken to Bulti, said the 20-year-old had told her she wanted to complete her studies and requested a government job in the future.         
	Bulti has failed her madhyamik exam, which she had taken just before her marriage.         
	The Presidents office and the district administration have requested a private organisation to hand Bulti Rs 36,000 to help her prepare for next years Madhyamik.         
	As Bulti is a school dropout, the government cannot offer monetary help to her directly. So we have asked the private company to pay the money. If she passes her Madhyamik exams next year as a private candidate, we will pay for her further education, district magistrate O.S. Meena said.        
	Meena said Bultis father would be given a loan of Rs 1 lakh to open a shop. The family will also be given Rs 35,000 under a state government scheme to build a pucca house, the DM added.        
	Bulti said she was very happy that she would be able to resume her studies. I will try to do well in Madhyamik. I am thankful to the President and the local administration, she said.         
	The families of the bride and groom had agreed on a dowry of Rs 2 lakh in cash apart from ornaments and furniture. But when Bultis father told groom Sanjay Bagdis family that he was short by Rs 15,000, Sanjays father threatened to leave and the barjatris started hurling insults.

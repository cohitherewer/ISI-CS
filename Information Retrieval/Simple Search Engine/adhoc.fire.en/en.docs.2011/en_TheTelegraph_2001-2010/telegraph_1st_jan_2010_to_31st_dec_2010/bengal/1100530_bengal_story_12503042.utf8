The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Eye on city Muslim swing
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Eye on city Muslim swing

	May 29: Unlike in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Muslims in Calcutta have a problem of choice in the civic polls.        
	Last year, their choice was clear. Angry with the Left over Nandigram and the Rizwanur Rahman episode, they voted for the Opposition. It is tricky now because the Opposition is a split house. The question is how much of the Muslim vote in last years general election was for Mamata Banerjee and how much for the Congress.         
	Last year, the majority of the Muslims across the country wanted to ensure that the BJP did not return to power and voted for the Congress. In Bengal, this meant voting for its ally Trinamul.         
	Of the 34 wards in Calcutta that have a significant Muslim population, the Left had trailed in 29 in the Lok Sabha polls. In the 2005 CMC polls, it had trailed in 15 of the 34 wards.        
	In Calcutta, the majority of Urdu-speaking Muslims have traditionally been Congress voters, although this is different in the case of the Bengali-speaking Muslims in the districts. The minorities switched tracks after the Babri Masjid demolition but now that most Muslims of Calcutta are anti-Left again, the question is whether they will go back to the Congress or stay with Trinamul.        
	Because of the new situation, all the parties are going the extra mile to woo Muslims. The government has announced a 10 per cent job quota for backward Muslims and promised to bring a crore of them in the OBC net. The minority affairs budget has gone up. Mamata has allowed candidates to take railway job tests in Urdu and granted train concessions to madrasah students.         
	But the presence of the Congress in some of the 34 wards can be worrisome for Trinamul.

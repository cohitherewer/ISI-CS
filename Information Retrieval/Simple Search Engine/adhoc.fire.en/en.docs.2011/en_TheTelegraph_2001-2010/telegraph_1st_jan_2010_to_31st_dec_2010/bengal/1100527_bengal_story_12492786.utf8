The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Gurung in alls-well scramble 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Gurung in alls-well scramble 
          VIVEK CHHETRI                      Bharati, the widow of Madan Tamang and the newly appointed president of the ABGL, on Wednesday appealed to the people in Darjeeling to unite and fight for the restoration of democracy in the hills.  (Suman Tamang)                          
	Darjeeling, May 26: Bimal Gurung has set the stage for the next round of tripartite talks that looked uncertain a week ago, sprinting to reclaim political space and paint a picture of normality in the face of an unusual show of defiance in the hills.        
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leader met the central interlocutor, Vijay Madan, last night and this evening in Darjeeling. The next round of political-level talks is likely to be held in the first week of June.        
	The round was originally scheduled for the last week of this month but a standoff over territorial limits had clouded the timetable. The murder of Gorkha leader Madan Tamang had further vitiated the atmosphere.        
	Curiously, the Morcha today did not refer to the territorial dispute that had plunged the talks into uncertainty.        
	Gurung had maintained that unless the entire Darjeeling district, along with the Terai and parts of the Dooars, were included in an interim set-up, his party would not attend the next round. The Centre and the state had insisted that only the three hill sub-divisions of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong would be part of the interim arrangement.         
	The silence today need not mean the Morcha has dropped the demand. It is being seen as a tactical shift to ensure that the talks are back on track, which suggests that the Morcha is rattled by the backlash after Tamangs murder.         
	Gurung also seems to be keen to send a message that he is still in complete control.        
	Darjeeling did return to some sort of normality today with shops and other establishments opening after a four-day shutdown since the daylight murder of Tamang.        
	After the initial display of defiance, to which Gurung responded by leading a 100-car convoy to Darjeeling yesterday and announcing a mammoth rally on Sunday, those who distanced themselves from the Morcha have started trickling back to the fold.        
	Trilok Dewan, a former principal secretary in the Andhra Pradesh government, and Amar Singh Rai, former vice-principal of Loreto College, both of whom had resigned from the Morchas think tank, the Study Forum, announced their decision to return.        
	Rally defiance        
	Morcha sources said today that Darjeeling MP Jaswant Singh was likely to arrive in Darjeeling on Saturday and attend Sundays rally.        
	In Calcutta, home secretary Samar Ghosh said that as of today, permission for such a rally cannot be granted.        
	The state administration has not received any request for permission to conduct such a rally so far, added Ghosh. Given the situation in the hills, the question of granting permission for such a rally does not arise.        
	Gurung, however, said that even if the government did not give permission, he would go ahead with the rally.

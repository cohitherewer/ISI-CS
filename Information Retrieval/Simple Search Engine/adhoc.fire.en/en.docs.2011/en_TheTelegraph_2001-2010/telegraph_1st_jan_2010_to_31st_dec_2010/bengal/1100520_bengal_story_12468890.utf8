The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bomb scan goes for a toss
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bomb scan goes for a toss
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Calcutta, May 19: Lapses on the part of the police administration led to todays blast in Chowkishal forest, a CRPF officer said today.         
	The practice of engaging teams with explosives det- ectors at regular intervals to scan roads used by security forces had stopped months ago. When the joint forces had moved into Lalgarh last June, it was mandatory to scan roads with such detectors before every operation. This system has gradually stopped. We do not know why, a CRPF officer said.        
	Now, these exercises are allegedly carried out only before a VIP visit.        
	Intelligence branch officials said the area where the blast occurred today was a Maoist hotbed when the joint forces moved in about a year ago.        
	At the very onset of Operation Lalgarh, security forces were engaged in encounters with Maoists in the forests of Kadashole, Pingboni and Mahultole. The road between Ramgarh and Goaltore used to be regularly checked by explosive experts then, particularly the dozen culverts that are often used by the guerrillas to hide improvised explosive devices, an IB officer said.         
	Sources said todays strike also pointed out the strong source network the Maoists had built over the past year with the single-point objective of keeping an eye on the security forces movement.        
	The Maoists knew the deputy commandant had gone to Ramgarh in the morning from Goaltore and would return either along the same route or another one. So, their sources in Ramgarh kept watch and tipped them off, an intelligence officer said.         
	The Maoists also knew that the CRPF deputy commandant was travelling in one vehicle with several jawans. It is always advisable to travel in a convoy on such terrain, the officer added.        
	Maoists claimed todays strike was part of operation Peace Hunt.         
	We observed a Black Week from May 11 to May 17 and today was the last day of our two-day bandh in five states against Operation Green Hunt. If the security forces do not leave our area, they will have to pay in the manner they did today, said a leader of the CPI (Maoist)s Bengal-Jharkhand-Orissa regional committee.         
	Police officers in West Midnapore admitted that the strike would not have been possible in the absence of specific information about cop movement. The vehicle had left Ramgarh 10 minutes before it was blown up. It proves how closely they were keeping watch, said an officer.        
	According to IB officers, who claimed to have intercepted conversations of Maoist guerrillas after todays blast, the rebels had found it difficult to pull off a major strike in the past few weeks because the security forces had been moving around with strong contingents.         
	Today, they found only one vehicle going to Ramgarh and returning the same way. We are sure the IED had been planted in the past and the rebels just had to trigger it, an officer said.        
	The police also suspect the hand of villagers trained by Maoists.

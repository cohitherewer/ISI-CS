The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress stirs to protect space 
                                                                                                                                                 Congress stirs to protect space 
          BARUN GHOSH                                            
	Calcutta, March 28: Congress leaders from across Bengal told Pranab Mukherjee today that they would not sacrifice space to the Trinamul Congress in places where their party had a stronger base than its ally just for the sake of an alliance in the run-up to the elections to 82 civic bodies.         
	Mukherjee, who chaired an extended secretariat meeting as state party president at Bidhan Bhavan today, had to swallow many unpalatable questions from several district unit chiefs who expressed reservations about the alliance with Trinamul.        
	Im accepting a challenge to ensure that the Congress retains all three civic boards in Nadia (Shantipur, Birnagar and Ranaghat) by contesting on its own. You remove me from my post or I shall resign on my own if I fail to keep my promise, Shankar Singh of Nadia told Mukherjee when he tried to explain that the alliance had to be struck with Trinamul so it could be taken forward to the 2011 Assembly elections.         
	Singh, who is known to have strained relations with Mamata Banerjee since her party got all 16 Congress councillors of Ranaghat to switch sides last year, raised his voice to assert: The alliance isnt a necessity in Nadia. Trinamul is a party that has only one post (apparently referring to the one occupied by Mamata), while the others are lampposts.         
	Armed with an earlier party guideline that the seat adjustment with Trinamul should be worked out at the district level, Singh today said that as the Nadia district chief, he would field candidates against all those 16 candidates in Ranaghat if they are nominated by Trinamul.         
	Trinamul sources said Mamata had already asked the partys Nadia unit to field the 16.        
	The Bankura district president accused Mamata of poaching the chairman of the Congress-run Bishnupur municipality, Shyam Mukherjee, last year. There is no need to align with Trinamul in Bishnupur because the Congress can fight the CPM on its own thanks to its organisational strength, he told the meeting.         
	Malda leader Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury said: Trinamul is on the verge of a split in Malda. We should field our own candidates for the two municipalities in the district.         
	Only last week, Abu Hashem had publicly said Mamata was not welcome at the foundation stone laying for an engineering college named after his brother A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury.         
	Talks on the alliance have also run into rough weather in North 24-Parganas, where 21 municipalities will go to the polls in May-end. Trinamul has three-four groups within the party in my district; with whom shall we discuss the alliance? asked the district party chief.         
	Having heard the leaders, Mukherjee urged them to make utmost efforts to work out seat-share deals because it was a political necessity in the larger perspective. However, he was also quoted as saying: You should try your best to forge an alliance with the Trinamul Congress but in places where it is not possible, you put up your own candidates.        
	Congress leaders see in the assertion an attempt to send a message to Mamata that the party would not make an abject surrender to her as it was accused of doing before last years Lok Sabha elections. Only a third of Bengals 42 Lok Sabha seats had been left for the Congress to contest.        
	Mukherjee later told a news conference: There are problems in some districts and that is why we will have to take a cautious approach to keep the alliance intact.         
	State party working presidents Pradip Bhattacharya and Subrata Mukherjee have been assigned the task of initiating talks with Mamata to discuss seat-sharing for the civic polls. The decision was taken at a core committee meeting held tonight at Pranab Mukherjees home.

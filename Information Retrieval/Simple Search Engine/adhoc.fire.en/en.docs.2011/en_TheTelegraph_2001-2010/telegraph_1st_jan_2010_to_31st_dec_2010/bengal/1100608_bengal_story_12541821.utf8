	Calcutta, June 7: The chief minister has asked for 12 additional companies of the CRPF in his reply to a letter from the Union home minister enquiring about the situation in Jungle Mahal, an official said at Writers Buildings today.        
	The chief minister has sought 12 more to take the number of CRPF companies stationed in Jungle Mahal to 40, the official told The Telegraph.         
	P. Chidambaram had also wanted to know from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the condition of the camps in which the jawans stay. There are 24 temporary camps to house the 28 companies now. Each company has about 100 personnel.        
	Bhattacharjee mentioned in his reply his governments intent to increase the number of CRPF camps in the Maoist-affected areas and also set up some permanent camps, the official said.        
	Jnaneswari probe: The state has decided to wind up its CID probe to pave the way for a CBI investigation into the May 28 sabotage that caused the derailment of the Jnaneswari Express and 150 deaths. The arrested van owner accused of ferrying the Maoists will be handed over to the CBI.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 31: The Left Front will hold a silent rally in Calcutta tomorrow to mourn for the victims of the Jnaneswari tragedy and condemn the Maoist subversion that had caused it.         
	The CPM apparently got a shot in the arm after what it interpreted as Union home minister P. Chidambarams endorsement of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees views about the nature of the subversion and the culprits.         
	Chidambaram made it obvious that the Maoists were responsible for the subversion. They have attacked 127 trains in the past year. The railway minister herself has said that the Maoists have ruined or damaged railway property worth Rs 5,100 crore, CPM state secretariat member Rabin Deb told a news conference.         
	The railways police complaint on the train tragedy had not mentioned the Maoists, the suspected perpetrators of the crime. After the Maoists denied a role in the incident, some pro-Mamata artistes and actors had put the blame on the CPM, branding it a possible political beneficiary of the subversion.         
	However, before the state home secretary rejected the CBI probe proposal, Deb was non-committal on whether the government should accept it, indicating the partys initial ambivalence about it. Left Front chairman Biman Bose has already asked for the Prime Ministers intervention. It is for the Centre to decide which agencys help it would take in the probe, he had said.         
	Tomorrows rally will focus on the Maoists rather than the usual complaint about Mamata Banerjees alleged nexus with them, apparently to pre-empt the Trinamul charge of trying to settle scores with her.         
	Deb harped on the railways alleged indifference to passenger safety but shied away from seeking Mamatas scalp. We are not commenting on her resignation. We rather want the railways to work together with the Centre and the state in unearthing the truth about the perpetrators. In the meantime, the railways must take care of passenger safety.        
	The state election commission had barred the Left rally, originally planned on Saturday, in view of the Sunday polls. Now that the polls are over, its permission is no longer necessary, Deb said. The procession will begin at Lenins statue at Esplanade at 5pm, after the re-polling ordered in a few booths ends, and end at College Square, Deb said.

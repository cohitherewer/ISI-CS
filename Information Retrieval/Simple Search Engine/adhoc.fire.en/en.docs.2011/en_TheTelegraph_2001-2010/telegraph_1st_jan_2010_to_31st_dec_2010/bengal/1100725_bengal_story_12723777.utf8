The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hint of thaw in hill tangle
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hint of thaw in hill tangle
          OUR BUREAU                           Maken (left) shake hands with Giri at the Delhi meet. (PTI)                                  
	July 24: The Bengal government and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today inched closer to setting up an interim hill authority, both agreeing to send within two weeks their final observations on draft proposals drawn up by the Centre.        
	The development, which the Morcha dubbed a breakthrough, came at political-level tripartite talks in Delhi, chaired by junior home minister Ajay Maken.        
	The Centre had proposed that an interim set-up called the Gorkhaland Autonomous Authority, which would report to the Bengal governor, should replace the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. Delhi also said the new authority would have legislative powers along with the executive authority the DGHC now enjoys.        
	While none of these proposals is new, the days positive development was that both the Morcha and the state government said they would submit their final observations within the deadline so that the interim authority could be formed soon.        
	We told the Centre the interim authority has to be time-bound and without any prejudice to our primary demand, which is a separate state, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri, who led his partys dozen-strong delegation, said. The meeting was very cordial, he added.        
	The Bengal government has conveyed to the Centre it is in agreement with the proposals, but has some reservations on the financial powers and transfer of officers to the interim authority.         
	Although the Morcha spoke of a breakthrough, fears remained that the authoritys territorial jurisdiction could come in the way of a settlement.        
	Both Delhi and Calcutta have been insisting that the territorial jurisdiction stay confined to the hill sub-divisions of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong, but the Morcha has said it must include Siliguri as well as Nepali-dominated areas of the Dooars.         
	The next round of talks, which will be at the official level, will be on August 17, a little over a week after the deadline for the Morcha and the Bengal government to submit their observations.         
	Subsequently, after the monsoon session of Parliament, the next round of political-level talks will take place after thrashing out differences over the Centres proposal at the official level, a home ministry spokesperson said.        
	Sources said the Morcha appeared more accommodating today, realising that any delay in reaching a consensus on the interim authority might jeopardise the plan.        
	The authority needs to be in place by early December. The Bengal elections are due in May, but any day after December 10, the Election Commission can decide on its own when to call elections. Once the model code of conduct kicks in, it would be difficult for the state government to put in place the authority.        
	Others present at the talks included Trinamul leader and Union minister Dinesh Trivedi, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai, Bengal health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, state home secretary Samar Ghosh and joint secretary N.S. Kalsi.

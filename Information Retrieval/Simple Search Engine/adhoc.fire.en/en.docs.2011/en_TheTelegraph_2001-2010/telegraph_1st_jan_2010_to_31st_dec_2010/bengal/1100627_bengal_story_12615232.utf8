          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, June 26: A 58-year-old STD booth owner died today after he fell down during a scuffle with a gang of five who had come to his Ekbalpur shop to extort Rs 60 lakh.        
	Mohammed Yunus, who died at a local nursing home, had a heart ailment. The exact cause of his death can be ascertained after a post-mortem.        
	Yunus fell down on a chair and lost consciousness after one of the youths pushed him.        
	Yunus had struck a deal with the owner of the house where his shop was located to buy the shop space. He was supposed to pay the last instalment today. The police said the local gang could have received information that Yunus was carrying money and therefore they came to demand money.

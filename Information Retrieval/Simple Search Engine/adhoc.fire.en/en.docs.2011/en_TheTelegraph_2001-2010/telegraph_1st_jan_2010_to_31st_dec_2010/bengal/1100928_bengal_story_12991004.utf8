	Mahanad (Hooghly), Sept. 27: A headmaster on the verge of retirement has bought dresses for all 90 students of his primary school in Hooghly and given gold nose studs to 26 of the girls most hard-up to stop poor children from dropping out.        
	Over the past two years, 27 children have dropped out of Swapan Neogis Harmala Primary School in Mahanad, a small village of mainly poor farmers. Poverty has forced most of the farmers to discontinue their childrens education so that they can help in the fields.         
	Most of the villagers dont understand the importance of education. When the boys grow up a little, their fathers take them to the fields to help them in farming. The girls are asked to help their mothers in the kitchen. Around a dozen students drop out every year. Since 2008, 27 boys and girls have dropped out. So I decided to give them gifts as incentive for coming to school, Neogi said.        
	The 59-year-old, due to retire this year, said he had discussed the matter with his wife. We both agreed we had to do something to stop the children from leaving school. I have given dresses to all the 90 students of the school. Of the 49 girl students, I chose 26 who are extremely poor and gave them gold nose studs. I have spent Rs 40,000 on the gifts.        
	Neogis monthly salary is Rs 22,000.        
	Harmala Primary School has two classrooms. Another room was being built but the work had to be stopped because of lack of funds. Apart from the headmaster, the school has three teachers.        
	Class III student Arpita Tewari, whose father is a grocer, has not missed classes since she got her gift, a gold stud, her mother said. My daughter is very fond of the headmaster, she added.        
	Arpitas classmate Kalyani Murmu said her mother had asked her to help her in the field. My parents are farm labourers, she said. But I like to go to school every day.        
	Headmaster Neogi said he has always tried to encourage his students to attend school. I regularly buy bindis and chocolates for them as incentive to attend classes, he said.        
	Mahadeb Soren, the district inspector of schools (primary), said over 3.5 lakh students studied in 3,000 primary schools in Hooghly.         
	In the villages, the dropout rate is high because parents prefer their children to work in the fields or in the kitchen. We are organising awareness campaigns in the villages to prevent dropouts, Soren added.        
	Hooghly zilla parishad sabhadhipati Pradip Saha, who also looks after education, said around 12 per cent of primary school students in the district drop out every year.

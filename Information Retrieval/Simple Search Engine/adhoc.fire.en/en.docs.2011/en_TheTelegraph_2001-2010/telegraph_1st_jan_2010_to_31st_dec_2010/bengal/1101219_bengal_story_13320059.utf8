	Malda, Dec. 18: A 62-year-old woman was burnt alive this morning by some of her relatives and villagers in Malda on the suspicion that she was a witch.    
	Police, however, said Sonia Malla, a childless widow and resident of Adivasipara, could have been killed because the relatives wanted to grab her property. Malla owned some land and a house. Local residents said she had been branded a witch by a witch doctor last week.

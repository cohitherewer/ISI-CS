	Midnapore, April 17: Police engaged Maoists in a gun battle for around six hours in the Bhalukbasha forest in Goaltore police station area today.        
	The police have found the body of a suspected Maoist along with 20 guns in the forest. We are yet to identify the body. It appears that he was among those who were firing at us. There were three bullet injuries on his body, said Manoj Verma, the superintendent of police, West Midnapore.        
	The police said the gun battle started around 10am. We had received information that an armed Maoist squad had gathered in the forest. We started proceeding towards the forest through different routes. We wanted to block their exit routes, an officer said.        
	The Maoists fired at the joint forces as they crawled towards the forest across paddy fields. We fired back and they had to retreat, the officer added.        
	But the forces, who had blocked the exit routes of the forest, engaged the Maoists in further gun battles as they tried to move to another area. We fought the battle in five phases, Verma, who led the operation today, said.        
	Transfer protest        
	More than 100 people  family members of Eastern Frontier Rifles policemen  held a demonstration and later blocked the Kharagpur- Bhadraghat Road in West Midnapores Salua, protesting the transfer of the forces special inspector-general Benoy Chakraborty.         
	The roadblock, which started at 4.30pm, continued for nearly an hour.

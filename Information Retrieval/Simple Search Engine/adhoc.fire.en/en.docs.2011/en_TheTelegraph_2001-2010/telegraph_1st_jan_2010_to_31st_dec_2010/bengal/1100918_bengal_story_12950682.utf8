	Midnapore, Sept. 17: Two 14-year-old schoolboys drowned and one of their classmates went missing after they tried to bathe in a river while drunk in Midnapore town today.        
	Police have recovered the bodies of Bapi Sau and Sumit Sharma, both Class VIII students, from Kangshabati river while Dibyendu Banerjee is missing.        
	One of their friends, Raja Chakraborty, who had accompanied them to the river bank, said they had drunk vodka before stepping into the river.         
	Our feet got stuck in the sand on the riverbed. Bapi, Sumit and Dibyendu tried to free themselves but failed and started drowning. I tried to drag them out but but nearly drowned in the attempt. So I swam back, Raja said.

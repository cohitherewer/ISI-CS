          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Aug. 24: The owner of Gurjant Singhs truck today moved a petition for the release of his vehicle that has been kept at Kolaghat police station in East Midnapore.        
	In his plea, Narinder Singh has requested the Tamluk chief judicial magistrate to release the truck seized on August 9 after Gurjant rammed it into Mamatas convoy when she was returning from her Lalgarh rally.         
	Gurjant was granted bail on August 10 but was re-arrested the next day after Trinamul Congress lodged an FIR charging him with conspiracy to kill its party chief Mamata.        
	The manager of the Punjab firm that owns the plastic granules loaded on the truck moved a separate petition to get back the consignment.

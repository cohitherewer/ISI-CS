The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Politics at Nandi rail event
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Politics at Nandi rail event
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram. (Jahangir Badsa)                                   
	Tamluk, Jan. 30: Mamata Banerjee today broke her pledge not to talk politics at railway programmes by criticis- ing the CPM and vowing to prevent the construction of the proposed chemical hub.        
	But she was in Nandigram, the place that has changed her political fortunes and propelled her close to the seat of power in the state.        
	After laying the foundation stone for a railway line connecting Nandigram with East Midnapore district headquarters Tamluk, she said it was now time to heal the wounds of the people of Nandigram.        
	Many times when I have come here in the past I have been attacked. For the past three years, people have not been able to sleep here, nor could they perform puja and azaan. Blood has flown..... Now I have a lot of dreams for Nandigram, Mamata told the gathering.        
	She did mention the CPM once. Former CPM MP Lakshman Seth and his men had repeatedly tried to prevent me from laying the Tamluk-Digha rail line by staging demonstrations on railway tracks, she alleged.         
	The tracks were laid during the NDA regime that ended in 2004, but the trains started running only a few months ago.         
	The Trinamul Congress leader also made it clear she would not allow a chemical hub to come up at Nayachar, an island on the Haldi only about 6km away. Nayachar and Nandigram are almost side by side. We dont want a danav shilpa (demon industry) there. We shall build an eco-park instead of a chemical hub, she said.         
	Earlier, Mamata would say: I am not here to talk politics, this is a railway programme, a government function.        
	A Trinamul general secretary later explained that by referring to the hub as danav shilpa she meant it was likely to pollute the area.         
	The state had picked Nayachar as a possible site after its plans to build the hub at Nandigram were scuttled by Trinamul-led villagers. However, the Union environment ministry has yet to give the go-ahead to the Nayachar project.         
	Trinamul minister Sisir Adhikari, who had spearheaded the land war in Nandigram with his son Subhendu, said the party-run East Midnapore zilla parishad had sent a proposal to Delhi for the promotion of eco-tourism at Nayachar.         
	NRI investor Prasoon Mukherjee, whose company is involved in the proposed chemical hub, had last week told a seminar that he had plans for an eco-tourism project there.        
	Mamata said 180 acres would be required for the 17km Nandigram-Tamluk line, but she would not acquire land forcibly. A survey by the rail- ways has revealed that people are willing to offer land for the new line, she said. If necessary, the railways will provide a job to a member of each family whose house is demolished.

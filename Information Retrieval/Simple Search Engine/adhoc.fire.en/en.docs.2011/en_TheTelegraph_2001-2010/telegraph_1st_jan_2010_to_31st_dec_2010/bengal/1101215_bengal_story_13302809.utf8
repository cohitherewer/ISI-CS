The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Adhir   card   salvo at   Mamata
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Adhir   card   salvo at   Mamata
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                
	Behrampore, Dec. 14: Behrampore Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury today claimed his name had been printed on the invitation card for a Mamata Banerjee event in his area tomorrow without his consent.        
	The railways have printed my name without my consent. After TV channels started showing my statements yesterday that I wouldnt attend the programme, a person called me up and identifying himself as the divisional railway manager of Howrah requested me to be present at the programme. I told him it would not be possible, Chowdhury said today.        
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is also scheduled to attend the event  the foundation ceremony of a double-line project at Sagardighi  as it falls under his Jangipur constituency, which is in the same Murshidabad district as Behrampore.         
	Congress leaders in Behrampore will organise a rail roko tomorrow in an apparent bid by Chowdhury, also the district Congress chief, to embarrass the rail minister. Chowdhury claims he has nothing to do with the protest, lined up to press for two flyovers.        
	Chowdhury said he had a word with Mukherjee yesterday. I told him that the rail roko has been called in Behrampore. I told him I will not attend (the Sagardighi event) as I have not been invited.         
	Chowdhury has long been insisting that the Congress fight the CPM alone in his stronghold, without ally Trinamul.        
	Today, he found support from some in his party who criticised Trinamul leader Kalyan Banerjees comments after Chowdhury declared yesterday that he wouldnt attend the rail event.        
	We strongly condemn the way the Trinamul MP (Kalyan) slammed our Behrampore MP. He (Kalyan) is acting as CPMs agent, Congress leader Nirbed Roy said.         
	Mamata had in the past used similar language, saying the Congress has a secret nexus with the CPM.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          A Mahindra Scorpio                                        
	Chinsurah, March 8: Unnikrishnan Nair was told by his film director client to pick up a few foreign delegates from the airport. The delegates did not arrive.        
	But worse awaited Nair. Seven cars that Ajay Gupta, the supposed filmmaker, had hired from him were gone and the drivers were found unconscious in a guesthouse where Nair had left them this afternoon.        
	Of the seven cars stolen, four are Hyundai Santros, two Mahindra Scorpios and one Mahindra Bolero.        
	According to police, Gupta had given an advertisement in a Hindi newspaper seeking 10 new cars for shooting a documentary with a foreign crew. He had promised Rs 10,000 per car a day.        
	After seeing the advertisement, Nair hired six cars from a Howrah travel agent, Munna Pandey, and delivered them to Gupta on March 4.        
	Gupta even made Nair, a Budge Budge travel agent, his assistant production manager. This morning, he sent Nair to the airport to pick up the foreign crew as well as an American actress who was supposed to work in Guptas documentary.        
	Gupta had put up at room 305 of Rikita guesthouse in Dankuni. The owner of the guesthouse, Prabir Bhandari, has been detained for questioning.        
	Gupta had said he wanted to shoot a documentary at Iskcon and the Tarakeswar temple and needed the cars for this purpose. Gupta was staying at Dankunis Rikita lodge from March 4 along with the drivers of the cars. Nair also went there yesterday, an officer of Dankuni police station said after speaking to Nair.         
	According to Nairs complaint, Gupta asked him this morning to go to the airport with two cars to receive the delegates.        
	But no one came and Nair kept on waiting till 1pm. When he rang up Gupta, his phone was switched off and the phones of the other drivers kept on ringing. Nair rushed back to the guesthouse to find the drivers lying unconscious in a room and all the cars gone, said an officer.        
	The police have found out that Gupta had fed the drivers some sweets and cold drinks that were probably laced with sedatives. The police suspect he may have hired others to drive the cars.        
	The police have admitted the unconscious drivers to Uttarpara State General Hospital.

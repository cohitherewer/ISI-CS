                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mollah veiled barb at Asok
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 12: Abdur Rezzak Mollah today launched a veiled attack on urban affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, saying the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority had misused the land his department had leased out to it.         
	Mollahs land and land reforms ministry had leased out 100 acres of land off EM Bypass to the CMDA, which is overseen by Bhattacharya, in 2003 for infrastructure development. However, Mollah told The Telegraph he had information that the land had been misused by the CMDA.         
	I have information that the land was used for commercial purposes like the construction of shopping malls. This should not have been done, Mollah said. This was the governments vested land, he added. Mollah said he had sought an update on the land from the CEO of the CMDA within a week.         
	The land had been leased out for infrastructure development like construction of roads, water reservoirs and housing complexes for the poor. But the same land was used for other purposes, Mollah told a news conference at Writers after a meeting with CMDA officials today.        
	Mollah parried questions on whether Bhattacharya was his target. I am only concerned with the CMDA, he said.        
	Bhattacharya, who is in Siliguri, said: Rezzakda is in the habit of going public on many things concerning the government.

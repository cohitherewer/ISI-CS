The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bomb inside bus
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bomb inside bus
                            
	Kalchini (Jalpaiguri), Jan. 11: An improvised explosive device with a timer set at 3.04pm was detected in a bus parked on the outskirts of Kalchini last night.        
	Had the explosive stuffed in a foot-tall tiffin carrier gone off at that time, the bus would have been on its way to Jaigaon, about 60km away, with around 30 passengers from the Alipurduar bus stand.         
	The bus makes two trips from Jaigaon to Alipurduar and back in a day and covers the distance in about 90 minutes.         
	The bus owner found the lunch box on the luggage rack when it was parked near his home.         
	A bomb squad defused the explosive today. Its contents are being sent to Calcutta for tests, Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Anand Kumar said. The timer was packed inside a plaster of Paris case inside the steel container, said a source.         
	Jaigaon town is located on Indias border with Bhutan.

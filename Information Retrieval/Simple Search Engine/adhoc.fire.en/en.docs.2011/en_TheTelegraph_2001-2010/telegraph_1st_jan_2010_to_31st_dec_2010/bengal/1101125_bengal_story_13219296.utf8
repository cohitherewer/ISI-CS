The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shyamal barb at police
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Shyamal barb at police
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Shyamal Chakraborty at the CPM rally at Metro Channel on Wednesday. Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 24: CPM leader Shyamal Chakraborty alleged some policemen had colluded with the Trinamul Congress to frustrate the Lefts peace initiative in Khejuri today and prodded his party to ensure that the force remained impartial.        
	The unfortunate part is that a section of the police force today colluded with (Tamluk MP) Subhendu Adhikari and Trinamul. We dont know how this happened. We will have to look into this. Before the Assembly polls next year, we must ensure that the police act impartially, Chakaraborty said at a Left Front rally in Esplanade.         
	The CPM state secretariat member added: Trinamul is spreading anarchy in East Midnapore and is frustrating the CPMs peace initiative. Adhikari is creating terror in the district.        
	Chakraborty said that just like Rahul Gandhi was the prince of the Congress, Adhikari was the yuvraaj of Trinamul.         
	The Citu president accused Trinamul of driving out CPM supporters who were trying to return to their homes.         
	This shows how desperate they (Trinamul) are to wipe out the ruling party. Why will homeless people be prevented from re-entering their villages? The police and the district administration should keep an eye on what Trinamul is doing, he added.        
	A section of the CPM leadership was not surprised by Chakrabortys criticism of the police force, controlled by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	A party leader said: Shyamaldas comments are not surprising. He is aware of the ground realities in East Midnapore and the manner in which Trinamul has been trying to decimate us in Nandigram, Khejuri and other parts of the district.        
	He added: Buddhababu may be the home minister but if the police act in Trinamuls favour, what can he do? We will have to discuss this (Chakrabortys allegation) during our party meetings.         
	Addressing the public meeting, CPM state secretary Biman Bose accused Trinamul of attacking poor villagers in Khejuri and urged the rally participants to resist the terror unleashed by the Opposition.         
	Bose said that this morning, armed Trinamul men attacked poor, innocent, unarmed villagers who had been driven out of their homes in Khejuri.         
	The leader added: Their (villagers) families are in dire straits. They have been forced to stop cultivation because of Trinamuls threats. Cant they go back to their homes?        
	How can it be that only one party will take part in political activities and the others will be threatened if they organise road shows, processions or meetings?        
	Accusing Trinamul of limited vision, Bose termed the party as kupamonduk, which in Bengali literally means a frog in a well.         
	They dont understand the basics of politics. They are saying that the red flag will not flutter anymore. How can they say that? Bose said.         
	He urged the rally participants to join hands against the unholy forces.

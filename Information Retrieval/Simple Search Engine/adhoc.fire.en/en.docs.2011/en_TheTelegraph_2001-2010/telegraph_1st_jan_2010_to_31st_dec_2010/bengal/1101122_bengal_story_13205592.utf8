  - Ex-BPO employee in dirty call net          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Subrata Das being taken to a court in Durgapur on Sunday. Picture by Gour Sharma                                        
	Durgapur, Nov. 21: A former call centre executive who rang numbers at random and recited Tagore and Nazrul if he found a woman on the line before making indecent proposals has been arrested after a two-month hunt.        
	Jhargram resident and graduate Subrata Das was picked up last night on complaints from at least 10 women in Durgapur, though his call-and-tease antics extended to several other parts of Bengal, including Calcutta, police said.        
	Many of the calls the 34-year-old son of a retired schoolteacher made were from the cellphones of friends and acquaintances who had no idea their numbers were being misused until the police began calling and cross-checking them. Three SIM cards and two mobile phones were seized from Das at the time of his arrest.        
	A Durgapur officer said Das, a bachelor, made the calls over the past year for fun. He never met any of the women. He used to speak in Bengali, Hindi and English. He recited poems of Rabindranath Tagore, Nazrul or Sankha Ghosh to impress the women, said the officer.        
	Police sources said Das had lost his job at the Calcutta call centre a year ago for making lewd remarks to women customers while handling their phone queries.        
	Some of the women he allegedly harassed in Durgapur are wives of executives in the steel town.         
	Even though the calls had been made from his friends mobile phones, our investigations revealed the owners of these phones did not know about them, the officer said.        
	The last such complaint, made only three days ago, was from a senior executive of a private company in Durgapur alleging his wife was getting calls on their landline from an unknown man who was talking dirty and making indecent proposals.        
	The executive had a caller line identification machine. We traced the numbers to Jhargram town and its vicinity and got the address from the cellphone firms, said the officer. A Durgapur court today remanded Das in five days police custody.        
	Das used to make the calls not only at night  a practice common with crank callers  but also during the day. Subrata confessed to calling up numbers at random. Whenever he heard a woman at the other end, he would save the number. He also called women in Calcutta, Burdwan, Midnapore and Siliguri, said the officer.        
	District superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said the investigators were finding out if Dass friends were actually in the dark about his deeds. The calls from his friends numbers were made without their knowledge. But we are investigating the matter.         
	Dass father Gyanendranath expressed shock at his sons activities. I was surprised to learn from the police that my son used to make dirty phone calls to women. It is very shocking and shameful. I have nothing more to say, the former teacher said.

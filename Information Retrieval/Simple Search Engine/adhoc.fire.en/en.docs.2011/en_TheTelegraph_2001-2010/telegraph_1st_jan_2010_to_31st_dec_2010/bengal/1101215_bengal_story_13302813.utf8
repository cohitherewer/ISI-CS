                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Ragging trio denied bail
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Durgapur, Dec. 14: Three girls of a Durgapur engineering college charged with driving a junior to the brink of suicide were today denied bail despite the victims lawyer saying he had no objections to their release.        
	The additional chief judicial magistrate of Durgapur remanded Subhasree Dhar, Arpita Das and Deblina Haldar, all of them from Calcutta, in jail custody till December 28.        
	The girls from the National Power Training Institute  under the Union power ministry  had been in judicial custody since their arrest on December 9.        
	Gagan Chandra Ghosh, a lawyer for the three girls, requested magistrate S.K. Manna for the relief saying their careers were at stake and that they needed to appear for their ongoing semester exam.         
	But the plea was shot down. If they (girls) were serious about their careers, the incident should not have happened, Manna said.        
	The rejection of the bail pleas came despite submissions from the ragging victim, Satarupa Das, and her father that they had no objection if the three accused were granted the relief.         
	I do not want to spoil the career of the girls as I am also a father. We did not oppose the bail petition but I will not withdraw my complaint, said Das.        
	Dass lawyer Sajid said his client had no objections if the court granted bail to the girls for the sake of their careers and their examination. We had submitted this in writing. But the crime has taken place and the case should go on.        
	The fathers of the three girls broke down. I have nothing to say. My daughters career has been ruined, mumbled one of them but refused to give his name.         
	The trio have been allowed by the court to appear for the semester tests, which will continue till December 22. On exam days, they will be taken to the institute from jail and brought back there again.

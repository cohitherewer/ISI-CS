                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Demotion rap on CPM duo 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 1: Two CPM leaders of North 24-Parganas were today dropped from the partys district committee for breach of discipline, three days after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee warned party men against being arrogant and bossy and asked those with hot heads to get out.        
	According to a section in the CPM, the chief ministers outburst in Barrackpore on Sunday and the action against the two leaders today is in keeping with the partys ongoing rectification drive to weed out undesirable elements ahead of next years Assembly polls.        
	The decision to remove Kalyan Mukherjee and Ranjit Das from the district committee was taken at a meeting of the state secretariat and the partys North 24-Parganas district secretariat at Alimuddin Street this morning. Chief minister Bhattacharjee and state secretary Biman Bose were present during the discussions.        
	Asked about the action, Bose said: Both of them were removed from the district committee for breach of discipline and for not adhering to party policies. Our party works like that.         
	According to a state secretariat member, Mukherjee, who hails from the Khardah area, has been demoted from the district committee to the zonal committee while Das has been made an ordinary member.        
	Ranjit will no longer hold any elected post in any CPM body. Kalyan will function as a zonal committee member, the leader said.        
	Speaking at the rally in Barrackpore in North 24-Parganas  a district where the CPM lost all five Lok Sabha seats in last years Lok Sabha polls  Bhattacharjee had asked leaders with hot heads to get out.        
	 Many of our party functionaries and workers have done things which the people have not accepted. They have been arrogant and bossy. If there is a mistake, one has to take lessons with heads bowed. Those with hot heads should get out.        
	The Barrackpore strongman and ex-MP Tarit Topdar was among those seen as a possible target of the chief ministers warning.        
	Sources in the CPM said Alimuddin Street had been getting complaints that Mukherjee had not worked in the partys interests in the last Lok Sabha elections and this years municipal polls. Also under the glare was his alleged nexus with promoters.         
	Das was found to have remained largely inactive as a district committee leader and had inappropriately acquired money which weakened the organisation.        
	We have lost considerable ground in the Baranagar-Kamarhati belt since the last Lok Sabha polls. Ranjitbabu weakened the organisation and was preoccupied with activities that had no connection with the party. Kalyan used his party clout to get favours from contractors and promoters. The party earned a bad name in the Khardah-Sodepur area as he misused his party position, a source added.

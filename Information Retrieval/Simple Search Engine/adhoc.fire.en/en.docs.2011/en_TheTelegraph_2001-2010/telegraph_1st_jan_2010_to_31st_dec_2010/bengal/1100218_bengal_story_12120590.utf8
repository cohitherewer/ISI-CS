          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                    
	Calcutta, Feb. 17: Eastern Frontier Rifles officers had told the government several times to shift the Shilda camp from the crowded marketplace for security reasons.         
	We had written to the government several times to shift the camp to an isolated place but nothing was done, said a senior officer.         
	We had two main concerns. First, in an area teeming with people, police would have to restrain themselves while retaliating in case of an attack to minimise civilian casualties; second, the Maoists could easily mingle with the civilians and the police would not be able to distinguish one from the other.        
	Inspector-general, western range, Kuldiep Singh, confirmed that such a request had been made. Yes, its true that the EFR authorities had asked us to find an alternative place for the Shilda camp but such things take time to get done. Finding a suitable site and getting the land is a time-consuming process.         
	Singh said the process of finding the land had started but, unfortunately, the attack took place before anything concrete emerged.        
	Vivek Sahay, the inspector-general (armed police) under whom EFR falls (the special IG, EFR, reports to him), said he was stunned that the Shilda camp had continued to be in the midst of the crowded bazaar for two years. The security of the personnel was at stake from the very beginning. How could a camp be set up at a place to which everybody had access? he asked.         
	The police and the people shared a toilet inside the camp. Sahay, who visited the camp yesterday, added: Despite several intimations, the camp was not shifted. I learnt that the district authorities were trying to find a suitable plot to shift it.        
	Singh, too, agreed that the camp should not have been set up at the primary health centre in Shilda. The camp was vulnerable, Singh said. We were not satisfied with the security of the camp.         
	Now that the Shilda camp has been dismantled, Singh said land for the alternative site had to be acquired expeditiously.        
	We have identified a site near Shilda but the land there is yet to be acquired, Singh said. It is in a secluded place and so the defences would be much better and the camp would be more secure.         
	The bazaar allegedly had another crippling effect on many of the personnel. The bustling spirit of the area lulled the policemen into a sense of complacency, an officer said. It was a nice happy-go-lucky place with couples roaming around, people shopping and shops all around. It is hardly the kind of place where one would expect an attack of the nature of the one on Monday.        
	The officer said the police had realised that the camp would be difficult to secure.         
	He also said that it was so typical of the government to act only after the harm had been done.         
	This has repeatedly happened all across the state. Only when there has been an attack and killings has the state acted.

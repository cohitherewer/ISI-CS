The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Concern, not crackdown   Simply a case of murder: Govt
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Concern, not crackdown   Simply a case of murder: Govt
          OUR BUREAU                          Policemen and people who had come to attend the rally run away while Madan Tamang is being attacked . Picture by Suman Tamang                                        
	May 21: The Bengal government today said it had asked the Darjeeling administration to arrest the culprits behind Madan Tamangs murder, but gave enough indication that, like in the recent past, it would not take any action that could precipitate the situation in the hills.        
	After a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, both home secretary Samar Ghosh and director-general of police Bhupinder Singh made it clear the sensitive hill situation would have to be handled carefully.         
	We have sent additional state forces to Darjeeling, Ghosh said.         
	Strict vigil has to be maintained so that clashes or killings do not occur. But we also have to make sure the police do not do anything that can be termed excesses. After all, the situation in the hills is sensitive. We are treating this incident simply as a case of murder. So, only the standard operational procedure will be followed.        
	The government is aware that the situation is tricky as Tamangs alleged killers are Morcha supporters and it would not want to do anything hasty that could derail the ongoing talks to end the hill impasse. As it is, the talks are stuck over the dispute on territory. If the state does anything that upsets the Morcha, it could jeopardise the talks further, an official said.         
	It is important to measure the cost of action.         
	Underlining what Ghosh said, state police chief Singh stressed there had been no breakdown in law and order in the hills and there was no need to react to it as such. Its a case of two political parties combating each other, Singh said.         
	It is not that some ethnic or communal clashes have broken out. Only if there is a law-and-order breakdown will the government crack down. But that is not the case. There are no reports of clashes after the incident.        
	In Delhi, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, too, indicated that normality had to prevail and the tripartite talks had to go forward. Our main priority will be to keep the national highways which pass through Darjeeling district open as they are vital to our sec-urity they connect Sikkim and Bhutan, Mukherjee told The Telegraph. Im worried about the violence spreading in the hills.        
	Mukherjee said the talks with the Gorkha (Janmukti Morcha) leaders would continue. In the long run, some more autonomy may be granted but neither a separate province nor extended territory for Gorkhaland is possible. Darjeeling is a strategic area and a perpetual solution through dialogue is the only way out.        
	In Calcutta, minister of state for hill affairs Asok Bhattacharya, one of the states two representatives at the political-level tripartite talks, lashed out at the Morcha, holding it responsible for Tamangs murder. The Morcha killed Tamang in a pre-planned manner as he had called for the restoration of democracy in the hills.        
	On the future of the tripartite talks, Bhattacharya said: Tripartite meetings cannot be held at gunpoint or with those who have blood on their hands. Todays incident will surely have an impact on such meetings.         
	However, Ghosh cautioned against jumping to any con- clusions.         
	Well go by what the Centre says, the home secretary said. Todays incident is definitely undesirable but the agenda for the tripartite meeting is different.        
	In Delhi, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai admitted that the bloodshed would impact the talks atmosphere. It (the murder) vitiates the atmosphere for talks. There is a need for people to keep calm and work towards a peaceful solution and all sides need to maintain peace, he said.        
	North Bengal inspector- general of police K.L. Tamta said three companies of the CRPF were heading to Darjee-ling to ensure normality in the hills.

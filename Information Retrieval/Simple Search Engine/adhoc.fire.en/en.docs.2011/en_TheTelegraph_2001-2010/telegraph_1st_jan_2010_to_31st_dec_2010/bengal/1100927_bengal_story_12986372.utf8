The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Abductors in net,   thank Kaho Naa
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Abductors in net,   thank Kaho Naa
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           A poster of Kaho NaaPyaar Hai, a scene from which helped police set up the cellphone trap to catch the abductors                                        
	Durgapur, Sept. 26: Played last night on a Jharkhand highway: a Hrithik Roshan mobile trick from Kaho NaaPyaar Hai. The scene over, an Asansol kidnapper was in the net.        
	The cast included a posse of Kaho Naa-smitten Jharkhand cops who decided the 2000 blockbuster was worth too much to remain just on the screen and in DVDs. It should be brought to life in a reel-to-real adaptation to catch a runaway abductor fleeing with his hostage, a 21-year-old college girl who had spurned his advances.        
	Jharkhand police only had the cellphone number of the alleged kidnapper, Akash Singh, when they began stopping every car on a stretch of National Highway 2 near Hazaribaghs Barhi coming from the direction of Asansol.        
	The girl, a third-year BA student, had been kidnapped from the Bengal town while she was on way to tuition with a friend in a bus yesterday afternoon. Bengal police had only passed on the number of the accused, not photos, apparently for lack of time.        
	The Jharkhand team stopped each car and dialled Akashs number that Asansol police had provided them. They let several vehicles pass but after almost an hour of the dial-and-scan drill, they stopped a white Indica. Then, when a policeman called the number, a phone rang. The Kaho Naa gamble had worked.        
	Akash was arrested along with friend Sanjay Yadav and their associate Ranjit Singh, as was the driver of the hired Indica. All the four accused and the girl  the daughter of a cloth trader  are residents of Asansol.        
	A Jharkhand officer said the way the abductors were caught was similar to the way Hrithiks character identified Anupam Kher, who played a villain, in the movie. We saw in that film how Hrithik dialled the number of Kher without knowing he was the villain. When Khers phone rang, he was identified, said the officer.        
	But the ploy may not be a foolproof way to track fugitives. Fortunately for us, Akash had not switched off his mobile. If he had, it would have been very difficult for us to trace them, said the officer. The trick would not have worked in another situation too: if Akash had kept his phone in silent mode.        
	Asansol additional superintendent of police Prasun Banerjee said they had got the number from Akashs father Ram Singh and brother Bipin, who were detained hours after the kidnapping yesterday. We tracked Akashs phone and located it near Dhanbad first and Barhi later. We sought the Hazaribagh police chiefs help, said Banerjee, adding they wanted to get on the abductors trail fast and there was too little time to send photos.        
	A 9mm pistol and a double-barrel gun were found inside the Indica, prompting the police to also charge the kidnappers under the arms act. The girl was kept last night at Barhi police station and handed over today to her parents who reached there with the officer in charge of Asansol (south) police station, Biplab Pati.        
	Police said Sanjay was a known thug in Asansols Dhadka area. Sanjay was earlier arrested in connection with snatching cases. Akash is also a rowdy. He had seen the girl at her cousins house a month back and was attracted to her. Since then, Akash tried to pressure her into a relationship. When the girl rejected his advances, he decided to kidnap her, said Banerjee.        
	The girls father, Pramode Singh, thanked the police on both sides. We are happy to get our daughter back and thank the police for their prompt action, Pramode said over the phone from Barhi, around 150km from Asansol, this morning.        
	The girl had been kidnapped from the bus near Asansol railway station by the youths, one of whom put a pistol to the drivers head while the others dragged her out and put her into a car.

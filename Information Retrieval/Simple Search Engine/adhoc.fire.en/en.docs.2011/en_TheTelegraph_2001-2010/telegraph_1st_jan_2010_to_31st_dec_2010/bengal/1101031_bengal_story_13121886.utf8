The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Didi call for industry
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Didi call for industry
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Andal, Oct. 30: Mamata Banerjee today predicted a shilpo biplab (industrial revolution) in the state while announcing a host of railway projects at programme in Burdwans Andal.        
	Industry banchle shobai banchbe (if industry survives, everyone else will), the railway minister told a gathering of 15,000 people. Shilpe sona pholbe. Banglay shilpo biplab hobe (Industry will strike gold. There will be an industrial revolution in Bengal), the Trinamul chief said after listing proposed railway projects.        
	Mamata flagged off a wagon-making factory in Kulti, 45km from Andal, through remote control. The factory, a joint venture of RITES, a railway organisation, and SAIL, will have the capacity to manufacture 1,200 wagons a year and repair 300.         
	Todays public meeting was attended by Union steel minister Birbhadra Singh and SAIL chairman C.S. Verma.        
	Mamata also announced expansion plans for the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works. She said Rs 134 crore would be spent to implement the plan.        
	She had something for Andal too. Do you want a project for Andal? Mamata asked the crowd. Yes, came the thunderous reply. The railway minister then promised a bogey-making unit in Andal and proposed that SAIL be part of it. The impromptu announcement left the railway officials at the programme a little flustered. We will plan something, one of them said.         
	Alluding to the forcible acquisition of land in Singur, Mamata took a dig at the Left Front government and the chief minister. You cant do industry with rifles and the mafia, she said. You must know how to do it (industrialisation). You should have the right temperament to work.        
	Why should our boys go out of the state to work elsewhere? We should create jobs so that they can come back.        
	She obliquely criticised the state government for failing to stop illegal mining in the Durgapur-Asansol coal belt. If there are jobs, poor people will not risk their lives and engage in illegal mining, she said.        
	Rail power pact        
	The railways, in the presence of Mamata, will tomorrow sign a memorandum of understanding with the NTPC to set up a 1,320MW power plant at Purulias Adra to provide electricity to run trains. The event will take place at Anara near Adra.

	Calcutta, Aug. 19: The Central Administrative Tribunal today set aside the promotion of four inspectors-general of police, one of them in charge of the chief ministers security, on the ground that they had superseded two IPS officers.        
	Anil Kumar, the inspector-general (welfare), and R.J.S. Nalwa, the inspector-general (telecom), had been overlooked by the state government while announcing promotions to the post of additional director-general, their counsel Sardar Amjad Ali said.         
	Ali said the two IPS officers were senior to A. K. Maliwal, the chief ministers director (security), Ranjit Pachnanda, special commissioner of Calcutta police (I), Banibrata Basu, special commissioner of Calcutta police (II), and Raj Kanojia, additional director-general (CID). The state government has not furnished reasons for which my clients were superseded, Ali added.

          ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR                              
	Tamluk, April 26: The government has transferred the responsibilities of 67 gram panchayats where work has come to a standstill because of Maoist problems or political disturbance to the respective block development officers.        
	Of the 67 panchayats, 60 are in Maoist-hit West Midnapore and Bankura, while the seven others are in East Midnapore.        
	Panchayat and rural development minister Anisur Rahman said these panchayats were not being able to function for about a year now. As a result, development work is being affected. In West Midnapore, and Bankura, work has come to a standstill because of Maoist activities. In East Midnapore, some panchayats in Khejuri cannot function because of political turmoil, he added.        
	Panchayat secretary M.N. Roy sent a circular to the three districts on April 16, saying: All relevant programmes/schemes sponsored by the Centre or the state government for economic or social development entrusted upon those gram panchayats shall be implemented by the relevant block development officers.        
	In West Midnapore, 35 gram panchayats  in Binpur I and II, Nayagram, Jamboni, Jhargram, Midnapore Sadar and Garbeta II blocks  feature on the list.         
	The Dherua gram panchayat in Midnapore Sadar, for example, has been locked for several months. The Maoists have asked me to quit the CPM. When I refused, they threatened to kill me. So, I have stopped going to the panchayat office, said Bulbul Chowbey, the CPM panchayat pradhan.        
	Maoists torched the CPM-run Makli panchayat office in Garbeta II six months ago. The office was shifted to a school last month, but Im not going. How can I? I feel insecure, said pradhan Jaba Murmu.         
	In Jhargrams Jamboni, CPM pradhan Karunasindhu Mahato, was shot dead six months ago. BDO Sukumar Baidya said the deputy chief had been formally asked to take Mahatos place. But he fled. Three other panchayat members have resigned.        
	In Bankura, 25 gram panchayats in Sarenga, Raipur and Ranibandh blocks are on the list.         
	In East Midnapores Khe- juri, seven panchayats are defunct because leaders have fled homes after alleged Trinamul attacks since last years Lok Sabha elections.

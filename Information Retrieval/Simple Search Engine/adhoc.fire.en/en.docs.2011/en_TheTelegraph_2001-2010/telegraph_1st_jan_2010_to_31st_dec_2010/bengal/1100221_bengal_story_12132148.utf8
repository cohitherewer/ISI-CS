	Calcutta, Feb. 20: An indecent gesture allegedly made by a student during yesterdays college polls at Presidency sparked violence on the campus today as SFI and Independents Consolidation (IC) supporters clashed for over an hour, injuring one.         
	The elections, which saw the SFI retain control of the college union, had passed off peacefully yesterday.         
	But today, while polls to elect office-bearers were on, clashes broke out after SFI supporters beat up Debarshi Chakraborty, an IC sympathiser who had allegedly made the obscene gesture at some some members of the CPM students wing.        
	Debarshi, who suffered head injuries, was taken to hospital.         
	SFI and IC supporters hurled bricks at each other but no one was seriously injured.        
	Although principal Sanjib Ghosh had ordered that no outsider should be allowed to enter the college, former students were seen entering and leaving the campus at will, some even climbing over the closed gates to join the clashes.

	We have been complaining about the entry of outsiders for long. Even today, former students entered the campus, an IC supporter said.         
	Police had to be called in to separate the warring sides. The cops, after whose intervention the situation was brought under control, however, did not resort to a cane-charge. We need orders from college authorities to take action inside the campus, a police officer said.        
	The principal and other college staff looked from the first-floor balcony as the rival groups clashed.        
	Ghosh, however, denied any knowledge of the ruckus inside the campus.                    An IC supporter being restrained by a friend during the clash with the SFI at Presidency College    
	No instances of violence have been reported since yesterday till 2.30pm today. We received complaints from the IC against a few students for beating up one of their supporters. I dont know what happened today, the principal said.         
	IC supporter Anindya Nandi said: We have submitted a written complaint to the principal against SFI supporters Stotro Chakraborty, Debarja Biswas and Sushanta Poddar for beating up Debarshi and asked for immediate action.        
	I have forwarded the complaint to the police, Ghosh said. I have also received a complaint from Richa Gupta, an SFI supporter, that she had been physically assaulted on Friday. I will forward this complaint to the police too, Ghosh added.         
	The principal alleged that he had received a threat call. I received such calls earlier also but had ignored them. This time I have decided to inform the police.         
	Ghosh said a disciplinary committee would act on the complaints received.                    IC supporters block the gate of Presidency College.   (Picture by Bishwarup Dutta)    
	SFI supporters denied involvement in the violence. The IC is creating an issue out of an accident. We were not involved in any violence. They are making false allegations, said Tanmay Burman, an SFI spokesperson.         
	Arindam Mondal, of the botany department, has been elected general secretary.         
	Sociology student Madhurima Ghosh, who was elected secretary of the girls common room, was the only IC member in the newly formed union.

  - Poverty prompts adoption procedure labelled illegal          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                    Alaka Maity. (Jahangir Badsa)    
	Tamluk, May 12: A poverty-stricken woman in East Midnapore who has been separated from her husband for two years has given away both her sons to two families for Rs 10,000, with authorities claiming the adoption procedure is illegal.        
	Alaka Maity, 29, who has been staying with her brothers and farm labourer father in Tamluk since her separation, admitted that she had given away her sons, aged eight and four years, for Rs 7,000 and Rs 3,000 respectively.         
	Alaka, however, claimed that she had not sold her sons, Shantanu and Suvro (names changed), but given them for adoption to the two families which did not have a son. She said she had made a notarised affidavit.         
	District welfare officer Swapan Ghosh said the way in which the two children had been handed over to the couples is illegal. Ghosh said he would investigate the matter. If it is found that the woman (Alaka) is indeed so poor that she cannot bring up her children, the kids will be sent to a government home, he added.        
	District magistrate Archana said she had ordered a probe. I have sought a report from the district welfare department, she said.        
	Alaka claimed she left her husband Bapi Maitys home as he was a drunkard and used to beat her up regularly.         
	Shantanu studies in Class II while his younger brother Suvro was recently admitted to a primary school.        
	My father is a farm labourer and my two younger brothers are cycle van-pullers. It was becoming very difficult for them to maintain me and my children. That is why I gave my kids to two families for adoption. I took money from them to repay my debts, Alaka said.        
	Jeweller Amiruddin Khan, 30, a resident of Daspur in West Midnapore who has adopted Shantanu, said: My son died soon after birth. So I wanted a son. When I heard from a relative that Alaka wanted to give away her children, I approached her. I paid her Rs 7,000, said Khan, who took the boy away today.        
	Ten days ago, Manik Adak, 32, a resident of Radhaballavpur in Tamluk, had taken Alakas younger son.        
	But Adak, a contract labourer at the Indian Oil refinery in Haldia, denied having paid any money to Alaka.         
	I wanted a son badly and I liked Suvro at first sight. So I adopted the child. However, I did not pay any money to Alaka, Manik said.        
	The matter brings to light how the lawyers authorised by the government to act as notaries often put their official seal on the affidavit without reading the content.        
	A notary is authorised to put his official seal on affidavits requesting change of names and surnames, or the declaration of lost documents.        
	Murari Maity, the notary who put his seal on the adoption of Shantanu and Suvro, refused comment.        
	Kamal Das, the president of the bar association of the district, said: Adoption can be done by filing an affidavit with the notary. They should minutely read all affidavits and other documents before putting their seal on it. We appeal to the lawyers who function as notary to be more careful.        
	District welfare officer Ghosh said children could not be taken for adoption directly from their parents. Adoption is a lengthy process. There is a child welfare committee in every district which handles adoption, he said.        
	Ghosh said that if anyone wished to adopt a child, he/she would have to apply to the district child welfare committee.         
	The committee will then investigate whether the person is financially capable of taking responsibility of a child. If the committee finds the candidate suitable, it will recommend him/her. After adoption, the candidate will be observed for three years. If it is found that the child is not being brought up well, then he/she will be taken away from the adoptive parents and put in a government home, Ghosh said.

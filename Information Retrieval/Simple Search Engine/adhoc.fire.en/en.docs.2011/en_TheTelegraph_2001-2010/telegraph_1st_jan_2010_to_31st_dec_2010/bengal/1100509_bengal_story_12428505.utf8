The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tax plan for IPL tickets
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Tax plan for IPL tickets
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, May 8: The Bengal government is contemplating a special amusement tax on IPL tickets next year.        
	Sports minister Kanti Ganguly has submitted to the chief minister a proposal to tax tickets for IPL IV as the (Twenty20) game is no longer sports only, but entertainment too.         
	The Maharashtra government today announced taxes between 15 and 24 per cent on IPL tickets next year.        
	Asked about the development, Ganguly said: The frenzy surrounding IPL matches shows people are ready to pay regardless of ticket prices. The IPL is a commercial venture and should be treated like that. Thats why, I had written to the chief minister 15 days ago proposing the tax on IPL tickets.        
	The chief minister has not yet responded to the proposal.        
	Ganguly also wants a tax on high-priced tickets for other cricket matches. I have also proposed to the chief minister that tickets for non-IPL cricket matches that are high-priced should be taxed. Tickets that attract the tax could be those priced at Rs 500 or more, but thats up to the chief minister to decide.        
	Asked about the move, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said: We had thought about it almost a month ago. We had also planned to promulgate an ordinance. But now we are thinking of introducing a bill in the Assembly once its session recommences in June. We want to describe the proposed legislation as a special amusement tax on high-value tickets.         
	The sports minister said the revenue could be spent on the development of sports infrastructure. If one ticket in the VVIP gallery is priced at Rs 32,000, the tax will yield a considerable revenue.        
	The Maharashtra move came two days after Bombay High Court ordered that NCP chief Sharad Pawar be made a respondent to the petition filed by a Shiv Sena leader questioning the states decision to exempt the cash-rich league from entertainment tax. The petition alleged that the Congress-NCP government had taken a decision to tax IPL III in January but held it back under pressure from Pawar.         
	The CAG had earlier said the state had lost Rs 5 crore in revenues by exempting the IPL from entertainment tax.

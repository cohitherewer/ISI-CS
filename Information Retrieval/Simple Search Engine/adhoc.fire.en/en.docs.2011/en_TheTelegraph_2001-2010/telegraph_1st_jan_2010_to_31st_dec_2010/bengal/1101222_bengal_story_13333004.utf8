The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shiver spell in south Bengal
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Shiver spell in south Bengal
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 21: A sharp Celsius drop over north and central India has resulted in a cold wave in four south Bengal districts, which could spread to other parts of south Bengal over the next 24 hours.        
	Meteorologists attributed the chill to cold winds from the north and the northwest, which are blowing in after passing through vast stretches of north and central India experiencing a cold wave.        
	The northerlies and the northwesterlies are cold and dry. But they usually lose much of their sting by the time they reach south Bengal, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).         
	However, over the last couple of days, the north wind has been colder than usual while blowing over south Bengal. Its journey over the cold wave-hit north and central India has been making it colder, he explained.        
	Bankura, Burdwan, Purulia and West Midnapore were already experiencing cold wave conditions today, with temperatures in many places dipping to the 10-degree mark or below. The coldest was Bankura, which recorded a minimum of 6.5 degrees Celsius, the lowest in 18 years.         
	The ongoing cold wave in the four districts will continue. In the next 24 hours, the conditions might spread to other districts, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, director of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The weatherman said the cold wave might spread to districts like Birbhum, Murshidabad, Malda and North Dinajpur tomorrow.        
	Calcutta, however, is not likely to experience a cold wave during the current phase.        
	The minimum in Calcutta for this time of the year is 14 degrees Celsius. For a cold wave to set in, the minimum temperature has to drop to 9 degrees or below. That is extremely unlikely at the moment, Debnath told The Telegraph.        
	The minimum recorded at Alipore today was 13.2 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. The minimum at Dum Dum was also a degree below normal at 11.8 degrees Celsius.        
	Parts of the city are experiencing a minimum of 12 degrees or just below. The minimum could drop by another degree in the next 24 hours, said Debnath.

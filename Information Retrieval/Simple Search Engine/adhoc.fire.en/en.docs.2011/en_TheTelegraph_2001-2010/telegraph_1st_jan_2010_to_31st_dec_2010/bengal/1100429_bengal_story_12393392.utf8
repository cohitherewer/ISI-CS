          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chatterjee after releasing the list. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	Calcutta, April 28: The Trinamul Congress tonight announced candidates for 115 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporations 141 wards, leaving 25 for the Congress and one for the SUCI.         
	Stunned by the sudden announcement, at a time discussions were on over their demand for 51 wards, Congress leaders called it a one-sided decision and sent an SOS seeking state party chief Pranab Mukherjees intervention.        
	This is a one-sided decision by our ally and unacceptable, which is why we have sought Pranabbabus intervention, said central Calcutta Congress president Pradip Ghosh, who had been overseeing the seat-sharing talks. We have also sent Pranabbabu a list of 83 wards where we are confident of winning on our own. But the final decision rests with Pranabbabu.        
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya refused comment.        
	While releasing the Trinamul list, party secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said it was the final one. We have waited and discussed at length at Mamatas level and all issues had been taken up, Chatterjee said.         
	Since the last date for filing nominations, May 3, is approaching, we have decided to announce the final list. We have already offered 25 seats to the Congress. Keeping Mamata Banerjee at the helm, we must ride this wave of change and keep a united front. There should be no straining of relationship (with the Congress) and keeping the honour and faith of the people we should jointly defeat the Left Front. We hope good sense will prevail and the Congress will join us in defeating the Left Front.        
	Todays list did not name a candidate for mayor, but party sources said the scales were tipped in favour of councillor and Ballygunge MLA Javed Khan.         
	The announcement of the mayoral candidate has been kept in abeyance, Chatterjee said. Let us first win the polls... then we will decide who will be the mayor.        
	Of the 115 candidates, 50 are women and 23 from the minority community, including Rizwanur Rahmans brother Rukbanur. The list includes another MLA, Firad (Bobby) Hakim, and former mayor-in-council member Sovan Chatterjee.

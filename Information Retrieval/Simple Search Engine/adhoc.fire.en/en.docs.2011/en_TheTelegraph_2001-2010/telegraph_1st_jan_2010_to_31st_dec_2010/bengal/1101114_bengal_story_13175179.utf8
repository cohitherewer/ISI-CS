          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Nov. 13: A youth who had been in jail on the charge of raping a child four years ago allegedly strangled the girl, now 11, last evening after receiving bail.        
	Prasanta Santra, 25, son of a local CPM leader, had been behind bars as an under-trial since 2006. The girl was to depose in the case a few days later. Prasanta allegedly murdered her at her home in Burdwans Kalna and hung the body with a sari from the ceiling to make it look like a suicide. He is in hiding.        
	Police started a murder case after the girls uncle, Sukumar Dhara, lodged a complaint saying he had seen Prasanta run out of the house last evening. I went to my nieces room and saw her hanging, Dhara said.        
	The police have questioned Prasantas father Sukumar Santra. The girls father, Ashoke, has been in hiding since 2000 after allegedly killing his wife.

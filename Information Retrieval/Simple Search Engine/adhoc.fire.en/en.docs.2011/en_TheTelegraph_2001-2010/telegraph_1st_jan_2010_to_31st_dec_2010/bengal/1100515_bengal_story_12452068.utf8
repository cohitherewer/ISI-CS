          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, May 14: The mother who had given away her sons to two families for Rs 10,000 was arrested today on charges of human trafficking following a complaint by her estranged husband .         
	Alaka Maity, 29, had left her husband two years ago because he was allegedly a drunk who beat her up regularly. The woman, who lives with her farmhand father, had sold off her sons, aged eight and four, for Rs 7,000 and Rs 3,000, because she could not bring them up properly.        
	But a court here today sent Alaka to 14 days police custody and gave the children to their father, Bapi, who had allegedly never enquired about them in two years.         
	Under the law, a father is a legal guardian and can claim custody of his children. So the judge gave the children to him instead of sending them to a home, said additional public prosecutor Safiul Ali Khan.        
	Farm labourer Bapi said Alaka had left him after a fight two years ago. I didnt interfere in her life after that because my sons were staying at their maternal grandpas house.

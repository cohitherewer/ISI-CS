	Calcutta, March 27: Former Bengal chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray was admitted to a city nursing home today after he complained of uneasiness and body ache.        
	Jayanta Basu, the doctor attending to him, said: He is stable and clinically all right. (But) he has kidney and heart problems. His sugar level is also high. You have to consider his age. Ray, 89, fell at home last week and had been suffering from the body ache since.

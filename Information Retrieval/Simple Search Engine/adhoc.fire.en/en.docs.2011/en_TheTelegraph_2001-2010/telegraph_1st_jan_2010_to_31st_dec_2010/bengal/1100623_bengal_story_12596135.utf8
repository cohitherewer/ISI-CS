          OUR BUREAU                                               
	June 22: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today announced a 48-hour bandh relaxation starting 6am tomorrow and shifted its lathi-wielding volunteers from some of the government buildings they had been occupying, the conciliatory gestures coming within hours.         
	Its general secretary, Roshan Giri, said late tonight that the relief would last till 6am on Friday.         
	It was made so that people are not inconvenienced, Giri said, hours after the Morcha had threatened to strictly enforce the indefinite strike across the hills.         
	A sign that the Morcha was more keen to avoid a confrontation with the administration than ever before was evident when members of the Gorkhaland Personnel started vacating some of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) properties late last night.        
	However, the outfit tried to give the impression that it had not given up, saying it would not move out of the buildings that were better located.         
	Col (retd) Ramesh Allay, the president of the volunteer force, said the camps at Deolo, Relli, Kafer, Pedong and Algarah had already been vacated.         
	At Deolo, 5km from Kalimpong town, Kafer, 55km away, and Relli, 11km from Kalimpong, the Morcha had been occupying DGHC tourist lodges.         
	At Pedong and Algarah, it had taken over two government offices lying unused for years.        
	There were 49 Gorkhaland Personnel camps in the hills and seven of them were housed in DGHC buildings.         
	Four of them  Parijat Lodge and Dalim Fort in Gorubathan, Tribeni Lodge in Rongli-Rongliot and Roy Villa in Darjeeling  are still under Morcha occupation.         
	DGHC administrator B.L. Meena had filed FIRs against the volunteer force for occupying the seven properties.                         File picture of a Morcha volunteer at the Deolo lodge       
	Morcha sources said the reason the volunteers were being moved out was the urgency to dissociate with any confrontation or violence in the aftermath of the murder of ABGL leader Madan Tamang. The hill party has been accused of masterminding it.        
	The backlash after Tamangs death has been contained to a large extent and the Morcha does not want to get into a situation which might lead to a confrontation with the government and end in violence, a leader said. The government should also reciprocate this gesture by not insisting that the GLP moves out of the other properties.        
	The administration indicated the Morcha had no option but to vacate all the buildings. Action will be taken against all illegal occupants, district police chief D.P. Singh said.        
	K.L. Tamta, the out-going north Bengal inspector-general of police, had warned the squatters that they risked being arrested.

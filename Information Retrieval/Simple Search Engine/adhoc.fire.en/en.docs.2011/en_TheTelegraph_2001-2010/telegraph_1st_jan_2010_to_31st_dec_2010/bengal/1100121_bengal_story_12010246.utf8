          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Jan. 20: Police today claimed to have seized a laptop and a hearing aid belonging to Maoist leader Kishanji, who apparently had a narrow escape when the joint forces swooped down on a forest about 25km from Lalgarh.        
	Five single-barrel guns, a pipe gun, an improvised explosive device, 41 rounds of ammunition, a transistor, clothes, medicines, Maoist literature and leaflets were put on display along with a laptop bag this evening at the West Midnapore police chiefs office.         
	We narrowly missed Kishanji, but seized his laptop and hearing aid. The laptop is important as we believe we will find a lot of information stored in it. It is being sent to experts in the CID, superintendent Manoj Verma said.        
	About 400 personnel led by the presidency range DIG, S.N. Gupta, and Verma had raided the jungles of Hatiashole yesterday morning. The raid continued till this morning.         
	Three encounters took place. In a clearing in the forest, we found the seized items. They left these behind in their hurry to escape, Verma said.        
	In Lalgarh, two women were detained today while allegedly heading to a Maoist indoctrination camp. Their husbands had allegedly been arrested earlier on the charge of being Maoists. The police have denied the arrests.

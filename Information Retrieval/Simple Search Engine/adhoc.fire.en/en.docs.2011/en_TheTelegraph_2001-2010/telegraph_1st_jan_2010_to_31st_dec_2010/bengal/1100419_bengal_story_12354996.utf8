          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raiganj, April 18: Panchayat members of storm-hit North Dinajpur are fleeing from homeless villagers who are beating them up for relief that has not arrived in five days since the calamity left 42 dead and 1.5 lakh homeless.         
	Last night, a group thrashed the CPM panchayat member of Karandighi I, Manilal Singh, and local CPM leader Manik Das. Both of them have fled their homes since.        
	If relief minister Mortaza Hossain had faced angry villagers in Hemtabad block, 15km from here, yesterday, civil de- fence minister Srikumar Mukherjee and animal resource development minister Narayan Biswas encountered them today.        
	The CPM leader in charge of relief in the Karandighi panchayat samiti, Karuna Dasgupta, said it was not possible to distribute relief to everybody all at once. She said Singh and Das were punched and kicked and left with bleeding noses.         
	Other panchayat members like Tamu Biswas have chosen to play it safe. More than 1,100 houses have been destroyed in my area and only 400 tarpaulin sheets have been distributed. I decided to leave home and stay with a relative as it began raining last evening, said Biswas, a Forward Bloc member of Altapur I gram panchayat.        
	Fazlur Rahman, a Bloc member of the Lahutpara I gram panchayat in the same block, said: My house was one of the few unscathed. I fear an attack if the villagers are forced to stay out in the open and brave the rain, so I fled.

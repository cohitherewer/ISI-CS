          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has finally managed to bring boycotting Trinamul Congress legislators into the Assembly, albeit unwittingly and fleetingly.        
	The chief minister told the House today that the principal Oppositions demand to withdraw central forces from Jungle Mahal would lead to a dangerous situation in the state.         
	The immediate provocation for the remark could be the Trinamul chiefs announcement at yesterdays martyrs day rally that she had requested the Prime Minister to remove 35 companies of the central forces engaged in anti-Maoist operations.         
	Bhattacharjee then claimed that many of the arrested Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities members are Trinamul activists.        
	The Trinamul MLAs, who heard the chief ministers allegations and accusations on the loudspeakers installed in their House chambers, then rushed into the Assembly, led by Partha Chatterjee, and started protesting. We are astonished that the chief minister has not been able to read the writing on the wall yet. He is trying to malign the character of our leader Mamata Banerjee, Chatterjee shouted.         
	You (Bhattacharjee) should admit in the Assembly that you are unable to look after the state, he added.        
	When the chief minister offered to ask Chatterjee two questions in response to his tirade, the Trinamul leader shot back: You dont have to respond. You please get out.         
	As barbs flew, the two leaders unknowingly played out the Question Hour ritual too.         
	Bhattacharjee asked Chatterjee if it was correct that Trinamul had requested the Centre to withdraw 35 companies of central forces involved in the joint operations against the Maoists. Is it correct? Bhattacharjee asked. It is correct. We are fully justified, Chatterjee answered.        
	Pat came the chief ministers next question: Do you or do you not have direct contact with Chhatradhars committee? The reference was to arrested Peoples Committee leader Chhatradhar Mahato.         
	The Trinamul MLAs then tore business papers and walked out of the Assembly as the Left members erupted in laughter.         
	Mamata challenge        
	Mamata today said she would hold a rally in Lalgarh on August 9 and apparently dared the state administration to prevent me.         
	I am a citizen of a democratic country. Why should I not be allowed to visit Lalgarh? Is a battle going on there? I will hold a rally there. Lets see who can prevent me, Mamata said. The chief minister said in the Assembly today that meetings were not allowed in Lalgarh, where Section 144 was in place.

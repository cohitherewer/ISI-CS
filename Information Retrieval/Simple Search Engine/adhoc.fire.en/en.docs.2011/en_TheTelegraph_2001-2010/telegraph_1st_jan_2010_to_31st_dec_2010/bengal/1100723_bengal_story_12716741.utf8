          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Students protest teachers absence at a Lalgarh school on Thursday. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, July 22: Residents of a Jhargram village today chased away a group of Maoists and Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities activists who had ordered them to take part in a procession at gun point.        
	The 20-strong group had assembled on a school playground at Radhanagar village around 2pm and asked students and villagers to join their procession. The rebels were armed with revolvers and bombs.         
	However, the villagers refused. We told them that we had other work and our children had to study, said Banamali Mahato, a villager.        
	When the Maoists pulled out their guns, around 200 angry villagers chased them away. The rebels and Peoples Committee members hurled bombs and fired in the air while fleeing.         
	Praveen Tripathi, the superintendent of Jhargram (district) police, said that over the past two days, Maoists and Peoples Committee activists had been trying to force villagers to take part in processions demanding the withdrawal of the joint forces.         
	This is the first time that villagers have refused to join a Peoples Committee or Maoist rally, Tripathi said.        
	School protest        
	The students of a Lalgarh school yesterday locked their classrooms to protest the absence of most of the teachers in the past three days.         
	The students of Gohomidanga High School also alleged that the authorities had not let them participate in a football match the police had organised in Lalgarh on Monday. Around 700 students today opened the locks following a request from headmaster Nemai Patra.        
	The authorities said most of the 21 teachers could not come to school because of a roadblock organised by the Peoples Committee in the area. The students refused to buy the argument, saying that if we can come, the teachers should also turn up.        
	Patra said he did not take the risk of allowing the students to participate in the football match, held to wean local youths away from the Maoists, because the managing committee had told him he should take responsibility if anything happened.

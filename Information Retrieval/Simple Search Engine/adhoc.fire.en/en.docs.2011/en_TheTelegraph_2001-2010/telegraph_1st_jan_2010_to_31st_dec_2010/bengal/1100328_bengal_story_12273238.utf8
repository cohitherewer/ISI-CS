                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul beats up engineer
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, March 27: A group of Trinamul Congress supporters today pushed and punched a deputy chief engineer of the Dankuni Coal Complex when he went to plead with them to join work instead of holding a demonstration.         
	Churamoni Seth, 52, was taken to the coal complex hospital with a profusely bleeding nose.         
	Dankuni is only about 20km from Singur, from where a Trinamul-led agitation had forced Tata Motors to pack up.         
	However, eager now to prove that she is not anti-industry, Mamata Banerjee tonight cancelled the partys affiliation to those who had spearheaded the agitation. We dont approve of such violent activities in factories. We have dissociated ourselves from the Dankuni Coal Complex Contractors Labour Union that spearheaded todays violence and expelled (from Trinamul) its secretary Somnath Bag, said Bidyut Raut, Trinamuls trade union cell chief in Hooghly district.         
	Police said the trouble started around 11.30am when about 100 members of the Trinamul union stopped work and started a sit-in demanding permanent jobs.         
	When Seth protested the ceasework, the workers shoved him and hit him. They also ransacked his office, smashed furniture and windowpanes and damaged his jeep.         
	When police arrived, the protesters threw stones at them. Three cops were injured.        
	Seventeen people, including Bag, have been arrested.        
	Serampore subdivisional police officer Kankar Prasad Barui said a case had been registered on the basis of Seths complaint.

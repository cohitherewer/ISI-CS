The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Suman falls into text trap
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Suman falls into text trap
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 30: The Trinamul Congress parliamentary party sought Kabir Sumans disqualification from the Lok Sabha a day after he sent a text message to Mamata Banerjee offering to quit Parliament and the party.        
	The Jadavpur MP had also sent the same message to Trinamul chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay after a tiff with party workers in South 24-Parganas Narendrapur yesterday.         
	We have written to the Lok Sabha Speaker quoting Kabir Sumans text message to me and Mamata for his disqualification as MP. We have requested the Speaker to treat his message as resignation and the formal letter on this will follow, Bandopadhyay said from Delhi tonight.        
	Told that Speaker Meira Kumar was away in Bangkok to attend the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting, Bandopadhyay said the letter had been sent to her office.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata wanted to get rid of the rebel MP to put an end to the saga of embarrassment that he has brought to the party.         
	Asked about Sumans resignation threat, a visibly annoyed Mamata refused to react today. This is our partys in- ternal matter, she told newspersons in Delhi.         
	Party sources said Mamata was unhappy with Suman and would not like to publicly say anything that could draw a response from him and bring even more embarrassment to the party.         
	A junior Trinamul minister said from Delhi tonight that Sumans text message came in handy for the leadership to train its guns on the rebel.         
	Our four-member disciplinary committee had earlier recommended disciplinary action against Suman. But if we had expelled him, he could have remained an unattached MP. Now that he has offered to resign, we want to take advantage of it.         
	However, former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said a text message from an MP offering to quit could not be treated as resignation. An MP has to personally hand over his or her signed resignation letter to the Speaker. Had I been in the Chair, I would not have treated such a text message as a resignation letter and acted on it, he added.         
	However the Trinamul move today is a clear signal to Suman that the party wants him to quit.         
	We wanted to make it clear to him that we do not want him any longer in the party, a Trinamul minister said.        
	Suman was not available tonight for comment on Bandopadhyays missive to the Speaker.         
	The singer-MP may have overplayed his hand in impulsively sending in his resignation and may be seeking to find an honourable way of getting out of it now.         
	Although he told a news conference this morning that he would stick to his guns and soon write to the Speaker on quitting as member of the Lok Sabha, he did no do any such thing during the day.         
	Sumanda has not written any letter to the Speaker yet, said his election agent Mafazzal Hossain, a Trinamul leader of South 24-Parganas.         
	At the news conference, Suman iterated his complaints about corruption in the party and instances of how he had been humiliated. Im being humiliated in the party for long. But there is nobody in the party to take note of it.        
	He also poured vitriol on South 24-Parganas district party president Sovan Chatterjee. I saw Sovan accompanying Mamata in her car and serving tea and biscuit to us. But he has become leader overnight and is dictating to me how I should spend my MP funds for development.

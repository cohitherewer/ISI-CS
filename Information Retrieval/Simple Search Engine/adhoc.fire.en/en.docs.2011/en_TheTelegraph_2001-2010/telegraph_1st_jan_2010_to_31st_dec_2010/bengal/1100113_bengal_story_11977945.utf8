	Pursura (Hooghly), Jan. 12: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today urged party leaders and cadres here to go to the people with folded hands and apologise for mistakes they have made.         
	He was addressing a rally this afternoon at Pursura in Arambagh, which witnessed a series of clashes between the CPM and the Trinamul Congress late last year.         
	Boses statement comes at a time Jyoti Basu is battling for life. The CPM patriarch had time and again advised his party to seek apology and regret its mistakes and go to its core support base to stem the rot.         
	Bose urged party workers to go door to door. We still have time. Go to the people and seek apology with folded hands for the mistakes you have made. Tell people we will not repeat these mistakes.

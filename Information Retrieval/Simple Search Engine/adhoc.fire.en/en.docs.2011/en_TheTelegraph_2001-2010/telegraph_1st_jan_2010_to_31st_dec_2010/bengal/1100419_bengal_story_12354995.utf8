The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM trouble in Salt Lake
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM trouble in Salt Lake
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Calcutta, April 18: The CPM chairman of Bidhan Nagar (Salt Lake) municipality today said he would not contest the May civic polls to protest the partys decision not to allot him the ward he had contested five years ago.         
	Biswajiban Majumdar vented his ire hours after the North 24-Parganas district CPM unit announced its candidates, replacing him with a Calcutta University teacher.        
	Twenty-one municipalities, including Bidhan Nagar, are going to the polls in the district. Of the 518 wards in the 21 civic bodies, the Left has named candidates for 496. The rest have yet to be finalised.        
	I have my commitment to the people of Ward 15, from where I had won the last time. But the leadership has chosen someone else for my ward without consulting me. They are now offering me another ward. Why should I accept that? Am I a puppet that dances to the party bosses tune? he asked.         
	Ward 15 comprises parts of Karunamoyee and the EE and CJ blocks. Jyoti Bhusan Dutta has been nominated from the ward this time.        
	The party has left Ward 3, which comprises the AL and BL blocks and a part of CJ, vacant for Majumdar.         
	District CPM secretary Amitava Basu said: We are still trying to persuade Biswajibanbabu to contest the polls. We dont know about his grievances.         
	A CPM North 24-Parganas district secretariat member, Amitava Nandi, said Majumdar had not spoken about his grievances when I personally spoke to him twice.         
	Majumdar slammed the leadership for not taking him into confidence while preparing the list of candidates. Being the chairman of a municipality for five years, I should have been consulted. But they did not bother to do so.        
	Majumdar is known to have strained relations with former Dum Dum MP Nandis wife Ila, the vice-chairperson of the present board.         
	The late Subhas Chakrabortys brother-in-law, Nanda Bhattacharya, has also not been renominated. His ward  number five  has been reserved for a woman and Ila is contesting there.        
	The candidate for another Bidhan Nagar ward  No. 12, comprising Labony  was not announced because front partner RSP has yet to decide its nominee.        
	In the rest of North 24-Parganas, the CPM has denied tickets to the chairpersons of nine municipalities.         
	They were all above 70. So, we have replaced them by young and energetic people, said district secretary Basu.

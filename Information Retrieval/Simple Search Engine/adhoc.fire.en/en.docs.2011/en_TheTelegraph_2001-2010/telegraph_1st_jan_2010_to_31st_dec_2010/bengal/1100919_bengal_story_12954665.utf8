                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Heist at businessman house
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: A youth today burgled the south Calcutta house of the owners of catering firm Bijoli Grill and escaped with Rs 7 lakh in cash and jewellery.        
	Police said the burglary took place in the third-floor room of Annapurna Barik, 76, the mother of Anil and Tapan Barik, the owners of Bijoli Grill.         
	Annapurna had gone to the terrace of the four-storey building at 6.30am to pray. When my mother returned to her room around 8.15am, she saw that the two almirahs were open and had been ransacked. One of the almirahs had not been opened since my fathers death five years ago, Tapan said.        
	She came out on the balcony and shouted for our cook, Mrityunjoy Mondal. But when she turned back, she saw a youth scampering down the stairs. The youth was bare-bodied and was wearing shorts, Tapan added.         
	I suspect that when my mother stepped into the room, the youth was hiding somewhere inside, he said.        
	Annanpurna told the police the youth looked around 16.         
	The Bariks said that among the items stolen were 12 gold bangles, a gold chain and some gold and diamond earrings. Around Rs 10,000 in cash had also been stolen, they said.        
	An officer from Tollygunge police station said: It appears that insiders were involved in the burglary. The thief seemed to have known of when the elderly lady would not be in her room. We have spoken to Annapurna devi and prepared a sketch of the youth.        
	The two Barik brothers live on the second floor while the widow of Annapurnas second son lives with her family on the third floor.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Malda MP fails to get PM date
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, March 24: Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury is returning empty-handed from Delhi.         
	The Congress MP from Malda South is yet to get a confirmation from the Prime Ministers Office on when Manmohan Singh will be able to lay the foundation stone of the Ghani Khan Chowdhury Institute of Engineering and Technology here.        
	The Prime Minister had set March 26 as the date for the programme but the visit was postponed. Although no reasons were cited, sources in the PMO said the Prime Minister would be busy with a Chinese delegation on that day.        
	The postponement came hours after Hashem blasted Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, a Congress ally, for announcing that she would share the dais with Singh in Malda.         
	Today, Hashems brother Abu Naser said in Calcutta: The Prime Minister was very busy and could not meet him. The PMO has told my brother to return after a week.        
	This time both of us will go to Delhi and we will not return without meeting the Prime Minister and fixing a date for the event, he added.        
	The Prime Minister knows that we will have no one else but him, Abu Naser said.

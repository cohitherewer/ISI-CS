The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Avishikta flat burgled
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Avishikta flat burgled
                            
	Calcutta, May 22: Robbers broke into a flat on the sixth floor of Avishikta I off EM Bypass and allegedly took away ornaments worth around Rs 5 lakh defying the complexs three-tier security.         
	Santanu Dutta, a marketing executive with a reputable consumer goods company who had taken the flat on rent, was not at home when his maid spotted the broken door and alerted a family on the fifth floor.        
	An agency called GDS manages the apartments security. Its personnel are at the main gate, around the premises and at the entrance to buildings. An officer said the flat was possibly burgled in the morning because that is when neighbours mistake thieves as locksmiths or carpenters. A year ago, a flat in the adjacent highrise had been burgled.

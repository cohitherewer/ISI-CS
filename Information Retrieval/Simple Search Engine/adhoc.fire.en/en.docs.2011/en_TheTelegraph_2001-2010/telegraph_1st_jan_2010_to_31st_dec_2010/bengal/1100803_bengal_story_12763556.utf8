	Calcutta, Aug. 2: Mohammad Naimuddin, the driver of the tragedy-struck Vananchal Express, today told the CID that the drivers of the Uttar Banga Express may not have noticed the red light at the rear of the Vananchal before ramming into it because of a curve on the tracks just before Sainthia station.        
	The CID also interrogated Somnath Sengupta, the Uttar Banga guard. He was asked when he had last spoken to the driver and at what speed the train was travelling before the crash.        
	Naimuddin and Sengupta had come along with 12 railway staff members to the CID headquarters at Bhavani Bhavan for questioning.

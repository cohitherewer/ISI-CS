	Midnapore, Sept. 15: A CPM minister today said the partys turnaround in Jungle Mahal could be traced to Enayatpur, where the Left had set up the first of its several camps in the Maoist belt.        
	The minister for paschimanchal development affairs, Susanta Ghosh, told a rally in Midnapore town: If someone throws bricks at us, we will respond by throwing stones. We will not throw rosogollas. He said the CPM would reopen its offices in Lalgarh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata for Sachar as governor
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata for Sachar as governor

	New Delhi, Jan. 7: Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, who initially asked for a Muslim governor for Bengal, has now suggested the name of Justice Rajinder Sachar, presuming that his appointment, too, would yield similar electoral gains.        
	The Congress has not finalised any name so far and sources said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would not like to choose the new occupant of Calcuttas Raj Bhavan without a discussion with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	The Congress was initially keen to send party general secretary Mohsina Kidwai to Bengal but she politely declined the offer, wanting a politically calmer destination if she had to leave Delhi.         
	Congress leaders thought she was the best choice, being a prominent Muslim leader of the country.         
	Party sources revealed Mamata had asked the Prime Minister to consider Sachar, whose report on the plight of Muslims criticised Bengals dismal record on minorities. The report showed the Left Front government had done little for the minorities despite its long, uninterrupted rule.         
	The Congress may not have any particular reservations on Sachar but the Prime Minister would like to build a consensus first.         
	Sources said even the Bengal chief minister had expressed his preference for a non-political governor. But the Left would be choosy in giving its approval as its experience with Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the former governor who was a bureaucrat, was not pleasant.

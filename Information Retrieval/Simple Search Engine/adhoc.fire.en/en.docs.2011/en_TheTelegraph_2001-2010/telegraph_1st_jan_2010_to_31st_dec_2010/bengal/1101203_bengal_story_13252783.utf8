	Balarampur (Purulia), Dec. 2: An India Reserve Battalion constable allegedly gunned down two policemen for objecting to the noise of firecrackers during pre-Christmas festivities in a Purulia camp whose personnel had killed a civilian in October on the suspicion that he was a Maoist.        
	Purlembo Ao, 27, allegedly shot dead Sanjoy Bor, a state armed police constable, and his senior, India Reserve Battalion subinspector Kebrihom Dominique, with his AK-47 rifle at the camp in Balarampur early today. Ao, an IRB constable from Nagaland, was allegedly drunk.   
	Local residents said Ao and some of his IRB colleagues, all of whom were drunk, had been bursting firecrackers on the camp compound since last evening. They had put up an illuminated Christmas tree inside the complex and a dummy Santa Claus on the roof of the camp building, which also houses state armed police (SAP) personnel.         
	The residents said the IRB constables started bursting crackers after setting up the Christmas tree. There was a lull for some time and the constables again started bursting crackers late at night, said Parameswar Kundu, a retired block development officer who lives opposite the camp.         
	The police said that around 2.30am, Bor, 28, requested Ao and his colleagues to stop bursting the firecrackers. A source at the camp said Bor had told the IRB personnel that the loud noise so late in the night was disturbing people in the neighbourhood.         
	The source said Ao suddenly started firing at Bor with his AK-47. Bor took five bullets.         
	Hearing the sound of the firing, IRB subinspector Dominique rushed out of the camp and tried to snatch the gun from Ao. But Ao, the source said, pumped around six bullets into Dominique, killing him on the spot.         
	Aos colleagues and SAP constables managed to overpower him and snatched the gun. A force from a police station 2km away arrived around 3.15am and took Ao away.         
	Bor was taken to a private hospital, 22km away in Jharkhand. He was declared dead on arrival.         
	On October 1, IRB personnel in the same camp had fired at two youths from Bokaro after they allegedly refused to stop their car when asked to. The IRB jawans had mistaken firecrackers being burst in the neighbourhood as a Maoist attack and had probably thought the youths were rebels. Vikas Misra, 23, was killed while his friend Ganesh Gupta, also 23, was seriously injured.         
	After the October firing, most of the IRB jawans at the Balarampur camp had been shifted to another base.         
	The inspector-general of police (western range), Zulfikar Hassan, said: Around 30 IRB personnel had stayed back as the commanding officer of the 10th battalion has his office there.         
	Hassan said that after todays incident, we will have to reconsider their presence in Balarampur.         
	Six companies of IRB jawans from Nagaland are involved in anti-Maoist operations in Purulia.         
	The IRB battalion in Purulia was earlier posted at Nagalands Zhadima. They had allegedly mutined when they were told in August that they would be sent to Purulia. They had apparently refused to come to Bengal unless given sophisticated arms to combat Maoists.

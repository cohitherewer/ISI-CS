  - Rebels conduct football matches and sports meets to scout for athletic youths        NARESH JANA                          Kalshibhanga, one of the villages where the Maoists are allegedly organising the football matches. Telegraph picture                                        
	Salboni, July 4: Maoists are organising football matches in West Midnapore to recruit fit and athletic youths, following losses suffered at the hands of security forces.         
	The state intelligence branch (IB) has said in a report submitted to the government that the rebels are using the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities as a front to organise these matches.         
	Over the past year, the rebels have suffered heavy casualties and injuries during encounters with joint forces.         
	The matches are being organised since the past month in the villages of Salboni that are deep inside forests, the report says. The villages are all within 25km of Maoist hotbed Lalgarh.        
	The report says the Peoples Committee has been luring the poor youths found fit on the football field with monthly stipends.         
	The Maoists have suffered heavy losses in the past year. We have killed 21 rebels in encounters. Their bodies have been found with arms and ammunition. Besides, several of them have suffered injuries. We have also arrested 180 Peoples Committee members, 50 of whom had been given arms training by the Maoists, said West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma.         
	Faced with a soldier crisis, Verma said, the Maoists are conducting a recruitment drive. This is why they are organising football matches to recruit fit and able youths, Verma added.        
	Maoists suffered their biggest loss at the hands of the security forces on June 17 when eight rebels were killed in an encounter at the Ranja forest in West Midnapore. Several rebels have also been killed in encounters in the forests of Cheraboni, Memul and Sirshi, all of which are on the outskirts of Lalgarh.        
	The rebels had admitted that five of their men had been killed during the Shilda camp attack in February in which 24 Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans were massacred.        
	According to an IB officer, the Maoists have already recruited 20 youths from Kalshibhanga, Mathurapur, Pidrakuli and Gadra villages of Salboni. At least four football matches have been organised in these areas in the past one-and-a-half months, the officer said.        
	Recruiting young people from core rebel areas in Lalgarh is no longer possible because of the heavy deployment of joint forces. So they have targeted other areas like Salboni where they are active, another IB officer said.        
	The police came to know about the new recruitment method from some Maoists they had arrested in 2009. They said the Maoists had recruited them because of their power, strength and energy. They told us that the Maoists were organising football matches as part of their recruitment drive, Verma said.        
	The IB has outlined in its report the qualities the Maoists are looking for in their candidates. They are testing endurance skills: how a youth can run while playing football, his strength and energy.. These are the priorities. This is because a Maoist has to walk for miles in forest areas, an IB officer said.        
	The officer said the Peoples Committee would organise sports meets to also recruit women. During such events, the fitness of the candidates will be tested through races and long jumps. The Maoists have not recruited women recently, the officer added.        
	However, Peoples Committee leader Asit Mahato has denied that the football matches are being organised to recruit Maoists.         
	Villagers love to play football. Earlier, football tournaments used to be held regularly in West Midnapore villages. But now, such matches cannot be organised because of constant raids by the joint forces. The villagers always live in fear and we are organising the matches to cheer them up, Mahato said.

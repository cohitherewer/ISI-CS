The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Deb land jab at railways
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Deb land jab at railways
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 14: Gautam Deb today said the CPM would start an agitation against a statute amendment that empowers Mamata Banerjees railways to acquire land directly without involving the state governments.        
	The law (amendment) passed in 2008 has created trouble in places like Bolpur (Birbhum), Maslandapur (North 24-Parganas) and Phurphura Shariff (South 24-Parganas). This will create further unrest in the state, the state housing minister told a media conference at the Hidco office.         
	The Deb-led Hidco has been the target of a campaign by Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamul Congress over alleged forcible land takeovers in Rajarhat.        
	The places he referred to are pockets in Bengal where he claimed the railways were taking over plots from farmers.        
	The Railways (Amendment) Act, 2008, empowers the utility to acquire land for any special project approved by the Centre for improvement of a particular area. Railway officials confirmed that the amendments gave them more teeth. If the railway ministry approves a special project, the officer overseeing the plan can acquire land directly by informing, but not involving, the state administration, said an official.         
	Earlier, the railways had to acquire the land through the district collector. However, under the amended act, the railways pay the compensation directly to the land loser, the official said.        
	Railway sources said land was being acquired for the dedicated eastern freight corridor and some other projects in Phurphura Sharif, Maslandapur and other places under the amended act as they have been declared special projects.        
	Deb threatened a protest against the provision. The state government will approach the Centre to repeal the act and if it does not do it, well start a political agitation against such forcible acquisition.

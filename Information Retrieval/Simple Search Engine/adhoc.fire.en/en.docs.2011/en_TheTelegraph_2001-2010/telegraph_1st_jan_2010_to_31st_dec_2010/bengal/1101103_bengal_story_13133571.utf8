The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM renews minority push
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM renews minority push
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 2: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today told a gathering of minority students and teachers that a group of people are lagging behind, an admission seen as an attempt to court the community whose alienation has been blamed for the Lefts poll debacles.        
	Ek dol manush pichhiye achhey (a group of people are lagging behind). Almost 85 per cent of Muslims in Bengal do not have access to proper food, shelter and education. We have to create a samatal (level playing field) for them, the chief minister said at the inauguration of a skill development programme run by the state-aided Aliyah University.        
	The admission by Bhattacharjee, who had earlier accepted that the community has a marginal representation in government jobs, assumes significance against the criticism of the Sachar Committee report by his own party and the rest of the Left for reaching similar conclusions about their plight.         
	The report said while Muslims made up 25 per cent of the states population, their share in government jobs was only 4 per cent.         
	Much of the Lefts debacles  from the panchayat elections in 2008 and the Lok Sabha polls in 2009 to the civic elections in May this year  was blamed on the desertion by the minorities and their drift towards the Trinamul Congress.        
	The chief minister said Muslim youths were not getting jobs because of lack of proper education. Our government has started (education) schemes under which they have to pay a small amount while the government bears most of the expense.        
	But the admission may have come too late. The principal of a higher secondary Urdu medium school present at the programme wanted Bhattacharjee to accept responsibility rather than highlight a known fact. If the chief minister has accepted that the Muslims are backward, he should also accept that his (partys) government, in power since 1977, is responsible.

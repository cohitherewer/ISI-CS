	Burdwan, Dec. 5: Mamata Banerjee today threw down the gauntlet at her rival in CPM citadel Burdwan and vowed to wipe out the ruling party from the district.        
	Avenge Raina and Mangalkot at the ballot box the CPM must not get a single seat in Burdwan. All sections must come together for a movement against the CPM, Mamata told a gathering at Burdwan towns Utsab Maidan this afternoon, less than a week after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee held a rally at the spot. Raina and Mangalkot are restive pockets that have been rocked by CPM-Trinamul clashes in recent months.        
	The size of the crowd the Trinamul chief addressed today was put at 80,000-plus. A senior police officer said the turnout at Bhattacharjees November 29 rally was significantly smaller.         
	Today, the officer said, the gathering was so big that he had a trying time ensuring a smooth passage for Mamatas convoy.                     
	Some political observers dubbed the event the biggest political rally organised by an Opposition party in Burdwan in recent years.        
	 The CPM wants to fight us. We are ready. We will take them on at their home turf, Mamata dared her adversary during her 45-minute speech.         
	She had announced the rally just after the killings of two Trinamul supporters, allegedly in police firing, in Raina on December 1.         
	Today, Mamata met the family members of the Raina victims  Hasmat Mallik and Kajal Molla  and the widow of another party supporter killed in Mangalkot earlier.         
	Raina is the latest addition to the list of trouble spots in Burdwan after Mangalkot, Ketugram, Purbasthali and Memari. These places have been buffeted by clashes between CPM and Trinamul, and occasionally Congress supporters, in the past few years.         
	Mamatas references to such simmering pockets is being seen as an attempt to cash in on the anger at the violence. But the Trinamul chief also asked her supporters to maintain peace in an attempt to ensure that she is seen as a responsible leader on the verge of winning power.         
	Those who are on their way out do not have any responsibility. But those who are coming to power have a lot of things to deliver, she said.        
	Burdwan  the states rice bowl  has been a CPM stronghold since the days the communists launched the movement for the rights of the peasants in the late 1960s. Of the 26 Assembly seats in the district, the Congress and Trinamul could together win only three in the 2006 elections.        
	Trinamul, which has improved its performance in the district since the 2008 panchayat polls, is eyeing a bigger pie of the 25 Assembly seats  one less because of delimitation. Although the Left retained all the three Lok Sabha seats in the 2009 elections, Trinamul and ally Congress won big in the civic polls in May this year.         
	During her speech, Mamata repeatedly reminded her supporters that CPM leaders would use the police to recover lost ground in most parts of rural Bengal, including Burdwan, and told them to resist such moves. We will see whether the guns of CPM cadres have more power than the grit of our supporters. But they should come without the police.         
	She accused Bhattacharjee and his party colleagues of stoking violence with their speeches.         
	What have they (the Left) done apart from killing people and democracy? she asked. She promised to deliver development and jobs if voted to power and highlighted her achievements as railway minister on that count. The railways have brought about a revolution in Bengal.

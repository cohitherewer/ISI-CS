          MONALISA CHAUDHURI                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 17: Four Maoists who surrendered in recent months are yet to get the rehabilitation package announced by the government for rebels who lay down arms and promise to return to the mainstream.        
	The scheme is gathering dust in the state home department at Writers Buildings after being cleared by a Surrender Rehabilitation Committee, comprising senior IPS officers. We had sent the (rehab) proposals for Shobhan Karak, Shobha Mandi and Bibhuti Mahato, who surrendered in West Midnapore in September. We are still waiting for the response, said Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore police chief.        
	A similar proposal for Rumpa Mahato, who had given herself up in Bankura on November 16, is waiting for approval, said district police chief Pranab Kumar.         
	Officers fear the delay could hit the efforts to win back more such rebels. This is a serious issue and needs immediate attention. If the government cannot guarantee the surrendered Maoists the benefits of the rehab package announced, it is sending a wrong signal to other rebels who want to surrender, said a senior IPS officer.         
	State home secretary G.D Gautama wasnt available for comment. A source in his department confirmed the proposals had been received but could not say why the files were stuck. The proposals are pending with us, the source said. Under the rehab plan announced in July, Maoists who surrender will get a monthly stipend of Rs 2,000 for three years. A fixed deposit of Rs 1.5 lakh will be made in their names, but this money can be used only after three years to set up small business or any other source of livelihood. Vocational training is also part of the plan.        
	Police sources said the four surrendered Maoists were now living in transit camps in undisclosed locations. They are neither in jail nor in police stations. They are living normal lives under the protection of the police. However, their locations cannot be divulged for their security, said an officer. It is not clear if, and how, the former rebels will be prosecuted. The decision on whether to press the charges or lighten them will largely depend on their conduct, said a committee member.

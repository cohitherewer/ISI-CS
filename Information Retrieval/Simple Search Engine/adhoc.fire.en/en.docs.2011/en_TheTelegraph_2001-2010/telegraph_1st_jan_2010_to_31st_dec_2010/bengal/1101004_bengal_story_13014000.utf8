The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Stations after Matua icons
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Stations after Matua icons
          BARUN GHOSH                          Mamata Banerjee gifts a shawl to Baroma at Thakurbari on January 21, 2009                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 3: Mamata Banerjee has decided to name a proposed Metro station and a railway station after three leading lights revered by the Matuas, days after prevailing on community matriarch Binapani Debi Thakurani to stay away from a programme where the chief minister felicitated her eldest son.        
	Trinamul Congress leader Dhanesh Guha, an adviser to the All-India Matua Mahasabha, said a station on the proposed Metro line between Noapara and Barasat would be named after Sri Sri Thakur Harichand and Guruchand Thakur.         
	The railway minister also plans to name one of the stations on the proposed railway line from Maslandapur to Swarupnagar in the Bongaon section after Binapani Debis late husband P.R. Thakur.         
	Mamata will also christen as Matua Dham a halt between Thakurnagar, home to Binapani Debi, who is called Baroma by her followers, and Chandpara in the Sealdah-Bongaon section.        
	The move is being seen as a bid to woo the Matuas, whose 1.2 crore members had once been Left voters, ahead of next years Assembly elections. Baroma, 92, is the chief adviser to the Mahasabha.         
	The Matuas, who live in 74 Assembly segments spread over eight districts, had voted for us during last years Lok Sabha polls. We want to ensure that our vote bank among the Matuas remains intact during the Assembly polls, a Trinamul vice-president said.         
	Thakur Harichand (1812-1878) and his son Guruchand (1847-1937) were social reformers.         
	Baromas youngest son Manjil Krishna said: My father was a minister of state for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the B.C. Roy government.         
	I have been told that Mamatadi will shortly unveil a halt for the benefit of thousands of pilgrims travelling to Thakurnagar during our annual fair in April, he said.         
	Gaighata Trinamul MLA Jyotipriya Mullick said he had visited Baromas Thakurnagar residence on September 29. I have conveyed Mamatadis message to her, he said.        
	Mullick said Baroma had sent a letter containing suggestions for the development of Matuas to Mamata, the chief patron of the Mahasabha.

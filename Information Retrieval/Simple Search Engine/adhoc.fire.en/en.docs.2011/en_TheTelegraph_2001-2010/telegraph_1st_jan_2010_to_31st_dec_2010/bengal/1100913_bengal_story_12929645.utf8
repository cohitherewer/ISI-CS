The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | DVC funds request
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      DVC funds request
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 12: Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today told a Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) event in Calcutta that the Centre would consider granting Rs 5,000 crore to the agency to complete its current and planned projects.         
	DVC officials told Mukherjee the corporation was facing losses because of inadequate tariffs fixed by the central electricity regulatory commission. They also requested him to take initiatives to exempt DVC from the purview of the electricity act so that it could fix its own tariffs.        
	DVC officials said the corporation was also involved in flood control and irrigation. But the commission considers DVC just a power-generating agency, an official said.        
	Pranab displeasure        
	Mukherjee has expressed displeasure at the way in which some dissident Congress leaders publicly protested Manas Bhuniyas nomination as state Congress chief on Thursday.

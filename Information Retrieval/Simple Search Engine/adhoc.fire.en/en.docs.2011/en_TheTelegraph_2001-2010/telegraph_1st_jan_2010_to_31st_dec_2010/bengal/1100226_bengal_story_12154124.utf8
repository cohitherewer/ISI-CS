          AMIT UKIL                              
	Purulia, Feb. 25: Minutes before he was shot by Maoists early today, inspector Rabi Lochan Mitra had spoken to wife Sudipta.        
	Sudipta, 45, said this was the first time her husband had called so late at night and that, too, during an encounter. Generally my husband called around midnight. I was a little surprised as he called around 1.50am today. He told me police were in an encounter with Maoists. We have killed two of them. They also shot at us.        
	Suddenly, he started shouting dekho dekho, mejobabu eka hoyey galo  dekho dekho kothai galo (See the second officer has become isolated . look for him). Then the line got disconnected. I began to worry. I called him back repeatedly but I couldnt get through, said Sudipta, breaking down.        
	Alarmed, Sudipta then called Mitras colleagues and Sarenga police station in neighbouring Bankura, of which he was the in-charge, but without success. Around 2.30am, a call came, saying my husband was busy with an encounter. I couldnt sleep, said Sudipta, sitting in their two-storey house in Purulia town.        
	She learnt of her husbands death from a news channel around 6am.

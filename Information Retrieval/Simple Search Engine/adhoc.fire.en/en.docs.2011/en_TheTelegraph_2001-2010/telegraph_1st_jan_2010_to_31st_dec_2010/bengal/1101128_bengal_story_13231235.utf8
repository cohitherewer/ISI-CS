          ZEESHAN JAWED AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                          Bhattacharjee at the meeting in Basirhat on Saturday. Telegraph picture                                  
	Basirhat, Nov. 27: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today tried to woo back with a humble please those who had deserted the CPM and joined the Trinamul Congress.        
	Please come back. Some of you deserted us because you misunderstood us. But I appeal to you to return, the chief minister told a rally in Basirhat, 80km from Calcutta.        
	Bhattacharjee promised to the estranged supporters to share whatever we have with you and take Bengal on the path of progress together.        
	He urged the 15,000-strong gathering not to be misguided by Mamata Banerjees false claims of industrialisation.        
	The chief minister said the railway minister had been announcing one industry after the other but the announcements only existed in newspaper advertisements.         
	He went on: Nobody has seen the industries the railway minister keeps announcing. Where are they coming up? They only exist on paper.         
	In contrast, the chief minister said, the Left Fronts industry drive was for everyone to see. He cited as examples the Jindal steel plant in Salboni and the Videocon electronics hub in Siliguri.        
	Bhattacharjee declared his government would not compromise on its industrialisation policy at any cost. He said the government would press ahead with the drive despite the setback in Singur. If somebody tries to create a wall to stop us from setting up industries, we will break that wall into pieces and surge ahead, he said, adding land would be acquired whenever required.         
	The chief minister accused Trinamul of not letting the government widen NH34, which connects Basirhat to Murshidabad. He also alleged Mamatas party was creating hurdles in the path of the proposed power station in Burdwans Katwa.        
	Basirhat is a Muslim-dominated area that has rejected the Left Front in recent elections. Bhattacharjee today urged the people of the area not to fall prey to Trinamuls propaganda that the CPM was taking away land from Muslims. Do you think we are mad? Why would we do such a thing?         
	This is the second meeting Bhattacharjee has addressed in North 24-Parganas in a week. Last Sunday, he had addressed a meeting in Rajarhat. Tomorrow, the chief minister will attend a rally in the industrial belt of Barrackpore in the district.        
	A district CPM leader said the party was on a sticky wicket in North 24-Parganas. He said the district, which was once a Left stronghold, now lacks a strong leadership.

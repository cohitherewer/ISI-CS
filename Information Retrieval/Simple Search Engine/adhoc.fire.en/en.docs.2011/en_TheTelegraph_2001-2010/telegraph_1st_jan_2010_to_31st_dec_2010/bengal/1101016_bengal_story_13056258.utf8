The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | In city, pandal tribute to technology
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      In city, pandal tribute to technology

	Calcutta, Oct. 15: Puja organisers across the city have logged heavily into technology.        
	At the top of the heap with an eye-popping feat is Salt Lakes FD Block Sarbojanin Puja Committee. They have installed an elevator to take elderly visitors up to the idol.        
	It is a hydraulic jack. We have covered three sides with fibre glass. It can carry a weight of about 240kg, said puja secretary Subrata Bhattacharya. The bill for the facility? Rs 1.5lakh. This is the first time the block has a pandal which requires one to climb the stairs to a height of about 15ft.         
	The neighbours are not far behind. BG Block has air-conditioned its pandal. We have installed seven 10-tonne air-conditioners. As there is no option of keeping the door closed, we had to factor in the load required to keep our 5,000 sqft pandal cool, said secretary Dipankar Das. The cost of the cool comfort  Rs 2 lakh  has been offset by putting up free advertisements of the installing agency.        
	The organisers are sending text messages to residents about anjali timings and cultural programmes.        
	In BE (East), the three stages of the evolution of Durga Puja is captured with three-feet idols with a projector above screening life in those ages. We shot the Akalbodhan segment with live actors, said Sanjib Saha of Vibgyor Marketing, the implementing agency. The second segment portrays life in the 1960s and the third shows flying saucers in the air with the area around Victoria Memorial reduced to a concrete jungle.         
	Ekdalia Evergreen Club and Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatti Durgapuja Committee are using Bluetooth technology. If visitors keep their cellphones on, they will receive a message as soon as they reach our locality. If they accept it, within seconds images of the idol and the pandal will be transferred to their phones, said Chaltabagan organiser Sundeep Bhutoria.

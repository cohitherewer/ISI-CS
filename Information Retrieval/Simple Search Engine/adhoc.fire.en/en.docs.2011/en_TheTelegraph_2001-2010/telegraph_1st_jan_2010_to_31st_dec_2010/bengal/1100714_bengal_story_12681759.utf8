The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Didi phone unattended, Deb picks up pen
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Didi phone unattended, Deb picks up pen
          BARUN GHOSH                                            
	Calcutta, July 13: Bengal housing minister Gautam Deb today claimed he had made several phone calls to Mamata Banerjee to unveil a Burdwan project but they had gone unanswered, after which he had to write to the Trinamul chief.        
	The calls and the letter are part of the CPM ministers efforts, apparently backed by his party, to build bridges with the principal Opposition.        
	The project that Deb wants the railway minister to unveil is a Rs 50-crore water treatment plant in the Purbasthali area of Burdwan, a long-time CPM fortress.         
	Today, I wrote to the railway minister after having failed to get through to her on her two cellphones on Sunday night. I want Mamata to unveil the water treatment plant because she didnt accept my earlier request to hand over flats to subscribers in a housing project in the Rajarhats New Township, Deb told The Telegraph.        
	For the Rajarhat event which Mamata did not attend, Deb had offered to do away with three things he said the Trinamul Congress leader was allergic to  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, any mention of the Left government and even himself.        
	Deb, also a CPM state secretariat member, said he had spoken to the leader of Opposition, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee, after he failed to speak to Mamata over the Burdwan project.        
	Although both phones (of Mamata) kept ringing, nobody picked them up. Finally, I contacted Partha over his cellphone to request him to attend the programme and also ensure his leaders participation, the minister said.        
	Chatterjee confirmed his conversation with Deb but said he would take a decision after consulting Mamata. I shall decide on attending the Purbasthali programme after talking to Mamata and our local party leaders.         
	Asked if Mamata would accept the invite, he said it was up to her. I will convey to Mamata Debs desire. But it is up to her to take the final decision, Chatterjee said.        
	The CPM leadership has backed Debs overtures. We stand by what Gautamda is doing to win over the Opposition. Co-ordinating with the Opposition will help us carry out pending projects, a CPM state committee member said.        
	A minister in the Left Front government said if projects were completed with the Oppositions help, the ruling combine could win back those who had voted against it since the Lok Sabha polls. It will help us win back those who voted against us, said the minister.        
	Deb gave three reasons why he wanted Mamata to unveil the water plant.         
	One, to build a healthy relationship with the Opposition for better governance.         
	Two, the project is partly funded by the Centre, of which Mamata is a part.         
	Three, plant site Purbasthali has two Trinamul Congress-run panchayat samitis. The project can be inaugurated on a date convenient to her.        
	Some Trinamul functionaries in Purbasthali want Mamata to do the honours. We want Didi to unveil the project rising above politics. This will be a morale-booster for us in a CPM citadel like Burdwan, said Manashi Das, sabhapati of Trinamul-run Purbasthali I panchayat samiti.

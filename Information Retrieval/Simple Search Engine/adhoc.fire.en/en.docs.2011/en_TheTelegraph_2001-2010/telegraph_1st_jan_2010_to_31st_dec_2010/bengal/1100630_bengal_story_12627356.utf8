                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata amp; Mangalkot on Manas lips
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 29: Manas Bhuniya unveiled his plans to bolster the beleaguered Congress organisation in the state and its relations with the Trinamul Congress after taking over as the state party chief.        
	My primary tasks will be overhauling the organisation by mobilising a mass movement across Bengal and strengthening our alliance with Trinamul, Bhuniya told a news conference at the state Congress headquarters.        
	His first move was to an- nounce a trip to Mangalkot on July 15 to mark a year of the attack on a team of Congress MLAs he had led there. They had gone to distribute relief among party workers who had fled their homes following attacks by alleged CPM supporters after one of their local leaders was killed.         
	The Mangalkot visit will be followed by a string of programmes in the districts during which Bhuniya hopes to get a feel of the partys organisational strength.        
	Bhuniya was picked for the job to ensure smooth running of the Congresss alliance with Mamata and he did not disappoint. I have already worked out a joint campaign with her (Mamata Banerjees) party for the July 5 bypoll to the Durgapur I Assembly seat and have spoken to (Trinamul) Union minister Mukul Roy about a rally there, the state Congress chief said five minutes after formally taking charge.         
	Mamata has left the seat in the CPM stronghold to her ally.        
	Roy said he would be part of a joint campaign with Bhuniya on July 2. I shall be there with Manas at Mamatadis instance to ensure a Congress victory. The need of the hour is to see to it that our alliance is intact till the Assembly polls.

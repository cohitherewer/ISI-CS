The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Suman complains to Speaker about party
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Suman complains to Speaker about party
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kabir Suman                                  
	Calcutta, April 19: MP Kabir Suman today wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar accusing the Trinamul Congress leadership of keeping him in the dark about its plans and programmes and suggested that it could be a conspiracy to get him punished.         
	He referred to the partys recent decision not to inform him about its boycott of Parliament last week.         
	My relations with the Trinamul Congress have not been good over the last few months. The party is not keeping any contact with me these days. As a result, I have been facing a lot of practical problems. I attended Parliament both on April 15 and 16 without knowing that our MPs had decided to stay away from the House, he said. I want to keep you (the Speaker) informed about the development, he added.         
	Suman added later his apprehensions about the partys motive: Suppose there is voting in Parliament and Im absent from the House (not knowing what the party plan is). I shall lose my membership. If the party does not keep me informed about its plans and programmes, I shall be at the receiving end. It is better if Trinamul expels me from the party.        
	The Jadavpur MP has sent copies of his letter to Mamata Banerjee and Trinamul chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay.        
	Although Suman has embarrassed the party on several occasions in the past with his support to Maoists and opposition to Mamata, the party has shied away from throwing him out.        
	Sources said Suman was worried that the leadership could write to the Speaker demanding the cancellation of his membership for not acting in accordance with the party line. It had last month forwarded to the Speaker a copy of his text message to Mamata and Sudip in which he had offered to quit, one of them said.        
	A source said Trinamul wanted him to resign on his own after getting fed up with the sustained harassment.         
	If the party expels Suman, he can remain an unattached MP. But if he resigns, he has to quit Parliament.         
	Former Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said a Speaker could cancel a membership on the basis of a partys complaint about an MP going against its whip. But an inquiry has to be conducted first.        
	Trinamul junior minister Sisir Adhikari said from Delhi tonight: We are aware of Sumans letter to the Speaker. But we are not attaching any importance to it.         
	Seat-share talks        
	Mamata has assured the Congress she would meet its state leaders on her return to Calcutta next week to discuss seat sharing for the municipal polls. Pranab Mukherjee had a chat with Mamata today, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.        
	In Bolpur, a district Trinamul leader said there would be no alliance with the Congress because it wants to give us only eight wards out of 19.

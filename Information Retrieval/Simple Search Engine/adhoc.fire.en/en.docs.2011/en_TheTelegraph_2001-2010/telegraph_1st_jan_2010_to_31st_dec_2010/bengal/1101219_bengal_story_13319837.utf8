	Calcutta, Dec. 18: Two SFI activists, both students of Asutosh College, were arrested today in connection with Thursdays violence at the institution, prompting the CPM student arm to organise protests across the city and gherao a police station.        
	Three members of the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) had been arrested yesterday in connection with the violence that left Asutosh College student Souvik Hazra with possibly irreparable damage to his left eye. Hazra left for Hyderabad this morning for treatment.        
	Hours after the arrest of SFI activists Sovam Mitra and Rishav Sarkar, both second-year students, hundreds of the outfits members gheraoed Bhowanipore police station for half an hour.  
	Activists of several Left students organisations burnt effigies of Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee in front of a few city colleges. They also held marches and meetings at various crossings across Calcutta to condemn campus violence.         
	The SFI, which has called a students strike on Monday, denied that Mitra or Sarkar were involved in Thursdays clashes between SFI and TMCP supporters at Asutosh College. SFI state committee member Anirban Hazra said the two students were innocent and had been arrested on false charges.        
	TMCP supporters marched on roads around the college.        
	All the five students arrested were produced at Alipore court today and received bail.        
	Supporters of both the students unions were present on the court premises, where a large police team was deployed. After the grant of bail, the supporters shouted slogans.        
	Asked about the SFI strike on Monday, Calcutta University vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said all classes on the College Street and Alipore campuses would remain suspended that day because Vice-President Hamid Ansari would address two programmes there.        
	The authorities of several schools said they were yet to decide whether to keep the institutions open on Monday. Many schools have already closed for the winter vacation.         
	At a news conference at her Kalighat home, Mamata announced her party would organise a rally at Esplanade on December 23 to protest the reign of terror let loose by the CPM.        
	She said TMCP members would march from the Shyambazar five-point crossing to the Gandhi statue at Maidan on Monday.        
	The Trinamul chief claimed that armed CPM goons had killed SFI activist Swapan Koley on Thursday after mistaking him for a Trinamul supporter. Koley was killed during a clash between SFI and TMCP supporters at Anduls Prabhu Jagadbandhu College.        
	Mamata said she had complained to Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee about the CPMs military rule. She urged the Congress to make it clear whether it supported the CPMs misrule.         
	Kabir Suman, the Trinamul MP from Jadavpur who has fallen foul of Mamata, however, said all political parties were involved in campus violence over student elections.        
	Governor M.K. Narayanan voiced concern at the college flare-ups while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a CII seminar at a Calcutta hotel.        
	I will talk to the chief minister and others, he said. The governor said he would speak to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee when its convenient.        
	Asked if he would speak to the railway minister too, Narayanan said: Law and order is a state subject.        
	At a rally in Burdwans Mangalkot, the chief minister urged people to resist Trinamul-sponsored terror in educational institutions.

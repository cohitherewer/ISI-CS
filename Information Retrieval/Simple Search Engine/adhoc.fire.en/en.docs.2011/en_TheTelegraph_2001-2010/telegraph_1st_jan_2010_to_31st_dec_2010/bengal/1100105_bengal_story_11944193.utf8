The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rail jobs for landlosers 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rail jobs for landlosers 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 4: Mamata Banerjee today said she had amended the railways land acquisition policy chupi chupi to be able to provide a job to every family that gives its land for a railway project.        
	I have got amendments made to the railway land ac- quisition act (policy) secretively (chupi chupi). From now on, each landloser family will get one job in the railways over and above the compensation, the railway minister said after laying the foundation stone for the Bagnan-Amta line in Howrah.        
	She added that the railways would never use force to acquire land. We need only small plots and, normally, land is taken only from those who are willing, she said.         
	Trinamuls political for- tunes have changed after Mamata led an agitation against forcible land acquisition in Singur, forcing Tata Motors to pull out. A similar agitation in Nandigram had forced the state to scrap its plans for a chemical hub there.         
	Sources said the minister had sent her suggestion on employment for each landloser family to the railway board.         
	A senior official confirmed that the railway minister had the power to amend the policy on compensation and other benefits for those who lose land to railway projects.         
	Sources said changing the policy was a political compulsion for Mamata after the railways faced Singur-like protests in Chandauli district of Uttar Pradesh.         
	The railways had served a land acquisition notice to farmers there for the western freight corridor.         
	Todays announcement drew cheers from the over 3,000 people in the field adjoining Amta station. The 16km Amta-Bagnan line requires 168 acres.        
	Providing jobs will be easier said than done, said a senior railway official. Mamata had earlier said that over 21,500 acres would be required for the western and eastern freight corridors. It means several thousand jobs have to be created to meet the ministers commitment.

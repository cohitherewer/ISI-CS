          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, Dec. 26: Top officers of the joint forces today met in Purulia to discuss a new strategy to counter the Maoists, a day after suffering the first casualty at the hands of the rebels in the district.        
	Yesterday, a Cobra jawan of the CRPF was killed and four of his colleagues were injured after Maoists triggered a landmine blast inside a forest on the Ayodhya Hills.        
	Todays meeting was attended by, among others, T.V. Rao, the CRPF inspector-general (operations); Zulfikar Hasan, the inspector-general of police (western range); Ajay Nanda, the deputy inspector-general of police (counter-insurgency Forces); and Anil Kumar, the deputy inspector-general of police (Midnapore range).        
	A district police officer said the Cobra team that took part in the raid yesterday had successfully flushed out Maoists from Lalgarh last year.         
	However, he said the terrain in the Ayodhya Hills was different from that of West Midnapore. Maoists can lay traps more easily in the hilly jungle turf in Purulia. The Cobra jawans could find it more difficult to counter Maoists here than in West Midnapore, the officer said.        
	The Maoists yesterday fired at the Cobra jawans from a higher terrain, hiding behind trees and rocks immediately after the blast. The officer said a major plan was chalked out at the meeting today to counter the rebels in Purulia. He refused to divulge details.

	Sept. 19: A tigress that had taken shelter in a cowshed injured a villager in the Sunderbans when he stumbled on it in the darkness last night.        
	Pradip Gayen had gone to the cowshed after he heard a strange sound.        
	He yelled for help and ran out. Neighbours called Sunderbans Tiger Reserve officials who tranquillised the animal and took it away.

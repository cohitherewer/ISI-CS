	Calcutta, Sept. 25: A telephone exchange code and an area code scribbled on a piece of paper by a south Calcutta boy suffering from autism, an affliction that has robbed him of the ability to express himself properly, has united him with his parents.        
	Gariahat resident Anirban Dey, 14, who suffers from pervasive developmental disorder  impaired social interaction and communication  was spotted by a man in front of Kavi Nazrul Metro station in Garia, around 8km from his home, at 9pm yesterday, around three hours after he went missing from his house.         
	The man informed the Metro authorities about the boy who did not look normal. Metro officials contacted the Patuli-Baishnabghata investigation centre, a unit of Jadavpur police station.         
	A police team took Anirban to the investigation centre. However, the boy could say nothing beyond his name.         
	The police then called a psychologist, Roop Kumar Ghosh, and social activist Sujoy Kumar Sarkar to talk to him. But when he could not say anything, we gave him a writing pad, a police officer said.        
	Autistic children often show a hightened ability to remember numbers.         
	Anirban first wrote frog and Pogo. Then he scribbled 2440, which we guessed could be a telephone exchange code. He also wrote Kol-19, the officer said.        
	The cops traced the codes to Gariahat and informed the police station there. The police station contacted Anirbans parents  Arindam and Sanghamitra Dey  who had already lodged a missing persons diary there and were frantically searching the neighbourhood for their son.        
	I was standing under Gariahat bridge when I received a call from the investigation centre at 11.45pm. I would not have got back my son had it not been for Rameshwar Ojha, the inspector in charge of the centre, Arindam said after returning home with his son at 1.30am.        
	Arindam said Anirban had told him he was travelling in a bus. The boys aunt, Aditi, said: We think he had hopped onto a bus and got down in front of the Metro station.

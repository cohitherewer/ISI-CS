          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 27: The Bengal Congress will hold a meeting on January 2 to appoint a new chief of the legislature party.        
	Manas Bhuniya, who became state party chief in June, has been continuing as CLP leader. Congress sources, however, said Bhuniya would step down as CLP chief in keeping with the partys one-person-one-post principle.         
	Congress sources said Abu Hena, who is presently the deputy chief of the CLP, was expected to succeed Bhuniya. Hena, a four-time Congress legislator from Lalgola in Murshidabad, is the eldest son of the late Abdus Sattar, the agriculture minister in the Siddhartha Shankar Ray cabinet during 1972-77.        
	S.M.S. Hyder, the secretary of the previous Pradesh Congress Committee, is expected to be elevated to the post of its general secretary.         
	Hyder represents a vast section of Urdu-speaking Muslims across the state. He deserves to be appointed PCC general secretary, an AICC leader said.

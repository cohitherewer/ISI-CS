          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Nov. 9: A suspected Maoist action squad member was arrested from the car of a Trinamul Congress leader today in West Midnapores Salboni soon after a party rally demanding the joint forces withdrawal.        
	Trinamul leaders claimed Kanchan Debsingha, picked up from the hired SUV of the Salboni block chief Nepal Singh this afternoon, was no longer a Maoist, having quit the rebels ranks and joined the party. Debashis Chowdhury, the district president of the Trinamul youth wing, was also present in the Sumo.        
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said Nepal Singh would be interrogated later. Another officer said Chowdhury would also be quizzed.        
	District Trinamul president Pranab Basu alleged that Kanchan, 40, had been held on trumped-up charges. Kanchan is no longer a Maoist. He is a Trinamul supporter. He was staying in one of our supporters house. Today, he went to attend a rally with our Salboni president. Police arrested Kanchan on false charges.        
	The CPM seized on the arrest to repeat its allegation that Trinamul was colluding with Maoists.         
	We have time and again said Trinamul and Maoists are hand in glove. It has been proved today with the arrest of the hardcore Maoist from the car of the Trinamul leader, district secretariat member Dahareswar Sen said.        
	Police chief Verma said there were at least 15 cases against Kanchan, including half-a-dozen related to murder. Kanchans younger brother Hemanta was killed in an encounter with the joint forces almost a year ago.

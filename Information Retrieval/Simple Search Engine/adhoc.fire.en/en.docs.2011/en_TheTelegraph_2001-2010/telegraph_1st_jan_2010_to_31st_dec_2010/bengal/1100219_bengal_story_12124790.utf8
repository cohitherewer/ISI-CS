          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta/Kharagpur, Feb. 18: An unclaimed packet was found today in the toilet of the Howrah-bound Ispat Express, triggering a bomb scare, but the bomb-disposal squad found no explosives.         
	The Titlagarh-Howrah Ispat Express was near Jhargram station when one passenger, D.S. Singh, noticed the packet. He saw two red wires coming out of the packet which was kept on a rack, a South Eastern Railway official said.         
	Singhs co-passengers informed Railway Protection Force personnel. The train was stopped between Jhargram and Sardiah. All 60 passengers were shifted to another bogie.

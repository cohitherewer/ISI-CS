	Bolpur, Dec. 1: Three armed youths looted Rs 34 lakh at gunpoint this afternoon from bank employees who had come to refill an ATM before speeding away on a bike through a bustling street in Birbhums Suri.        
	The police suspect the role of an insider and have started quizzing the bank employees. There must have been some one in the bank who tipped off the miscreants. Else, how did they know that the bank would refill that particular ATM counter at that time?, said Birbhum police chief Humayun Kabir.        
	The assistant manager of the Suri branch of SBI, Chandan Kanti Dutta, and another employee along with security staff Ghanashyam Goswami had come in a car to the ATM counter to refill it. The car had been hired and Rajkumar Mondal was the driver, a police officer said.         
	As soon as they got down from the car to enter the ATM, the three youths arrived on a bike. One of the youths pointed a revolver at the ATM guard and asked him to hand over his gun. Another youth pointed a revolver at the assistant manager and asked for the cash box. After taking the case, they sped away. All this was over within two to three minutes, an officer said.

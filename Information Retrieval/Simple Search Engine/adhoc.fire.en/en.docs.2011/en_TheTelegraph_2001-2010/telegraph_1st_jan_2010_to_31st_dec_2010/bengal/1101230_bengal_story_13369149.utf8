The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sitting MLAs to stay: Manas
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Sitting MLAs to stay: Manas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manas Bhuniya                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 29: State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya today said he would ensure that no sitting party legislator is sacrificed for the sake of the alliance.         
	Bhuniya said the Congress had to drop 14 sitting MLAs for the 2001 Assembly polls to keep the alliance with the Trinamul Congress. The party had accepted Mamata Banerjees terms and settled for only 57 of the 294 Assembly seats.        
	We dont want a repetition of that sordid episode, Bhuniya said today. Our primary objective is to ensure that all sitting party legislators get nominations. I shall stand by the sitting legislators so that they are not sacrificed just for the sake of the alliance.        
	Bhuniyas comments came three days after state leaders requested the party high command to ensure that an alliance with Trinamul was not on Mamata Banerjees terms and that the Congresss interests were safeguarded.        
	An AICC source said from Delhi that the state Congress would begin its poll preparations after Mondays extended executive committee meeting in Calcutta. The meeting will be chaired by Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.         
	A Congress leader said the district party presidents would be told at the meeting to prepare the groundwork at the block level for the polls. We shall seek lists of eligible candidates from the districts and send them to the high command for its approval, he added.        
	The AICC source praised Bhuniya for organising programmes to rejuvenate the partys beleaguered organisation since taking charge as state Congress chief.         
	Exodus from the Congress was almost a regular event some time back. But since Manas has taken over as state Congress chief, the trend has stopped. Instead, many are now rejoining the party, the source said.

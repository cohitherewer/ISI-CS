                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bid to expand Maoist list
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 6: Bengal police have recommended to the state home department that Nadia, Murshidabad and Birbhum be declared Maoist-affected in the wake of the growing rebel threat.         
	West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia have already been given the tag.         
	The additional director-general of police (law and order), Surajit Kar Purkayastha, said today: We have sent a written recommendation to the state home department to notify the three districts as Left-wing extremism-affected. They must be monitored closely for the growing threat.        
	He said the recommendation had been forwarded by the state home department to the Union home ministry.         
	Kar Purkayastha said that if the recommendation was accepted, areas under 20-odd police stations would be added to the existing 28 in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore that have been declared Maoist-affected.         
	Around five to seven police stations each from Nadia, Murshidabad and Birbhum would be declared Maoist-hit if the suggestion is accepted.         
	The police have been tracking the growing Maoist activities in the three districts, especially in areas where bheris (fisheries) abound. In the absence of forests, Maoists have chosen the fisheries as they are less accessible to the police, Kar Purkayastha said.        
	HC ban query        
	Calcutta High Court today directed the state government to file an affidavit stating whether the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities was being treated as a banned organisation under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

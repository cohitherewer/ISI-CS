The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | thank you, thank-you rally
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      thank you, thank-you rally
          Trinamul Congress supporters took out rallies across Calcutta on Saturday evening to celebrate the partys civic poll success. The Telegraph walked with three of them                                                  
	Wellington Square        
	Did they remember Mamata Banerjees promise and leave one flank of the road free?
  Yes. Half the Nirmal Chunder Street was left to traffic. About 250 people led by MP Sudip Bandopadhyay walked only about 100 metres through the busy road and slipped into the lanes and bylanes of Ward 51. They did emerge for about two minutes on SN Banerjee Road, where they blocked the entire thoroughfare before moving into the lanes again.         
	Concern for your ears:
  There were about half-a-dozen loudspeakers, but not the sort of din one would usually associate with the Opposition party.         
	Kick-off:
   Sudip went into former Congress chief minister B.C. Roys house and garlanded his bust.                        
	Harish Chatterjee Street        
	Did they remember Mamatas promise?
  The procession stuck to the lanes of the Kalighat-Hazra area. When it passed through the wider and busier Harish Mukherjee Road, a flank was left open.         
	What we saw:
  A new umbrella brand, called TMC.         
	Standout moment:
  A beaming Mamata waving at the procession as it passed her Harish Chatterjee Street home, her mother by her side.The smile vanished as photographers pleaded with her to position herself better for their lenses. In she went in a huff.                  
	Shyambazar-Hatibagan        
	Did they remember Mamatas promise?
  Through the lanes and bylanes again, not disturbing evening traffic.
  When the marchers did emerge briefly on Bidhan Sarani and Aurobindo Sarani, the leaders ensured their comrades did not break the invisible cordon.         
	Concern for your ears: 
  Loudspeakers, but with Rabindrasangeet wafting out. Never mind the interruptions by cries of Maa, mati, manush.        
	What we saw:
   Balloons in Trinamul colours and women in saris with the party symbol lining their borders. Not to be outdone, the men wore panjabis with the flowers hanging over their bellies.         
	Standout moment:
  The balloons going up in the evening sky as a symbol of peace. The marchers sang We shall overcome.

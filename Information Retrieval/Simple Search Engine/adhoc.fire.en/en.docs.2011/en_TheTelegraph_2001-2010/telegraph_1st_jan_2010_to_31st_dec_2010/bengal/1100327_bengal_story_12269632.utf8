	Tamluk, March 26: The Trinamul Congress, which had driven Tata Motors out of Bengal, is now in the ring to ensure production at a Tata plant.        
	A group of workers determined to defy a month-long strike and join work at the Tata Chemicals factory in Haldia today beat up protesting Citu leaders and chased them away, triggering a CPM-Trinamul clash.        
	The Citu leaders alleged the workers who wanted to resume duty were acting at the behest of a Trinamul union.        
	Arjun Mondal, general secretary of the Citu union, and his colleague Janamejoy Mondal had to be taken to a nursing home with head and hand injuries.        
	After the Citu protesters fled, leaders of the Trinamul union took over the protest venue outside the factory gate.        
	Workers do not support the illegal strike called by Citu. The workers today made it clear that they wanted to join work. We will make arrangements so that normal production begins from tomorrow, said Subhendu Adhikari, now the Trinamul MP from Tamluk, earlier a face of the Singur agitation that resulted in Tata Motors exit in 2008.        
	Citu controls the contractor labourers union, which has called the strike, and Trinamul the permanent employees union. Production has been stalled since February 24, when about 800 contractor workers owing allegiance to the Citu union went on a strike on behalf of the 200-odd day labourers among them. The day labourers earn Rs 200 a day on an average but do not get work through the year. They are demanding fixed monthly wages.        
	Nearly 50 workers marched to the factory gate around 2pm to join work but were stopped by the Citu activists.         
	We were told by Citu leaders to return home as the strike was on. But how could I listen to them? I have a wife and three school-going children to support, said Bijoy Mondal, 35, a worker in the maintenance department.        
	After an altercation, the willing workers hurled stones at the Citu activists, hitting Arjun and Janamejoy. Later, a group of about 30 CPM cadres arrived in jeeps and on motorcycles but fled when they saw at least 200 Trinamul supporters, including women, waving party flags and running towards them.         
	Some Citu activists hid in a union office and had to be rescued by 50 policemen.         
	Sudarshan Manna, a Citu district secretariat member, said: Trinamul attacked our leaders in a planned manner. They are out to foil the strike. Citu will continue with it.

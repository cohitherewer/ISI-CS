The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pranab clean chit to Mamata 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Pranab clean chit to Mamata 
  - NO LINks with Maoists           A STAFF REPORTER                          Mukherjee and Forward Bloc veteran Ashoke Ghosh hug at a function at Bidhan Sishu Udyan to unveil a statue of late Congress leader Atulya Ghosh. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 29: Pranab Mukherjee today defended Mamata Banerjee on her Lalgarh rally statement advocating talks with Maoists, saying the remarks did not mean that she had links with the rebels.        
	If Mamata thinks that the Maoist problem can be solved through dialogue, she is free to say that. It should not be interpreted that she has links with Maoists. She might be a constituent of the UPA but that does not mean that as a separate political party, they (Trinamul) cannot have an independent thinking, the Union finance minister said after a book release programme at Calcutta Press Club.        
	Asked specifically whether he thought the Trinamul Congress chief had links with the Maoists, Mukherjee said: I dont think so. Mamata told us everything at a meeting where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister P. Chidambaram and myself were present.         
	He was referring to Mamatas meeting with Singh last week when she had demanded the demolition of CPMs camps in the rebel-infested Jungle Mahal saying arms were allegedly being stockpiled in such bases.        
	The finance minister also claimed Mamatas statements on Azads death at her August 9 Lalgarh rally did not amount to contradicting the Centres stand. Mamata had said that if Azad was killed at a time he was trying to initiate talks with the Centre, that should be explained. Even the Andhra Pradesh (Congress) government came out with a statement after Azads death. So, there is no contradiction in Mamatas statements with the stated policy of the UPA government.         
	On Trinamuls allegations that armed CPM cadres are using the joint forces to reclaim lost ground in Jungle Mahal, he said: The Union home ministry is looking into the matter.        
	Late this evening, Mamata said her MPs would meet the Prime Minister tomorrow or Tuesday with the demand for the demolition of the camps. We will keep pleading with the Centre, she said.        
	Mukherjees clean chit to Mamata today is seen to have two positive fallouts for her. One, it will help further cement the alliance between her party and the Congress. Two, his remarks will enable Trinamul to counter more forcefully the CPMs allegations that it is hobnobbing with Maoists.        
	Now, Pranabdas remarks will help us counter the CPMs slur, said state Trinamul chief Subrata Bakshi. The CPM smelt alliance pressures. Since Mamata is a UPA constituent, there are coalition compulsions, said state secretariat member Mohammed Salim.        
	Rahul rally        
	K. Keshava Rao, the AICC general secretary minding Bengal, today asked state leaders to bring supporters by the truckloads to Rahul Gandhis Calcutta rally on September 6.

	Calcutta, Jan. 9: Ardhendu Sen, the home secretary, today said the government would seek 10 companies of central paramilitary forces for deployment in the Maoist-infested areas of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia.        
	The request will be made at a meeting called by the Union home secretary in Delhi on January 12.         
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and director- general of police Bhupinder Singh will attend it.        
	Twenty-four companies of central forces (each has 100 jawans) are deployed in the Maoist zone of Lalgarh and its surrounding areas.         
	We have got some success (in Lalgarh), Sen said. We are getting necessary information and co-ordination with the local people is good.         
	Asked about Kishanji, Sen said the rebel leader was in the Maoist belt.        
	He said from the time the joint forces had entered Lalgarh, ration shops and government offices have opened.         
	Asked whether the songs of Trinamul MP Kabir Suman on Chhatradhar Mahato were anti-national, he said: I have not heard the songs. Let me hear them. But I dont think it could be called deshodrohita.        
	Arms haul        
	Police on Saturday found arms and ammunition from a jungle near Jamda village in Lalgarh early in the morning.        
	The police said they carried out a raid on a tip-off and seized four single-barrel guns, a double-barrel gun and a country-made revolver besides 12 bore ammunition.        
	The police said the guns could be the ones the Maoists had been collecting from villagers in Lalgarh, Salboni, Binpur and neighbourhood areas over the past one year.

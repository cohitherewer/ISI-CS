The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rail plots for dozen medical colleges
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rail plots for dozen medical colleges
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 23: Bengal may get 12 new medical colle-ges linked to super-speciali- ty hospitals under a joint railway-health initiative to use railway land to develop healthcare infrastructure.         
	The railways have offered land for hospitals with medical colleges in Andal, Asansol, Dankuni, Kanchrapara, Kharagpur and New Jalpaiguri, junior Union health minister Dinesh Trivedi said today. The six sites are in addition to Haldia, Howrah, New Farakka, Malda town, Paglachandi (in Malda district), and Siliguri, identified earlier by railway minister Mamata Banerjee.         
	Bengal needs medical colleges and super-speciality hospitals, Trivedi said. Why should patients from Bengal travel for treatment. We find them in Chennai, Vellore and Hyderabad.         
	The 12 sites are among about 40 across India where the railway ministry will offer 20 acres for a hospital with super-speciality medical services such as cardiothoracic surgery, nephrology or neurosurgery.         
	The initiative follows a memorandum of understanding signed by Mamata and health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad earlier this year. The health ministry plans to eventually set up outpatient clinics and diagnostic centres at all 8,000 railway stations across India, and general hospitals on railway land at over 90 places where it will get 5 to 10 acres.         
	No land will be transferred to the private sector. This is likely to work on a public-private partnership, said Trivedi, Mamatas party colleague.         
	Trivedi added that the medical and diagnostic services at the new centres would charge everyone except those below the poverty line.        
	A senior doctor and member of a government task force on medical education said the initiative to increase the number of hospitals and medical colleges was likely to encounter investment and faculty challenges. Theres a faculty shortage and starting new hospitals and associated medical colleges from scratch will take time, the doctor said. But this initiative may be one way to have a uniform spread of colleges across India, he added.         
	The colleges are now clustered in the southern states.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      SC bandh notice to Gurung
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 11: The Supreme Court today issued contempt notices to Gorkha Janmukti Morcha president Bimal Gurung and two others for repeatedly violating its order not to obstruct National Highway 31A, land-locked Sikkims only road link with the rest of the country.        
	A two-judge vacation bench served the notices on Gurung, Morcha assistant secretary Binay Tamang and the chief of a Siliguri-based anti-Gorkhaland outfit, Mukunda Majumdar. It also asked the Centre and Bengals chief secretary and home secretary to explain why the steps they had taken to keep the highway free of blockades were not working.         
	Acting on a plea by Gangtok resident .P. Bhandari, the court had twice asked political parties not to block the road as it caused immense hardships to the people of Sikkim.        
	Bhandari filed the contempt petition against the Morcha and the Bangla Bangla Bhasha Banchao Committee, alleging that the two outfits together had called at least seven strikes since December 14, 2009, and urged the court to give their leaders the maximum punishment possible.         
	Although the law prescribes a maximum jail term of six months for contempt of court, the apex court can exercise its extraordinary powers and order any punishment.         
	ABGL rally        
	The Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League today held a rally at the spot where its chief Madan Tamang was killed by all- eged Morcha supporters last month. But the turnout of only 120 people was a reminder to Morcha rivals that they had to do more to throw a credible challenge to Gurung.

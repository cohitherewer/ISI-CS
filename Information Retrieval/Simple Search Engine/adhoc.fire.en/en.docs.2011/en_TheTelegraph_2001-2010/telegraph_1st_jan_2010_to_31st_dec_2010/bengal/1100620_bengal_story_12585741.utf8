The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha off the roads 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Morcha off the roads 
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, June 19: The hills shut down on the first day of the indefinite bandh called by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha but its supporters did not put up pickets on the streets to flaunt their might as in the past.        
	Instead, CRPF jawans, posted after Morcha rival Madan Tamangs daylight murder, patrolled the town. Also, unlike in the past, the highway to Sikkim was left free for traffic.        
	Although we had kept NH31A out of the strikes purview, very few vehicles plied today, said Morcha assistant secretary Binay Tamang.         
	Explaining the reason for not putting up pickets, treasurer Dawa Lama said: There is no need to post pickets as the entire hill people are with us.        
	But on all occasions the Morcha had called bandhs in the past, it had put up pickets.        
	A leader said the change in stance was because the party did not want to do anything that could precipitate the situation, especially now that the CRPF was out on the streets. We have been able to contain the backlash of Tamangs killing to a significant extent, a Morcha leader said. We do not want to provoke any violence in the hills. Everyone can see the bandh has been totally peaceful as well as complete, though we did not come out.        
	The leader said the Morcha wanted to convey to the people that it wanted peace.        
	The Morcha also allowed people with important work or travel plans in the plains to leave the hills.        
	There are few tourists now. But some of the few here availed of vehicles arranged by the Morcha to leave the hills.

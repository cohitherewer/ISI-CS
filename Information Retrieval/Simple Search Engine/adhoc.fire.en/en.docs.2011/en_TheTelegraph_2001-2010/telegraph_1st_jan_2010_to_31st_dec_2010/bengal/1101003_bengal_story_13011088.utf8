                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Citu stalls ONGC work on job demand
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           The ONGC project site at Durgapur. (Gour Sharma)                                  
	Durgapur, Oct. 2: Over 200 Citu activists have allegedly stalled work at an exploration site of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) near Durgapur, demanding jobs as contract labourers.        
	They also locked up 13 contract labourers at the site in Sharpi village during a raid last night. Though police rescued the workers this morning, work is yet to resume.         
	ONGC has hired a private company to dig the site to find if pollution-free shale gas is available beneath for exploration.        
	The Citu activists allegedly asked around 60 workers engaged in drilling holes to leave. As the workers left, 24 of the activists entered the site around 10pm, waving red flags. They overpowered the security guards and forcibly wrote their own names in the contract workers attendance register.         
	Then they locked the main gate of the fenced compound before leaving around 11pm, trapping 13 workers sleeping at the site office.        
	We woke up after hearing a commotion outside. We came out and found that we had been locked, Brindaban Das, a contract labourer, said.         
	Ranjit Mukherjee, a Burdwan committee member of Citu, denied that the activists had locked up the workers.         
	An official of the private company hired by ONGC said: We had decided to engage 36 workers for the excavation work, nine each from Citu, Intuc, INTTUC and the SUCI. However, Citu has demanded that 24 workers be taken from their union.        
	Fake cop arrested        
	The CID today arrested a man in Durgapur for allegedly posing as an IPS officer and collecting money from unemployed youths on the promise of giving them jobs.         
	Harshvir Pandey, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, had also eloped with a minor girl from New Town, where he had stayed for a year posing as a Narcotics Control Bureau official, on the false promise of marrying her. The cops have rescued the girl and seized two police uniforms, a car and a toy pistol from Pandey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Promise to start project after carve-up
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Promise to start project after carve-up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta, Feb. 8: Sajjan Jindal today provided steam to the proposed Salboni steel project that could bring Bengal its biggest private investment yet, but hived off a power plant from its original plan.        
	His company now plans to build the power plant near its coal reserves in Burdwans Ichhapur.        
	Jindal met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and promised to start work on both the steel and power plants in six months. The 3-million-tonne steel plant will be completed in 30 months once work starts. The 1,600MW power project will be ready in 42 months, the vice-chairman and managing director of the JSW Group announced after the meeting at Writers Buildings.        
	The Rs 17,280-crore group plans to buy 500 acres near Durgapur on its own for the power plant. We will save on transportation costs by not carrying the coal to Salboni, explained Biswadip Gupta, the CEO of JSW Bengal Steel.         
	However, the realignment would also help the group de-risk its investment.         
	There are concerns about law and order in Salboni bec- ause of Maoist presence. The rebels had triggered a blast targeting the chief minister while he was returning from the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the steel plant on November 2, 2008. Police raids that followed had sown the seeds of the tribal agitation against the administration in Lalgarh, which the Maoists used to launch their own war against the state.         
	The issue came up today and the chief minister promised security to Jindal. After the meeting, Jindal iterated that his employees security was paramount for him.        
	At Ichhapur in Burdwan, security should not be an issue. Moreover, power is a more lucrative business in the short term than steel.        
	The total investment in the projects at Salboni and Ichhapur will be around Rs 20,000 crore, Jindal said.         
	The company had earlier indicated that construction of the steel project could only start in mid-2011. However, the likelihood of Japanese steel gi-ant JFE partnering JSW, Indias largest private steelmaker, in the Bengal project appears to have brightened the chances of faster progress.        
	JFE is likely to pick up 26-40 per cent of the equity in JSW Bengal, the company that will execute the Salboni project. The Japanese have visited the site. They have liked it very much, Jindal said today.         
	JSWs Bengal project has everything that a steel project needs  land, mines, environment approval and special economic zone status.        
	However, soon after the chief minister had laid the foundation stone, the project had plunged into uncertainty because of the global financial turmoil. JSW stopped work on the Salboni project as the demand for steel dwindled and prices went down. The company cited non-availability of funds for the delay.        
	The crisis had coincided with the security fears, clouding the entire project.        
	I have no expertise in assessing security. It is the job of the government to ensure that the (Salboni) site is conducive to investment and the chief minister has assured us (of security), Jindal said today.         
	He went to Writers on the eve of Union home minister P. Chidambarams meeting in Calcutta with the chief ministers and officials of four Maoist-hit states  Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa and Bihar  to work out a joint programme to tackle the guerrillas.

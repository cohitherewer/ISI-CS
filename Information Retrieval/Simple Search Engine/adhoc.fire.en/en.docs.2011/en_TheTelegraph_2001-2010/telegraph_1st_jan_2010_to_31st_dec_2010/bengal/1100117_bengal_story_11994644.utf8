The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Left OK with MK, Trinamul...
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Left OK with MK, Trinamul...
          OUR BUREAU                          MK Narayanan                                  
	Jan. 16: CPM leaders expressed guarded satisfaction on the nomination of M.K. Narayanan as governor of Bengal hours before the formal announcement today while the Trinamul Congress said it was least bothered about who moved into the Raj Bhavan.         
	Late tonight, the Rashtrapati Bhavan gave its assent to the appointment of five governors, including Narayanan, the outgoing national security adviser.         
	K. Sankaranarayanan moves to Maharashtra from Jharkhand where Congress leader M.O.H. Farooq will take charge. Former home minister Shivraj Patil is being sent to Punjab and Chhattisgarh governor E.S.L. Narasimhan will be shifted full-time to Andhra Prad-esh. Former defence secretary Shekhar Dutt is expected to take over in Chhattisgarh.        
	CPM leaders in Calcutta said the Centre had consulted chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee before finalising Narayanan as the successor to Gopalkrishna Gandhi. The state government has been consulted and the chief minister has agreed, a state secretariat member said.         
	Why should the party oppose? The matter does not concern the party but the Centre and the state government.... The Prime Minister is in town (Calcutta) and he must have spoken with the chief minister, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said in reply to a question this afternoon.        
	Although the CPM is more than happy, the bitter experience with Gandhi, whose appointment was greeted with elation that soured when he issued statements on Nandigram and other contentious subjects, has prompted the party to be cautious.        
	Our options were limited. The Centre had wanted to send N.D. Tiwari and we objected even before he landed in a sex scandal in Andhra. Narayanan is better than any Congress politician. After all, he is a career bureaucrat and has no personal agenda, even though he is ideologically anti-Left, the secretariat member said.         
	He did not refer to the issue but some sections of the party feel that the outgoing national security advisers perceived differences with Union home minister P. Chidambaram will work to the Left Fronts advantage as far as the Raj Bhavans potential to nettle the state government is concerned.        
	The friction between Chidambaram and the state on some issues such as political clashes is well known, and the CPM feels Narayanan will not go out of his way to help the Union home ministry build its case against the Left administration.        
	The CPM leaders did not mind Narayanans pro-active role in shaping the Indo-US nuclear deal, which the Left had opposed tooth and nail. Instead, they found virtue in his bureaucratic background.         
	He did what he was told to do by the government on the nuclear deal. Thats expected from a bureaucrat. We would rather begin with a clean slate. Let us watch him first in his new role, a central committee member said.         
	Narayanans strong aversion to Maoists and his experience in tackling them has also enthused the CPM. He may be anti-Left. But he is more opposed to the Maoists, a CPM veteran said.         
	Trinamul sought to cut a nonchalant front. We are least bothered about who is being appointed governor. But whoever he may be, he must work impartially like Gandhi. He should govern the state as its constitutional head, said state president Subrata Bakshi.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, May 25: The Left Front today observed a 12-hour bandh in the Sunderbans, which was ravaged by cyclone Aila last year, to protest the Centres alleged apathy in disbursing funds sanctioned for the rehabilitation of the victims.        
	Subhas Naskar, the irrigation minister and RSP MLA from Basanti in the Sunderbans, said at Writers Buildings today that the state government had requested the Centre to sanction Rs 6,000 crore for repairing the 3,500km river embankments. The Centre had agreed to sanction Rs 5,032 crore but till today, we have not received the money, he said.         
	Naskar said that after Aila, the Centre had promised Rs 1,000 crore to the state government for the rehabilitation of the affected villagers. But till today, only Rs 186 crore has been sanctioned. Until now, we have spent Rs 700 crore on rehabilitation and repairing the damaged embankments, he said.         
	Around 42 lakh villagers in the 19 blocks of the Sunderbans were affected by Aila.

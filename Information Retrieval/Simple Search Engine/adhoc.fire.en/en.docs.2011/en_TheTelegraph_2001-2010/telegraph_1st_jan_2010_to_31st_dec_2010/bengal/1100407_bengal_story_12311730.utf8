          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Poles erected two years ago for village electrification remain as they were in Belpahari. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, April 6: Block development officers in Bengals Maoist hotbeds have been advised not to venture out even with police escort, prompting suggestions the move amounts to a virtual surrender before the guerrillas.        
	The verbal advisory, issued hours after this mornings Maoist strike in Chhattisgarh, to the officers in sensitive areas of rebel-hit West Midnapore comes two days after Lalgarh villagers clamoured for development before P. Chidambaram during the Union home ministers visit to the town.         
	If the BDOs are asked not to visit sensitive areas, how can their subordinates visit these places? This means the administration is surrendering to the Maoists threats. It will result in a total halt to development activities, said an officer of Binpur II block.        
	The advisory covers Binpur I and II, Jhargram, Jamboni, Gopiballavpur I and II, Sankrail and Nayagram blocks.         
	In Lalgarh (part of Bin- pur I), construction of roads and reservoirs has come to a standstill since November 2008. In Belpahari (under Binpur II), work on four roads has stopped. Work on rural electrification has hardly progressed, said a district official.         
	The trigger for the advisory could be an incident yesterday. About 1,000 villagers under the banner of Agragami Krishak Shramik Aikya  a front of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities  had threatened to teach the Nayagram BDO a lesson after he refused to step out of his office to receive their memorandum. The police had chased the villagers away.        
	Since the BDO, Priyanjan Das, is facing threats indirectly from Maoists, we brought him to Midnapore town with police escort. We also asked the BDOs of the other troubled areas to move around with caution, said West Midnapore district magistrate N.S. Nigam, who was with Chidambaram when the development cry rent the air.        
	They (Lalgarh villagers) are... agitated that they dont have education, electricity, medical care, Chidambaram had said.        
	A district official who did not want to be named said the advisory went beyond urging caution. We have asked the BDOs not to go to sensitive areas even with police escort.         
	The BDOs refused comment. District officials said they were soft targets.        
	Asked about the potential blow to development activities because of the restrictions, a senior official said: There is no need for a BDO to visit every development project frequently. Inspections can be carried out by his subordinates.        
	DM Nigam echoed the view, saying development work would continue. Even if a BDO is asked to return to Midnapore town, his staff will continue the work.        
	Some would argue that work would not be affected because there hardly was any even when there were no restrictions on movement. The poles in Belpahari meant to carry power to villages, standing without cables for nearly two years, bear testimony to that.

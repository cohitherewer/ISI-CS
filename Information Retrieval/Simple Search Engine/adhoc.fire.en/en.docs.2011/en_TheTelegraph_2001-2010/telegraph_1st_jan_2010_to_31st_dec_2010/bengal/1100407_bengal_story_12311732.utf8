The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul no-help vow
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul no-help vow
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 6: The Trinamul Congress and the Congress today held a joint news conference to scoff at the governments plea for co-operation to help it bring normality to the states violence-racked pockets.        
	Why should we co-operate with a government that unleashes terror on our party activists? Let the government first stop its state-sponsored violence, Trinamul secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said.         
	While asserting yesterday that the states law and order was his responsibility, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said: But the Opposition should behave properly.... (Union home minister P.) Chidambaram should convince the Opposition parties to attend all-party meetings.         
	The reminder to the Opposition about its responsibility had come in reaction to the Union home ministers remark that the buck stops at the chief ministers table and stern measures had to be taken to maintain law and order.         
	Trinamuls Chatterjee justified his partys non-participation in all-party meetings. The question of joining all-party meetings does not arise until the government stops its atrocities on the Opposition and innocent people.         
	He also took exception to the chief ministers remark that the Opposition should behave properly. A person who doesnt know how to behave is asking us to behave properly. We are not going to learn anything from him.        
	Chatterjee must have had in mind the chief ministers remarks in the Assembly last month. What do I say about the leader of the Opposition? His speeches are so bad.... Its a punishment listening to what he says. I feel petrified, Bhattacharjee had said during the discussion on the state budget. Trinamul boycotted the rest of the budget session in protest.         
	Congress leaders, whom Bhattacharjee had called spineless during the bad-speaker jab at Chatterjee, today joined their ally in justifying the Oppositions non-co-operation. We had earlier attended all-party meetings called by the state government to plan relief after natural calamities like cyclone Aila.... But the government didnt accept our suggestions. Should we attend all-party meetings only to put a seal of approval on what the government is doing? asked state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya. We cannot stand by a government that tries to throttle the Opposition, he added.        
	The two Opposition parties today stayed away from the Raj Bhavan where two new ministers of state were sworn in.

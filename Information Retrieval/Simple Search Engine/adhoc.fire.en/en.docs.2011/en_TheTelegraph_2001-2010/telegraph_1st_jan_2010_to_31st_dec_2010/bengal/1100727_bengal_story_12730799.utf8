          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 26: The Congress today removed four district presidents from their posts for opposing the alliance with the Trinamul Congress before the May civic polls.        
	The AICC had directed the state unit to remove those responsible for the collapse of the alliance in Bengal.        
	While Pradip Ghosh, Nirbed Roy and Pranab Basu had organised hunger strikes demanding that they be allowed to put up candidates independently after Mamata Banerjee refused to part with more than 25 seats in Calcutta, Shankar Singh had fielded a candidate against the Trinamul nominee in Nadias Ranaghat.        
	Ghosh, Roy and Basu were the district presidents of central, south and north Calcutta respectively. Singh was the Nadia Congress president.        
	We have brought in new faces to replace the four. The party could have fared better in the civic polls had we formed an alliance with Trinamul. We had to suffer because of their wrong assessment, an AICC leader said from Delhi.        
	He said that by suspending the recalcitrant leaders, the party wanted to send the message to Mamata that the Congress was keen on retaining the alliance ahead of the Assembly polls next year.        
	State Congress president Manas Bhuniya today parried questions on the suspensions. I will not go into the details behind their removal. It was done in accordance with a directive from the AICC, he said.

	Durgapur, Nov. 21: A 20-year-old youth is feared drowned after he went to save his brother in the Damodar river near Durgapur barrage this morning.        
	Sanjay Singh, 20, a Class XII student at Benachiti Hindi High School, had gone with his parents and brother Amarnath, 13, a Class VII student, for a dip in the Damodar on Rash Purnima around 6.30am.        
	His father Mathuraprasad Singh, a worker at a coal depot in Waria on the outskirts of Durgapur town, said Sanjay was learning swimming and was near the bank when he heard his brothers screams.         
	Amarnath was very enthusiastic about bathing in the river but did not know swimming. Suddenly, we heard his shouts for help and saw Sanjay jump into the water to save him. But after saving Amarnath, Sanjay could not swim out because of the strong currents, Mathuraprasad said.        
	A search for Sanjay with local fishermen had not yielded results till this evening.                                
	Amarnath was very enthusiastic about bathing in the river but did not know swimming. Before we could ask him to be cautious, he went deep in the water. Sanjay who was learning how to swim was nearer to the bank. Suddenly we heard Amarnaths shouts for help and saw Sanjay slide across deeper in the water to save his brother. After saving Amarnath, Sanjay could not swim out of the current, said Mathuraprasad, a worker at a coal depot in Waria on the outskirts of Durgapur town.

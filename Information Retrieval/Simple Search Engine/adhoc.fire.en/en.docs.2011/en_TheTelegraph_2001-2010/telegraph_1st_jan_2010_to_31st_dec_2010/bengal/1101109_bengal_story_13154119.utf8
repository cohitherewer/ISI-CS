The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | BJP entry flutter in Malda Trinamul
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      BJP entry flutter in Malda Trinamul
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Nov. 8: The induction of three BJP councillors into the district Trinamul Congress and the nomination of one of them as its youth wing president has created dissent in the party.        
	District Trinamul president Sabitri Mitra said the three BJP councillors  Amlan Bhaduri, Sanjoy Dey and Bulu Chowdhury  would join the party along with their supporters in the presence of Mamata Banerjee in Calcutta on November 15.        
	However, the incumbent Trinamul Youth Congress district president Ananta Chakrabarty has threatened to quit the party if Bhaduri replaces him.         
	I and my supporters have set up units in blocks by touring the length and breadth of the district. Now we are no longer being backed by the party high command. If we have become untouchables, what is the use of remaining with the party? We have no objection to Bhaduri joining the party, but his nomination as the youth president will not be accepted by our members, Chakrabarty said.        
	He said he had already informed the district and state leadership of the party about this dissent and claimed that many were willing to leave the party because of this decision.         
	Even Babla Sarkar, the former Trinamul district president, expressed dissatisfaction over the issue. This dissidence has been created because Bhaduri has been nominated as a youth leader. Many from other parties are joining the Trinamul Congress ahead of the Assembly elections next year, Sarkar said.        
	Mitra, however, did not give much credence to the dissent. Only a handful are showing dissent, which will not have much affect on the party. We are trying to strengthen the party in Malda. The three BJP councillors are front-ranking leaders of their party and have large following, she said.        
	The district president said Bhaduri had won the last civic elections for the second time from Ward 13 and had polled nearly 90 per cent of the votes.         
	More and more leaders from other parties are joining us and we are getting feelers even from CPM leaders across the district. Things are looking bright for Trinamul in Malda, Mitra said.

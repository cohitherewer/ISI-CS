          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 9: The CPM today named its bypoll candidate for Durgapur I amid questions over whether the winds of change blowing across the state will also blow it away from an area its has held for over three decades.        
	Archana Bhattacharya, 69, who has been associated with the partys womens wing since 1970, will be the Left Front candidate from the seat that fell vacant with the death of power minister Mrinal Banerjee in February.        
	The CPM has won in Durgapur since 1967, with an exception in 1972 when Siddhartha Shankar Ray became the chief minister. Banerjee had a winning margin of 40,000 votes in 2006. Trinamul had not even put up a candidate against him, supporting then ally BJP instead.         
	In the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, when Mamata Banerjees party put up a stunning performance across Bengal, the CPM candidate had led by over 16,000 votes in Durgapur I.        
	Trinamul will contest the seat this time, hoping to carry on here its habit of winning elsewhere in the state. Junior Union minister Sisir Adhikari said Trinamul was hoping that the Congress would support them and ensure a united Opposition.         
	However, the Congress is yet to take a decision. Pranabda will take a call on Sunday, said state Congress working president working president Pradip Bhattacharya.         
	The filing of nominations for the July 5 bypoll will continue for a week from June 11. The result will be declared on July 8.

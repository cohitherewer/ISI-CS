The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sonia so near, yet Mamata so far
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Sonia so near, yet Mamata so far
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Calcutta, Sept. 2: Mamata Banerjees Singur chalo programme on September 25 will coincide with Sonia Gandhis visit to the state.         
	The Trinamul Congress organises the programme at Singur every year on September 25. On that day four years ago, Mamata Banerjee and some party functionaries were allegedly beaten up by police and CPM activists there while protesting the forcible acquisition of land from farmers for the Nano car project in the .         
	However, this year, Sonia is slated to address a Congress convention at Netaji Indoor Stadium on that day. The event is part of the partys country-wide programme to mark 125 years of its existence.        
	After chairing her partys core committee meeting at Trinamul Bhavan in Topsia, Mamata said today: We will organise a Singur chalo programme on September 25 as part of our month-long agitation against the CPMs reign of terror and to remember and protest the attack on me and other Trinamul workers on that day. Raj Kukar Bhulu, a Trinamul worker, was killed in the attack on us on September 25, 2006.        
	Mamata, however, parried questions on why her party was organising the event on the day the Congress president was expected to be in Calcutta. We have been observing September 25 as Singur Day every year since 2007. Our Singur movement has set an example to the entire country. We feel proud that our agitation has forced the Centre to consider a new legislation so that land is not acquired (forcibly) from poor farmers, she said.         
	Trinamul sources said the Singur event would help Mamata impress upon Sonia her sway over Bengal politics.         
	Soniaji will be impressed by our ability to mobilise a large number of party workers to Singur, said Trinamuls Sisir Adhikari, the Union junior minister for rural development.        
	Another Trinamul event is scheduled on a day Rahul Gandhi is slated to visit Bengal.        
	Trinamuls month-long agitation programme will be kicked off with a march to West Midnapores Keshpur on September 6, the day the AICC general secretary is to address a public rally at the Shahid Minar ground.        
	However, Mamata will not be present at Keshpur. Trinamul Youth Congress president Subhendu Adhikari will oversee the programme.         
	Trinamul sources said Mamata would not attend the Keshpur event because there was a possibility of Rahul visiting her Kalighat home.         
	The Trinamul Congress chief said she would lead a padayatra from College Square to Esplanade on September 8 to protest the CPMs reign of terror. On September 15, she will take part in a procession from Sashan to Rajarhat in North 24-Parganas. She will also participate in a rally in Birbhums Nanoor on September 19. On September 30, she will lead a padayatra at Canning in South 24-Parganas.         
	Our objective behind the month-long movement is to isolate the communists from the masses in rural Bengal, Mamata said.

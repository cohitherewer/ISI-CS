	Rajabandh, May 30: Around 2,500 railway personnel worked through Saturday night, clearing the lines, replacing the damaged tracks along a 300-metre stretch and testing them, before declaring them open for normal train services early this morning.         
	The line for Mumbai-bound trains  on which the Jnaneswari Express was running before it was thrown off the tracks by suspected Maoist sabotage and some of its coaches were smashed by a goods train from the opposite direction  was restored around 3am. The parallel line got the fit certificate at 8am.         
	A goods train was the first to use the newly laid Mumbai line at 4.45am. The Puri-Delhi Purshottam Express was the first to carry people across the stretch at 6.10am.        
	It ran at 30kmph, said Ravi Byas, who is from the railways Kharagpur workshop. But it gave us our first cheer since Friday. Till then we had only been cutting coaches and pulling bodies out.        
	The Kharagpur-Tata Passenger passed 10 minutes later. The Ahmedabad Express, Mumbai Mail, Porbandar Express, Tata Steel Express and the Barbil Janshatabdi followed.         
	Most of them were scheduled to cross the section at night but had been rescheduled because of the Maoist threat.        
	Train schedules        
	Services may have resumed on the Kharagpur-Tata section, but several trains scheduled to leave Howrah over the next few days have been cancelled or rescheduled and diverted.         
	The Howrah-Adra-Chakradharpur and Howrah-Adra-Bokaro passenger trains, which leave Howrah at 11.30pm every day, have been cancelled till June 2.         
	The Howrah-Hatia Express will run through Asansol, Dhanbad, Bokaro and Muri till June 2. The Howrah-Koraput Express will run through Kharagpur, Bhadrak and Sambalpur till June 2.         
	It is a cascading effect of the accident, said a South Eastern Railway official.         
	Five trains  the Mumbai Mail via Nagpur, Howrah-Pune Azad Hind Express, Jnan- eswari Express, Ahmedabad Express and the Jabalpur summer special  that were originally scheduled to leave Howrah on Sunday were rescheduled on Monday morning.

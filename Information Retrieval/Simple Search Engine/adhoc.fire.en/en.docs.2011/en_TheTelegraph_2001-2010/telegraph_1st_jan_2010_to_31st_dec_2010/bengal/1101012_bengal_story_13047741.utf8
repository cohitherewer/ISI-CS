The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist demon stalks Lalgarh Pujas
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoist demon stalks Lalgarh Pujas
          NARESH JANA                          An artist gives finishing touches to the Durga idol at Lalgarh on Monday. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Lalgarh, Oct. 11: The Goddess has arrived but there is one demon she is yet to slay: the fear of Maoists.        
	A day after the CPM reclaimed Lalgarh from the Maoists, residents of the West Midnapore town have asked Puja priests to wrap up the rituals by sundown, fearing retaliation by the rebels. Only one Durga Puja is organised in Lalgarh town.        
	However, the priests, Jaladhar Banerjee and Kalidas Chakraborty, said that was difficult because the rituals had to be conducted according to the time schedule mentioned in the almanac.         
	We dont know how it is possible to wind up the rituals before sundown every day. At this time of the year, the sun sets around 5pm. According to the almanac, the Shandhi Puja on Ashtami this year has to begin at 5.49pm and end by 6.37pm, Jaladhar, 50, said.        
	But Tapas Adhikari, the secretary of the Puja committee, said he was helpless.        
	What can we do if the residents, who have paid subscription for the Pujas, ask us to finish the rituals before sunset? No one wants to stay outdoors after dusk, Adhikari said.        
	Although Adhikari would not be drawn on whether the residents feared a Maoist backlash after the CPMs recapture of Lalgarh, a member of the Puja committee, Sheikh Alimuddin, was more direct.        
	After the CPM entered Lalgarh in a huge procession yesterday, the people are fearing that the Maoists could strike back any moment. It is because of this reason that the people do not want to stay outdoors after dusk, Alimuddin said.        
	Adhikari said that last year too, the fear of Maoist attacks had cast a shadow on Puja festivities in Lalgarh.         
	He said that last year, during the peak of the Maoist menace, the Puja budget had been scaled down from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 50,000.         
	However, after the joint forces arrived here and stepped up heat on the Maoists, the number of rebel attacks has gradually decreased. So this year, we have raised the budget to Rs 70,000 and were looking forward to the Pujas, Adhikari said.        
	Several residents who were encouraged by the CPMs show of strength yesterday sounded apprehensive today after the initial euphoria ebbed.        
	I was feeling very happy yesterday when I saw the procession of 10,000 people enter Lalgarh. But today, I feel scared. We think the Maoists can strike back any moment, said Dulal Pandit, 42, a Lalgarh resident. Pandit had cleaned the CPM party office in the town with other CPM supporters yesterday.         
	The sense of insecurity was palpable at the Lalgarh market this morning. Very few people turned up to buy new clothes.         
	Shopkeepers said the market normally drew shoppers from at least a dozen neighbouring villages such as Bhimpur, Kantapahari, Bamal, Ramgarh and Dharampur during the season.        
	Jyotilal Mahato, who owns a garment store at the market, said: This year too, the sales had been good until this morning. Over the past two weeks, I had sold garments worth Rs 8,000 daily on average. But till 1pm today, I have done business worth only Rs 1,000.         
	Police in Lalgarh said the residents fear was not unfounded.         
	Maoist squads are holed up inside the jungles of Bhulagera, Tarki and Purnapani. All these places are within 5km to 7km of Lalgarh town. There is a chance that the Maoists might retaliate to create panic among the residents and the CPM supporters, said Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore superintendent of police.        
	Joydeb Giri, the secretary of the local committee of the CPM, said a sense of panic had crept in among the residents since yesterday. We have entered Lalgarh after 15 months. If anything happens, we will fight back. The people are with us, he said.  
	From almanac  
	According to the Suryasiddhanta method of almanac computation, the shandhi puja on Ashtami this year has to begin at 5.49pm and end by 6.37pm. It is mandatory to complete Shandhi Puja in 48 minutes, comprising the last 24 minutes of Ashtami and the first 24 minutes of Navami. The balidaan (sacrifice) has to be done in the 24th minute. During Shandhi Puja, the Goddess is worshipped in the violent form of Chandi

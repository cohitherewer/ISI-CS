          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Aug. 6: Governor M.K. Narayanan has written to the state government seeking information on the security arrangements for Mamata Banerjees rally in Lalgarh on Monday.         
	We received a letter from the governor yesterday in which he sought information on the security arrangements for the August 9 meeting in Lalgarh, state home secretary Samar Ghosh said at Writers Buildings today.        
	Ghosh said chief secretary Ardhendu Sen had written back to Narayanan, updating him on the arrangements. Sen has informed the governor about the route Mamata will take to Lalgarh as well as those the people attending the rally will take.        
	Ghosh said Mamata enjoyed Z-plus security. She will be provided the same security during her visit to Lalgarh, he added.        
	A team of state police and CRPF personnel will carry out random checks on the routes the VVIPs will take. The process will start a day before the rally.        
	Inspector-general of police (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha said the state government had obtained permission from the Union home ministry to deploy the CRPF in Lalgarh on the day of the rally.         
	Z. Hassan, the inspector-general of police (western range), will decide on the number of CRPF personnel to be deployed, Purakayastha said. The CRPF will work in coordination with the local police, he added.         
	Asked if any mass organisations, including the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, would be allowed to join the rally, Purakayastha replied in the affirmative.         
	However, we will arrest any Peoples Committee member who is on our wanted list if we see them at the rally, he said.

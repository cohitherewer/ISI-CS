The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | The seven that withstood the winds of change: why and how they did it

	June 2: The winds of change failed to have any major impact on the seven municipalities in north Bengal that went to the polls on May 30 along with 74 others across the state.        
	Although the Trinamul Congress made marginal gains in the four municipalities in Cooch Behar district, the status remains more or less the same in all seven in the region except for Mathabhanga. In Cooch Behars Mathabhanga, the CPM and Trinamul won six seats each and the civic board will be determined by the toss of a coin.        
	The outcome in Dinhata, also in Cooch Behar, was particularly disappointing for Trinamul as it was there that the party had made its first major breakthrough by defeating the Forward Bloc on its home turf in the 2006 Assembly elections. Although there was a pro-Trinamul wave during the run-up to the polls, the party had little to show for it (see chart below).        
	The Congress, however, will have to fall back upon Trinamul in the two municipalities of Cooch Behar and Englishbazar in Malda to gain control of the respective boards as they do not have single majority in either.        
	So where were the winds that swept Trinamul into the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and many more municipalities in south Bengal?        
	I noticed during the campaign by Trinamul leaders in north Bengal that they only harped on the issues of Singur and Nandigram and highlighted their allegations about the CPMs terror tactics. Frankly speaking, these events have been taking place too far away for the electorate here to sit up and notice, said Sanjoy Chakrabarty, the secretary of the Jalpaiguri Welfare Organisation, an NGO.        
	The people here, Chakrabarty felt, were habituated to seeing Mamata Banerjee jump into the fray whenever something cropped up in south Bengal but she rarely came to the north. She visited the closed Kanthalguri tea garden in August 2007, five years after it had been shut down and toured the other estates too the same year, said Chakrabarty, who is not known to have any political leanings and is well-known in the district.         
	In fact, Chakrabarty said, north Bengal has been a traditional Congress belt, barring Cooch Behar district, where the Left Front has retained power in the three municipalities of Mathabhanga, Toofangunj and Dinhata. The Left has retained the Old Malda municipality as well and the Congress fared marginally better in Englishbazar, he said.        
	Other observers pointed out that never during their campaigns did the Trinamul leadership touch upon issues like the situation in the Darjeeling hills, closed tea gardens and the overall underdevelopment of the region. The Congress and CPM leadership mentioned these issues during their campaigns. Leaders like Nirupam Sen (CPM) and Deepa Das Munshi (Congress) were very prompt to raise these issues, the observer said.        
	Trinamul district leaders blamed the top brass for the poor show in north Bengal. A senior party leader in Cooch Behar said the state leaders paid scant attention to the party organisation in the district. We had to put up with the money and muscle power of the CPM and the Congress during the campaign, very little was sent to us from Calcutta, a district leader rued.        
	We would have certainly done better had the top party leadership concentrated a little more on Englishbazar rather than put in all their efforts behind Calcutta and south Bengal. We had Partha Chatterjee campaigning for the party on one occasion and it was plain that he was just going through the motions, said Babla Sarkar, a Trinamul state committee member in Malda.        
	He said the partys poor show in Englishbazar could also be attributed to very poor campaigning. In some wards, the party had put up very weak candidates, like Dolly Chowdhury in ward 14. She is a greenhorn and she could not poll more than 574, Sarkar said.         
	Malda district president of Trinamul Gautam Chakrabarty alleged that unlike in Calcutta, where the absence of an alliance with the Congress did not affect the anti-Left votes, it was not the case in Englishbazar. In many wards the anti-Left votes were split between us and the Congress, he said.

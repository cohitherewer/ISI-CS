          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 20: Mamata Banerjee today asked the state government to return to Singur land-losers not only the 400 acres she claims were forcibly acquired but also 10 per cent of the remaining 600 acres.         
	This was apparently her reply to housing minister Gautam Debs advice that she should only demand the return of 10 per cent of the total land acquired in Singur, as she had done in the case of Rajarhat.        
	Debs formula would have restricted Mamatas demand to just 100 acres in Singur, where the government had given the Tatas 1,000 acres for the Nano project. But Mamatas statement today means she now wants the government to return 460 acres, 60 acres more than what she had been demanding so far.        
	I want the state government to first return the 400 acres it had forcibly acquired. In addition, the administration should give back 10 per cent of (the remaining) 600 acres, Mamata told a news conference at her home in Kalighat this afternoon.        
	This will help the displaced farmers start small businesses, she added.        
	Mamata had earlier prescribed the 10 per cent formula for Rajarhat, where land has been acquired for a township project. Deb had then advised Mamata to follow the same policy in Singur.         
	The Trinamul Congress chief today said she would talk about only 600 acres, as there can be no discussion about the remaining 400 acres acquired forcibly. She said she would oppose further efforts by the state government to acquire land in Rajarhat.        
	Mamata accused the CPM of hobnobbing with the BJP to topple the UPA government over the spectrum scandal.        
	Gurudas barb        
	CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta today questioned Mamatas moral right to raise a storm over Rajarhat, alleging she had revealed her double standards through her silence on the spectrum scandal.        
	We find a central minister and her party speaking almost every day on the Rajarhat issue and demanding a probe. The question is whether she has the moral right to say so as she hasnt been vocal about the 2G spectrum scam, the Aituc general secretary said without naming Mamata.

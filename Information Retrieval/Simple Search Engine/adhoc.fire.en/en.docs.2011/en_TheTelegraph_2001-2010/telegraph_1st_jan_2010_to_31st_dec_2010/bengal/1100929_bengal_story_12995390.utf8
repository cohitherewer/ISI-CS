	Siliguri, Sept. 28: Jairam Ramesh will visit north Bengal on October 2 for meetings to find ways to curb rail accidents involving elephants, the trip spurred by last weeks death of seven jumbos on the tracks in the Dooars.         
	I will visit north Bengal on October 2 to check out the state of affairs in the region, the initiatives taken for conservation of elephants and to discuss the issue of the rail track that led to the death of seven elephants last week, the Union environment and forest minister said over the phone from Delhi this morning.         
	On September 22, seven elephants were mowed down by a goods train on the Dooars rail track that connects Siliguri Junction with Alipurduar. The incident  which came at a time the forest ministry has decided to declare the elephant a national heritage animal  evoked sharp criticism from wildlife NGOs.        
	Two days later, forest officials and those of Northeast Frontier Railways Alipurduar division met at Gorumara National Park and agreed to strengthen inter-departmental information exchange to prevent elephant deaths on tracks.

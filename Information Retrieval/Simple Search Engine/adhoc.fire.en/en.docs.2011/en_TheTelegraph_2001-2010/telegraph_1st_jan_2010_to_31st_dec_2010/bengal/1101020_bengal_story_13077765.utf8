The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul poll countdown
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul poll countdown
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Mamata Banerjee                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 19: Mamata Banerjee will tomorrow hold the first meeting on her partys preparations for the Assembly polls next summer, taking updates from senior leaders on the political situation and even discussing probable candidates.        
	All district presidents of the Trinamul Congress, heads of frontal organisations and key office-bearers will attend the extended core committee meeting of the party at Maharashtra Nivas.        
	The venue of the session was shifted from Trinamul Bhavan on Topsia Road to the Hazra Road address because it has more space and is closer to Mamatas Kalighat home.        
	Trinamul sources said the discussions would be Mamatas first interaction with party functionaries on the poll preparations.         
	Senior Trinamul leader and Union minister of state for rural development Sisir Adhikari outlined the possible agenda and the thrust of the discussions. The district presidents are expected to update Mamata on the probable candidates. This would be our first initiative to make preparations for the polls, said Adhikari.        
	Adhikari, who heads Trinamul in home district East Midnapore, felt tomorrows meeting would send a message to party managers across the state that our preparedness for the elections was far ahead of rivals.        
	Gautam Deb, the Darjeeling Trinamul president who is attending tomorrows session, said he would tell the leadership that the party was organisationally strong to take on the ruling Left in the six north Bengal districts.        
	This time, there will be 54 Assembly seats (an increase from 49 last time because of delimitation) in the north Bengal districts. We are organisationally strong in all of them, Deb, who oversees Trinamul in the entire region apart from Darjeeling, said.        
	Trinamul sources said district presidents would be told to send the names of probable candidates by the first week of January so that the leadership could initiate discussions with the Congress to firm up the alliance.         
	A seat-sharing deal with the Congress has to be struck before choosing our party nominees. First, it has to be decided how many seats we are going to offer to our alliance partner, said a Trinamul vice-president.        
	An AICC leader from Delhi said Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, would meet the Trinamul chief next month on the seat-sharing deal.         
	According to Trinamul sources, Mamata is expected to finalise plans for a series of protest programmes and rallies at tomorrows meeting. Saturdays (October 23) padayatra by Mamata from Salt Lake to Beliaghata in support of our demand for the withdrawal of the joint forces will be taken to the districts, said Trinamul state chief Subrata Bakshi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM visitors face   wrath 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM visitors face   wrath

	Nanoor, June 30: If most of the anger of Ananda Dass family and friends was directed at police, the party was not spared either.         
	Dass family members and many residents of Nanoor today accused the CPM district leadership of indifference towards the leader.        
	When Dilip Ganguly, the Birbhum CPM secretary, went to Dass house around noon, he was greeted by a volley of accusations and uncomfortable questions. Why have you come? Have you come to watch the fun? Dass wife Hasi shouted at Ganguly.        
	As Ganguly tried to console her, Dass 16-year-old daughter Chaiti told him that the party had not kept in touch with her father since denying an Assembly poll ticket in 2006. My father has laid down his life for the party but you people never enquired about how he was for the past so many days, Chaiti said.        
	Ganguly was not spared by Dass neighbours either. Have you come to attend a wedding reception? a woman sitting beside Hasi said0.        
	Ganguly kept quiet and after some time returned to the CPM zonal committee office.         
	A Left Front delegation led by library minister Tapan Roy also visited Dass house to offer their condolences but none from the bereaved family spoke to them.        
	Sources said Das had been accused of involvement in the alleged Nanoor massacre in which 11 Trinamul Congress supporters were killed by suspected CPM goons in 2000. His suspected role in the incident may have been a reason why the party denied him a ticket in 2006.

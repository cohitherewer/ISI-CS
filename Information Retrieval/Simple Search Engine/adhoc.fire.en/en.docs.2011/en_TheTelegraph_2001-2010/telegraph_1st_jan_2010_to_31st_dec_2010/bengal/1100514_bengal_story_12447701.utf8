          A STAFF REPORTER                                          The sick girls at the Baghnan hospital. (Gopal Senapati)      
	Howrah, May 13: Three mentally challenged girls have died and over 20 have shown symptoms of nausea and diarrhoea at a rehabilitation centre in Howrahs Baghnan in the past three days.         
	The centre, run by NGO Chiro Nabin, gives shelter to 98 mentally challenged girls and 25 destitute boys.        
	Those who died have been identified as Sumana, 12, Gita, 21, and Sabari, 16.        
	The centre today admitted all the girls to hospital as a precautionary measure.         
	Indranil Chowdhury, the block medical officer of the Bagnan rural hospital, said it was not clear whether the girls were suffering from food poisoning or an enteric disease.         
	Twenty of the girls admitted have been given saline drips while the others are being observed, Chowdhury said.        
	Later, the hospital released 33 girls.        
	Sumana and Gita had started vomiting and had bouts of diarrhoea after they had lunch on Tuesday. Both of them died in hospital. Sabari also started vomiting after she had dinner yesterday and died today morning.         
	According to Sukesh Das, the chief patron of Chiro Nabin, the same food is served to everyone at the centre, including the employees. But none of the boys or the employees have fallen ill so far.        
	The authorities at the centre panicked after the girls fell ill. We got scared after Sabaris death and decided to admit all the girls to hospital. We are still not sure why they fell ill, Das said.         
	Das has informed the district authorities. Supriya Rangarajan, the additional district magistrate (general), convened a meeting today where it was decided that an executive magistrate would investigate the cause behind the deaths and illness.

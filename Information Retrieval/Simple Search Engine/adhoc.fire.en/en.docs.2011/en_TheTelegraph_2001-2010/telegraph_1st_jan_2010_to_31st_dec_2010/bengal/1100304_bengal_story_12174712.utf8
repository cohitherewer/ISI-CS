The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Man found hanging in Digha hotel
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Man found hanging in Digha hotel
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, March 3: The body of a youth who had come to Digha with two others was found hanging from the ceiling fan of a hotel room this morning.         
	In the hotel room, police have found a bank passbook belonging to one Joydeb Das from Dhakuria. The cops are verifying if the passbook belonged to the dead youth.        
	The police said the three youths, including a girl, had checked into the hotel on Monday and had taken two rooms on the ground floor. The hotel register gives the names of the trio as Joydeb Das, 21, Pradip Sahu, 24, and Shabnam Shahu, 20.        
	We are not sure which of the two men was Joydeb, said Bikash Jana, a hotel employee.        
	Hotel staff saw the woman step out with one of the men at 7am today. They told us they were going to the beach but never returned, Jana said.        
	A hotel sweeper knocked on the door of one of the rooms that the three had booked at 9am but got no response.         
	The sweeper then informed us. Through a crack in a window, we saw the man hanging from the ceiling fan, a hotel employee said.         
	A police officer said the mans legs were touching the bed. It was probably a case of suicide because the room was locked from inside. But we are waiting for the post-mortem report to know the exact cause of the death, said Tarun Haldar, the sub-divisional police officer of Contai.         
	Officer-in-charge of Digha police station Sanjoy Srivastav said a Kidderpore address and a phone number furnished by the three at the hotel had turned out to be fake.         
	We are not ruling out a triangular love affair, a police officer said.

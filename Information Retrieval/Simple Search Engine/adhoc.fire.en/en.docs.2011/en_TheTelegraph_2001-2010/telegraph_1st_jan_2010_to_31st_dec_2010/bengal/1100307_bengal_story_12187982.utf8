          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 6: Trinamul Congress activists today shouted slogans against state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra as Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad looked on embarrassed at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.         
	The activists started yelling around noon when Mishra, Azad and Union minister of state for health Dinesh Trivedi entered the administrative block to meet hospital authorities and find out the reasons for the delay in the Rs 150-crore upgrade of the institute.        
	The infrastructure in this hospital has collapsed and the state health minister is responsible, said Piyal Chowdhury, one of the activists.         
	I have no words to explain their act, Mishra later said.

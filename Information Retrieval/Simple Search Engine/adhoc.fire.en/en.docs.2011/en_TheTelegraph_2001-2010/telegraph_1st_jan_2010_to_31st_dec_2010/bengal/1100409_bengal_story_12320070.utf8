                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Kishan whiff in quack arrest
          OUR BUREAU                              
	April 8: A quack has been arrested from West Midnapores Mathurapur where police have busted a makeshift medical centre allegedly treating Maoists, director-general of police Bhupinder Singh said today.        
	Singh, however, refused comment when asked if Jawaharlal Mahato, arrested with an unlicensed rifle, had treated injured Maoist leader Kishan.        
	Mathurapur is about 35km from Chhotopukuria, where the police believe Kishan had taken refuge after suffering bullet injuries in an encounter with security forces. Their suspicion is that the Maoist leader has slipped into Jharkhand.         
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said Mahato was a self-styled quack. However, he said he had no knowledge of whether Mahato had treated Kishan. We dont even know if Kishanji is injured, Verma said. Mahato has not told us so far if he had treated him.        
	Verma said that during Tuesdays raid at Mathurapur, Mahato had been found with the unlicensed single-barrel rifle. Mahato had told the police that he used to treat local villagers.        
	He has been arrested under the Arms Act and for cheating people by posing as a doctor, Verma said, adding that Mahato had been arrested last August on the charge of aiding Maoists. But he got bail, Verma said.        
	Police sources said the Mathurapur medical centre was frequented by Maoists and it was possible that Mahato had treated them.         
	The Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities has called an indefinite strike in Junglemahal to protest the quacks arrest.        
	During a raid last month at Chhotopukuria, the police had detained two quacks on the suspicion that they were treating Maoists but had to release them because of lack of evidence.

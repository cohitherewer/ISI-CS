          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 12: The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities has come up with a list claiming that 44 of its supporters have been killed in the past year either in fake encounters by security forces or in attacks by armed CPM cadres in and around Lalgarh.        
	In a four-page booklet, the committee names the dead and mentions their age, address and dates of their murders.        
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said at least 10 of those mentioned were hardcore Maoists. Most of the others are wanted Maoists, but we dont know whether they are dead because we have not seen their bodies.         
	The committee alleged that Aswini Mahato, 33, was in his paddy field in Salboni on November 28 when he was killed. On January 2, the forces allegedly fired at a rally, injured a trio, tied them to a jeep and dragged them to death.

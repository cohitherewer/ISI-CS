                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Pak frees Bengal teacher
          MEHEDI HEDAYTULLAH                          Abdul Karim                                  
	Islampur, Aug. 29: A North Dinajpur man who taught in a Patiala madarsa became the first Indian prisoner since 26/11 to be released by Pakistan, walking free yesterday after a five-year term for straying across the Punjab border.        
	Abdul Karim had been discovered by the International Red Cross in the Rawalpindi prison in 2007. After that, the 25-year-old had written to his parents through the Red Cross saying he was alive and well, after his family in Goalpokhors Betabi village, 90km from North Dinajpurs Islampur, had given him up for dead.        
	Nagesh Singh, director (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran division) in the Union ministry of external affairs, told The Telegraph over the phone from Delhi that this was the first time since the Mumbai attacks of November 2008 that an Indian had been released from a Pakistani jail. The release will go a long way in improving the bilateral relations, Singh said.         
	Karim walked into India around 4pm yesterday after being handed over to the Indian authorities at the Wagah international checkpost, near Amritsar.        
	Utpal Roy, the secretary of NGO Diganta Welfare Society, which had taken up Karims cause after he was found in 2007, said the madarsa teacher had stayed at the Red Cross Bhavan in Amritsar last night.         
	Our members have left for Calcutta by train. On Tuesday, he is expected to arrive at the Aluabari Road station (near Islampur). From there, we will take him to his recently widowed mother Gulshan Begum, Roy, who is in Delhi to receive him, said. Karims elder brother Iqbal Hussain is accompanying him home.        
	In Betabi, Id seems to have arrived early. The villagers are particularly happy that Karim is returning in the holy month of Ramazan. So far, I had been living with the knowledge that my son was at least alive in a Pakistani jail. Now he has been released during Ramazan. But my husband couldnt see him, said mother Gulshan, who has nine children.         
	Karims father Mohammad Tazuddin, who died of a heart attack this May, had yearned for his son till his last day, said Gulshan. But Karim is still unaware of his fathers death.         
	Karim had strayed into Pakistani territory while playing football with the madarsa students. But 26/11 caused all talks with Pakistan to break down and we were feared we would not be able to bring him back, Roy said.        
	He said Diganta had sent several appeals to the Indian and the Pakistani governments for his release.

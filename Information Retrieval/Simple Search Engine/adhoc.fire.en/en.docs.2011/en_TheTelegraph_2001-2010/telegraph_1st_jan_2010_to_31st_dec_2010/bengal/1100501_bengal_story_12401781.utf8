The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Delhi talks fail, Mamata firm
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Delhi talks fail, Mamata firm
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	April 30: The Congress has failed to persuade Mamata Banerjee to part with a few extra seats and break the deadlock over the Calcutta civic polls even after two rounds of talks with her in Delhi.         
	Frustrated at failing to secure an honourable deal, the four Calcutta district presidents of the party began a fast in front of state party headquarters Bidhan Bhavan this evening. They withdrew it late tonight after requests from state party chief Pranab Mukherjee and an apparent promise that a deal would be struck with the Trinamul Congress only if it is honourable.        
	In both rounds of talks with Mamata, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, tried to convince her about the importance of the alliance and the need to arrive at a deal acceptable to both parties. But Mamata held her ground and insisted that she would not part with a single seat other than the 25 she had already offered in Calcutta.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has 141 wards and Mamatas party has declared its candidates for 115 of them, leaving 25 for the Congress and one for the SUCI.        
	Rao did ask for an additional 15 seats, but apparently did not press the matter to keep the alliance afloat.        
	After his second meeting, Rao said: We had decided long ago that the civic polls would be fought on local factors, decided by local leaders. We did discuss the matter here today but decided to leave it to the local leaders. Mamata is our ally and a pillar of strength for the Congress.         
	Congress sources said keeping the alliance intact was of prime importance for the party high command and it did not want a civic election to snap it.         
	Our message to her was that the problems in local polls should not strain the relationship at the national level, a Congress leader said in Delhi.         
	However, Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel did call Mamata and ask her to be a bit more reasonable but she apparently brushed the request aside.        
	Eyebrows are being raised in Congress circles in Calcutta at Mamatas failure to discuss the matter with state Congress chief Mukherjee, though he was in the capital through the day.         
	With her other MPs, Mamata was absent from Parliament during most of yesterdays debate on the Finance Bill, presented by Mukherjee.         
	The possibility of talks with Mukherjee on the deal appears remote as he is leaving for Tashkent tomorrow morning and would not be available for three days.         
	The last day for filing nominations for the May 30 civic polls is Tuesday.         
	Earlier in the day, the state leaderships efforts to get the high commands nod for its decision to declare candidates for 88 seats failed, with Mukherjee calling up Bengal unit working president Pradip Bhattacharya and directing him to put the move on hold.        
	A Trinamul leader said the possibility of offering the Congress more seats was remote.        
	We are not going to oblige the Congress with even one more seat. Will they (Congress leaders) offer us a larger number of seats in Malda, Murshidabad and Nadia, where they are on a stronger footing? a Trinamul general secretary asked.         
	Hundreds of Congress workers demonstrated at the party headquarters today, demanding that the leaders not surrender at Mamata Banerjees feet.        
	The CPM has decided to wait till May 7, the last day for withdrawal of nominations, to assess the impact of Opposition disunity on the Left Fronts poll prospects.         
	The front will meet on May 8 to take stock of the situation. It will be followed by the CPM state committees deliberations on May 11.         
	In the interim, the CPM politburo and central committee will discuss the overall situation.

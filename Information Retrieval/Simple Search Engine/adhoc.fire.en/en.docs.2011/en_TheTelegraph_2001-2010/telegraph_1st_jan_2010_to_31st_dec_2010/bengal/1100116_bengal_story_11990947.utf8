The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tagore vision to guide varsities
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Tagore vision to guide varsities
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                       
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: Rabindranath Tagores vision for Visva-Bharati may guide Indias 14 new world-class universities promised by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	The human resource development ministry has borrowed some of Tagores ideas, immortalised as the objectives of Visva-Bharati, in drafting the guiding aims of the promised new institutions, formally referred to now as innovation universities.         
	Key lines from the objectives of the Santiniketan institution have been incorporated in the HRD ministrys final concept note for the innovation universities, top central officials have told The Telegraph.         
	While the world may have changed since Tagore penned these ideas, many of them still capture the pursuit of knowledge we want from the ambitious innovation universities, a source said.         
	The 14 will not be built as Visva-Bharati replicas and need not adopt the specific academic structures and practices followed at Santiniketan.         
	The aim behind the borrowing, the sources explained, is to instil the spirit of a boundary-less pursuit of knowledge for the greater good of man that Tagore had envisaged.         
	The Prime Minister wants the 14 new universities to emerge as global leaders in research, in collaboration with individuals and institutions across the globe, instead of becoming factories of degree-driven education. There is a need to draw a clear distinction between the universities we have now, which are aimed at providing degree-driven education to students, and the innovation universities. Thats where Tagores ideas come in, an official explained.         
	The Visva-Bharati Act, which governs the Santiniketan varsity, lists founding father Tagores vision. To study the mind of Man in its realisation of different aspects of truth from diverse points of view, the first of the five objectives listed in the act, has been borrowed for the concept note for the innovation universities.         
	Many of Tagores other objectives reflect an India battling for an independent identity and respect from the West. These objectives refer to relations between the East and the West and Visva-Bharatis role in improving these relations.         
	Officials said that given the current era of globalisation, distinguishing between the East and the West in objectives for the innovation universities may not be appropriate. But many of Tagores ideas are being tweaked to retain his broad message while reflecting todays realities.         
	These include Tagores emphasis on spiritual realisation, amity, and co-operation between thinkers from different cultures.         
	The innovation universities will be completely exempt from most regulations imposed on other varsities. They will not have to answer to any higher education or regulatory mechanism, according to the concept note. They will each have a broad theme  environment or heritage for instance. A university will offer a bouquet of courses across streams related to its designated theme  engineering, economics, politics and international relations associated with environment, for instance.         
	Ironically, the idea of using Visva-Bharatis objectives struck the HRD ministry while responding to a crisis at Santiniketan. It has been rocked by allegations of corruption against vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray.

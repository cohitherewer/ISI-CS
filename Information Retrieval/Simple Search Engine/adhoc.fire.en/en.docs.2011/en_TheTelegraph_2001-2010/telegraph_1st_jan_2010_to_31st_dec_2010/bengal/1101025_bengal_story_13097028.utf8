          OUR BUREAU                                  Inspector Partha Biswas (top), who has been held captive with his friend Saumajit Basu (below); (middle) the Borgora village which was one of the places where the joint forces searched for the duo.

	Calcutta/Purulia, Oct. 24: Police have failed to find intelligence official Partha Biswas and his schoolteacher friend 48 hours after they were taken hostage by suspected Maoists in Purulias Ayodhya Hills.        
	The search has been hamstrung by lack of information about which Maoist group had captured the duo on Friday. The police fear that the 40-year-old intelligence branch inspector and his friend Saumajit Basu may have been taken to neighbouring Jharkhand. Basu, 32, is attached to an NGO working for tribals in rebel-hit areas.        
	Had the group been identified, we could have got some leads. We could have monitored some cellphone numbers. We are not sure whether Biswas has been kept in Bengal or taken to Jharkhand, said an officer.        
	Surajit Kar Purakayastha, additional director-general (law and order), said the police were combing villages around the deeply wooded Ayodhya Hills. There is no headway till now. No lead has emerged.         
	Personnel of the CRPFs elite Cobra unit  part of the joint forces engaged in anti-rebel operations  have been pressed into the search. Last night, they scoured Borgora, Tilagora and Hedelbera villages at the base of the Ayodhya Hills.         
	The forces asked us whether we had seen any Maoist on Friday and whether we had provided shelter or food to them. They also asked us if we had seen any hostages in our village. They searched our house but did not find anything, said Krishna Pahari, 28, an unemployed youth in Borgora.        
	Netai Pahari, 52, of Tilagora spoke of a similar drill. The policemen came around 8pm yesterday, just when we had sat down for dinner. We told them that we had seen no Maoist, the farmer said.         
	Senior officers had claimed yesterday that Biswas  the first intelligence sleuth to fall into rebel hands since the joint forces began operations in June last year had not informed his immediate bosses when he set off with Basu.        
	Today, police sources said Biswas had called a colleague at the intelligence branch headquarters in Calcutta a few minutes before he was taken hostage. Biswass colleagues said he had wanted a transfer  he has been posted in Purulia for the past two years  fearing he could be identified as an undercover cop.        
	At Biswass home in Naihati, on Calcuttas outskirts, wife Barnali appealed to her husbands captors. He had last visited home on Wednesday. My husband was concerned about the welfare of poor tribals. I appeal to those who have kept him hostage to release him, she said.        
	State transport minister Ranjit Kundu visited the Biswas home this afternoon and reassured the family that the government was trying its best to trace him.        
	In Hooghlys Bandel, where Basu hails from, a police officer claimed that someone speaking Hindi with a south Indian accent had called the family around 11.50pm on Friday night, hours after he was taken captive. They told Avijit (Basus elder brother) that they were verifying the identities of the duo, the officer said.        
	Basus wife Sankhatua  they have a two-and-a-half-year-old son  and parents cannot bear the tension any more, said Avijit. We are praying for my brothers safety. He is innocent and I hope he is released, said the private firm executive.         
	Basus mother Sumita, 65, said: I feel that I might collapse any moment from the strain.

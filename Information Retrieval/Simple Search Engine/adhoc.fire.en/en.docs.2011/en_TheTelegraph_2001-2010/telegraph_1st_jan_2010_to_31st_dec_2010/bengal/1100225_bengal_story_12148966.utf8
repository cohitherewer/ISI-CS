                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mom skips action at home
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Mamata Banerjees biggest fan, her mother, was missing from their Kalighat home today.        
	While the rest of the family was glued to the television screen to see her present the railway budget, Gayatri Debi was at a relatives house because she was unwell and wanted to avoid the crowd that would invariably gather at the Harish Chatterjee Street address on such days.        
	Mother is very ill so she is not watching the budget this time. But Didi called her to take her blessings before she started for the Lok Sabha this morning, Mamatas brother Kartik said.         
	Her brothers, three sisters-in-law, nephew and niece were huddled around the 26-inch Sony Bravia in Kartiks room from 11.30am.        
	At the party office next door, a few people watched as Mamata took the podium but the incessant flow of people during last years railway budget and spontaneous applause were missing this year.        
	Last year, Didi was presenting the budget after a long time so there was more excitement, said a Trinamul Congress supporter who had come to watch his leader with other party members.        
	The crowd increased after Mamatas speech ended, with supporters carrying party flags and green gulal landing up.        
	Ei duronto rail budget-er jonyo Mamata Banerjee-ke dhonyobad (we thank Mamata Banerjee for the super rail budget), they chanted, drums beating in the background.        
	It is exactly what we had expected. She has thought of the common man not just in Bengal but across India, said Sumana Saha, whose role model is Mamata.

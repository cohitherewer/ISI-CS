The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Battle looms over bills
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Battle looms over bills
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 10: Before the ballot battle, the bill bout.        
	Left MLAs were today asked to foil attempts to block bills to be brought in the winter session amid fears of such disruptive tactics by the Opposition, which believes a government on its last legs shouldnt pass key laws. The session will effectively be this Assemblys last full sitting before the polls next summer.        
	The Left advisory was issued by chief whip Syed Mohammad Masih at a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee this morning. Leader of the Opposition, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee, and Congress chief whip Asit Mal demanded that the bills be shelved.        
	The government has no moral right to introduce any important bills as the current session is the last before the polls, and it has already lost peoples mandate. If attempts are made to introduce the bills, we shall oppose them tooth and nail, Chatterjee was learnt to have said at the meeting.         
	Mal echoed him at the meeting. It would be unfair on the part of the government to introduce any bills and get it passed on the basis of its majority when the polls are only a few months away. We shall not allow the bills to be introduced, come what may, Mal told The Telegraph tonight.        
	Six bills and an ordinance are on the House agenda. One of them is the New Town Development Authority Bill related to Rajarhat, where Trinamul has intensified protests against alleged forcible land acquisitions by the government.        
	Faced with Oppositions tough stand, Masih met Left partners RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI to work out a strategy. We have been elected for five years, regardless of the fact on whether we had lost in successive polls (since the 2008 rural elections). So I have asked our partners to get ready to face any eventuality to get the bills passed, he was learnt to have told Left legislators.

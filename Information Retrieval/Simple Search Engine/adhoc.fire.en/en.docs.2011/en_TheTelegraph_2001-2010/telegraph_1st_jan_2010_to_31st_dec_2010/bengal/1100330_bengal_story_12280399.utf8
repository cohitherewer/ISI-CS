The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Search for Kishan draws a blank
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Search for Kishan draws a blank
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 29: Maoist leader Kishan may have given police the slip even with suspected bullet wounds in his shoulder and leg.        
	A search in the Belpahari village where he was believed to be undergoing treatment drew a blank this morning. The police feel he slipped into nearby Jharkhand on a motorcycle with some of his aides holding him up.         
	We had specific information about Kishan being treated at Chhotopukuria village, said an officer overseeing the offensive against the guerrillas. Our forces were heading towards the village last evening but they were challenged by the rebels who engaged them in a gun battle. So, the police entered the village only this morning.         
	The police said they got a confirmation of Kishan being treated there when two quacks from adjacent Keudishole told them they had yesterday treated an injured man in his 50s. Since we had blocked almost all roads leading to areas where we suspected he could seek medical help, the Maoists had no option but to depend on local quacks, the officer said.        
	The quacks  Jadupati Mandal and Ashok Mandal  are now being held at the Belpahari police station.         
	Quacks are apparently an important link in the Maoists supply chain. If a quack is caught with a lot of medicines, no one suspects him, an officer said. So they have become important for the Maoists.        
	A string of telephone intercepts had convinced the police yesterday that Kishan had been hit during a gun battle with the security forces on the outskirts of Lalgarh on Thursday. The rebels were said to be looking for emergency medical aid for their Dada in the recorded conversations.        
	A purported Maoist statement emailed to Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik lent credence to the suspicion. We will reply to each bullet that hit Kishenji and comrade Bikram, it said.        
	As soon as you launch the joint special operation or Green Hunt, we will start attacks at Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri simultaneously, the email added while threatening to blow up Patnaiks residence.        
	The server from which the threat mail was sent has been traced to the Czech Republic, police sources in Bhubaneswar said today.         
	A senior officer said preliminary investigations had revealed that the mail sent to cmoori.nic.in from PLGAorissa.gov.in had its server in the Czech Republic. A hunt is on for the sender.        
	The forces in Bengal today raided several parts of Belpahari, taking the quacks with them. State police chief Bhupinder Singh was in district headquarters Midnapore today.        
	In Calcutta, state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the the government had no information on Kishans health.        
	With Kishan injured, top guerrilla leaders are said to have met at Bangriposi in Orissa to decide who should take charge of the guerrilla squad and operations in Lalgarh for the time being. Maoist sources said that given the serious nature of injuries, Kishan could be out of action for quite some time.

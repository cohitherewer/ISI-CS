The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Power plant ball lobbed to Centre court
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Power plant ball lobbed to Centre court

	Calcutta, Dec. 6: Caught in the middle of a deepening fiscal crunch and an anti-land acquisition agitation, the state government is apparently trying to shift the onus of building a power plant in Burdwans Katwa to the Centre.        
	The state power department and its production utility, the West Bengal Power Development Corporation (WBPDCL), were originally the primary promoters of the project. But now, the state government is in talks with the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel) and the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) for either of the two to play the lead role in the venture.         
	The WBPDCL, however, will not withdraw completely from the project. Power department sources said a partnership with either the NTPC or Bhel was being worked out.         
	A senior official of the power department said: The WBPDCL will no longer be the primary promoter. But the state utility will have a role to play. The terms and conditions for the partnership are still being negotiated.         
	State power secretary Moloy De said a decision would be taken before the end of this month.        
	The proposed 1,600MW plant was supposed to start generating power by 2015.         
	The project, for which 1,033 acres has been earmarked, ran into stiff resistance from 4,600 land losers, who have organised themselves under the umbrella of the Trinamul Congress-backed Save Farmland Cultivators and Agricultural Workers Committee.         
	For the first stage of the project, 350 acres had been acquired and the process of taking over the rest is under way.        
	Despite the chief ministers repeated pledges of completing the project, the state government had to seriously mull the option of shifting it to Murshidabads Sagardighi in 2008 when anti-land acquisition protests intensified.         
	However, in April this year, state power minister Nirupam Sen announced that the government would go ahead with the plant.        
	Bengals financial crisis added to the problem. With a debt burden of Rs 1.96 lakh crore forcing the state government to tighten its purse and cut corners, the WBPDCL is now in no position to shell out its contribution to the Rs 8,000-crore project, sources said.         
	A power department official said: The investment is to be made in a debt-equity ratio of 7:3. This means the WBPDCL was to invest Rs 2,400 crore and raise the remaining Rs 5,600 crore through loans from financial institutions. Given the present financial condition, Rs 2,400 crore is not an easy ask for a state government agency.         
	Besides, De said, the super-critical technology needed for the thermal power plant is something Bhel or the NTPC can offer right away.

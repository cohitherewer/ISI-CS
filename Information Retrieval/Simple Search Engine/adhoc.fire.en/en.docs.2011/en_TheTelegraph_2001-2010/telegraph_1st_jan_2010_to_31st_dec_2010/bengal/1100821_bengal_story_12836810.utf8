The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Experts brake heat on Gurjant
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Experts brake heat on Gurjant

	Calcutta, Aug. 20: Gurjant Singh may or may not have intended to slam his truck into Mamata Banerjees convoy but by knowingly driving a vehicle with faulty brakes, he ran the risk of committing mayhem, mechanical experts said today.        
	They said it was sheer luck that only one car was damaged. Gurjant could have ploughed into the packed dhaba in front of which Mamatas convoy was parked, which could have had far graver consequences, they said.        
	The truck driver from Punjab had admitted that while he was approaching the highway in Kolaghat, he did not take the overbridge to the flank that leads to Calcutta. He had feared that he might not have been able to control the trucks speed on its descent as the brakes were not functioning properly. Instead, he unlawfully took a path under the flyover and cut across a gap in the divider to intrude into the Trinamul chiefs convoy.        
	Gurjant had also told police he was driving slowly because he was aware of a leak in the brake pipe.        
	It is grossly irresponsible and criminal of him to have taken such a risk unnecessarily, a motor vehicles expert said. After he realised that the brakes were malfunctioning, he should have immediately stopped his truck by the side of the road and called a mechanic. That would have been a safe thing to do, he said.        
	Sanjay Ghosh, a vehicle restorer, said: Brakes give notice much ahead of failure. Whether it is an air brake or a hydraulic brake, the brake pedal first softens up if there is a leak. Besides, when brakes fail, the driver can shift to higher gears or use the hand gear to avoid collision. Brakes should be routinely checked.        
	Experts said that even though Gurjant had claimed he was driving slowly, the speed was enough to have caused a major tragedy.        
	The truck-hit not only damaged a car in the convoy badly, but it also injured its driver, a policeman said. The escort vehicle then hit Mamatas SUV on impact, injuring her.        
	He said Mamatas convoy had acted as a shield, preventing the truck from ploughing into the dhaba.         
	A CID officer said the agency was probing why Gurjant had not waved a red cloth despite knowing that the brakes were not functioning properly.        
	Advocate Pradip Roy said: This is a fit case for charging the driver with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which carries a maximum punishment of a life term. When he admitted he was driving despite faulty brakes, it is a wonder why the police initially let him off with only a case of rash and negligent driving.        
	Gurjants brother Veer Singh and uncle Kaur Singh arrived in Calcutta yesterday and met him at the CID headquarters today.         
	Manjit Singh, who was appointed the drivers lawyer, said: On August 23, I will move the Tamluk subdivisional court for Gurjants bail. I will appeal to Calcutta High Court if his bail plea is rejected.         
	Traffic experts alleged that drivers in Bengal literally get away with murder because of lax policing and the light charges pressed for running people over.

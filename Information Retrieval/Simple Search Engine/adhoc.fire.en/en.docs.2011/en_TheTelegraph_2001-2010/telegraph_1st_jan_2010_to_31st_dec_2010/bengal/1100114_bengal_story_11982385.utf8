The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Singur early SC hearing 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Singur early SC hearing 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: The Supreme Court has decided to hear the Singur land case on February 5 at the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporations request.         
	The corporation, through its lawyers Altaf Ahmed and Pijush Kanti Roy, had urged the court to decide the case early so that a decision on the land could be taken.         
	The railways have expressed an interest in the land, the corporation told the court. The land, acquired for Tata Motors, is now lying unused.         
	The railway board had written to the state evincing interest in setting up a coach factory there.         
	However, the board had also made it clear that it was interested only in 600 acres and not the remaining 397-odd, which railway minister Mamata Banerjee considered forcibly acquired.         
	On May 13, 2009, the apex court had refused to stay a January 18, 2008, Calcutta High Court judgment upholding acquisition of around 1,000 acres in Singur for Tata Motors and its vendors. The court had rejected a plea by a lawyer and some local cultivators to stay the high court order.         
	The apex court is yet to hold a detailed hearing on the legality of the land acquisition.

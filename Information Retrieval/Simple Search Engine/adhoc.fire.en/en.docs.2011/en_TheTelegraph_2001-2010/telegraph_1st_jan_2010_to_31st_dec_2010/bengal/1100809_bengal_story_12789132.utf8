                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul lunch for CPM

	Papuri (Birbhum), Aug. 8: Heres some food for thought for Bengals parties warring for political space.         
	Trinamul Congress supporters in Nanoors Papuri today cooked and served food to family members of CPM workers who returned to the village after fleeing their homes two years ago following clashes between Trinamul and the CPM.        
	Around 20 families owing allegiance to the CPM today returned to Papuri as part of a police initiative. The police said the Trinamul workers, who clash with CPM supporters frequently in the area that is under a Left-run gram panchayat, readily agreed when they were requested to cooperate in the initiative.         
	We understand the agony of being homeless for years. Around 600 of our supporters had to flee their homes in Nanoor because of CPM atrocities, said Anubrata Mondal, the district Trinamul president.        
	Most of them who returned today were women and old men.         
	Mondal, along with local CPM MLA Joydeb Hajra and police superintendent Humayun Kabir, sat with the families and had lunch.        
	The lunch of rice, fish curry, aloo posto and pineapple chutney was served at a local madrasah. The Trinamul supporters said they had caught the fish and picked vegetables from their fields to prepare the lunch.        
	Even the CPM MLA was impressed. We appreciate the effort of the Trinamul workers, Hazra said.        
	Mondal also appealed to Trinamul workers to ensure the safety of those who returned home today.        
	A gang had ransacked our house in February 2008. We escaped and took shelter at my brothers home in Burdwans Ketugram, Motila Bibi, 68 one of those who returned, said.        
	Another woman, Farida Sultana, 35, said she dared to return only because of the SPs request. I have come alone to see the situation. I have not brought my husband and son, said Farida. Her husband Sheikh Sirajuddin is a CPM cadre.         
	Todays incident is in sharp contrast with the situation in East Midnapores Nandigram and Khejuri where hundreds of CPM supporters who had fled their homes after Trinamul swept the panchayat polls in 2008 are still scared to return despite efforts by the district administration.

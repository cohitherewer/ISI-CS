	Calcutta, May 7: The Bengal government is set to bag a $200 million (Rs 900 crore) loan from the World Bank to embark on rural development projects in a desperate bid to recover lost ground before next years Assembly elections.        
	Since the CPMs stunning setbacks in the 2008 panchayat polls and last years Lok Sabha elections, the party had been thinking of ways to win back rural voters and this loan may be of immense help, said a CPM minister.        
	We lost a few thousand gram panchayats and panchayat samitis in 2008, besides four zilla parishads. In the parliamentary polls, the Trinamul Congress swept south Bengal. So, something had to be done to get back our village vote bank. We needed a substantial am- ount of money to embark on rural projects independently (independent of the Centre) and the loan had been sought with this objective in mind, the minister added.         
	Officials of the state gov- ernment, Union finance ministry and the World Bank met in Delhi last week to sign a draft deal that would pave the way for the Rs 900-crore soft loan that Bengal will get after a final nod from a Washington meeting of the bank in June.         
	The principal secretary of the states panchayat and rural development department, M.N. Roy, told The Telegraph the June 8 approval was a mere formality.        
	This loan will be a big development for us. We expect the money to come in three-four months. The important aspect of the loan is that we wont have to pay any interest but only a nominal service charge and there are no conditions attached, added Roy.        
	The service charge will be less than 2 per cent a year on the reducing balance. The money is due in August 2010 but the repayment will start only in 2020 and continue till 2045.        
	The state governments track record hasnt been good in areas like road construct- ion, sinking deep tube wells and providing sanitation and healthcare. Not much has been done to build village houses under the Indira Awas Yojana. All this has resulted in the big dent in the ruling fronts biggest support base. Having seen that, it began persuading Delhi a few months ago to get in touch with the World Bank, said a panchayat department official.        
	According to sources in the panchayat department, the initial plan is to select 1,000 gram panchayats from among 49,000 on the basis of their performance over the past three years in terms of development work and then allocate grants to them from the loan.         
	The other rural bodies will be allotted funds later on the basis of the experience gained from the manner in which the first 1,000 utilise their money.         
	The money will be spent to improve water supply, drainage and sewerage, repair schools, build roads and bore deep tube wells, an official said.         
	The loan will also be used to train panchayat functionaries so that the funds are effectively used. There will be a performance monitoring system for all the gram panchayats that receive the money, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rajarhat punch brings Singur salvo   Deb dares   Mamata   with Nano site formula
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rajarhat punch brings Singur salvo   Deb dares 
  Mamata   with Nano site formula          A STAFF REPORTER                                                                    
	Calcutta, Nov. 16: Gautam Deb today dared Mamata Banerjee to agree to the 10 per cent formula she has been advocating elsewhere, throwing down the gauntlet to bring back the Nano project days after she appeared set to do a Singur in Rajarhat.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief wants 10 per cent of any developed land to be returned to the original landowner. She has been demanding the inclusion of such a clause in the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill on which she has been holding out in Delhi despite ally Congresss efforts to make her come around.        
	While addressing a meeting of people who claimed to be landlosers in Rajarhat on Saturday, the railway minister had suggested the same model be followed there too.         
	Today, Deb, the Bengal housing minister, wondered why the rule should be applied selectively. Why only Rajarhat? Why not Singur, why not Nandigram and why not all railway projects? Deb asked in a 90-minute news conference where he replayed Mamatas allegations over Rajarhat on a monitor and responded to them one by one.         
	Then, at one point during the presentation, he conjured up a dramatic sequence of events.                  Mamata Banerjee with industrialist GP Goenka at the railway event in Dankuni on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta       
	Why 10 per cent, I will return 11 per cent of the land but let her first announce from Dankuni (where she inaugurated a rail project) today that she would settle for 10 per cent of the total land acquired for the Nano project and not demand more. Tomorrow, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will call up Ratan Tata. By next month, I will return 11 per cent of the land, said Deb, whom Mamata and her party have accused of forcible land acquisitions and nepotism in distributing plots in Rajarhat, the upcoming township on Calcuttas eastern fringes.         
	Deb did not clarify if his promise meant the government was ready to return 10 per cent of the acquired land in Singur. The government has so far been categorical that no part of the acquired land can be given back to its original owners.         
	In Dankuni, neither Deb nor Singur were on Mamatas lips as she invited industrialists to build car factories and ancillary hubs on railway land. But Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee told The Telegraph tonight: How does the question of settling for 10 per cent land arise in Singur and Nandigram? The government had forcibly acquired the land at these two places. The landlosers never received adequate compensation.        
	Trinamul wants 400 acres from the 997-acre site of the now-abandoned Nano project to be returned.         
	The Deb-led Hidco has run into Trinamul-led protests over the past year and a half in Rajarhat. The agitation looked set to intensify with Mamatas threat on Saturday of filing court cases against the alleged forcible acquisitions.        
	Development work has almost come to a halt in Rajarhat with landowners not letting agencies get on with their jobs. In the 10-odd inaugural programmes and news conferences that Deb has conducted in the past six months, the railway minister and her party have figured more than anything else.        
	Rail land offer        
	Mamata has invited industrialists to build automobiles and ancillary units on land to be provided by her railway ministry, choosing to make the appeal from a place not far from the abandoned Nano project for whose exit she was blamed.        
	We have our land bank, spread over thousands of acres across the country. I ask industrialists to come up with investments and we will give them all facilities like land and infrastructure, the railway minister said at the foundation ceremony for the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor terminal in Dankuni, 20km from Singur.        
	The industrialist will hold a 30 to 40 per cent share in the industries that come up on our (railway) land, Mamata said. Duncans chairman G.P. Goenka and officials of several business chambers were on the dais.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM poll prod to Morcha
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM poll prod to Morcha
                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 30: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today told the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha that there would be no interim authority in the hills unless the party allows rural and civic elections in the region.         
	We have already made it clear to Delhi that we are not going to accept any interim committee in Darjeeling. They (the Morcha) should first agree to elections to the panchayats and municipalities, the chief minister told a Left Front rally at Metro Channel this afternoon.         
	The poll verdict will make it clear whose strength lies where, Bhattacharjee added.

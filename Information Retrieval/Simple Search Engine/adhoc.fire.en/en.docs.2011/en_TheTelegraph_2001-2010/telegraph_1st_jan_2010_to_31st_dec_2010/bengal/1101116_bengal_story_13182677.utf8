                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Man lynched on shalishi orders
  - Kangaroo court hands death sentence to 30-year-old for refusing to accept Rs 72,000 fine        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Sukdeb Goswami                                        
	Tamluk, Nov. 15: Villagers yesterday beat a 30-year-old man to death in front of his mother after a kangaroo court in East Midnapore handed him the death sentence for refusing to obey its order of paying a fine.        
	Sukdeb Goswami, a father of two and a resident of Uttar Mirjapur village in Tamluk, had been asked by the shalishi court to pay Rs 72,000 to a local man he had beaten up three months ago over an unpaid debt.        
	Sukdeb, a hawker of readymade garments, told the shalishi he had already spent 70 days in jail for the attack on Swarup Jana and that his trial was on in a court, his mother Maya said.        
	But those conducting the shalishi told Sukdeb they were not bothered about any court or legal proceedings.        
	Maya said the villagers then pounced on Sukdeb with rods and sticks and beat him to death.        
	I requested the attackers with folded hands to let my son go and fell at their feet, but they refused to listen, she said. My son told them he would leave the village but they continued to beat him.                    
	The district superintendent of police said shalishis were illegal. We are searching for the culprits. Sukdebs mother has lodged an FIR against 29 villagers. We have arrested one of those named in the FIR, he said.         
	Sukdeb had been charged with attempt-to-murder for beating up Swarup with a stick and inflicting a head injury after a quarrel over Swarups failure to repay a loan. He was released on bail on November 4.        
	While Sukdeb was in jail, the residents of Uttar Mirjapur had held a shalishi, which decided he must pay Rs 80,000 to Swarup, who owns a cycle-repairing shop. Sabita, Sukdebs wife, then paid Swarup Rs 8,000.        
	After Sukdeb came out on bail, some villagers, allegedly led by CPM worker Sankar Das and Trinamul Congress activist Haripada Jana, called another shalishi. Both Sukdeb and Maya were summoned.        
	Maya, 55, who works as a domestic help in Delhi, rushed back to the village after Sukdeb informed her over the phone about the shalishi.        
	The court was held at 3pm yesterday inside a classroom on the first floor of Uttar Mirjapur Primary School. Sources said around 100 villagers, including Raghunath Bhowmik, a CPM member of the local Trinamul-run Kharui-II gram panchayat, were present.        
	Maya said 30 villagers, led by Das and Jana, conducted the kangaroo court and ordered Sukdeb to pay the remaining Rs 72,000 to Swarup.         
	My son repeatedly told them he had been arrested for beating up Swarup and had already spent over two months in jail. He said the matter was being heard at the Tamluk court and he would only accept that courts verdict, Maya said.        
	He refused to accept the decision of the kangaroo court. But they told Sukdeb he must abide by their decision if he wanted to live in the village.        
	Maya said the kangaroo court continued for over five hours with both Sukdeb and the villagers sticking to their stands.        
	Sukdebs uncle (Mohan Goswami) and I told the villagers that we wanted to leave but they said we would not be allowed to go until my son paid up, she said.        
	Around 8pm, Sukdeb told the villagers he wanted to go to the toilet. Some of the villagers escorted him. After he returned, one of those at the shalishi produced a paper-cutting knife and alleged he had found it in Sukdebs pocket.        
	Sukdeb denied that the knife belonged to him but the villagers accused him of carrying the weapon to attack people. They demanded the death sentence.        
	The kangaroo court then sentenced Sukdeb to death for refusing to accept its verdict.        
	Some residents of the village, who had not attended the shalishi but could sense trouble brewing, informed the police. It is not clear when the call was made.         
	The police arrived around 10pm, by when Sukdeb was dead. They took away the blood-splattered body.        
	About 100 people who had attended the shalishi have fled the village, including panchayat member Bhowmik.        
	Bhowmiks son Purnendu said: The villagers forced my father to attend the shalishi. He tried to stop them from lynching Sukdeb but they refused to listen.        
	Purnendu said some of the villagers had beaten up his father for opposing the shalishis decision.        
	District inspector of schools Taraknath Roy has served a show-cause notice on Krishnakanta Sarkar, the headmaster of the school where the kangaroo court was held.        
	I have asked the headmaster to explain how the villagers got the keys of the school and why they were given permission to hold the shalishi there, Roy said.

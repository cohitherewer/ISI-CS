The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Train passenger shot at twice
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Train passenger shot at twice
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 10: A pathologist coming to Calcutta for a conference took two bullets while battling robbers on the Danapur Express last night but had a miraculous escape as they pierced his right shoulder and got lodged in his underarms, a few centimetres from his right lung.         
	Police said Pabitra Mukherjee put up a resistance seeing two youths snatch a lady passengers purse in an AC three-tier compartment.         
	I boarded the train around 9.30pm last night and occupied a lower berth. After dinner, when the train was about to enter Barh station around 11.30pm, I woke up to see two youths snatch the purse and a mobile phone from a woman. I lunged at them and one of them fired twice at me, Mukherjee, 50, said after the train pulled into Howrah station this morning.        
	He succeeded in thwarting the train heist. As Mukherjee slumped, other passengers pounced on the duo who somehow slipped out in the melee and jumped off the train at Barh.        
	Doctors at the nearby Mokama station arrested his bleeding and put his arm on a sling and he resumed his journey.        
	At Howrah, Mukherjee walked down to the taxi stand and hired a cab, which took him to AMRI Hospital in Dhakuria.        
	The two bullets lodged in Mukherjees underarm were removed this afternoon. They had entered through the shoulder and got stuck in the underarm, a hospital spokesman said.        
	Since no vital organ was hit and the wound had been promptly attended to, Mukherjee could move around freely and talk to people, said a doctor.        
	Mukherjee said he was attached to a diagnostic centre in Patna and was on the way to a pathologists conclave.         
	The superintendent of railway police in Patna, Jiten Singh Rana, said the robbers had boarded the train as passengers without tickets. They had taken away Rs 5,000, a phone and a purse from Manju Agarwal when Mukherjee stepped in.

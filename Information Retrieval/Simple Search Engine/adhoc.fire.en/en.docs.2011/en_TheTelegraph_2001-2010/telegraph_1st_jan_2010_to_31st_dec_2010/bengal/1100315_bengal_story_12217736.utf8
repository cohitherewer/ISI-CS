          MITA MUKHERJEE                                        
	Calcutta, March 14: A state-aided university in North 24-Parganas has told 57 colleges under it to allow Muslim students special library and laboratory facilities at a time the Left is fast losing its grip on the district.        
	The CPM lost all five seats in the Lok Sabha elections to the Trinamul Congress.         
	Ashoke Ranjan Thakur, the vice-chancellor of West Bengal State University, denied any politics behind the decision to encourage Muslim students.         
	He cited enthusiasm among the students instead as the reason. We have noticed remarkable enthusiasm among Muslim students to pursue higher education, especially among young girls of the community. We were happy to see that a good number of Muslim students got first class in the BA Part-I exams last year, he said.        
	But a university teacher, on the condition of anonymity, said: The intention of the university is clear. Its target is to cash in on the Muslim votes in these areas.         
	Barasat, where the university is located, Bongaon, Basirhat and Barrackpore are all Muslim-dominated areas in North 24-Parganas. Thirty-six per cent of the districts population is Muslim.        
	The two-year-old university  the policy-making bodies of which are controlled by pro-CPM members  has drawn up a plan for its nearly 6,000 Muslim students.         
	University authorities have sent directives to all 57 affiliated colleges asking them to give special attention to students of the minority community.         
	The head of each affiliated college has been told to increase enrolment of Muslim students, vice-chancellor Thakur said. The colleges have been asked to arrange for special classes, offer free tutorials and coaching to Muslim students who are meritorious.         
	Students who are average performers in class will be allowed extra time in libraries and laboratories.        
	University sources said if an average Muslim student wants to use the library or the laboratory for one or two hours beyond the stipulated time, the college authorities will allow him.         
	Teachers have been asked to take extra care of Muslim girl students who need coaching and guidance.         
	The general facilities offered by a college are for the benefit of all students. But we are committed to take extra care of the Muslim students. The teachers have been asked to closely monitor the performance of the Muslim students, particularly the girls, a university official said.         
	The library and laboratory facilities can be extended according to the needs of the students in their respective colleges, the official said.        
	In addition, the colleges have been asked to conduct interactive counselling sessions for students of the community. A data-collection exercise, started by the varsity last year, has shown that Muslim students have a common inclination to pursue studies in theology and Urdu. The colleges have been asked to motivate the students to study subjects like Bengali, history and political science.         
	In order to ensure that the colleges do not miss out a single Muslim student who can be given a seat in the undergraduate courses, vice-chancellor Thakur recently held a meeting with headmasters of 100 higher secondary schools. The intention was to find out the number of Muslim students in their institutions and how many of them would be passing the Class XII board exams this year.        
	The university, which held its Part-I exam in 2009  the first conducted by the institution after it started operating in 2008  will ensure that all assistance is given to the 174 Muslim candidates who scored 55 per cent or more in Part-I. We will ensure that all these high-scorers in Part-I perform better in Part-II next year, a university source said.

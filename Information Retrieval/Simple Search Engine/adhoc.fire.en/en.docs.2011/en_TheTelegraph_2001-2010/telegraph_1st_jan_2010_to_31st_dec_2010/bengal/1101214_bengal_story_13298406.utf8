                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Adhir protest jab at Mamata
          OUR BUREAU                            Mamata, Adhir                          
	, Behrampore/Calcutta, Dec. 13: The Murshidabad Congress has lined up a protest at a Mamata Banerjee show on Wednesday in an apparent attempt by local party strongman Adhir Chowdhury to embarrass the railway minister.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will also attend the event  the foundation for a double-line project at Sagardighi  as the venue falls under Jangipur, his constituency in the same district.        
	Mamata is not on the best of terms with Chowdhury, who has been insisting that the Congress should fight the CPM alone in his stronghold, without ally Trinamul.         
	Chowdhury, the district unit chief, claimed he had nothing to do with the six-hour rail roko but appeared to justify the protest saying it was to press for construction of two flyovers over tracks in Behrampore.         
	She (Mamata) had promised it would be done but she has not kept her word, he said, adding he wouldnt attend the event.        
	Asked why he was staying away, he said: Even if the minister invites me now, I will not go. In Calcutta, Trinamul MP Kalyan Banerjee claimed the divisional railway manager had invited Chowdhury. If he wants the invitation to come from the general manager, he must talk to Sonia Gandhi and become a minister first, Banerjee said, flashing the invitation card with Chowdhurys name.

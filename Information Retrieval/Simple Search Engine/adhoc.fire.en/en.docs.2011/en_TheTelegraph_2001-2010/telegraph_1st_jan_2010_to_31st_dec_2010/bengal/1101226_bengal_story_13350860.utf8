	Howrah, Dec. 25: Around 15 trees, including some rare bamboo plants brought from abroad, were destroyed in a fire at the Indian Botanic Garden in Howrah this afternoon.        
	The fire, which started around 3.30 from a dumping area near gate No. 4 on the 273-acre campus, spread rapidly.        
	Four fire tenders fought the blaze for three hours before it was brought under control. The exact reason for the fire is yet to be ascertained, garden authorities said.        
	The garden was in the news earlier this year when a wedding feast was held on the campus.

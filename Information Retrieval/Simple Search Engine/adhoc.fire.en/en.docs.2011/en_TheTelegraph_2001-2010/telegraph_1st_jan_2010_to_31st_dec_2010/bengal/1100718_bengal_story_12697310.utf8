	Calcutta, July 17: From the fire to the frying pan of thieves.         
	When Lalit Kumar Malhotra, 75, visited his second-floor apartment in Block II of the fire-ravaged Stephen Court today, he found that his home had been ransacked and burgled. Several items, from silver medals to bathroom taps, had been taken away.         
	The residents of Block I and Block II of Stephen Court have still not been allowed to return to their homes after the March 23 fire that killed 43 people as these parts of the building are considered unsafe.         
	The main door was intact. But once I went inside, I found that the locks on the doors of the five rooms were broken, said Malhotra, a commission agent at a packaging unit.        
	Silver trophies that Malhotra had won at sports meets in his youth had been yanked off their wooden bases and taken away. The burglars had also taken away trophies that his son had won from the cupboards.         
	The burglars have stolen my wine bottles, some brass and bronze showpieces, clothes and shoes, Malhotra, whose son lives in New York and daughter in New Delhi, said.         
	The robbers had not left behind the bathroom fittings, metal taps or shower pipes, either.         
	The Malhotras had removed most of their valuables from their Stephen Court flat after the fire. Malhotra now stays with his wife Rama, 68, and mother Kavita, 95, at a relatives flat at Rainey Park near Ballygunge Circular Road.        
	The Malhotras 3,000sqft flat had suffered little damage in the fire. Only the main door had been burnt. Last month, I fitted a new door after seeking special permission from the fire services and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation authorities, Malhotra said, his voice choking.        
	He said he used to regularly visit the flat and had last come in the third week of June.         
	Malhotra said the burglars could have entered his flat from the open verandah that faces Middleton Row.         
	They probably had hopped onto the terrace of the popular eatery on the ground floor and then climbed up a ladder that has been lying there since the fire to reach my verandah, Malhotra said.         
	When The Telegraph visited Stephen Court this evening, five policemen were found on duty at the mouth of Park Street. However, no cops were to be found at the Middleton Row end of the building.        
	Inside the flat, all the rooms were found ransacked, with almirahs and cupboards wide open. Malhotra was rummaging through the scattered clothes and other items for old family photographs.        
	It is scary how the robbers entered the building, which now gets police protection round the clock, Malhotra said.         
	An officer at Shakespeare Sarani police station said the police were probing the robbery.        
	Only six families have been allowed to return to their flats  in Block III and IV  at Stephen Court.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          One of the policemen being taken to hospital after the clash with villagers on Monday. (Jahangir Badsa)      
	Tamluk, Oct. 18: Angry shopkeepers today thrashed 20 policemen with their batons for arriving six hours late at a crime scene  a market that robbers attacked at dawn.         
	Thirteen policemen were admitted to Haldia subdivisional hospital in East Midnapore. Three others with head injuries are in the district hospital in Tamluk because they need CT scans.        
	Two villagers were also injured  one by a bomb hurled by the robbers, the other by a stray bullet when a policemans revolver accidentally went off.        
	According to the police, it was the bullet injury to the villager that angered the local people so much that they snatched the batons of the policemen and beat them up.        
	Asked why the force arrived so late to Parbatipur village in Sutahata, a senior police officer said: It seems the policemen were tired after monitoring idol immersions till 2am.         
	At Parbatipur, on the banks of the Hooghly, trouble started when over 20 robbers in boats struck at 3am today in a bid to loot the shops in a local market. There are 200 shops and around 20 traders guard the market every night as robberies have happened earlier.        
	Till 2am, policemen were posted near the market because of the idol immersion in the Hooghly. After that the police left. Around 3am, 20-25 robbers, their faces covered, came in a boat and tried to break the locks of some shops. When we chased them, they hurled bombs at us. One hit betel stall owner Kankan Das in his left leg, said Rintu, Mondal, a 40-year-old stationery shop owner.        
	 The shopkeepers started dialling the police immediately but for hours no one came.        
	At 9am, about 100 villagers hired trekkers and started for Sutahata police station, 7km away. When they were about 3km from Parbatipur, the villagers saw a police jeep heading towards the village. Four policemen were in it.        
	A police officer said: The villagers broke the windshield of the vehicle, beat up the four policemen and dragged them to the office of the local traders association and locked them there.         
	When the force at the police station realised their colleagues had been caught and confined, 20 more men were sent to Parbatipur.         
	The villagers fought the 20 policemen who baton-charged, an officer said. The villagers threw bricks in reply.         
	The policemen then fired in the air, angering the villagers even more. Some of them tried to snatch the firearms from the force. As the policemen tried to protect their guns, one revolver went off and a bullet hit Sambhunath Das in the leg.        
	After the villager was injured, the mob became more violent. They snatched the batons from the policemen and beat them up. Altogether 16 policemen were admitted to hospital.        
	To control the mob, the police fired in the air. Some villagers tried to snatch revolvers from them. In the melee, a policeman tried to prevent his revolver from being snatched and accidentally a shot got fired. The bullet hit a villager in the leg. We have arrested 23 villagers, said Ashok Biswas, the district superintendent of police.         
	The four policemen, who were kept locked, were rescued later.

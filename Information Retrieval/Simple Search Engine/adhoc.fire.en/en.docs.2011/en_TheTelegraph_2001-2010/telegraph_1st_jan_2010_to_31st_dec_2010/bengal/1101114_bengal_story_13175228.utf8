	Calcutta, Nov. 13: The store manager of a private firm in Jadavpur was murdered in his office this afternoon by two youths who hit him on the head with a meat chopper.     
	Saibal Mukherjee, 42, was interviewing a man for a job around noon when he was called out of the room by the youths.     
	Chandra Nath Nandi, the 45-year-old interviewee, said: Minutes later, I heard a cry. When I stepped out of the room, I saw the youths attacking Mukherjee with a meat chopper.     
	Nandi received a chopper blow on his right hand while trying to save Mukherjee. Police said Mukherjee may have been killed by a youth he had sacked a few months ago.

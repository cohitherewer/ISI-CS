	June 22: The railways today extended till June 26 the bar on night trains passing through the Maoist-hit areas.        
	It means several long-distance trains bound for western India from Howrah will continue to leave early in the morning instead of night.         
	Among them are the Mumbai-bound Jnaneswari Express, whose Maoist-engineered derailment on May 28 had prompted the move. The train will leave Howrah at 4.30am instead of 10.55pm.         
	The Howrah-Mumbai Mail via Nagpur will leave at 5am instead of 8.15pm, the Howrah-Pune Azad Hind Express will leave at 5.30am instead of 9.55pm and the Howrah-Ahmedabad Express will leave at 4am instead of 11.55pm.         
	One the way to Howrah, Jnaneswari, Samarsatta Express, Mumbai Mail, Azad Hind Express and Porbandar Express will leave eight hours behind schedule so that they do not reach Jharsuguda in Jharkhand before 4am. The Howrah-Adra-Chakradharpur Passenger, the Howrah-Adra-Bokaro Passenger and the Kharagpur-Tata Passenger will remain cancelled till June 26.         
	Tata concern        
	The suspension of night train services is affecting business in the region, Tata Steel managing director H.M. Nerurkar said in Jamshedpur.         
	The company is trying to revive air connectivity to the steel city to get around the problem, he added.

	Durgapur, March 24: About 500 villagers, led by Trinamul Congress activists, today set fire to a tent that housed a site office of the Aerotropolis project in Burdwans Andal and pulled down the fences on the land acquired for the airport city scheme, stopping work at the site for some time.         
	The protesters, claiming to be sharecroppers, demanded they be paid 50 per cent of the value of the land they had lost to the project. The government has said it will pay 25 per cent of the land value as compensation.         
	The villagers, some of armed with burning torches, descended on the construction site at Amlauka mouza, one of the sites of the project, and set fire to the tent. The agitators pulled down the barbed wire fencing and tore them out of their pegs. They poured diesel  kept in cans at the site for earth-moving machines  and set the fence on fire.        
	We have made a mistake by giving land for the project. The sharecroppers are yet to get their dues. We demand 50 per cent of the land value. We will not allow work to continue, said Mithu Bauri, 30, a villager from Amlauka who claimed to be a sharecropper.         
	Cops from Andal police station, 4km away, cane-charged the agitators and chased them away. Thirteen people have been arrested from neighbouring areas.         
	Villagers at Andal mouza, another site for the project,led by a Trinamul-backed save-farmland committee, have not allowed officials to hold hearings for the third phase of land acquisition for the airport city project.        
	On Monday, some committee activists had stormed a government office and foiled a meeting with villagers on land acquisition in Andal. The agitators had allegedly tried to snatch the officials files. The officials did not return to hold any further hearing today.        
	The aerotropolis project will include an airport, industrial and logistics hubs and IT parks.         
	The villagers in Andal mouza are demanding that Rs 20 lakh per acre for landowners and 50 per cent of the value of the land for registered bargadars.         
	On February 2, Trinamul Congress supporters had stopped fencing work for a few days at the Amlauka mouza.        
	Officials of Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Limited (BAPL), which is promoting the project, expressed concern at the repeated disruptions. The villagers are repeatedly disrupting the work on the project. In Andal mouza, they are even preventing the administration from holding hearings for the third phase of land acquisition. We dont know what will happen, a BAPL official said.        
	A BAPL official said work at Amlauka resumed this afternoon with police protection.         
	Additional district magistrate (land acquisition), Abhijeet Mukhopadhyay, said the BAPL authorities had lodged an FIR. Mukhopadhyay admitted that the sharecroppers were yet to get their compensation. It is taking time because we are scrutinising the claims of the sharecroppers. But we have made payments to the landowners, Mukhopadhyay said.        
	Trinamul Burdwan chief Moloy Ghatak said: If the administration does not pay any heed to the local farmers, we will step up our agitation in the future.

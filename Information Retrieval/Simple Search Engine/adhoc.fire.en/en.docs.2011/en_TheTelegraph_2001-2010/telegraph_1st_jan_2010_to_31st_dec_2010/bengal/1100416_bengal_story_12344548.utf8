                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoists kill CPM leader
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, April 15: Suspected Maoists dragged a CPM leader out of his in-laws house and shot him dead at a village near Lalgarh last night.        
	Police said Swapan Das, 42, a CPM branch-committee secretary from Domohini village in West Midnapore, was found dead in a pool of blood early this morning in neighbouring Bagjhapa village. They said he had been shot in the head.         
	Bagjhapa is 1km from Birihari village, where Das had come to meet his wife who has recently given birth.        
	Das had fled Domohini along with other CPM activists last June following a spurt in Maoist attacks there. He had been on the run since then while his wife and eight-year-old son stayed at his in-laws place in Birihari.         
	Das, who was staying the night at Birihari yesterday, was forcibly taken away by a group of 30 suspected Maoists.         
	His wife tried in vain to stop the Maoists. Around 5.30am today, some villagers spotted Dass body at Bagjhapa, a police officer said.        
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said: We have started conducting raids. No one has been arrested yet.        
	Anuj Pande, the CPM zonal committee secretary for Binpur, which covers Barihati and Bagjhapa, said the murder was definitely carried out by the Maoists.         
	The Maoists had destroyed our party office in Bagjhapa a month ago. Swapans body was found near the same party office.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 15: A Hooghly farmer who refused to pay subscription for a Kali Puja held at an office of the states electricity company was implicated in a false power-theft case and had to languish in jail for almost two months.        
	Fatik Chandra Bag was given bail today by Calcutta High Court after a report from an additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) saying a manager of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WBSEDCL) had cooked up the charges.        
	The resident of Dasnagar village in Hooghlys Khanakul had been asked to pay Rs 5,000 for the puja in the WBSEDCL office.         
	After he refused, Asit Sarkar, the manager of the local WBSEDCL office, lodged a police complaint alleging that Bag had hooked  drawn electricity without paying for it  power. The farmer was arrested soon after and remanded in jail custody.        
	My client had refused to pay the amount. The WBSEDCL employees had threatened him that he would not be spared for not paying the money. On October 28 this year, Bag received a bill of Rs 6.55 lakh from the WBSEDCL. He was told that he had been running his husking machines by hooking power, Bags lawyer said today.        
	On December 8, Bag moved a bail petition before the high court, which asked the ACJM of Chinsurah to conduct a probe. The ACJM said in his report that he himself had gone to Dasnagar and found no husking machine in Bags house.         
	The magistrate also said Bag owned a water pump, for which he had been using power legally. Bags neighbours confirmed that he never had any husking machine, the ACJM said.        
	According to the report placed before the high court, Bag, who owns a few bighas, was constantly under pressure to cough up the puja subscription and had been targeted by manager Sarkar and his colleagues because he didnt pay the sum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Yasmin custody to govt
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Yasmin custody to govt
          A STAFF REPORTER      
	Calcutta, Dec. 24: Calcutta High Court today handed over Yasmin Khatun, the teenager rescued from New Delhi, to the social welfare department and asked the state government to bear all her expenses.         
	While praising the CID for rescuing Yasmin (name changed), the high court dismissed a petition by her stepmother, Johora Bibi, against the director-general of police alleging negligence in tracing the girl, who had been missing since April 15, 2009.         
	The court also refused to hand over Yasmin to Johora, who wanted to take the teenager back to their home in South 24-Parganas Kakdwip. Balai Roy, the state advocate-general, said it would be the responsibility of the social welfare department to take proper care of the girl now.         
	After the court proceedings were over, a CID team took Yasmin to the Narendrapur home where she has been staying since being brought back from Delhi on December 20.         
	When Johora tried to enter the chief justices chamber where Yasmin was being heard, the girl refused to speak to her. Aami katha bolbo na. Tui ja ekhan thekey (I wont speak to you. Get out of here), Yasmin shouted at her stepmother. After Johora left the room, Yasmin told Chief Justice J.N. Patel: Where was she all these months? Why is she now showing fake concern? I met my mother and sister yesterday at Kakdwip court and I dont need to meet anyone else.         
	Johora told reporters Yasmin had been tricked into believing that her parents were not good and that she would not be safe if she returned home. She said she had spent a lot of money to bring the teenager back. I dont know why my daughter does not want to return home. I will discuss with my family members how to get her custody.

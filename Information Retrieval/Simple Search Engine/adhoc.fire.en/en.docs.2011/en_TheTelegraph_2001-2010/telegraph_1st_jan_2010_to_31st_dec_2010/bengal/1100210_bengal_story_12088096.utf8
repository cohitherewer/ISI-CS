          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                           Shibu Soren                                  
	Ranchi, Feb. 9: Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Sorens absence at P. Chidambarams meeting with chief ministers revived speculation about the states reluctance to participate in a co-ordinated offensive against Maoists who supported the JMM in last years Assembly elections.         
	Sorens deputies Raghubar Das and Sudesh Mahto were present at the meeting of four states, called to fine-tune strategy and ensure inter-state co-ordination of forces against Maoists. But the chief ministers absence  he was admitted to a hospital this morning  cast doubts about his governments stand on the Maoists.        
	Soren got admitted to the Apollo Hospital in Ranchi with a complaint of high blood pressure.        
	Soren, who made no bones about accepting Maoist support while campaigning for last years Assembly election, also gave JMM tickets to a number of former rebels who contested in Palamau, Khunti and Torpa  all rebel strongholds.         
	Sources close to Soren said his decision to skip the meeting was in tune with his politics. The proposed operation will hit tribal pockets, the support base of the JMM. Soren doesnt want to run the risk of losing their support in a politically uncertain state, said a senior JMM leader.        
	Some other JMM leaders said the concern over his health was real and nothing political should be read into it.         
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, too, did not attend the meeting, too . Asked about his absence, Chidambaram said: Unnecessary inferences are being made. I have been told that Nitish Kumar had earlier appointments. I will have a talk with him on the operations in Patna shortly. As for the Jharkhand chief minister, he was admitted to a hospital this morning. He has sent senior men from his government.

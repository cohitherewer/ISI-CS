	Sunia, Sept. 23: Trinamul Congress supporters allegedly fired shots and hurled bombs at East Midnapores Sunia village today, a day after a clash with CPM activists over the control of Khejuri claimed two lives.         
	Around 200 Trinamul activists from neighbouring Sonberia village guarded the main road that connects Sunia with Contai to stop CPM cadres from smuggling in arms.

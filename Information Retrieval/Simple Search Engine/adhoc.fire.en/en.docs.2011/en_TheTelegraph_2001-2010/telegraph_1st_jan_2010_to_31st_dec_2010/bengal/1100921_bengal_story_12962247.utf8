The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha calls for new land bill
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha calls for new land bill
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today advocated a new land acquisition bill to safeguard the interests of both farmers and industry, and stressed that the crucial issue was the compensation package.        
	We want the present land acquisition bill to be changed completely. There is no point dragging on with an 1894 legislation, he said after inaugurating a new building of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation in Camac Street.        
	The new law should make it clear how to acquire land and what would be the price of the acquired land. The issue of compensation for those whose land is being taken away is of utmost importance.        
	The Centre is keen to table the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill in the winter session of Parliament. Bhattacharjees political rival Mamata Banerjee has opposed the bill in its current form.        
	Bhattacharjee said the state government had acquired 6,500 acres of land after the Singur fiasco that dented the prospects of an industrial turnaround in Bengal.        
	We have acquired land in Andal, Naihati, Raghunathpur. In all these places, the farmers willingly handed over land because they want industry. The state attracted an investment of Rs 8,000 crore in 2009, he said.

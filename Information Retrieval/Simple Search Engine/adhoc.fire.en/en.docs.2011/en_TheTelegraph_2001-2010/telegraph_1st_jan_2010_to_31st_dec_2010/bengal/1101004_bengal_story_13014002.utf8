The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | PCPA calls off blockade ahead of Didi rally
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      PCPA calls off blockade ahead of Didi rally
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Oct. 3: The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities today withdrew its indefinite blockade in Jungle Mahal apparently to mobilise crowds for Mamata Banerjees October 6 meeting in Midnapore town.        
	Although committee spokesperson Joydeb Mahato said the blockade in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia was withdrawn because of the Pujas, local leaders of the outfit said the decision was taken to boost the numbers at the Trinamul Congress chiefs rally.         
	For the past five days, local transport such as buses and trekkers have kept off the roads.         
	We had a similar blockade on before Mamata Banerjees August 9 Lalgarh rally. But we withdrew it two days before the meeting to marshal villagers for the rally. This time, too, we have called off the blockade for the same reason, a local committee leader said.        
	Committee leaders said they were concentrating on the areas in West Midnapore that still remained their stronghold after the CPMs recapture of pockets in Lalgarh, Salboni, Goaltore, Jhargram and Kotowali.        
	We hope to mobilise around 30,000 villagers from Nayagram, Sankrail, Jamboni, Binpur and a part of Jhargram, a committee activist said. Committee leaders claimed they had discussed with local Trinamul leaders how to organise vehicles to ferry villagers.        
	Cong Siliguri trip        
	State Congress leaders will visit Siliguri on October 6 in an apparent bid to counter Mamata who had visited the hills a week ago.        
	We will interact with leaders from five north Bengal districts to seek their views on improving the socio-economic condition of the people there, state Congress president Manas Bhuniya said today.

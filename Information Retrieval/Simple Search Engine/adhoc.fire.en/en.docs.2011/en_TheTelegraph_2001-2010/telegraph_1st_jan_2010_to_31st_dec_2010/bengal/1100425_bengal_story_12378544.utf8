The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM salve, Citu stern

  - Biman tries to make strike before polls palatable        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta, April 24: The state CPM secretary promised milk for children on stranded trains and free passage for people going to work to make the 12-hour general strike on Tuesday less painful but the partys labour arm hung the threat of enthusiastic youths.         
	We wont go for any confrontation. We want people, particularly workers, to support the bandh spontaneously, Left Front chief Biman Bose said today, balancing the compulsions of an Opposition eager to nail Delhi on price rise and a ruling alliance heading towards crucial elections.        
	Long-distance trains shouldnt be stopped at small stations, but at big ones like Kharagpur, Burdwan or Bandel so that commuters get enough food and water. The strike organisers are requested to make provision for milk for children on trains that are stuck, Bose said, adding local trains wont be stopped forcibly.        
	However, grave doubts remain whether Boses grand no-confrontation promise will percolate down to the cadres who will hit the roads to enforce the strike.        
	Minutes after he spoke, Citu secretary Kali Ghosh said: Forcible enforcement is not our policy. But there are always some enthusiastic youths who may obstruct vehicles. How can we stop them?        
	He added that the blame should lie with passengers who travel on a bandh day. We will ask our people to see if they can arrange for some buses and taxis at Sealdah and Howrah. But the responsibility basically lies with the passengers who dont change their travel plans despite knowing about a strike in advance.         
	The Left Front has called the nationwide strike along with several other parties to protest the Congress-led Centres failure to curb inflation and unemployment.         
	But barely a month before elections to 81 civic bodies, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the Bengal unit is aware of its damage potential. It has ensured that the strike is confined to 12 hours.        
	Citu many not have to worry about the polls but Bose has to. Told that the union was keen to prolong the strike to a 24-hour one, Bose said: It is not the trade unions but the 13 parties that have called the strike and it would be from dawn to dusk.         
	If the trade unions want to do something else, they have that freedom, he added.        
	However, Bose too chose to ignore the danger that scores of trains would get stuck at small stations with little or no food or water in the chain reaction triggered by blockades.        
	He fell back on semantics while trying to justify the bandh as the first national strike called by non-Congress secular parties in 21 years.        
	If you are wondering about the countless bandhs you suffered during this period, Bose has an explanation: They were all called by trade unions and other organisations while political parties only extended their support.         
	 We are being asked whether the strike will reduce price rise. Yes, the strike during the NDA regime had brought down prices. Both the NDA and UPA I governments had rolled back fuel price hikes to some extent following strikes, he added.         
	Bose parried the question whether IT services were exempt from the strike. Ghosh made it clear that Citu did not consider IT an essential service, though the state government had called it a public utility.        
	There are always some dalaals (agents) and strike-breakers there (in IT firms). We request them not to try to foil the strike this time, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamatas jibe at leader on billboards
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamatas jibe at leader on billboards
          OUR BUREAU                     A billboard put up by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation quotes from a Tagore poem the lines   ldquo;Mor naam ei boley khyato hok/Aami tomader-i lok (Let me be remembered/As one of you) rdquo; to pay homage to Jyoti Basu                          
	Calcutta, Jan. 22: Mamata Banerjee today took a swipe at the CPMs billboard blitz with Jyoti Basus picture, saying advertisements cannot produce leaders.        
	She neither named Basu nor his party, but the allusion was obvious at a time the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has flooded the city with a campaign in which the late leaders portrait shines big and bright.        
	After unveiling a statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in the Alipore court complex on the eve of his 114th birth anniversary, the Trinamul Congress leader said: Desher neta bigyapon kore hoi na (advertisements dont make a national leader).         
	Together with some advertising agencies, the civic body has put up over 250 billboards since Basus death on Sunday.         
	How can the party pay its homage to Jyoti Basu through billboards? a Trinamul MP asked, echoing his leaders sentiment. According to him, Mamata is unhappy with the hype around Basus death.         
	Although Mamata had gone to see Basu in hospital, she skipped his last journey and has vowed to stay away from his condolence meeting, apparently to keep up her image of being the ever-uncompromising fighter against the CPM.         
	She did not take kindly to Congress president Sonia Gandhi visiting the Assembly where Basus body was kept to enable admirers to pay their last respects.        
	Her statements at the programme held by the Alipore Bar Association showed she wanted to continue in the same uncompromising vein, burying her earlier praise for Basu as an elder statesman.         
	Jara deshopremik noi, taderke niye matamati kora hoi, jara ashol nayak taderke lok bhule jachchhe, (Much is being made of those who are not patriots while people are forgetting true patriots), she said.         
	In the past, the Trinamul leader had claimed that she had developed an emotional bonding with Basu after he relinquished office in 2000, cleverly separating political rivalry and personal equation.        
	She used to respect Basu. But the CPMs strategy of using him in a bid to stall the slide in its support base has annoyed Mamata and she wants to counter it politically, said a Trinamul general secretary.         
	Observers think that by stirring the question about patriotism, she might be trying to refresh the old criticism against communists, who used to say Yeh azadi jhuta hai while the country was celebrating Independence.         
	Basus prolonged absence from flag-hoisting ceremonies on Independence Day had become a political issue and if Mamata raises questions on patriotism, the old issues are likely to resurface in political discourse, the Trinamul general secretary said.         
	Eighty municipalities across the state will go to polls in May and Calcutta and Salt Lake the month after. The Assembly polls are due next year.         
	It is hard to say if the CPM really expects Basus death to generate a sympathy wave or, if it does, whether that will last till the polls. However, the billboards suggest an effort to keep alive memories of the event that brought 10 lakh people out on the streets to march with Basus body.        
	Although Mamata thinks people have rejected the CPM and Basus death will do no good to its political fortunes, she sounded worried about the possibility during yesterdays meeting, said a Trinamul core committee member.         
	According to him, she asked all the leaders present to fan out to the districts and begin election-related work to counter any possible sympathy wave.

	Raiganj, Dec. 8: The Left government has downgraded the status of the Raiganj municipality in a manner that means the Congress-run civic body will get lesser funds.        
	The municipal affairs department, which has carried out the reclassification, has said in a circular that the revision from grade B to C has been made because the population of the area is not high enough to merit the higher category.         
	The number of wards has also come down by one to 25. Raiganj is the home turf of Congress leader Deepa Das Munshi.        
	Municipality chief Mohit Sengupta expressed fears that the lesser funds could affect civic amenities. But local CPM leader Nilkamal Saha blamed narrow politics for the downgrade. We had wanted more areas under the body. But the Congress-run board feared it might affect their vote bank.

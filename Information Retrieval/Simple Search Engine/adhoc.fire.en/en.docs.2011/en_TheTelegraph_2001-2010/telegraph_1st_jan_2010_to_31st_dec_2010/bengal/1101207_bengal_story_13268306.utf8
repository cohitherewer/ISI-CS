	Behrampore, Dec. 6: Panchayat minister Anisur Rahman today said tourism had not taken off in Murshidabad despite it being a historical place. The comment came at a programme where tourism minister Manab Mukherjee was present.         
	Several attempts have been made to develop tourism in Murshidabad. But not much development has taken place, Rahman said at the inauguration of a launch jetty on the banks of the Bhagirathi in Behrampore.        
	Mukherjee admitted that the government had failed to do much to improve tourism in the district but argued that Rahmans comment was not a complaint.

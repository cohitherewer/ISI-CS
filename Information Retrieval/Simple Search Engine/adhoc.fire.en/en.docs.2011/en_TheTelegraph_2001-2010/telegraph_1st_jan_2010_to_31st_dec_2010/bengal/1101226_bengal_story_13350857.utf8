          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Malda, Dec. 25: A train mowed down a 50-year-old man glued to his cellphone seconds after he ducked under the bar of a closed level-crossing gate in Malda and stepped onto the tracks this morning.        
	Sushil Choudhury, a bus conductor, was so engrossed in the conversation that he failed to notice the approaching train. Neither did he hear the screams of the gateman, who tried to alert him after seeing him stoop to go under the horizontal bar of the closed gate at the Malanchapally level crossing in Malda town.         
	Malanchapally resident Choudhury, who was going to work, reached the level-crossing around 6am. An eyewitness said he seemed to be in a hurry.        
	P.K. Das, the inspector in charge of Government Railway Police in Malda, said: He (Choudhury) was talking on his cellphone. He failed to notice the approaching Gour Express and stepped on the tracks. The on-duty gateman had tried to alert him by shouting.        
	Das said the conductor was killed on the spot. Choudhurys dismembered body lay beside the tracks for two hours. GRP personnel came around 8am and took the body to Malda district hospital for a post-mortem. Choudhury is survived by his wife and two sons, the police said.        
	Senior police officers said despite repeated warnings, people still talked over their cellphones while driving or walking down busy roads or crossing rail tracks.        
	A number of accidents such as todays has happened in the recent past. Despite that, people keep committing the same mistake, an officer said.         
	In the past two years, nearly a dozen people have been run over and killed by speeding trains in North and South 24-Parganas alone. All of them were speaking over their cellphones while crossing the tracks, unmindful of an approaching train.         
	Track death        
	A 55-year-old man was run over and killed by the Howrah-bound Intercity Express when he was crossing the tracks this morning near Malda station. The man has been identified as Ujjal Ghosh, a resident of Englishbazar.

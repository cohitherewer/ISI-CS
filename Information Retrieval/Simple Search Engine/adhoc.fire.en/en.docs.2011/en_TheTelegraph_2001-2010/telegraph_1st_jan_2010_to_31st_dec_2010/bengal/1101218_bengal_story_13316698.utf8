The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Police brake on Dankuni rail site
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Police brake on Dankuni rail site
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The rail site in Dankuni. Picture by Ananda Das                                  
	Chinsurah, Dec. 17: Police today stopped work on a portion of the rail land in Dankuni where water bodies are allegedly being filled up without the state governments permission in violation of green rules.        
	The halt comes in the wake of an FIR lodged yesterday by the state fisheries department accusing the Mamata Banerjee-led utility of carrying out the filling work without its prior permission. An engine component unit is to come up at the site.        
	The land, just outside Calcutta, belongs to the railways but approvals from the state government are required under the West Bengal Inland Fisheries Act, 1984, before water bodies are filled, irrespective of the ownership.         
	The officer in charge of Dankuni police station, Subir Chatterjee, said: We sent a team of policemen to the spot and asked the workers engaged by a railway contractor to stop work until further notice. But work has only been stopped on a portion of the site. It is continuing on the rest of the plot.        
	Another officer said work had been stalled on 39 acres. Two large ponds, spread across a total area of 137 acres, are being filled up.        
	But Howrah divisional railway manager P. Mondal claimed work was going on as usual and that there had not been any violation. We have a clearance from the Union environment ministry. We have not violated any norm.        
	Hooghly superintendent of police Tanmay Roychowdhuri said the contractors and rail officials had been asked to meet the officers at Dankuni police station as soon as possible. We have started an investigation as filling up water bodies is an offence. We have also asked for all documents relating to the land, Roychowdhuri said.        
	The FIR was lodged by an assistant director of the fisheries department  headed by Kiranmoy Nanda  after Left members of an Assembly standing committee visited the site on Wednesday.         
	The MLAs claimed that the pond-filling would leave Dankuni with severe drainage and ecological problems. The House panel has five Trinamul and Congress members but they were not part of the delegation.        
	Early this month, eight Left MLAs from Hooghly had complained to district magistrate Sripriya Rengarajan that wetlands were being filled up for the rail factory.

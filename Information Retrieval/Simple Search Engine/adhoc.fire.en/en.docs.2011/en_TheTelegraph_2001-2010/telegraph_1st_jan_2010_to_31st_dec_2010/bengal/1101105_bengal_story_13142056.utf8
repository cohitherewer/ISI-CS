The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong tie-up signal to Didi
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong tie-up signal to Didi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 4: The Congress today said it would firm up the alliance with the Trinamul Congress for next years Assembly elections, adding that the failure to strike a deal for the May civic polls was a forgotten chapter.        
	There is no denying that we could not firm up the alliance with Mamata Banerjee in the run-up to the civic polls. But that is a forgotten chapter. The Congress and Mamataji will join hands to oust the Marxists from Bengal in the Assembly polls, said K. Keshava Rao, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief had said in an interview with STAR Ananda last night that the Congress had broken the alliance with her party before the civic polls.         
	Rao today urged Mamata to forget such small matters. He told The Telegraph over phone from Delhi: We will soon sit with Mamataji and work out how to stitch up an alliance before the 2011 polls. The Congress and Trinamul will reach a consensus on all 294 seats in the state.        
	Rao said his party had passed a resolution at its one-day conference in Delhi on November 2 that the Congress would forge alliances with like-minded parties in all the 10 poll-bound states in the country.         
	The Congress leadership, however, made it clear the party was not in favour of withdrawing the joint forces from Bengal, a demand repeatedly made by Mamata.         
	The deployment of central forces is necessary to combat the Maoists. They cannot be withdrawn at this juncture on Mamatadis demand, an AICC leader said from Delhi.        
	Bengal Congress chief Manas Bhuniya echoed the central leadership. The central forces cant be withdrawn. It is up to the state government to ensure that the forces are not misused to expand the CPMs base in Jungle Mahal, he said.

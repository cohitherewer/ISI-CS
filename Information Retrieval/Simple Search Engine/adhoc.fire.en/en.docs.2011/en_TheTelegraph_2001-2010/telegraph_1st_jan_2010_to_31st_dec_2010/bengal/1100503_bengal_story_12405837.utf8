The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bomb blows off palm
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bomb blows off palm
                            
	Behrampore, May 2: A farm labourer had his left palm blown off this morning while tinkering with a six-inch water pipe, one of five his eight-year-old daughter had brought home at Kapasdanga in Murshidabad, 235km from Calcutta.         
	Police said neither the girl, who had found the pipes und-er a pile of dry leaves she had gone to collect for fuel, nor her father Khurshed Sheikh, 35, knew they were crude bombs commonly known as socket bombs.         
	Khurshed thought he would sell the pipes, which had their ends sealed, and tried to break open one of them to find out what was inside.         
	An explosion shook their hut. Khurshed, who also suffered splinter injuries in his chest, is now in hospital.

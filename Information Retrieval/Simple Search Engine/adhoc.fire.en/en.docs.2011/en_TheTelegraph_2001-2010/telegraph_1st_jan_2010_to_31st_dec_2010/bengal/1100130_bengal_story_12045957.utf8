The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul bid to halt sale
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul bid to halt sale
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 29: The Trinamul Congress today moved the Supreme Court in a bid to halt the sale of public sector Andrew Yule-owned DPSC to a private consortium led by Srei Infrastructure.        
	Trinamul, which opposes divestment of government stake in public sector units, failed to get a stay from the two-judge bench on the transfer of shares in DPSC, a power utility, to the Srei combine.        
	On Calcutta High Courts directions, the transfer of the 57 per cent stake had to be completed by January 29, 2010.        
	The petition was filed by the Indian Nationalist Trinamul Congress represented by its president Moloy Ghatak, challenging the high courts power to direct divestment of over 50 per cent shares in a government company without approval of the central government and central government companies.        
	Senior Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee told The Telegraph the party opposed sale of profit-making PSUs. In the case of loss-making companies, first priority must be given to revive them before sale.        
	DPSC, an Andrew Yule-Descon joint venture, is a profit-making company.         
	Chatterjee, who sought to distance the party from the union move that he said was aimed at protecting workers interests, is a member on the board of Descon, which lost to Srei the bid for the 57 per cent stake sale in DPSC.        
	Till the transfer of the 57 per cent holding to Srei, Descon was the largest single shareholder in DPSC.        
	Asked if there was a conflict of interest between him holding a board position in Descon and a Trinamul union going to court, Chatterjee said there could be no such issue. I normally dont attend board meetings, he said. Descon is an employee-driven organisation and I have been with Yule and these companies (Descon and DPSC) for many years.        
	Descon had opposed the sale of DPSC. After many legal wrangles, it participated in the auction.        
	The petition challenged government-owned LIC and United India Assurance Companys decision to sell their shares in DPSC to a private consortium without parliamentary sanction. It said: can the high court direct the transfer of shareswithout taking regard of the interest of workers at any stage?         
	The Supreme Court asked the parties concerned to follow the procedures laid down in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi)s takeover code. This means the Srei consortium will have to make an open offer to buy an additional 20 per cent, sources said.

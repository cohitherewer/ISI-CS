The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Along with iron fist, a velvet-glove gesture
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Along with iron fist, a velvet-glove gesture
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Calcutta, June 17: The Bengal government today announced a welfare package for Maoist-affected areas in the state, replicating the Centres security-cum-development policy on the eve of the first anniversary of deploying central forces in Lalgarh.        
	The government suggested that it would encourage the rebels to surrender, adding that bail would be sought for undertrials charged with minor offences.         
	The development measures and the lenient gestures came a day after the joint forces scored their biggest success yet by busting a Maoist camp and gunning down at least eight rebels.        
	The state government has prepared a special package for (Left-wing extremist) LWE-affected areas. We shall start with West Midnapore and then implement it in Bankura and Purulia, chief secretary Ardhendu Sen said at Writers Buildings this afternoon. Lalgarh is located in West Midnapore.        
	The package offers cheaper rice and seeks to promote educational opportunities. (See chart)        
	Asked about the reason for the special package, Sen said: Development works in Maoist-hit areas were stalled for the past one year. People were forced to suffer a lot. The governments move is aimed at offering relief to them.        
	 Sen said the state would implement a surrender-cum-rehabilitation package for the extremists who give up their arms and agree to join the mainstream.         
	He added that the cases against those in police custody would be reviewed so that the persons charged with minor offences could be released on bail.        
	Officials said about 400 youths charged with minor offences had been languishing in jails for the past one year.        
	Asked if any Maoists had so far approached the government to surrender, he said: We have got some hints about it. In fact, some NGOs have come forward to try for it.         
	Special cells headed by a senior officer will be created in the offices of the district magistrates of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia to monitor the implementation of the welfare package.         
	In New Delhi, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi said tribals owning land in Maoist-affected states should be made shareholders in projects.        
	Saying there is no difference between Naxalites and insurgents in his state, Gogoi said: Make the landowners shareholders according to the value of their land.         
	The Centre had prepared a draft act that seeks to make tribal landowners shareholders in mining companies.

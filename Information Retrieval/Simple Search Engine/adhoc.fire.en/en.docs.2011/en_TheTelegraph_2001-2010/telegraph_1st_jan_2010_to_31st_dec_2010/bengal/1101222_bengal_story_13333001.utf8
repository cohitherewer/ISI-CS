The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress tolerance sermon to seal alliance
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Congress tolerance sermon to seal alliance
          BARUN GHOSH                          K Keshava Rao                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 21: The senior Congress leader in charge of Bengal today said the alliance with Trinamul had to be struck at any cost, a day after Mamata Banerjees party announced it was prepared to go it alone.        
	The alliance with Trinamul has to be struck at any cost because it would benefit both parties. Our common goal is to put an end to the CPMs 34-year misrule in Bengal. And keeping this in mind, we should get over the minor hitches and stitch together an alliance to fulfil peoples aspirations. I will soon come to Calcutta and meet Mamataji, K. Keshava Rao told The Telegraph from Delhi this evening.        
	The AICC leader said he had asked the Bengal leaders to be more tolerant and accommodative in their approach to Trinamul. The opposition should not be for oppositions sake. I want my leaders not to criticise Trinamul like they do in the case of the CPM over the (political) violence. One should keep in mind that both of us had benefited from fighting last years Lok Sabha polls together.        
	Senior Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya, who heads Intuc, the partys trade union, agreed. During my telephone conversation with Rao today, I tried to drive home the point that some of our state leaders are intolerant and lack patience. Instead of being involved in mudslinging with Trinamul, they should be careful about protecting the alliance at this juncture. If the alliance flops, people wont forgive us, Bhattacharya said.        
	AICC sources in Delhi said Raos appeal for restraint followed near-daily public attacks by state Congress leaders on Trinamul. We told Raoji that those at the helm in the Pradesh Congress Committee these days convene news conferences daily just to show how we are at loggerheads with Trinamul, said a state leader who had just returned from the Congress plenary session that ended in Delhi yesterday.        
	A PCC executive committee meeting has been scheduled for January 2 in Calcutta to discuss steps to cement the alliance.         
	State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya, still in Delhi where he had gone for the plenary, said the meeting would be chaired by senior leader and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. We shall also discuss how to rejuvenate the organisation (the Congress) at the block level by launching a jana jagaran (mass awareness) programme, as Congress president Sonia Gandhi has asked us to.         
	Asked about Trinamuls go-it-alone threat, Bhuniya said: It would be sad for us if Trinamul does not stitch an alliance with us. In fact, I want them to begin the process right now by organising joint movements against the CPM-sponsored violence across the state.         
	That Trinamul leaders, too, are eager to firm up the alliance was evident in another meeting that party chief whip Ashok Deb held with his Congress counterpart Asit Mal for floor co-ordination in the ongoing Assembly session.        
	But in Siliguri, Trinamul leaders continued with their aggressive posturing, saying they would contest most of the 54 seats in north Bengal, traditionally a Congress bastion.        
	We will contest from most of the seats in Darjeeling, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and South Dinajpur, said Gautam Deb, the Darjeeling district president of Trinamul, flanked by party MP Subhendu Adhikari.        
	Asked about yesterdays warning to the Congress, a Trinamul general secretary let the cat out of the bag. This is a tactic to mount pressure on the Congress so that the seat-sharing deal is struck on Mamatadis terms.

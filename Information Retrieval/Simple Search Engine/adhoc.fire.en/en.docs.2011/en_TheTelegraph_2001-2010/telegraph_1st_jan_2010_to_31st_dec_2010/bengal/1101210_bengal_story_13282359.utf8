          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Governor MK Narayanan and fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda at the inauguration. (Jahangir Badsa)                                        
	Petuaghat (East Midnapore), Dec. 9: Governor M.K. Narayanan today regretted the absence of Trinamul central minister Sisir Adhikari at the inauguration of a Delhi-funded fishing harbour in his own constituency despite accepting the invitation.        
	I am very sorry that central minister Mr Adhikari is not present at the programme, Narayanan said during his speech after opening the harbour here. State fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda presided over the event.        
	Adhikari, whose son and local MLA Dibyendu also did not attend the inauguration, later said he had stayed away in line with a decision by his party not to share a platform with any Left minister. I abided by the decision of my party. We cant be present at any programme with any Left Front minister. This is a murderer government sponsoring terrorism across the state. That is why none of us attended the programme, said Adhikari.        
	Nanda said prior permission had been sought from the guests before printing their names on the invitation cards. We had printed their names with their consent. They stayed away because of political reasons. There may be political differences but every one should co-operate in matters of development, said Nanda.         
	A black marble plaque erected for the opening of the Rs 61-crore project mentions Adhikari as chief guest and Dibyendu along with Ranjit Mondal  the chief of the local Trinamul Congress-run zilla parishad  as special guests.        
	Narayanan appeared to lament the absence of local leaders  the senior Adhikari has been elected from Contai (South)  at a project he dubbed a first in the country. This is the first time a major fishing harbour is being set up in the country by the fisheries department of a state, the governor said.        
	Trinamul sources said the party had initially decided to shun meetings attended by CPM ministers but later expanded the boycott to include all ministers of the Left, of which Nandas West Bengal Socialist Party is a constituent.        
	Sisirda stayed away from todays programme in accordance with the party line. , said a Trinamul vice-president.        
	The sources suggested that the Adhikaris move was not a first. Calcutta mayor Sovan Chatterjee and Bidhannagar municipality chairperson Anita Mondal, both from Trinamul, have stayed away from several meetings convened by state urban development minister and CPM leader Asok Bhattacharya.        
	The boycotts have not always found favour with Trinamul ally Congress, whose state chief Manas Bhuniya has criticised Mamata Banerjee for skipping government events.

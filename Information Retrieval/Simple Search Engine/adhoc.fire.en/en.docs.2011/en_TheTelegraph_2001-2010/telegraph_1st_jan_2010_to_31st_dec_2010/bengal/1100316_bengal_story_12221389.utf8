          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, March 15: Kaushal Chowdhury and his wife had wanted to drown to death after allegedly killing their children, but they did not find a place deserted enough in the Hooghly to commit suicide.        
	Police have found out that the couple caught last night for poisoning their three daughters and a son ran away from home while the son and a daughter writhed in pain. After hearing 45-year-old Kaushals account, the police said lack of money and joblessness prompted him and his wife, 37-year-old Preeti, to kill the children.        
	Kaushal, who earlier worked in a cloth shop in Calcutta, and Preeti made the children consume the soft drink on Saturday night. Last night, a friend informed the police that Kaushal and his wife Preeti, 37, were hiding in his house.        
	Kaushal told the police that he and Preeti searched for a quiet place in Bally and Dakshineswar to commit suicide.         
	They wanted to drown themselves in the Hooghly and had gone to Bally and Dakshineswar. At Dakshineswar, Kaushal hired a boat for Rs 400 but abandoned the plan as the place was crowded. Then they went to a friends house in Burrabazar and confessed their crime and requested him to let them stay for the night. They had planned to go to Digha this morning and commit suicide there, said Nirupam Ghosh, the officer in charge of Rishra police station.        
	Kaushal told us they had initially planned to drink the pesticide at home after ensuring that the children are dead.        
	The officer added: The children were given the soft drink on Saturday night. But on Sunday morning, Kaushal and Preeti found that Prerna, 18, and Govinda, 15, had not died and were writhing in pain. Kaushal called up his brother-in-law, Madanlal Lohia, in panic and confessed what he had done and said he and his wife were going to commit suicide.         
	Divya, 20, their eldest daughter, and Tiya, 11, the youngest, died on Saturday. The other two died on Sunday.         
	Kaushal lost his job in the Park Street cloth shop three months back. He used up his savings. Kaushal told the police he used to earn Rs 11,000 a month.        
	But Kaushals friend in Burrabazar informed the police. The couple were produced in a Serampore court today and put in two days police remand.

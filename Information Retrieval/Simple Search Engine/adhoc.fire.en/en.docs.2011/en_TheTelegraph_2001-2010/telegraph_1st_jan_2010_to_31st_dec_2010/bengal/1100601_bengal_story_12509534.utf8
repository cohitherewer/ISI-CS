The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamatas UPA date
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamatas UPA date
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, May 31: Mamata Banerjee and Pranab Mukherjee are likely to meet in Delhi tomorrow at UPA IIs rescheduled anniversary programme, days after blaming each other for the collapse of their alliance.        
	Before leaving for Delhi today, the Trinamul Congress chief said she was going on a request from the Prime Minister. Being an ally in the UPA government at the Centre, I am attending tomorrows programme. Moreover, the request came to me from the Prime Minister.        
	Trinamul sources crowed that Manmohan Singh had called up last night to request Mamata to come over. But she may have to share a table with Mukherjee, the state Congress chief, hours before the civic poll results reveal whether the Congress was right in going it alone.        
	The UPA programme, scheduled for May 22, had been deferred because of the Mangalore plane crash earlier that day.        
	Asked if he would discuss the post-poll scenario with Mamata, Mukherjee said this evening: Im not going to tell you whether I have a meeting with Mamata or not, let alone reveal to you what we are going to discuss.         
	Mamata kept mum.        
	During the civic poll campaign, Mukherjee had warned Mamata against repeating CPM general secretary Prakash Karats mistake of withdrawing support to the UPA after she threatened to go it alone in the future. Mamata had time and again hit out at Mukherjee, accusing him of trying to strengthen the CPMs hands.         
	Some Congress leaders hope tomorrows meeting will bring a thaw in their relations. If Pranabda and Mamataji have a one-to-one meeting on the sidelines of the UPA programme, it could help ease their strained relations, said a party general secretary from Delhi.         
	Bengal Congress leaders, worried about the partys prospects after the STAR Ananda-AC Nielsen exit poll gave it only seven of the 141 wards in the Calcutta civic body, also want Mukherjee to sit with Mamata. Let us forget what happened before the civic polls, said state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

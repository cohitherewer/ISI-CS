	Calcutta, Feb. 12: IPS officer Gaurav Dutta has been suspended on charges of grave misconduct.        
	The state human rights commission had recommended action against him after a constables wife approached the panel accusing the officer of misconduct when he was a deputy inspector-general (training) posted in Barrackpore. Dutta is now IG (planning).         
	Departmental proceedings against him will start now, the home secretary said.

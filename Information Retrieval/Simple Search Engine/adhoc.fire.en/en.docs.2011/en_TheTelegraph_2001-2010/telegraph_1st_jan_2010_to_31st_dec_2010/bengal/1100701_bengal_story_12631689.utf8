The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Anger at police and party
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Anger at police and party
  - Victim family alleges inaction        OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Nanoor, June 30: The family of former CPM MLA Ananda Das, who was killed yesterday by alleged Trinamul Congress supporters, today accused police of arriving late though the leader had frantically called for help.         
	Das was dragged out of his house in Birbhums Nanoor village by an armed gang, beaten up and shot dead.        
	My husband had repeatedly called up the police when he saw them ransacking the neighbouring party zonal committee office. But the police did not arrive. My husband would not have been killed had the cops responded faster, Dass wife Hasi said.         
	Nanoor police station is less than a kilometre from Dass house. It should not have taken more than 10 minutes for the cops to reach the scene of the attack. But villagers alleged that the police arrived only after the leaders murder.         
	Dass daughter Chaiti, who had fled home with her three-year-old brother and cousin to escape the attackers, accused the police of inaction even after they arrived. My father called the police after the gang hurled bombs at the party office, she said. The attack continued even after they came.        
	Although the family did not allege as much, CPM supporters elsewhere had earlier accused the police of acting late on complaints against Trinamul, the party knocking at the doors of power.         
	The CPMs pent-up anger against the police in Nanoor today came to such a pass that villagers chased away the cops posted to guard Dass house.        
	The villagers also chased away a police team led by the second officer of Nanoor police station, Samir Dutta, when it went to patrol the village this morning. Yesterday, you did not come to save our leader. We dont need you any more, the villagers told Dutta.         
	Rabindranath Mukherjee, the Birbhum superintendent of police, claimed that a team of around eight to 10 cops, led by Dutta, had gone to Dass house immediately after the former MLAs call. However, they were outnumbered by the 250-strong mob that had descended on the party office, Mukherjee said.        
	The force was too small for the mob and so they could not take any action. We sent reinforcements from various police stations. But by then Das had been killed, the officer added.        
	An officer elsewhere said that though the force was outnumbered, the police could still have fired in the air to disperse the mob.         
	Nanoor officer-in-charge Habibul Hasan has been on leave for three days. The OC is ill. We today appointed a sub-inspector of Bolpur police station the temporary OC of Nanoor, Mukherjee said.        
	Uday Banerjee, the circle officer of Nanoor, was also not present in his office when Das was attacked. Banerjee said he had gone to neighbouring Illambazar on an assignment.        
	The villagers today also alleged that Dass bodyguard, a constable, was not with him when he was attacked.        
	The bodyguard, Mohammad Khoda Nawaz, said he had gone for tea. I had gone for tea at the bus stand (about 200 metres from Dass house). When I saw the mob, I tried to rush to Anandababus house but I could not reach because bombs were being hurled, Nawaz claimed.        
	Dilip Sutradhar, a villager, said they would not allow the police to come to our village.        
	Thirteen people have been arrested in connection with the murder and the attack on the CPM office.        
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee today demanded an inquiry into the alleged Nanoor massacre of 2000 and the subsequent killings of Trinamul supporters in the region.

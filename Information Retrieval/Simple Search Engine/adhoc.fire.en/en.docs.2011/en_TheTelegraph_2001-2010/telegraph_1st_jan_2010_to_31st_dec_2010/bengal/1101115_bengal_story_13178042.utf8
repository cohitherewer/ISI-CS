	Balarampur, Nov. 14: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today pledged to root out the Maoists from Bengal and urged the people to unite and stand by the government in its mission.        
	At a rally in rebel hotbed Purulia, the chief minister said: The time has come to unite against the Maoists. They are on a killing spree in our state. But dont be frightened. I have come here to share your concern. If you (the people) unite, the rebels will not be able to raise their heads any more. We will root out the Maoists.         
	Bhattacharjee told the gathering in Balarampur, where the rebels have killed 23 CPM leaders and cadres in the past two years, that he had asked police to be tough with the Maoists.         
	The chief minister identified the Trinamul Congress as a major hurdle to launching the offensive against the Maoists.        
	Unable to fight the Left Front politically, Trinamul is aligning with the Maoists. The party is not concerned about the welfare of poor people. Its sole objective is to weaken the Left Front, he said.         
	Trinamul leader Subrata Bakshi rubbished Bhattacharjees allegation. There is no difference between the Marxists and the Maoists. They are two sides of the same coin.        
	During his speech, Bhattacharjee made it clear the administration could not remain inactive as the Maoists had let loose anarchy in Purulia. Children are afraid to go to school. Teachers too are scared because a teacher was dragged out of his class and shot dead by Maoists.        
	He added: We will have to ensure peace and normality in Purulia. Maoists are hiding inside forests on the Ayodhya Hills and carrying out their operations from there. If they have the guts, they should come out in the open and face the administration.         
	The crowd, however, did not sound too hopeful about the possible results of the firm action Bhattacharjee promised against the rebels.         
	Buddhababu promised us a lot but given the ground realities here, we are doubtful if the situation will improve in the near future, said Amal Hembram, an elderly man.        
	Hembram said the government had done nothing to rescue police inspector Partha Biswas and his friend Saumajit Basu, who are suspected to have been kidnapped by the Maoists from the Ayodhya Hills. Bhattacharjee said he was trying his level best to bring the two back alive.

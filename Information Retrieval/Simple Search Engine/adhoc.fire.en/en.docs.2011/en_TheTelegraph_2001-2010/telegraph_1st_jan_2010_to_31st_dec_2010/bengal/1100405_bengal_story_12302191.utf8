The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM holds fire on minister
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM holds fire on minister
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 4: CPM state secretary Biman Bose was subdued in his reaction to the Union home ministers tough talk about the states law and order today.         
	Chidambaram does not know the details of the ground reality, he said.        
	About the Union home ministers repeated reminders about lack of development in the Maoist-hit areas, Bose said: Development and political activities cant resume as long as there is smell of gunpowder in the air. Normal life is missing as people cant live in peace, students cant go to schools.         
	He was not forthcoming on Chidambarams apparent admonition of the state government for failing to contain political clashes. I dont represent the administration.         
	The CPM apparently wants to see Chidambarams buck stops at your table reminder to the chief minister as his bid to maintain coalition dharma by keeping ally Mamata Banerjee in good humour. The party chose not to react to his statements while privately lauding his decision not to visit trouble spots in Burdwan, as Mamata had requested, or rake up complaints that armed CPM men had gained ground in Lalgarh taking advantage of the crackdown on Maoists.        
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya felt the home ministers assessment of the states law and order was a major jolt to the ruling CPM. It will help us step up our campaign for next months civic polls, he added.

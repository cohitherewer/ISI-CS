                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Tribal outfit takes PCPA men hostage
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 18: Activists of a tribal outfit today took 26 Peoples Committee supporters hostage following a clash in West Midnapore, joining the villagers uprising against the rebels in the district.        
	Around 4.30 this morning, nearly 400 activists of the Bharat Jakat Majhi Marwa (BJMM), an organisation for the social and cultural welfare of tribals, raided the houses of committee supporters in Ramchandrapur village, 5km from Jhargram town.        
	The group, led by Prabir Murmu, the secretary of the youth wing of the BJMM, consisted of the outfits activists from neighbouring Jharageria, Jamidardanga, and Shalukgeria villages. They were armed with guns, bows and arrows and spears.         
	They shouted tribal war cries as they rushed towards Ramchandrapur. When they reached the edge of the village, committee supporters fired at them and hurled bombs. Three BJMM supporters suffered pellet injuries. But the activists soon regrouped and retaliated by firing back and hurling bombs, a police officer said.        
	Outnumbered, the committee supporters began fleeing the village. However, the BJMM activists caught 26 of them. Their houses were ransacked and they were dragged to Jharageria where they were forced to squat on a field. The 26 have still not been allowed to leave.        
	Armed PCPA activists have been attacking Jharageria, Jamidardanga and Shalukgeria for the past 10 days since the residents of these villages have refused to take part in the committees programmes. They have hurled bombs at our villages and fired in the air to create panic, Murmu said.        
	He claimed his outfits supporters had gone to Ramchandrapur to sort out the matter but were attacked without provocation by the committee activists.        
	The police said they had sent forces to Jharageria to rescue the hostages.

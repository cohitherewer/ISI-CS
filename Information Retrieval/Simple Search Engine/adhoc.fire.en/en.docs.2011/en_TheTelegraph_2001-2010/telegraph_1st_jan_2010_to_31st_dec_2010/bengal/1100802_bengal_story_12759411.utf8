The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bangla family to be reunited
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bangla family to be reunited
          MEHEDI HEDAYTULLAH                                            
	Islampur, Aug. 1: Krishna and Anima will be reunited with their parents in Bangladesh soon, the government of the neighbouring country has said.         
	The assurance comes less than a month after The Telegraph reported how red tape in Dhaka had split the Bangladeshi family of four, separating Madan and Malati Barman from their minor children when they set foot on home soil after serving a jail term in India for infiltration.        
	The Bangladesh deputy high commission in Calcutta wrote to the Indian external affairs ministry on Friday that Krishna, 14, and Anima, 12, were bona fide Bangladesh nationals and sought urgent necessary steps for their early release and repatriation.        
	Dhaka has sent us confirmation about the nationalities of the two children and they are going to be reunited with their parents. A date for their send-back has not been set yet, but I would like to be present there personally when it happens, Mohammed Abdul Hasan Mridha, the first secretary of the Bangladesh deputy high commission, said from Calcutta.        
	Gouranga Sarkar, the joint secretary of the Bengal home department, said police, the BSF and the intelligence agencies were being informed.         
	On June 30 this year, Madan and Malati, residents of Dharampur village in Thakurgaon district of Bangladesh, were allowed to return home.         
	However, the Bangladesh Rifles did not let the couples children in, as their names did not feature on the list provided by the Bangladesh government. Since then, Krishna and Anima have been staying at a government home  Suryodaya  in North Dinajpurs Raiganj.        
	The principal of Suryodaya, Partha Sarathi Das, said: I have told them the good news . I am glad that their days of uncertainty are over. The saga of separation started in September 2007 when the family entered India.They were arrested by the BSF and charged with infiltration. While the parents were lodged in the Islampur sub-jail, the two children were sent to juvenile homes in Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri.        
	Malati had pleaded with the Islampur court to be reunited with her children. Local lawyer Feroz Ahmed took up her plea but it was rejected. Ahmed appealed to Calcutta High Court, which allowed meetings between the parents and the children based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.         
	But Bangladesh proved less flexible or sympathetic than an Indian court towards its own citizens by separating the minor children from their parents.        
	After The Telegraph reported on July 10 the pushback of the parents and the refusal of the BDR to allow the children into Bangladesh, the matter was taken up by a Calcutta-based NGO, Diganta. Its secretary, Utpal Roy, got in touch with the deputy high commission which, in turn, confirmed the childrens nationalities with the home ministry in Dhaka and wrote to the Indian authorities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Court concern over beach crime
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Court concern over beach crime
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 30: Calcutta High Court today expressed concern about increasing criminal activities on Bengals beaches while hearing the bail plea of a man who was allegedly part of a gang that had molested a woman at Digha and assaulted her brother when he protested.        
	A division bench of Justices S.P Talukdar and M.K. Sinha said the state should take immediate action to stop the rising number of criminal activities on the sea beaches of Digha, Mandarmoni, Shankarpur, Bakkhali and Sagar Island. The court also proposed the introduction of a special force to keep the beaches crime free.        
	Incidents of rape, molestation and other criminal activities are regular features here (the sea beaches). A number of hotels and resorts near the beaches are being used for flesh trade. This should not be allowed. Ask the state government to take action. Special police forces should be deployed to make these areas crime-free, the court told public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami.        
	The court was hearing the bail petition of Surajit Kar, a resident of Panskura in East Midnapore.         
	Kar and his six friends, all between 24 and 30 years, had allegedly molested the 21-year-old girl, a Digha resident, when she was bathing in the sea on June 2. The accused were drunk. They also forcibly took away her brother in their car and beat him up.         
	The brother, who is still in hospital, had identified seven of the accused, following which they were arrested from Contai. All the seven are from East Midnapore.        
	However, Surajit was today granted bail because the police had failed to produce him at the identification parade.

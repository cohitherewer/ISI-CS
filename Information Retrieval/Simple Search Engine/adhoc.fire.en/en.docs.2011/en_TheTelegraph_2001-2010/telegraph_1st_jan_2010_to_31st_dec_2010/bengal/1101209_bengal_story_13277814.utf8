                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Lady torture slur on CPM
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Dec. 8: The wife of a Burdwan Trinamul worker allegedly being hounded by the CPM with false cases has suffered 70 per cent burns amid conflicting claims by her husband and her father about how she suffered the injury.        
	The husband and his local Trinamul bosses alleged that the 27-year-old homemaker was gangraped and set on fire by CPM activists. But her father said she had tried to commit suicide over tensions with her husband.        
	A complaint alleging the woman was raped and burnt was lodged with Burdwan police chief R. Rajsekharan by her husband Madai Maji this evening, several hours after she was admitted to the district hospital.        
	But the womans father Biswanath Maji lodged a parallel police complaint in Mangalkot  known for political clashes  accusing his son-in-law of creating pressure on his daughter to get money from him.        
	My daughter was suffering from depression because of the tension with her husband and that is why she tried to commit suicide by setting herself on fire, Biswanath said.         
	Leader of the Opposition, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee, visited the woman in the hospital.         
	Madai is a worker of our party. The CPM has lodged a number of false cases against him. Now they have tortured his wife. The police in Bengal are turning a blind eye to the violence, said Chatterjee.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Alipore zoo strike
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Aug. 28: The employees of the private security agency manning Alipore Zoo today went on a flash strike and forcibly closed five counters, causing inconvenience to weekend visitors.        
	The employees were protesting after the security agency sacked two staff members following a request by the zoo authorities. Zoo director Raju Das said the duo were slack in performing their duties.        
	The zoo remained open but the footfall was lower than normal. Many visitors left from the gates because of the strike. The protesters, affiliated to Intuc, alleged that Das was functioning arbitrarily. The zoo authorities said they would give the charge of guarding the zoo to another agency if necessary.

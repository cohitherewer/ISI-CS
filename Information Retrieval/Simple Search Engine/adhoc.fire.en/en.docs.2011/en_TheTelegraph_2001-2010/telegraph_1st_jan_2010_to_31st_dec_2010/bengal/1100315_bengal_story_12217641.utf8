The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | HC glare on fatal school beatings
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      HC glare on fatal school beatings
          TAPAS GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, March 14: Calcutta High Court has ruled that teachers whose ways of punishing students lead to their death should be charged with murder, not negligence or culpable homicide not amounting to murder as is normally the case.         
	The ruling was given by the court last week in a case against a Burdwan teacher who had hurled a duster at a student. She died later.         
	The bench observed that police in Andal should have initiated a murder case against Rekha Bhakat, the teacher of Andal Girls High School, under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. The girl, Babli Ghosh, was a Class V student.        
	The police had filed charges under Section 304 of the IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). This court feels that the police should prosecute the teacher under Section 302 (murder) instead of Section 304 of IPC, the bench said and rejected Bhakats anticipatory bail plea.        
	Now, the Andal police will have to execute the high court order by starting a criminal case against Bhakat after framing murder charges, advocate Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee said.        
	The observation is significant as it is in contrast to what the police generally do. The police start prosecution cases against teachers alleged to have committed such a punishable act under Section 304 A of the IPC (death due to negligence). First, 304 A is a section under which the alleged offender can get bail. Second, a person convicted of an offence under this section can be imprisoned for up to two years only. A charge under Section 302 invites capital punishment, advocate Tapas Bhanja said.        
	Bhakat, absconding since Bablis death on May 15, 2008, had moved the anticipatory bail petition before the high court after a Burdwan court rejected her plea. Bablis father and the school headmistress had lodged complaints against Bhakat following which the police started a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.         
	In November 2008, Iftesham Chowdhury, a Class III student in Calcutta, died after being slapped by her teacher. In this case, too, the police had booked Anita Das under Section 304A of the IPC.

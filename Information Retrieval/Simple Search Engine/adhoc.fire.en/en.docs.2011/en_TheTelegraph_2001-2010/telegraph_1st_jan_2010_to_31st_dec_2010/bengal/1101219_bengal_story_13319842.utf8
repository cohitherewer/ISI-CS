The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hope for trapped ship
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hope for trapped ship

	Calcutta, Dec. 18: Tiger Spring, the ship stuck at Hooghly Point since an accident on November 23, could be towed away early next week, the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) chairman said today.        
	A high-capacity crane from Singapore is being used to offload the ships cargo so that the vessel, stuck in the riverbed in the narrow channel, can float again.         
	CPT chairman M.L. Meena said the crane had already offloaded 170 containers, weighing around 3,500 tonnes. This amounts to almost half of the ships cargo, he added.         
	Meena said the entire cargo need not be offloaded. We hope the ship can be towed either to Calcutta port or to any other port for repairs by early next week, he said.        
	Tiger Spring suffered damage after a collision with another vessel, Green Valley. The movement of heavy vessels through the channel had to be suspended for a few days earlier this month after Tiger Spring drifted towards the middle of the channel.        
	Even now, it is causing problems for other vessels passing through the channel.        
	Vessel movement has also been affected by the heavy siltation at Hooghly Point. The port authorities have opened a new track in the channel through which vessels have been sailing since December 8.         
	Port sources said the new track was shallower than the main one, where Tiger Spring is stuck. A port official said: If the depth of the new track reduces sharply, vessels can get stuck, choking the entire Hooghly Point. A port official said that Tiger Spring was causing circular currents that have already trapped a barge.

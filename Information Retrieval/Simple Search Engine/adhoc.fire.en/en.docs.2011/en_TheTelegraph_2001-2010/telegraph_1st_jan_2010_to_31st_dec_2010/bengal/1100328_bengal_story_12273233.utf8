	March 27: The identification of the unidentified victims of the Stephen Court fire has suffered a setback as the samples sent for DNA sequencing at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) have been found inadequate.        
	Yesterday, police had sent samples from four charred bodies to the CFSL, the only eastern India lab to conduct DNA sequencing. However, its authorities want better samples, a police officer said.         
	In a letter to the police last night, the lab said though it had wanted intact, long, uncut bones and deep muscle tissues, the samples they had received were partially burnt and cut bones that were charred.        
	We have sought better samples for DNA sequencing. The received samples have been stored and the sequencing will start as soon as we get the better samples, said CFSL director C.N. Bhattacharyya.        
	But the problem lies here: the bodies are so badly charred that the forensic experts at SSKM Hospital may not be able to provide the kind of samples the CFSL requires.         
	The bodies have been badly mutilated and its not possible to get better samples than the ones already sent. Still, we have collected fresh samples from the bodies and will send them to the CFSL, said a senior forensic expert at SSKM.         
	In case the samples do not match the CFSLs requirements, there is a possibility that the bodies might remain unidentified, experts said.         
	Sources said the fresh samples would be sent to the CFSL tomorrow morning. The lab has set up a team to work round the clock for the job.                  
	Today, three more bodies were brought to the SSKM morgue, taking the number of unidentified bodies to 13.         
	The police had also sent incomplete information along with the samples, a source said. The age and sex of the charred bodies, essential for DNA sequencing, were not sent yesterday. Also, the post-mortem reports and details of claimants are yet to be sent.        
	Police sources said post-mortem was conducted on seven more bodies today.         
	Relatives continued to visit the SSKM morgue searching for their dear ones. However, confusion prevailed till late afternoon as nobody knew whom to approach. We are coming here everyday since Tuesday, but I have not been able to identify my sons body, said Anil Ghosh, whose son Ankush worked on the fourth floor.        
	There is no one to give us information about the number of bodies that are in the morgue or the bodies that have been found in Stephen Court.         
	It was a similar plight for Manzoor Majhi, whose daughter Sangita worked in Guru Ispat. He went back to Bokaro on Thursday but came back on Friday after hearing that some more bodies had been found, said a friend of Sangita.         
	The hospital today finally put up a notice stating details of the number of unidentified and unclaimed bodies. Those who want to give blood samples for DNA sequencing should write an application to the officer in charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station and come here with two photographs of the victim at 10.30am on Monday, a police officer was heard shouting.

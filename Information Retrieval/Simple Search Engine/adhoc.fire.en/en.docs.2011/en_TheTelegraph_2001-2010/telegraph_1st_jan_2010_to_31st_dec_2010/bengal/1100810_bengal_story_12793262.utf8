          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 9: If Mamata Banerjee was at the right place at the right time this afternoon, Gurjar Singh was at the wrong place at the wrong time this evening, unless sinister forces were at work.        
	Singhs truck veered into the path of the Trinamul Congress chiefs Scorpio in Kolaghat when she was returning from the Lalgarh rally today.        
	The driver of the intelligence branch jeep that was immediately behind Mamatas SUV sped forward and stopped between her vehicle and the truck. The truck rammed into the jeep.        
	Mamata Banerjees SUV was going straight down NH6 in Kolaghat when a truck from Haldia that was travelling on an adjoining road rushed in through the divider. It came perilously close to Mamatas car but Utpal Das Mahapatra sped forward and took the blow, said Ashok Biswas, the superintendent of police, East Midnapore.        
	The truck did not take the overbridge that leads to the highway. It took a shortcut and suddenly burst into the highway by taking a road below the bridge, Biswas said. Although Biswas said Mamatas SUV was unharmed, the railway minister said the escort jeep hit her vehicle on impact after taking the blow from the truck.        
	The Trinamul chief was supposed to stop at a roadside restaurant but decided against it after the accident.        
	Trinamul sources said their leader was attacked deliberately.        
	A doctor attended to Mamata at her Kalighat residence after she returned. Strange things are happening, Mamata said. Well have to find out the reason why the truck came so close to my car. There could be something sinister.        
	Mahapatra, 40, has suffered a skull injury and has been admitted to a nursing home in Kolaghat. Singh, in his 40s, has been arrested and his vehicle impounded.        
	The police said Singh claimed that he did not take the overbridge as there was no signal or policeman to guide him. He was returning to Punjab with plastic goods from Haldia.         
	RPF row        
	State home secretary Samar Ghosh today alleged that the Railway Protection Force had checked vehicles along Mamatas route to Lalgarh without the state governments go-ahead. Sources in the district police, however, said they had no knowledge of such an incident.

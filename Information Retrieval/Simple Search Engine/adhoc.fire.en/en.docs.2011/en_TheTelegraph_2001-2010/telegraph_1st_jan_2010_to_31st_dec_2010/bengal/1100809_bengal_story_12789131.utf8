The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rao frown for Mamata
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Rao frown for Mamata
  - Cong leader to attend simultaneous Tamluk rally        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Keshav Rao and Mamata Banerjee                                      
	Calcutta, Aug. 8: Mamata Banerjee is unhappy that AICC general secretary Keshav Rao has turned down an invite to attend her Lalgarh rally tomorrow so he can be present at a simultaneous Congress event in Tamluk.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief had last week requested Rao, the Congress central leaderships minder in Bengal, to accompany her to Lalgarh to be a part of her apolitical rally.         
	Didi was expecting Rao at the Lalgarh programme since she had personally requested him to be present. But she was unhappy to learn that the AICC leader would skip the rally to be part of a Congress event in Tamluk, a Trinamul general secretary said in Calcutta after Mamata met her aides this evening for updates on the Lalgarh rally.        
	Rao, however, said from Hyderabad that he had initially planned to attend both the rallies. But I was told by our state Congress leaders that the rallies would be held at almost the same time and it would be impossible to attend both. So I was left with no option but to attend our meeting at Tamluk, Rao told The Telegraph.        
	The AICC leader said he would send a message to Mamata expressing his inability to attend her programme because of unavoidable circumstances.         
	Subhendu Adhikari, the Trinamul MP from Tamluk, refused to buy Raos argument. As a senior AICC leader, Rao should have stayed away from the Tamluk rally, which Manas (state Congress chief Manas Bhuniya) has planned to counter our meeting in Lalgarh. Raos presence at our meeting would have sent a positive message to his party ranks and underlined the need for a Congress-Trinamul alliance ahead of the Assembly polls next year, Adhikari said.        
	Asked if the Tamluk rally was a ploy by Bhuniya to counter the Trinamul event and try to gain a foothold in East Midnapore where the Congress has been cornered by Mamatas men, Rao replied in the negative.        
	The Tamluk rally was planned three months ago while Mamatajis meeting was announced only on July 21. So it will be incorrect to say that our rally is aimed at countering her meeting. I will convey this message to her when we meet next time, he said.         
	Rao said he believed the Tamluk rally would not jeopardise the alliance with Trinamul. We may have tied up with Mamataji to counter the CPM in Bengal but that does not mean that we cannot organise party programmes individually.        
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was in Calcutta today, refused comment on the Tamluk rally.        
	However, the Congress, worried about filling up the rally ground, has reportedly requested CPI supporters in Tamluk to attend the event. Tamluk is represented by a CPI MLA.

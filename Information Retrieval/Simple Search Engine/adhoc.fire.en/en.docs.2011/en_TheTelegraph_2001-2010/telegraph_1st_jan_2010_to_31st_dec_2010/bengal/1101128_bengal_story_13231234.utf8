The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Feet at Left Front rally, dream elsewhere
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Feet at Left Front rally, dream elsewhere
										      SUNDAY RALLY: Culture clan      MITA MUKHERJEE                            Sampurna Ghosh and Chiranjit Samanta at the Left Front rally at Metro Channel on Saturday. Picture by Mita Mukherjee                                 
	Calcutta, Nov. 27: Sampurna Ghosh, 19, is a Left Front supporter but she realises she would have to leave Bengal if she has to pursue higher studies in genetics.         
	There are limited research facilities in the state, said the second-year zoology honours student of Ashutosh College who attended the Left Front rally at Metro Channel this afternoon.         
	She added: There is hardly any research facility in genetics in Bengal. So there is no other option for me but to go to another state or country where there are better facilities.        
	False propaganda, thundered Partha Mukherjee, a leader of the All India Students Federation (AISF), the students wing of the CPI, from the stage. Mukherjee lambasted the Opposition, particularly the Trinamul Congress, for claiming brilliant students were leaving the state for lack of adequate higher education facilities.         
	Mukherjee went on: Who says brilliant students are forced to leave Bengal for higher studies? Those spreading the false propaganda must remember that students do not go abroad for a lack of better facilities. Some students go there as they have an inclination to settle abroad.        
	Todays rally by Left student and youth organisations was part of the fronts weeklong reaching out programme ahead the Assembly polls next year.        
	Sampurna, however, is thankful to the Left Front for the high academic standards at her college. I am lucky that I have got the opportunity to study in a college which is as good as any reputable institution in the country. My college has good teachers and top-class infrastructure, including excellent laboratory and library facilities.         
	But when it comes to fulfilling my dream of getting a doctoral or a post-doctoral degree in genetics, Sampurna, an SFI leader in college, knows she has to look beyond her state.         
	But unlike many students who have settled in other states or countries after completing their studies, I plan to some day teach genetics in a college or a university in Bengal.        
	But what AISF leader Mukherjee seemed to be blissfully oblivious of is that several of the 5,000 rally participants were not too happy with the Left Fronts performance in creating job opportunities either, apart from the lack of facilities for higher studies.        
	Said Chiranjit Samanta, a third-year student of Vidyasagar College: I am pursuing an honours in Bengali. I have done pretty well in my Part-I and Part-II exams. But I know a BA degree is not sufficient to earn me a job in this state.         
	Although Chiranjit, in his early 20s, perceives Mamata Banerjee as someone from the rival political camp, he has applied for a Group-D canteen job with the railways. What can I do? The government has failed to create sufficient job opportunities for the youth of Bengal, he rued.        
	After I graduate, I desperately need to earn at least Rs 7,000 a month to ensure that my family can make ends meet. Only a Madhyamik degree is required for the (canteen) job.        
	One of the speakers at the rally had an answer. If the chemical hub had come up in Nandigram and the Tata Nano plant in Singur, they could have generated several jobs....         
	The voice trailed off under the fading sun.

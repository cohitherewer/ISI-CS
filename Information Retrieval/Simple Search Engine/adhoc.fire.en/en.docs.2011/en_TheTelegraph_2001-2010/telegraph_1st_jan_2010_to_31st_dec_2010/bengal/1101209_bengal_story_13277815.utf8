The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Strong-arm lender alert
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Strong-arm lender alert
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 8: The Bengal government has decided to keep tabs on micro-finance institutions (MFIs) that have mushroomed in rural areas capitalising on the absence of scheduled commercial banks.        
	With rising complaints against the MFIs for the high interest rates they charge and the strong-arm tactics they use to recover loans, the state government  along the lines of the Andhra Pradesh government  is preparing regulations to bring in more transparency in their operations.         
	Given the allegations against micro-finance institutions, we would like to bring in regulations as soon as possible, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta said after a meeting with Reserve Bank governor D. Subbarao at Writers Buildings this afternoon.         
	The government will examine the MFIs interest rates, their lending and recovery methods and the indebtedness of the borrowers, who often end up borrowing from multiple lenders.        
	There are three types of concern pertaining to MFIs. These are rates of interest charged, their lending practices and coercive loan recovery methods, said Subbarao.        
	The RBI chief was apprised by Dasgupta and his officials about the steps Bengal has taken to regulate MFIs. The finance minister said 21 MFIs were operating in the state and the government was keen on strong social regulations for them.        
	But before taking any action, we want to wait for the report of the RBI-appointed committee (Malegam committee) so that the state government can move in tandem with the RBI, Dasgupta said.        
	While discussing the phenomenon of mushrooming of MFIs, the RBI governor noted that credit off-take  the amount of money the scheduled commercial banks lend out  in the state was low.         
	The credit-deposit ratio in the state is much below the all India average. I will discuss with bankers how to increase lending to the priority sectors, such as, agriculture, self-help groups, small and medium enterprises, Subbarao said.        
	The state finance minister has also convened a meeting with bankers on December 10 to discuss issues pertaining to MFIs and financial inclusion.         
	Out of a total 39,000 villages in the state, 7,486 villages do not have a single branch of a bank. We had decided to bring in banking services to 2,581 villages by March 2011. But till September this year, we could reach out to only 324 such villages, Dasgupta said.

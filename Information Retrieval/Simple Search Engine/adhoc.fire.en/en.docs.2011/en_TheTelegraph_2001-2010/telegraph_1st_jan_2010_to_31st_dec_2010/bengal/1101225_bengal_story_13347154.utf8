                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Registration ban on 629
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Dec. 24: None of the 629 first-year students of a college under Maldas Gour Banga University will get registration because the institution admitted more students than the number prescribed.        
	Varsity registrar Apurba Ghosh said the authorities of Chanchol College had admitted 249 students more than the prescribed 380.         
	He said a show-cause notice had been sent to the college, 65km from Malda town.         
	We did not receive any reply from them. At our university council meeting on December 16, we decided not to give registration to a single first-year student of Chanchol College, Ghosh added.        
	College principal Anita Chakrabarty said the authorities had to face pressure from local people to take in more students.

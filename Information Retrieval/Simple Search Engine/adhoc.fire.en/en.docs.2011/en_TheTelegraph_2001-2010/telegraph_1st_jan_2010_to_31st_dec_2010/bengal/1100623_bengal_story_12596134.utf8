	Bolpur, June 22: The Congress and the Left today prevented the Trinamul Congress from forming the board in the 18-member Suri municipality by supporting an Independent for the chairmans office.        
	Ujjwal Mukherjee got 11 votes  one more than what he needed. It came from a Trinamul councillor. Of the other 10, six came from the Congress, three from the Left.         
	Trinamuls Preeti Bhattacharya got seven votes, though the party has eight councillors. Mukherjee had contested as an Independent after Trinamul had denied him a ticket.

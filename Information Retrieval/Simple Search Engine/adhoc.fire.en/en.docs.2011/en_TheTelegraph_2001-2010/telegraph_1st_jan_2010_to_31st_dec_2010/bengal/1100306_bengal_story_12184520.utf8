  - Maoist backers set deadline amp; terms of release         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bankura, March 5: Suspected Maoists entered a school in Bankura this afternoon, blindfolded the headmaster and took him away during class hours.        
	Police, who got information about the abduction almost an hour after Ranjit Duley was taken away, said he is a former local committee member in the Sarenga unit of the CPM in West Midnapore. Duleys elder brother Ramkrishna, who was a branch committee member of the CPM in Sarulia, was shot dead by Maoists last year for not leaving the party.         
	This evening, Sidhu Soren, the secretary of the Gana Militia unit of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, claimed responsibility for the kidnap. He demanded that two innocent men arrested on February 26 in Saluka, adjacent to Sarulia, be freed within 48 hours in exchange for Duleys release.        
	Duley, 55, the headmaster of Shibram Satpathy Madhyamik Siksha Kendra in Sarulia, about 210km from Calcutta, was in his office when two men arrived on a motorcycle just after 1pm. Six other teachers were in the school as were about 100 students.         
	The men waved their guns before entering the school. They commanded the teachers to come out of their classes and snatched their cellphones, the police said. The teachers were told they must not shout.         
	The duo then entered Duleys office, blindfolded him and led him out of the school. They made him sit on the motorcycle and rode off towards Goaltore in West Midnapore through the Jamdohara jungles, the police added.         
	The two men  Ramchandra Duley and Balaram Murmu  whose freedom the tribal committee is demanding were arrested a day after the killing of Sarenga inspector in charge Rabilochan Mitra. They are in police custody.         
	Bankura additional superintendent of police S.K. Jhajharia said: It is suspe- cted that Maoists or their supporters are behind the abduction.

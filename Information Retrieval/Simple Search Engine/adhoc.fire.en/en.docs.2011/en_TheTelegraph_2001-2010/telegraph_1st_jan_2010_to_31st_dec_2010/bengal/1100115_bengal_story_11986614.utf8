The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Extension for hill caretaker
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Extension for hill caretaker
          OUR BUREAU                          Bimal Gurung                                  
	Jan. 14: The state government has decided to extend the tenure of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) administrator in the hills in a subtle message that it would deal firmly with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said in Calcutta: The proposal to extend the term of the DGHC administrator is being actively considered.         
	B.L. Meenas term will end on January 31. He had been given charge of the council since March 2008 when he was the divisional commissioner of Jalpaiguri. After he retired from regular service last year, he was given an extension as the DGHC administrator.        
	The Morcha, which wants a separate state to be carved out of Bengal and which does not want the hill council, was miffed.        
	We do not want the council, we want a separate state as its alternative, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said.         
	But the Centre had made it clear in the third round of tripartite talks with the Morcha and the state government that it was ready to repeal the DGHC Act, 1988, but the state and the hill outfit would have to come out with an alternative first. Union home secretary G.K. Pillai had said the act could not be repealed until the Morcha and the state came up with proposals. Ideally, we would have liked a time frame for them to come up with a proposal but they have not done as yet, he said.        
	The Morcha sought Meenas removal after the state failed to meet its November 17, 2009, deadline on regularising 3,472 contract workers of the DGHC.

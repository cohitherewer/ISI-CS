	Chandernagore, Oct. 16: Be it Paul the octopus or Amals doiwala (curd seller), if the lightwork at any Chandernagore pandal leaves you awestruck this Puja, chances are that the background sketch for it was done by Satinath Datta.        
	The 54-year-old Chandernagore resident was only 24 when one of his friends sought his help in sketching the design for a lightwork he was doing. That was in 1980.        
	Since then, sketching the background on which the light artists work has become a passion for Datta. I have always been interested in drawing. As a kid, I learnt drawing from a teacher here. When my friend approached me to do the sketch, I agreed, Datta said.        
	In the past 30 years, he has done the drawings for some of the best-known light artists of Chandernagore.        
	Almost every Chandernagore contractor who does the lights for the Puja gets the sketches made by Datta. Every year the top awards in Chandernagore, and even some in Calcutta, are bagged by lightworks designed by Datta, said Kashinath Das of Das Electrics.        
	This year, Datta made the lightwork sketches for several pandals in Calcutta, including those at College Square and Sreebhumi.        
	Light artist Sridhar Das recalled how his work on Dattas sketches of Rabindranath Tagore and Amartya Sen had impressed visitors.        
	Datta, who works in the electric maintenance department of a paint factory, starts as soon as one Puja is over. I try to cull ideas from whats happening around the world. I keep a catalogue ready. Sometimes the contractors come up with ideas and I work on them, the artist said.        
	The contractors get the prizes, but Datta is still happy.         
	He works mostly in the evenings, after returning from the factory. I come home around 6pm and work till 11pm. It doesnt earn me a lot of money, maybe about Rs 100 for a very small sketch. But its my passion, he said.         
	The work requires intense concentration and a lot of skill, for often the themes require the characters to move about. Its almost like animation. You have to draw each character in different positions so that they appear to be moving about, Datta said.         
	When I started out, small lamps were used. Today it is LED. Because LED is very bright, I have to leave bigger gaps between the elements of the sketch, or else it looks smudged, he said.         
	It is this attention to detail that has endeared Datta to the light artists.         
	Datta realises that drawing for a lightwork is different from an ordinary sketch. It becomes much easier for me if he has sketched the backdrop, said Babu Paul, a light artist who has worked with Datta for over 10 years.         
	Dattas personal favourite is a theme called Commando. It was based on the training the commandos receive. I did it some six years back, he said.

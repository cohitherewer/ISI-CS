          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 20: Stirrings in Bengal, aftershocks in Singapore.        
	The island nation appears to have pressed the pause button on future investments in Bengal and is keenly watching the political churning in the state before taking a decision on new plans.         
	Bengal is heading for elections in the middle of next year. People (investors) will watch it before long-term decisions is taken, George Yeo, the countrys foreign minister, said here today.        
	He was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting organised by Aspen Institute of India in partnership with business chamber CII.         
	Yeo  who visited Shantiniketan  yesterday said only economic factors would drive investments. If investment is less, the place must be less welcoming, he said.        
	Singapore had shifted its visa-processing office from Calcutta five years back. Asked if there is any chance of re-opening it, Yeo did not hold out hope. It is linked to flow (of business and people), he said.        
	Yeo is not the only one to have voiced such concerns. Many investors have been haunted by the political uncertainty arising from the possibility of the Left losing power for the first time in 34 years in the Assembly elections scheduled for next summer.        
	Political analysts warned that the process of change will be fraught with violence, further deteriorating the industrial climate.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, March 10: The Burdwan regional transport officer was today found dead, having fallen from the fifth floor of the building that houses his office.        
	Partha Sarathi Roy, the 56-year-old RTO, had a quarrel with the additional district magistrate (development), Purna Chandra Shit, at a meeting about an hour before his death, sources said.        
	The RTO fell from the terrace of the New Collectorate building. We are investigating whether he committed suicide, was pushed down by someone or fell off by accident, said Pankaj Mani, deputy police superintendent (headquarters) of Burdwan.        
	According to sources in the transport office, there was a meeting of transport officials at noon in the first-floor office of the additional district magistrate (development) that Roy, too, attended. During the meeting, held to finalise some transport regulations, Shit and Roy started arguing.        
	At one point after a heated exchange, the ADM got worked up and threw the file that was the bone of contention in front of Roy, who walked out of the room, said one of Roys colleagues.        
	Roy came down to his own office but left soon with three files. Around 1.40pm, he got into the elevator. I thought he would go back to the first floor meeting but he went to the fifth floor, said Surojit Koley, the lift operator. He, however, came down from the fifth floor after 15 minutes.         
	His driver Kanu Ghosh said Roy had a lunch of ruti-tarkari from an eatery.         
	I was waiting because he had meetings in the afternoon, Ghosh said. But he went back to the fifth floor terrace for the second time and fell from there.

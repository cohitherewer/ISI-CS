The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | In school, feeling pink and free 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      In school, feeling pink and free 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Teachers in coloured saris at the school. (Ananda Das)                                  
	Singur, May 10: Shipra Roy stepped into her school this morning draped in pink and feeling unfettered.        
	For the seven years she has been teaching at Golap Mohini Balika Vidyalaya, she has worn white saris to class, almost feeling like a student herself.        
	The high court has allowed her to wear anything to work as long as it is decent.         
	Shipra and six of her colleagues had moved court against the schools white-sari code. On Friday, Justice Jayanta Biswas said: The teachers are educated enough and know about the decency of their dress.        
	Roy said she and her colleagues underwent tremendous mental agony during the year and a half of the case. As I walked through the school gate today, I felt a sense of freedom... as if I had broken free of shackles. I want to assure my students that we are teachers and we wont do anything that shows them or the school in poor light, said Roy.        
	About a dozen of the 40-odd teachers in the Singur school, 50km from Calcutta, turned up in coloured saris but the rest toed the management line.        
	Sumana Ghosh was not among those who had moved court, but she wore blue because she supported them.        
	Her senior colleague Swati Purakayastha said: It felt horrible to come to school in white saris.        
	Headmistress Anuradha Singha Roy refused comment.

	Calcutta, Nov. 27: The husband of the woman found murdered in her Oxytown home in September was arrested from Bihars Munger today.        
	Although police were officially tight-lipped about Avik Ghoshs involvement in the murder of wife Mausumi Ghosh and maid Parulbala, sources in the department said he had hired three youths for Rs 2 lakh to kill his wife.        
	Avik, who works as an engineer in Munger, was picked up from the Bihar district after the three arrested youths  Somnath Tanti, Sadaf Parvez and Safique Ahmed Khan  told the police he had hired them to kill Mausumi, the sources said. The trio have allegedly told the police that Parulbala was murdered to eliminate evidence.

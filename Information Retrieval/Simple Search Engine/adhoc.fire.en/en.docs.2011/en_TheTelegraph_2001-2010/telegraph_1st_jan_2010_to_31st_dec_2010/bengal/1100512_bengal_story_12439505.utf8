The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM cries alliance to split rival votes 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM cries alliance to split rival votes 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 11: The Trinamul Congress and the Congress may be blaming each other for their break-up, but the CPMs civic poll campaign will harp on an unofficial Opposition alliance before the polls and possible patch-up later.        
	Insiders see in this a bid to unite the ranks and prevent Trinamul from harvesting all anti-Left votes. They said that had the party expressed happiness at the split, it could polarise anti-Left votes towards Trinamul. Mamata Banerjee wants all anti-Left votes in her kitty and that is why she has gone back to calling the Congress the CPMs B-team, they added.         
	At the CPM state committees pre-poll stock-taking today, Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose cautioned supporters against any euphoria over the rift in the Opposition.         
	Participants said he stressed the ongoing process of ground-level patch-up between Trinamul and the Congress and the likelihood of the UPA partners coming together to form municipal boards.        
	Who said the Opposition is divided? veteran leader Benoy Konar said after the meeting. We have reports that they have either joined hands on the ground or are moving towards that goal in many districts. We have asked our workers to plunge into the campaign considering that the Opposition will be united.        
	The CPM is worried about the ground it lost in the Lok Sabha polls, to the tune of 7 per cent votes. Since Trinamul had bagged most of it by eating into the CPMs base among the poor and Muslims, Bose spoke of a campaign to expose Trinamuls crocodile tears for the underprivileged while gunning for the Congress-led Centres pro-rich policies. He accused both parties of using money power to try and defeat the Left.        
	In its efforts to divide Opposition votes, the CPM has also decided to target the BJP and its alleged informal tie-up with the Congress-Trinamul alliance. But Bose knows a split in Opposition votes will not help it much unless the party is able to recover some of its lost ground. The situation has improved for us since the Lok Sabha polls. But we have to get more support from the people, Konar said.         
	Konar refused to divulge the partys assessment on retaining the 53 boards it runs among the 81 going to the polls. We dont know what people have in their mind, he said.        
	At todays meeting, the partys Calcutta leaders admitted a tough fight despite the good work done by the front-run city civic body, but leaders from Burdwan, Bankura, Hoogly and West Midnapore expressed confidence in retaining most of the boards.         
	Bose reminded them about their claims before last years Lok Sabha polls and suggested that their confidence could be misplaced. We have to accept that many poor and middle-class people have deserted us and we have to go door-to-door and meet them to keep tabs on the ground reality instead of making self-deluding claims, participants quoted Bose as saying.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee attended the first half of the meeting but remained silent.

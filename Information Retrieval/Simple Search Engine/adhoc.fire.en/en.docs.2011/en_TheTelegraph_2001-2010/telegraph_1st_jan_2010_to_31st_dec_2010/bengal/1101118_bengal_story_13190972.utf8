The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul leader killed in backlash
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul leader killed in backlash
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Barasat, Nov. 17: A Trinamul Congress leader in North 24-Parganas was hacked to death by a mob on the suspicion that his aides had murdered a history-sheeter today.         
	Around 2pm, a group of people attacked the house of Ayub Ali Mondal, who police claimed had criminal records, in Bongaon Jamipur village. The group called out Ayub, 45, and hurled bombs at him, killing him on the spot.        
	Trinamul had on previous occasions accused Ayub of being a CPM harmad (armed goon). Police said tension spread in the village, 80km from Calcutta, as the news of his death spread.         
	A police officer said some residents of Jamipur in Gopalnagar block who had seen Ayubs attackers identified them as being close to local Trinamul leader Mukul Gazi, 37.        
	A mob, including CPM supporters, dragged Mukul, the Trinamul secretary of Gopalnagar, out of his house and hacked him to death with sharp weapons. The mob also beat up Mukuls son and brother when they tried to save him.         
	Rahul Srivastava, the district superintendent of police, said Ayub, a clerk at a local madarsa, had several criminal cases pending against him. We have started an investigation, Srivastava said.         
	Jyotipriya Mullick, the Trinamul MLA from Bongaons Gaighata, accused the CPM of murdering Mukul. He said Mukul had built a strong base for the party in Jamipur.        
	The CPM falsely accused Mukul of being involved in Ayubs death and murdered him. By removing Mukul, the CPM stands to gain in the area, Mullick said.        
	District CPM secretary Amitava Bose, however, said Ayub had no connection with the party.         
	Mullick said Mukuls son Sammak was left with a broken hand and leg after the attack. Sammak has been admitted to Bongaon sub-divisional hospital.        
	Trinamul leaders accused the CPM of targeting Mukul and Biswajit Das, the Trinamul president of Gopalnagar, as the two were building the partys organisation in the area and preventing the CPM from regaining ground.        
	We had submitted a written request to the police superintendent seeking security for the two leaders. But only Biswajit was allotted a guard, Mullick said.        
	Tomorrow, Trinamul will organise processions to protest Mukuls murder and observe a black day in Bongaon.

	Calcutta, Jan. 13: Bengals advantage will fade away if genetically modified  better known as BT (bacillus thuringiensis)  brinjals are allowed, green activists and agricultural scientists said today while pleading with Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh to scrap the plan.         
	There are several reasons to oppose commercial cultivation of the BT brinjal. Not only will it harm the environment, it will also rob the farmers of their livelihood as they will have to depend on seeds imported by multinational companies, agricultural scientist Anupam Pal said during an interaction at the Bose Institute.         
	Before taking a final call on commercial cultivation of BT brinjals, the environment ministry plans to hold consultative meetings across seven cities, the first of which was held in Calcutta today.         
	Data suggest that the impact on farmers in Bengal will be the highest as the state contributes around 30 per cent to the countrys annual brinjal production of over 9 million tonnes. In the past three years, brinjal production in Bengal has grown by over 20 per cent and over 90 per cent of vegetable farmers in the state depend on the brinjal for livelihood.         
	After potatoes, brinjal is the most grown and most consumed vegetable in the state, said Ardhendu Sekhar Chatterjee of the Development Research Communication Services Centre, an NGO.         
	The minister clarified that the Centre did not want to rush through the process. That is why we have come here, Ramesh told a gathering of over 400 people  scientists, farm experts, farmers bodies, consumer groups and NGOs.         
	More than 200 people, who were not allowed inside the venue, continued with their protests outside.         
	The supporters of BT brinjal argue that the genetically modified variety will make the produce resistant to a pest known as Fruit and Shoot Borer by introducing the pesticide within the plant itself.        
	But there are 15 other types of pests, said a state agriculture department official.         
	The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, a wing of the environment ministry, had cleared commercial cultivation of BT brinjals. The decision kicked up a storm as green activists argued that it would threaten bio-diversity, destabilise ecosystems and make farmers dependent on multinationals.         
	Tempers ran high during the three-hour meeting as groups opposed to BT brinjals accused the Centre of playing to the hands of multinationals.         
	As noisy protests by the green lobby and NGOs came in the way of discussions, the minister threatened to leave the hall several times.         
	I expect to be through with my public consultation in seven cities by February 15, after which I will submit my recommendations to the Prime Minister, the minister said.

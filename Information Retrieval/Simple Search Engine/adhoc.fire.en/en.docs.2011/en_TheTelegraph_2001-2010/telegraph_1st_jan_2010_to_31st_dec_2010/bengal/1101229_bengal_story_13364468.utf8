                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha counters PC charges in letter
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 28: The chief minister said he had sent a reply to P. Chidambarams letter this afternoon. Although Buddhadeb Bhattacharya did not divulge the contents of his letter, Writers sources said he had countered every major point raised by the Union home minister.         
	A copy of the letter was faxed at 1.05pm to Chidambarams North Block office. The hard copy was sent by registered post soon after.         
	I have sent the letter. You will get it (copies) in due course, Bhattacharjee told reporters.         
	The chief minister has instructed us not to leak the contents of the letter. He has said copies will be handed out (to the media) only after its receipt is confirmed (by the Union home ministry), a senior official of Bhattacharjees secretariat said.         
	The chief minister has said he does want his office to do what the Union home ministry has done. He said it would be discourteous.        
	Excerpts from Chidambarams letter, dated December 21, had been leaked in the media but the chief ministers office received it only yesterday.        
	Some other officials, however, said Bhattacharjee had countered all major points raised by Chidambaram in his letter.        
	According to sources, Bhattacharjee has denied the existence of armed cadre camps in Jungle Mahal. He said the camps had been set up at CPM party offices in the area to give shelter to those who had fled their homes in the face of Maoist attacks.         
	There are no arms in these camps except those that the police guarding them are carrying, the chief minister has said in the letter, a source said.        
	The sources said the chief minister had hinted at a nexus between the Trinamul Congress and the Maoists, warning Chidambaram about their close ties.        
	The Union home minister was told that the Congresss key ally (Trinamul) had joined forces with the Maoists in Jungle Mahal, a source said.        
	The letter, according to the sources, also mentions the good work done by the joint forces in Jungle Mahal and the commendable progress in the recovery of illegal arms in the Maoist belt.         
	The letter has made it clear that the joint forces, not the CPM, call the shots in Jungle Mahal, another source said.        
	Officials in the chief ministers secretariat said the Union home minister was expected to attend office tomorrow. The receipt is likely to be confirmed by noon tomorrow, an official said.        
	Several secretariat officials said they would get into serious trouble if the letter was leaked from their end.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hearse to city from Lalgarh
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hearse to city from Lalgarh

	Dec. 19: The body of a Trinamul Congress supporter killed allegedly by CPM activists in Lalgarh has been brought to Calcutta so that leaders can pay their last respects.        
	The move comes three days after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state CPM chief Biman Bose placed wreathes on the body of Swapan Koley, an SFI activist. Koley died after being beaten up by alleged Trinamul supporters during a clash at Howrahs Prabhu Jagadbandhu College earlier this week.         
	The body of Sanatan Hembram, 27, who was hacked to death this morning allegedly by CPM activists in West Midnapores Lalgarh, 200km from Calcutta, has been kept in Peace Haven.        
	Tomorrow, it will be taken to Trinamul Bhavan at Topsia, where party leaders will pay their last respects. A procession will be taken out with the body.         
	A CPM state committee member accused Trinamul of playing ugly politics over a dead person. One should not do politics over a dead person. It is in bad taste, he said.        
	The state Congress, too, was critical of the politics over a dead person. State Congress general secretary Maya Ghosh said: The Congress does not believe in such things. It does not send a positive message to the people.         
	Trinamul leaders, however, denied the charge. Subhendu Adhikari, who led a Trinamul team that brought Sanatans body in a hearse to Calcutta, said: We have some questions for those who raised their hands in red salute and walked for miles with the body of Swapan Koley. We want to know why Sanatan was killed? What was his fault?

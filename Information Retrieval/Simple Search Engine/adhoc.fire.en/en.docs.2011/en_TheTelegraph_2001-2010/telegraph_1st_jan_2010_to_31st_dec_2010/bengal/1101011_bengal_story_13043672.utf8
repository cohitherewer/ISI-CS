The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM reclaim plan at work since Aug 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM reclaim plan at work since Aug 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lalgarh, Oct. 10: CPM leaders had planned the reclamation of Lalgarh since August when the party started regaining control of neighbouring pockets freed of Maoists by the joint forces.        
	The rebels had been flushed out of Lalgarh town six months back but the CPM waited till it had brought back surrounding areas under its grip, said Anuj Pandey, the partys zonal committee secretary and the face of the fightback.        
	The strategy was to move into Lalgarh town from the south and Dharampur, Pandeys village which the cadres won back on September 2, became the staging post.         
	Dharampur and its neighbouring areas were a stronger base and recapturing them was more important, said Pandey, whose Dharampur house was vandalised by a huge mob egged on by Maoists on June 15, 2009.         
	The areas north of Lalgarh, such as Ramgarh and Kantapahari, are still under the sway of the rebels. In the east, pockets such as Pirakata and Bhimpur continue to be strongholds of CPM rivals, the Jharkhand Party (Aditya) and, to a limited extent, the Trinamul Congress. To the west is the Kangshabati river.        
	We decided it would be easier to take control of Dharampur first and move in from the south, a CPM leader said.        
	After the party reclaimed Dharampur, a public meeting was held there on September 21. District party secretary Dipak Sarkar and the minister for paschimanchal affairs, Susanta Ghosh, attended the event.        
	A CPM leader said the Lalgarh countdown began the day the Dharampur rally was held. But two public meetings in Midnapore town by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee within four days delayed the move a bit.         
	We had planned to march to Lalgarh earlier this month but it was deferred because of the chief ministers public meeting in Midnapore town on October 2. Another date for the march was fixed for October 7 but it was also put off because of Mamata Banerjees rally at the same spot on October 6, a CPM leader said.         
	Bhattacharjees rally meant the district leaders were busy with preparations, while Mamatas event had sparked fears that there could be trouble besides keeping the police preoccupied with her security.        
	Todays date for the Lalgarh march was set only two days back. It was a daunting task organising such a huge procession at 48 hours notice. We had to inform comrades who had fled Lalgarh 10 to 12 months ago, said Pandey.        
	Joydeb Giri, the Lalgarh local committee secretary, said almost the entire march was organised with the help of cellphones. It was not possible for local leaders to inform workers and supporters personally. There was also no time for meetings.        
	Many supporters of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities joined the procession today. One of them was Dulal Pandit, 35, who was seen sweeping the floor and cleaning the party office. I was compelled to join the Peoples Committee. Otherwise, I would have become a target.

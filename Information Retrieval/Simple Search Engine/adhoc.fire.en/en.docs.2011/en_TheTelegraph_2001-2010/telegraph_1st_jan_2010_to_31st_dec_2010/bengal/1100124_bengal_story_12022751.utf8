                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      US surprise 
                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 23: US consul- general Beth A. Payne was seen at the RSSs Shahid Minar rally today.        
	The rally was Mohanrao Bhagwats first in Calcutta after he became the Sangh chief.         
	Payne was seen taking photographs for about 10 minutes but left before Bhagwat started speaking.         
	Ranendralal Bandopadhyay, the Sanghs chief in the eastern zone, said: We did not invite the US consul-general. It was a surprise for us.         
	A US public affairs department official said Payne was an outgoing person who loved to meet people. She (Payne) has also visited many Muslim institutions and met Muslim clerics. There is no need to read too much into her presence at the rally, he added.

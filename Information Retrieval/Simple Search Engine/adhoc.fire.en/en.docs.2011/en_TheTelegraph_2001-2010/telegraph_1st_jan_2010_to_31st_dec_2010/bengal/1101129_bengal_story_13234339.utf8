The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha tells CPM hotheads to exit   CM blasts arrogant attitude
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha tells CPM hotheads to exit     CM blasts arrogant attitude

	Barrackpore, Nov. 28: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today asked hotheads in his party to get out, saying their arrogance had led to the CPMs alienation from the people.         
	Many of our party functionaries and workers have done things which the people have not accepted. They (the functionaries) have been arrogant and bossy, the chief minister told a rally in North 24-Parganas, where the party has been hit by bitter factionalism and defeats in the last Lok Sabha elections.        
	If there is a mistake, Bhattacharjee said at the rally in Barrackpore, one has to learn a lesson from it with heads bowed. Those with hotheads get out.         
	Even though the chief ministers immediate targets appeared to be former party MP and Barrackpore strongman Tarit Topdar and his followers, Bhattacharjee could also have had a few other district leaders in mind. Party sources said several CPM leaders blamed Topdar for the Citus alienation from the workers in the Barrackpore industrial belt.         
	Kalyan Mukherjee, the former secretary of the local committee of the CPM in North 24-Parganas Khardah, was suspended earlier this year for misusing his party position.         
	The long-standing factional feud between Amitava Nandy, a former Dum Dum MP, and Amitava Bose, the CPM district secretary, has also affected the partys image. When the BJPs Tapan Sikdar won the Dum Dum seat in successive Lok Sabha polls in 1998 and 1999, the late Subhas Chakraborty had said factionalism was one of the causes for the defeat.         
	Party insiders said this was probably the first time the chief minister had been so vocal against those who have tarnished the partys image with their rude and indecent behaviour with the people.        
	A party leader said Bhattacharjees outburst was in keeping with the CPMs ongoing rectification drive to weed out undesirable elements. The leader said a section of the party believed that such misdemeanours had cost the CPM dear in the recent elections.         
	A CPM district secretariat member said one of the reasons for the partys disconnect with the people was the haughty attitude of some leaders and workers. Our immediate job before next years Assembly elections is to re-establish contact with the masses through door-to-door campaigns, he said.        
	The leader said the CPM planned to drive out those activists who have created a barrier between our party and the people. The chief minister, he said, today sent this message to those indulging in factional politics in North 24-Parganas.         
	At the Barrackpore rally, Bhattacharjee also touched upon the CPMs pet issues. He accused the Trinamul Congress of being hand in glove with Maoists.         
	He alleged Trinamul had on Friday held a rally with Maoists in Jhargram, probably referring to the one Tamluk MP Subhendu Adhikari addressed in Sebayatan village, about 5km from Jhargram town.        
	The chief minister also criticised Trinamuls idea of change. He said: At a time nearly 10 lakh people are expected to get jobs in Rajarhat, they (Trinamul) are saying they will not allow the township project to continue. What is the meaning of such change?         
	He attacked the Congress for creating two classes in the country  the rich and the poor.         
	He added: Trinamul is with them. Trinamul leaders have not raised their voices against price rise. There is corruption in Delhi but Trinamul is silent.

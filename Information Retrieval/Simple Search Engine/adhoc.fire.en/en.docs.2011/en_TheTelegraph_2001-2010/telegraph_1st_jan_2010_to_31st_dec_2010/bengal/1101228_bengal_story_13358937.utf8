          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Dec. 27: Five suspected Maoists who were challenged by a joint forces team when they were about to set a bus on fire took five passengers hostage at gunpoint and retreated into a forest in West Midnapore. They released the passengers minutes after giving police the slip.         
	The rebels had stopped the bus on a jungle stretch near Shilda, where Maoists had killed 24 India Reserve Battalion jawans in February, around 3.30pm and ordered the passengers and the driver to get off. The bus was carrying 102 passengers.        
	The Maoists doused the bus, which was travelling from Jhargram to Bankura, with petrol and were about to set it on fire when the joint forces team, out on a routine patrol, challenged them.         
	As soon as the eight policemen got off their vehicle and pointed guns at the rebels, the five Maoists took five passengers hostage. Each rebel held a gun to the head of a hostage and retreated into the forest.         
	They threatened to kill the hostages if the forces followed them, said Parmilla Hansda, one of the passengers who was not taken hostage.        
	Hansda said that five minutes after the Maoists escaped into the jungle, the five hostages came back running. All the passengers then got on the bus, which turned back and went to Binpur, where the driver lodged a police complaint.        
	After the FIR was lodged, the bus resumed its onward journey to Bankura with police escort.         
	Subodh Bera, another passenger, said: When the Maoists attacked our bus, we feared the worst would happen. Four of the rebels had pistols while another had a rifle.         
	Jhargram police chief Praveen Tripathi confirmed the incident and said the five men were Maoists. He said the rebels were trying to create panic a day before the 48-hour bandh called by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia to protest the arrest of the outfits secretary, Ajit Mahato. Mahato was arrested three days ago in West Midnapores Salboni.        
	Arson attack        
	Suspected Maoists and Peoples Committee activists burnt the house of a CPM leader and an election office of the party in a village in Jhargrams Nayagram last night.        
	Villagers said around 150 armed Maoists and committee activists descended on the house of CPM local committee member Ranjit Adhikari in Noyashai, 210km from Calcutta, around nine last night.         
	The house, however, was empty as Adhikari had fled to Midnapore town with his wife and two children three months ago following rebel threats. The Maoists broke open the doors and windows and entered the two-storeyed mud-walled house. Some of them ransacked the interiors. The Maoists then set the house on fire after dousing it with kerosene.        
	Before leaving, the rebel team also set ablaze the CPM election office, adjacent to Adhikaris house. Both structures were reduced to ashes.        
	Adhikari said the Maoists were trying to create panic in the area by targeting his house. Bidhan Bhattacharya, the inspector in charge of Nayagram police station, said the Maoists were behind the attack and a search was on to arrest the culprits. Bhattacharya visited Noyashai this morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Three more bodies on fourth floor 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Three more bodies on fourth floor 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A resident outside Stephen Court with belongings she brought out when police allowed her inside                                   
	Calcutta, March 27: Three more charred bodies were retrieved from the fourth floor of Stephen Court today, taking the toll in the Park Street fire to 33.        
	There could be a few more bodies lying under the debris, a senior police officer said. Four people are still missing.        
	The bodies, the identities of which could not be ascer- tained immediately because they had been burnt beyond recognition, were brought down in two phases at 2.45pm and 4pm.        
	Civic workers who were scouring the debris for bodies had a difficult time because of the stench of rotting flesh.        
	We have also come across the dead remains of several pets, said Debashis Kar, director-general II, building division of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Some of our workers have fallen ill because of the stench, he added.        
	The official said the fear of a cave-in was delaying the search operation.         
	The walls and the ceilings have become brittle because of the fire. We cannot use machines because the vibration could bring down the walls. We have not been able to deploy more than 30 civic workers at a time for the same reason, he said.                  Another resident carries his bags out of Stephen Court.

	Residents had a tough time retrieving their belongings from Stephen Court today because of a Calcutta High Court order making it mandatory for them to furnish photo-identity proof in order to enter their apartments.         
	Many residents who were denied entrance claimed that their identity proofs had been damaged in the fire.        
	They were allowing people to enter and leave the building freely yesterday, said Anjana Agarwal, a fifth-floor resident.         
	We had collected only a few of our belongings, thinking that we would take the rest later. But today we were suddenly asked for an identity proof. Since I was not carrying any, I was denied entrance, she added.        
	Some residents of the fifth and sixth floors, which have been completed gutted, had to sign risk bonds before being allowed to go up to their apartments. Some residents even scuffled with the police in a bid to force their way up.        
	A large portion of my house has been completely gutted. I am ready to sign the risk bond and collect my belongings as the workers dig them out from under the debris, said Mahendra Golcha, a resident of the fifth floor.         
	After all, it was my house and I cannot allow people to dump my belongings into the trash can and take them away, Golcha added as he tried to force his way into the building.        
	The police said they had strict instructions not to allow anyone to stay inside the building for more than 30 minutes.         
	CESC officials also inspected the building today to find out if restoration of power was possible in some portions.

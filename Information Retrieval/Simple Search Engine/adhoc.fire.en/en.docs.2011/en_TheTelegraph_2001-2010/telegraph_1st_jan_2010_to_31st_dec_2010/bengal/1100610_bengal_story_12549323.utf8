	Dhanbad, June 9: As many as 20 people, most of them from the same family and friends, were killed when their minibus crashed into a roadside tree early this morning on the way back from a wedding.        
	The family from a village in Salanpur, near Asansol, met with the accident about 25km from the Dhanbad district headquarters.        
	 A Jharkhand police officer said the driver may have dozed off. The bus crashed into a peepal tree off GT Road.        
	They had reached the wedding venue, about 10km from the crash site, at 9pm and started the return journey as early as 5.30am. The driver perhaps did not get enough sleep, a source said.         
	Sixteen people were killed on the spot, many of them probably in their sleep after night-long revelry. Four others died at the Patliputra Medical College and Hospital in Dhanbad.        
	More than 12 people were injured. The condition of five of them was said to be serious.        
	The dead included the father and brother of the groom, who was in another vehicle with the bride.        
	The father, Jagdish Ray, was a retired Eastern Coalfields Limited employee.        
	Mirth melted into tears at Samdih village in Salanpur, about 260km from Calcutta.         
	Many of the villagers rushed out of sleep and took a bus to Dhanbad, about 60km away.         
	Sixty-year-old Triloki Devi did not know whether to thank God for sparing her newlywed son or be angry at him for snatching her husband, elder son, grandson and several relatives.        
	Clutching a neighbour, Triloki said: I dont know how to react.        
	There were some who had returned home from the wedding last night itself and thanking their stars. We woke up to hear about the tragedy, said Kartik Rajak, 38, one of the sobbing neighbours of Roy.        
	Goutam Pal, 42, a relative of the Roys who has come to Samdih for the wedding, said: We enjoyed a lot yesterday. Everything has changed now.        
	The police said the stretch of GT Road where the crash took place was deserted around 6.15am. Local villagers pulled out most of the injured from the mangled heap of metal.

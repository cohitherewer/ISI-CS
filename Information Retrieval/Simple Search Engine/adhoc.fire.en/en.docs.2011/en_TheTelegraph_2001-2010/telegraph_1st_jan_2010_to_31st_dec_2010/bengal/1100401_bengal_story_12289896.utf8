	Calcutta, March 31: Tata Motors had not formally informed the state government before abandoning its small-car project in Singur and shifting it to another state, industries minister Nirupam Sen told the Assembly today.         
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee said the government was furnishing deliberately confusing information on the status of the land acquired for the Tata Nano project.                           
	How can the minister say this? The state chief secretary had informed the railway board that the Tatas had shifted their project to Gujarat and the land was with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, Chatterjee said.

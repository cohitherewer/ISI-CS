                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Ally divide over joint forces
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Nov. 10: The Trinamul Congress and the Congress today accused the CPM of misusing the joint forces but differed on the issue of their withdrawal at rallies separated by a few hours in Garbeta and Lalgarh respectively.         
	While Trinamul iterated its demand for the withdrawal of the forces, the Congress said it was up to the Centre and the state government whether the troops should depart. Both rallies had been organised to condemn the CPMs recapture of Nandigram on this day three years ago.         
	At the Trinamul rally in Garbeta, party leaders Mukul Roy and Partha Chatterjee accused the CPM of expanding its base in Jungle Mahal with the help of the joint forces.         
	Our party workers have launched a month-long movement in several parts of Jungle Mahal to highlight how the joint forces are helping the CPM to strengthen its armed camps, Chatterjee said.        
	Earlier in the day, state Congress chief Manas Bhuniya told the party rally in Lalgarh: The Centre had deployed the forces in Jungle Mahal in consultation with the state government. So it is up to them to decide whether the forces would be withdrawn or not. But our demand is that the forces must not be misused.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 15: Police today served notices on the owners of 29 markets in and around central Calcutta that are at risk of fire.        
	The market owners, who were called to Lalbazar, have been asked to take short-term and long-term measures and given 15 days and six months respectively to implement them.         
	The short-term measures include the installation of miniature circuit breakers and sand buckets in front of metre boxes. The long-term measures include a revamp of the wiring.        
	Minor changes have been suggested in markets where the wiring was found to be satisfactory. If those in charge of maintaining the markets fail to implement the measures, they can be jailed for up to five years.

	Calcutta, Nov. 20: The engineering students union at Jadavpur University today boycotted semester exams of first and third-year students for the second consecutive day.         
	Not a single candidate turned up for todays exams, said Satyaki Bhattacharya, the varsitys controller of examinations. Around 1,028 students were supposed to appear for the exams today.         
	The guardians of several students alleged their wards wanted to sit for the tests but the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu) did not allow them to enter the exam halls. The guardians lodged a complaint with the varsity authorities against Fetsu.         
	Fetsu members gathered in front of the engineering department buildings today and tried to convince several students to participate in the boycott movement.        
	University officials reaffirmed they would not bow to Fetsus demand that the authorities withdraw the FIR against 35 students accused of trying to prevent the chief minister from leaving the campus on November 9.         
	The examinations will be held according to schedule. Students will be marked absent for not sitting for the tests, said Siddhartha Dutta, the pro-vice-chancellor.        
	A Fetsu delegation met governor M.K. Narayanan, the chancellor of the varsity, this afternoon and appealed to him to look into their demand. He requested us to write the exams. But as of now, we will continue with the boycott, said Manmatha Ray, the chairperson of Fetsu.

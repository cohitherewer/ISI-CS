The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddhas teacher pat packs a punch
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddhas teacher pat packs a punch
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 27: The chief minister today said the panchayat department was performing far better than the school education department in primary education, causing some heartburn in the alleged laggard.        
	We were doubtful whether the panchayat department would be successful in imparting quality education when we first launched the SSKs and MSKs in 1997. But today, I feel proud to say you have proved yourselves better educators than those who are teaching in the schools run under our school education department, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said.        
	The observation was made while the chief minister was addressing a meeting of the Nikhil Bangiya Madhyamik Siksha Samprasarak and Sishu Siksha Sahayika Samiti, a CPM-controlled organisation of casual teachers working in the 16,109 Sishu Siksha Kendras (SSKs) and the 1,900 Madhyamik Siksha Kendras (MSKs) in the state. The panchayat-run SSKs hold classes from I to IV, and the MSKs from V to VIII.        
	Bhattacharjee may have paid the compliment to court the nearly 75,000 casual teachers before the Assembly polls but the comparison evoked a sharp response from a school education department official.        
	The teachers at the SSKs and the MSKs are appointed by the panchayat bodies from the localities. But the teachers of school education department-run institutions are appointed by the district primary councils and the School Service Commission. The appointment procedure for the latter is more competitive. It is not possible for the panchayat bodies to maintain such high standards, the official said.        
	But school education minister Partha Dey said: If the chief minister has said so, I would rather not make any comment.        
	Bhattacharjee said the teachers employed by the panchayat department were doing a noble job.

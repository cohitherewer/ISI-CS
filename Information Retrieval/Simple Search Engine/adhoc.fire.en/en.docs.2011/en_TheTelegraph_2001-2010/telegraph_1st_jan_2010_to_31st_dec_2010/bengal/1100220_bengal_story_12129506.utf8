	Tamluk, Feb. 19: Work at Tata Chemicals fertiliser unit in Haldia was again stalled as 84 day labourers stopped work after a dispute with another Citu group that had struck work yesterday was sorted out last night.        
	The day labourers wanted job security. Yesterday, about 200 permanent workers had struck work demanding implementation of a recent agreement on salary hikes.

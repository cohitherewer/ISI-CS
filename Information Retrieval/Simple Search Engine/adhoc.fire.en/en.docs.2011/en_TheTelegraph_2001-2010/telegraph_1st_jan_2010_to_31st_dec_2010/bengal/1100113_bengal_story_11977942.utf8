The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bank, Bangla for mangroves
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bank, Bangla for mangroves
          JAYANTA BASU                               
	Dobanki (Sunderbans), Jan. 12: The World Bank will provide Rs 200 crore over the next five years for the preservation of coastal Bengal, including the Sunderbans, Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh said today.        
	I had a discussion with the World Bank president in Copenhagen last month and he confirmed that Rs 200 crore has been earmarked for the preservation of Bengals coastline, including the Sunderbans. The project will be launched in June, said Ramesh, who visited the Sunderbans during the day.        
	He also said the Centre would soon launch a joint effort with Bangladesh to protect the Sunderbans. It is extremely difficult to carry out work to save the Indian part of the Sunderbans in isolation. After all, 60 per cent of the Sunderbans is in Bangladesh. So, we need to work together and protect it, Ramesh told The Telegraph.        
	Bangladesh and India share the 26,000sqkm mangrove kingdom, which is vulnerable to climate change.        
	The Centre has taken the initiative to set up an Ind- ia-Bangladesh joint Sunder- bans ecosystem forum, the minister said. It is expected to take up joint projects, including census of tigers.         
	Bangladesh had apparently shown interest in such an exercise for a long time but India had not responded the way it was doing now.         
	Ramesh also announced a task force at the national level to assess the climate vulnerability of the Indian Sunderbans. Before the Copenhagen meet, I got a letter from Bengals environment minister Sailen Sarkar highlighting his concern about Sunderbans vulnerability to climate change. I share his concern and hence have decided to form this task force with scientists and experts, he added.         
	A state official welcomed the Centres initiative. Both (the joint exercise with Bangladesh and the task force) are extremely welcome gestures and we will contribute in any manner required, said a senior environment department official in Calcutta.

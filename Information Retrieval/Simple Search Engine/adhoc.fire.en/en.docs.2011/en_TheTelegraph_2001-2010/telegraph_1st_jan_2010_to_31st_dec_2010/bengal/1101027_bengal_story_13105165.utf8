The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mukul claims PC probe assurance 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mukul claims PC probe assurance 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Roy and Chidambaram                                 
	Calcutta, Oct. 26: Senior Trinamul leader Mukul Roy today said home minister P. Chidambaram has promised a CRPF probe into the CPMs alleged misuse of central forces in Maoist-hit Jungle Mahal.        
	Chidambaramji told us that he would ask CRPF DG, K. Vijay Kumar, to probe our complaints about the misuse of the forces by the CPM, when we met him this afternoon at Mamatadis behest, Roy, the junior Union minister of shipping, told The Telegraph from Delhi.        
	Roy was accompanied by party colleague and junior health minister Dinesh Trivedi. They held talks with Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, now in Delhi, before calling on the home minister.        
	Asked about Chidambarams reaction to the partys demand for the withdrawal of the forces, Roy skirted the issue and instead focused on the alleged misuse. Chidambaramji gave us a patient hearing when we told him how the forces are being misused by the CPM to expand its base.        
	In Calcutta, the CPM accused Roy of lying. Roy lied about what Chidambaramji actually told him at the meeting, said state secretariat member Benoy Konar.         
	Yesterday, the CPM had slammed Roy for visiting the homes of two slain members of the rebel-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities in Jhargram, saying the trip was proof Trinamul was colluding with the Maoists.        
	Trinamuls probe claim today and its demand for the troops exit came exactly a week after CRPF director-general Kumar visited Lalgarh and suggested that the forces would remain and intensify operations, if required.         
	Konar appeared unfazed by the meeting with Chidambaram. The state government is updating him regularly on the activities of the forces.         
	The CPM today held a public meeting in Pirakata, near Lalgarh, after which its West Midnapore chief Dipak Sarkar said the people were not scared of Maoists and he was not bothered even if the forces left. Sarkar addressed the meet along with Sushanta Ghosh, the minister for Paschimanchal affairs.

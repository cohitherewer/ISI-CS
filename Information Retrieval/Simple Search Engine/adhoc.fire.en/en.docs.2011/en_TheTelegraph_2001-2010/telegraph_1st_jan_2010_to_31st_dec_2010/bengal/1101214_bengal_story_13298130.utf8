          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Tamluk, Dec. 13: An East Midnapore headmaster has been accused of molesting a lady teacher and making indecent proposals.         
	Nearly 300 guardians demonstrated at the Gopinathpur High School in Chandipur this morning demanding arrest of Lakshmikanta Dolui. The 55-year-old has stopped coming to work since December 9 when he came to know the teacher had filed an FIR.        
	The complaint has been lodged against someone as senior as a headmaster. We want to verify it before taking any step, said district police chief Ashok Biswas.        
	Biswanath Khatua, the father of a girl studying in Class XI at the school, demanded immediate action. This is a very serious complaint against the headmaster. Police should take immediate action against the headmaster, Khatua, who was among the demonstrators, said.        
	The teacher has alleged that Dolui had been harassing her for the past three years. Recalling an incident on December 3, she said: The headmaster called me to his chamber. Then he made indecent proposals to me. When I cried out for help, he covered my mouth with his hand and molested me, the teacher alleged.        
	The next day when she went to the school, Dolui allegedly threatened her. He told me to remain silent and even threatened to stop my salary if I opened my mouth, she said.        
	Dolui, president of the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Associations Chandipur unit, dubbed the charges false and politically motivated.         
	However, a section of his colleagues defended him. We dont believe that the headmaster has done such a thing. We know him for many years and he never showed disrespect to any lady teacher, said Ramesh Chandra Mondal, the geography teacher.

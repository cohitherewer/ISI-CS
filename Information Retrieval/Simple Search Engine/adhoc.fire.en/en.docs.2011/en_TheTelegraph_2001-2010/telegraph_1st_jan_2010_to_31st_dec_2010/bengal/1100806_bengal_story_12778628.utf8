The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Red brigade smells nexus blood
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Red brigade smells nexus blood
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee                                  
	Calcutta, Aug 5: The CPM today used a podium to mark the birth anniversary of its founder to renew its allegations of a Trinamul Congress-Maoist nexus but refrained from taking names.         
	At the programme to commemorate the 122nd birth anniversary of Muzaffar Ahmed at Mahajati Sadan, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state secretary Biman Bose tore into Mamata Banerjee for joining hands with Maoists to oppose the Left. However, the duo were careful not to name her.         
	The CPM attack came a day after the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities said it would attend the Trinamul rally in Lalgarh on Monday.         
	What desperation to counter the Left in Bengal. They are joining hands with the Maoists and even those who were involved in the Jnaneswari Express tragedy. Take help from anybody to oppose the Left. It has become the policy of the party (Trinamul) to go to any length to achieve power in the state by ousting the Left, Bhattacharjee said.         
	Bose said the Lalgarh rally had been deliberately dubbed apolitical so that the Peoples Committee could attend it.         
	Everybody knows that the move to call the rally apolitical is aimed at creating an opportunity for the Peoples Committee to attend the meeting, Bose alleged.         
	Bhattacharjee pledged to stage a comeback and asserted that the people wont accept Trinamul as an alternative to the Left. Do you think that such an indisciplined party (referring to Trinamul) that unleashes anarchy everywhere in the state can emerge as alternative to the Left, which has ruled Bengal for three decades? the chief minister asked the audience.         
	This will never happen. We will definitely turn around with the support of poor peasants and the working class, the chief minister said.         
	Yechury jab        
	CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today alleged that Maoists and organisations backed by them were mobilising people for Mamatas rally. Also, Pulin Baskey, the CPM MP from Jhargram, urged the Prime Minister to dissuade the Trinamul chief from holding the rally.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minister fishes in lost trust waters
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Minister fishes in lost trust waters
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  Calcutta, June 8: Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda today said the ruling Left had lost the confidence of the people and should prepare itself to sit in the Opposition after the Assembly polls.         
	In the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, the Left Front was decimated across the state. The same happened in the (2008) panchayat elections and now the drubbing in the civic polls. In such a situation, how can the front make a turnaround? I dont foresee any change of verdict in the Assembly elections. So, the front should prepare to sit in the Opposition. We have lost the confidence of the people, who are now giving oxygen to the Opposition.         
	The Samajwadi Party leader had needled the front earlier too, allegedly to keep alive the possibility of a switch to Mamata Banerjees camp.        
	After the Lok Sabha polls last year, he had demanded early elections because he felt the front had lost the moral right to rule. After the civic poll results were announced last Wednesday, he had said the people had given the ruling party a death certificate.         
	Today, Nanda said he did not want to single out the chief minister and hold him responsible for our governments lapses.         
	A CPM leader dubbed Nanda not a dependable ally.         
	Asked about the ministers comments on the eve of a front meeting to discuss the civic poll debacle, the CPM central committee member said: Partners like the CPI, Forward Bloc and the RSP have a commitment to our ideology. Nanda doesnt have that. He is not a dependable ally. We are told he has one foot in Trinamul.        
	Critics say Nanda needs Mamatas help to find a safe seat. In his Assembly segment, his party candidate was 13,000 votes behind his Trinamul rival in the Lok Sabha elections.         
	Moreover, Nandas Mugberia Assembly seat will cease to exist in the next polls because of delimitation.        
	Nanda, however, opposed early Assembly polls today saying that could make it look like the front wanted to run away. The workers and the peasantry have deserted us. In several parts of the state, the CPM cannot run, or even open, its offices. All this happened because of the wrong steps and policies of the state government. But we dont want early polls as that would make the people feel that we are jittery and want to run away.        
	Another front partner, the Forward Bloc, had yesterday hinted at the possibility of early polls while opposing it in the same breath. There has been no let-up in the unrest across Bengal since the polls. At this juncture, the poll panel can hold the elections in November, Ashok Ghosh had said.        
	Asked if the Samajwadis would quit the front before the Assembly polls and go with Trinamul, Nanda said: We are in the Left Front now. So, why are such questions being raised? Please ask the Forward Bloc, RSP and the CPI first.        
	At a three-day national executive of the party in Calcutta recently, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had indicated he was keeping his options open. The 2011 election is a year away. So, we have to decide whether to have ties with Trinamul, he had said with Nanda by his side.        
	The fisheries minister echoed Mamata today when he opposed the paramilitary operation in Lalgarh. I am totally opposed to CRPF deployment in these areas. We are spending lakhs but the killings are continuing. How many Maoists have been arrested? The tribals are moving away from us because of such operations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Anniversary jolt to Obama
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Anniversary jolt to Obama
  - Kennedy seat lost in suspected Democrat ambush          K.P. NAYAR                                      Barack Obama, Scott Brown and Edward Kennedy                                
	Washington, Jan. 20: Barack Obama today woke up on the first anniversary of his taking office to receive a present he did not want: a stark warning from the American people that, like Jimmy Carter three decades ago, Obama may be a one-term US President.        
	The stinging loss of a Massachusetts Senate seat, held by the late Edward Kennedy for nearly half a century to a long-shot Republican Scott Brown last night may be the death-knell for Obamas signature work yet as President: a law to reform American healthcare. With Browns election, Democrats have lost their treasured 60-seat majority in the 100-member US Senate. The ruling party needed Democrat Martha Coakley to continue Kennedys work in the Senate to thwart a process known as filibuster. With 41 seats in the chamber, Republicans can now filibuster or indefinitely block any health care legislation from proceeding in the Senate.        
	Obama will lose sleep in the coming days that his partys nominee was defeated in Massachusetts last night not by Republicans but by Democrats.        
	Many Democrats are angry over his policies of compromising in office with vested interests such as the insurance and pharmaceuticals industry on health care, with the military-industrial complex on expanding the war in Afghanistan and with Wall Street in allowing banks and financial institutions to continue along the disastrous path that caused the current global financial meltdown.        
	Preliminary estimates suggested that 22 per cent of Democrats in Massachusetts voted yesterday for Republicans to give their candidate a mere five per cent majority to become the first Republican Senator from the solidly Democratic state in nearly 40 years.        
	Even in Hyannis Port, the picturesque seaside village that was home to the late Senator, Kennedys one-time supporters voted in droves for the Republican candidate yesterday to send a clear message to Obama that his policies went against their desire for real change in America.        
	The defeat in Massachusetts is the third big loss for his party in a row since Obama moved into the White House. Two months ago, Republicans similarly unseated governors in New Jersey, another equally solid Democratic stronghold, and in Virginia, which Obama had convincingly won in his presidential election in November 2008.        
	On the first anniversary of his four-year presidency, there was more bad news for Obama.        
	His nominee to lead the transportation security administration (TSA), which oversees airport security across this country, withdrew from contention, compounding Obamas problems following a terrorist attempt to blow up a US airliner 26 days ago on Christmas Day.        
	Although the attempt failed, it has severely dented public confidence in Obama: Americans habitually believe in the popular myth that Republicans are better at handling terrorism and national security than Democrats.        
	In recent weeks, Obama had urged Senators to quickly confirm Erroll Southers, a black and former FBI agent, as head of the TSA to stress that the key post should not be left vacant at a time of threats like the failed attack on a US commercial airliner.        
	But his nomination ran into trouble after it was revealed that Southers had received a reprimand from his FBI superiors two decades ago for running illegal background checks on his then-estranged wifes boyfriend.        
	The victory in Massachusetts will significantly energise Republicans ahead of the mid-term elections to the US Congress in November this year.        
	Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, pointed out to reporters here last night that if Democrats cannot sell their agenda in the bluest state in the country, they cannot sell it anywhere else in America. Blue is the colour of the Democratic party.        
	Any loss of a majority in the Senate and the US House of Representatives, now controlled by Democrats along with the White House, will make Obama a lame duck President for the rest of his first term in office.

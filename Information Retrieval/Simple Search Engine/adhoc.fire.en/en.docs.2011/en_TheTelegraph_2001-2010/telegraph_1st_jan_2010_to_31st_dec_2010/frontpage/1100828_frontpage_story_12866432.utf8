          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 27: Pressure is mounting on housing minister Gautam Deb from within the CPM as well as the Opposition to come clean on the Rajarhat land allotments, including the plot that his wife was given through a lottery.        
	The CPM also wants Deb to get his wife to return the land, following in the footsteps of tourism minister Manab Mukherjee.        
	The Congress today demanded the publication of a white paper by the housing minister detailing land allotments in Rajarhat while the Trinamul Congress leadership filed an application under the Right to Information Act seeking details of plots allotted to individuals, co-operatives and corporate bodies.        
	According to a CPM leader, by going on the offensive, Deb has caused avoidable embarrassment to the party and the government on land, an issue that had upset the Left apple cart and started the partys electoral reverses beginning with the 2008 panchayat polls.         
	Gautam Deb had sought the party leaderships consent before calling the media conference to explain the Rajarhat land allotments. He was given the go-ahead. But it seems that he went overboard in saying that the allotments were made by the Hidco board by exercising its wisdom. People will interpret that as his whim as he is the Hidco chairman. The chief minister and Biman Bose didnt entirely approve of his gesture, a CPM central committee member said.        
	Our party wants him to come clean on the land allotments made by Hidco in Rajarhat. Land played a crucial role in our successive electoral defeats. Gautamda should also explain his stand to the party on the plot given to his wife.         
	That party pressure, including that from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM state secretary Bose, was being piled on Deb became evident when Mukherjee announced the return of the plot his wife had got from the Hidco chairmans quota.        
	After talking to the chief minister and Biman Bose, Manab went public so that Deb could follow in his footsteps. Thats what our party wants. Let the picture be clear so that we can reply to all the queries that would be raised by the Opposition, a CPM leader said.        
	According to a source, the CPM leadership also wants to exert pressure on Deb to consider whether he should take further recourse to the special quota for land allotments or go in for public advertisements.        
	A CPM state secretariat member said: We will have to discuss the issue at the highest level of the party. Gautamda is both a central committee and state secretariat member. So, our party must be talking to him in this regard.        
	Calcutta high court advocate and Congress leader Arunava Ghosh today said: First, the housing minister seems to be carrying the legacy of Jyoti Basu who had used his discretion to give away land to his near and dear ones in Salt Lake. Gautam Deb should have been transparent. If theres a quota, it should be well publicised for the intended beneficiaries. The minister should bring out a white paper.        
	On the RTI application, Trinamul MLA Jyotipriya Mallick said: We have reason to believe that CPM ministers, leaders and their men have benefited from Debs official benevolence.

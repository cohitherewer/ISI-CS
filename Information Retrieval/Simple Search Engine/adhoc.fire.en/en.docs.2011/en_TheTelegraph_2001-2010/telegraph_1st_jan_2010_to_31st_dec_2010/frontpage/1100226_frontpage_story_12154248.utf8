          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 25: Accountant, economist and politician  Pranab Mukherjee will have to wear all these hats as he rises to his feet at 11am on Friday to present the budget.        
	Eight months ago, Mukherjee had tried to spend his way out of trouble with total expenditure crossing Rs 10,00,000 crore. With signs of recovery visible, many of his colleagues believe he has to now contain prices whose rise is partly blamed on the splurge.        
	The finance minister has to worry about the ballooning deficit figures and rising public debt. But he cannot drastically cut expenditure as he has to realise the growth targets which will also give him more revenue. The concerns Mukherjee will have to deal with:                   
	Homemaker        
	Concern: Balancing the household budget has been tough. I want some respite from price rise.         
	Reality: The Economic Survey released today warned that overall prices would go up further in the months to come.         
	What can be expected: Mukherjee is not in a position to provide immediate relief on prices. He may forecast softening of prices with the arrival of the Rabi crop and announce steps to boost agriculture, besides freeing up imports.         
	Bread-earner         
	Concern: Fuel prices rising, cost of education for kids going up, eating out no longer that palatable for the purse. But my income is not rising. Please cut income tax.         
	Reality: A family of four with two kids ends up spending at least Rs 2,000 on an evening out. Not to mention other everyday scorchers.        
	What can be expected: The minister can provide some relief through tax tweaks. But any significant benefit is unlikely. Tinkering with tax brackets, higher standard deductions and more leeway in medical reimbursements can be expected.         
	Small farmer         
	Concern: Rise in input prices  from seeds to fertilisers  has increased costs but my realisations from produce have fallen. I need more subsidy, debt waiver and better support price.         
	Reality: The government raised the support prices for rice, pulses, soyabean, groundnut and mustard this year. But with the last monsoon failing and the survey confirming a drop in farm output, farmers are in distress.         
	What can be expected: Mukherjee is likely to lay stress on improving farm output and yield, better use of inputs, toning up marketing infrastructure and increasing public investment.        
	NREGA worker         
	Concern: I was promised 100 days work with a daily wage of Rs 100. I got work for only 50 days.        
	Reality: Around Rs 30,000 crore was spent this year to create employment. The government has claimed that the NREGA has increased rural purchasing power. But people have complained they did not get the guaranteed work.        
	What can be expected: The politician in Mukherjee knows the benefits of announcing more outlay for the rural job scheme. But his accountant and economist avatars tie his hands. As the NREGA has also been blamed for the price rise, Mukherjee is likely to stress more on plugging leaks than on significantly raising the outlay.         
	Chamber emissary         
	Question: Stimulus package with cuts in excise and service tax and other concessions helped. Please retain the sops to nurture growth.        
	Reality: Industrial production surged by 16.8 per cent in December 2009, confirming that the stimulus did yield desired results.         
	What can be expected: Sops in the form of tax cuts and concessions will result in revenue loss. Mukherjee is expected to tread a middle path and withdraw only part of the fiscal stimulus.         
	Economist         
	Concern: Its time to cut deficits by moving away from a subsidy regime.         
	Reality: Some economists believe the current level of deficit is unsustainable. The last budgets spending spree resulted in the ballooning of the fiscal deficit  the difference between governments expenditure and non-borrowed receipts  to 6.8 per cent of the GDP.        
	What can be expected: Mukherjee will aim towards pruning fiscal deficit to around 5 per cent by withdrawing part of the stimulus package and cutting spending.

	New Delhi, Apr 26 (PTI): A united Opposition in the Rajya Sabha today sought to corner the government over allegations of telephone tapping of ministers and senior political leaders, stalling proceedings of the Upper House. Members from the BJP, Left, AIADMK, JD(U) and SP did not allow Question Hour and legislative business in the house, shouting slogans and seeking response from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the controversy.         
	When the House met at 1230 pm after two adjournments, Home Minister P Chidambaram read out a statement, amidst din by Opposition, saying the allegations of telephone tapping are not found to be substantiated. The main Opposition BJP demanded a probe by the Joint Parliamentary Committee into the allegations and shouted slogans. However, members of BSP, which appears to be with the government over Opposition sponsored cut motions on the Finance Bill, remained seated. Judging the unrelenting mood of the Opposition parties, Deputy Chairman K Rehman Khan, adjourned the House for the day after it witnessed uproar for a few minutes. The BJP, which gave a notice for suspension of Question Hour, began to protest immediately after nominated member B Jayashree took oath when the House met for the day.         
	Chairman Hamid Ansari said the Government would make a statement and pleaded with the Opposition parties to allow the Question Hour to proceed. However, he was forced to adjourn the proceedings till noon.         
	Similar scenes of protests were seen when the House reassembled. Senior BJP leader M Venkiah Naidu said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should make a statement as the issue is very serious. Telephones of cabinet ministers, chief ministers and political leaders are being tapped....What is happening to the country, he said. After the House saw stalling of proceedings twice till 1230 PM, Deputy Chairman adjourned it for the day.        
	The news weekly has alleged in an article that the phones of Union Minister Sharad Pawar, Congress leader Digvijay Singh, CPI(M) leader Prakash Karat and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had been tapped. Responding to Advanis demand, Leader of Lok Sabha Pranab Mukherjee said the Prime Minister could make a statement only at 1530 hours as he had a luncheon meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Otherwise, they should allow the Home Minister to make a statement to clarify the issue. But the opposition members were not satisfied with Mukherjees statement and continued their protests.   
	In the din, Chidambaram read out his statement that neither the previous UPA government, nor the present one had ordered tapping of phones of political leaders. Both governments upheld the law of the land. We are committed to defend the rights of every Indian citizen, including the right to privacy, and will uphold the rights of the individual citizens enshrined in the Constitution of India, he said. Rejecting allegations against the NTRO, he said, It is a technical organisation of the government....The organisation was notified on April 15, 2004 and asserted that intelligence agencies functioned within the law and were fully accountable to the government. Under the Telegraph Act and the IT Act, each case of monitoring of telephones or electronic communications has to be approved by the Union Home Secretary personally and is subject to review by an oversight committee chaired by the Cabinet Secretary. Such monitoring, as may be necessary to fight crime, for national security or for counter-terrorism effort, is subject to multiple checks and oversight, Chidambaram said.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Menon on job, signs of thaw
  - ISLAMABAD TRIP ON PCS RADAR, IPL ON LIPS          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The first Pakistan visit by an Indian minister after 26/11 could happen next month, with a marginal but perceptible softening in New Delhis stance within a week of Shiv Shankar Menon taking over as national security adviser.        
	Sources said home minister P. Chidambaram was likely to visit Islamabad to attend a three-day conference of South Asias internal security ministers from February 20, provided Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and foreign minister S.M. Krishna agreed.        
	Government sources attributed the thaw partly to Menon, considered one of the architects of the Sharm-el-Sheikh declaration and a proponent of the good neighbourhood line.        
	Also contributing to this thaw were Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilanis appeal not to let bilateral ties become hostage to one incident, that is 26/11, and Pakistani investigators corroboration yesterday of Ajmal Kasabs statements.        
	Today, Chidambaram put the good neighbourhood line into practice. He welcomed the Indian Premier League statement that Pakistani players could still be part of this years meet.        
	I am speaking as a cricket lover.What I see on the television seems to be a good beginning, Chidambaram said about the reports that Abdul Razzak may be picked by one of the IPL franchisees. Even if three, four or five Pakistani cricketers eventually play in some matches I and several million cricket lovers would be happy.        
	On Monday, Chidambaram had criticised the IPL for ignoring Pakistani cricketers in the auction, terming the move a disservice to cricket and denying any government role in it.         
	The last Pakistan trip by an Indian minister had come in May 2008, when then foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee had gone across to carry forward the composite dialogue. It is a dialogue that Pakistan Premier Gilani has urged India to restart.        
	In an interview to a private Indian TV channel, Gilani described the Sharm-el-Sheikh meeting with Manmohan Singh as good. Indias Parliament had been in uproar, however, over perceived concessions made by New Delhi at the Egyptian resort.        
	Gilani said the process started at Sharm-el-Sheikh was stalled only because of Indian public pressure and Parliament and added that remaining hostage to 26/11 would only benefit terrorists.        
	While New Delhi and Islamabad continue to accuse each other of cease-fire violations, there are signs of an easing of tensions. The two foreign ministers are to meet on the sidelines of the London conference on Afghanistan that started today.        
	Yesterday, Pakistani investigators corroborated Kasabs statements to Indian sleuths. They also found sufficient incriminating evidence against seven militants arrested in Pakistan for plotting 26/11.

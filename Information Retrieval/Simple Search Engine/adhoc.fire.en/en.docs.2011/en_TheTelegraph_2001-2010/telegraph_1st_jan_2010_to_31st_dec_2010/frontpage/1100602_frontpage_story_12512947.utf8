          OUR BUREAU                               
	Ranchi, June 1: Immediately after Presidents rule was imposed in the state, Governor M..H. Farook called a meeting with chief secretary Ashok Kumar Singh and heads of all government departments.         
	At the meeting, Farook did not mince words to make it clear to all the bureaucrats present that he would not tolerate corruption, would seek punctuality, would want to see officials concentrate on field visits and complete pending development and welfare schemes in a time-bound manner.        
	The otherwise collected governor reportedly lost his temper when told that the urban development department had bought over 100 buses for the city bus service in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad, but was yet to find operators to run the same.         
	Buses are rotting there, a senior IAS officer quoted Farook as saying at least twice during the meeting.        
	A top bureaucrat revealed that the governor made it clear that corruption would not be tolerated at senior levels.         
	The meeting, which lasted for more than an hour, started at 5.30pm.         
	Besides chief secretary Singh and heads of different government departments, including home secretary J.B. Tubid, rural development secretary S.K. Satpathy, finance secretary Rajbala Verma, were among those present.         
	Director-general of police Neyaz Ahmed, who also attended the crucial meet, was told to ensure that law and order was maintained at any cost.        
	Apparently taking a cue from his predecessor, K. Sankaranarayanan, whose brief stint during Presidents rule was praised by all, Farook stressed on resuming distribution of sugar through PDS shops across the state.         
	A news communiqu issued by Raj Bhavan late in the evening suggested that the governor had directed Singh to ensure that pending panchayat elections were held in the state at the earliest.         
	He also voiced his concern over poor power supply and ongoing strike by non-teaching employees of all universities of the state.        
	Farook stressed on revenue collection and better implementation of Centre-sponsored flagship schemes like MGNREGS, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, JNNURM and National Rural Health Mission, among others.         
	Meanwhile, some bureaucrats apprehended major administrative reshuffle in coming days.

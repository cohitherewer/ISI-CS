                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CPM admits cadre link in attack
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      The Telegraph report on Saturday                          
	Midnapore, Sept. 4: Police today arrested three CPM cadres for yesterdays attack on journalists near a zone recaptured from Maoists, prompting the party to concede they were our activists.        
	But signs emerged that the action could end up as a token gesture, with a senior CPM leader saying the arrests should be appreciated and tempers allowed to cool. The police too quoted those picked up as saying they had attacked the journalists by mistake thinking their vehicles were ferrying arms.        
	The attacked journalists said they would accept that the right people had been arrested only if the police showed them photographs of the trio.        
	Among the seven journalists attacked with iron rods and sticks were Pronab Mondal, The Telegraphs principal correspondent, and Amit Datta, the newspapers photographer. His left arm fractured, Mondal was today admitted to a Calcutta hospital.        
	Panchanan Mahato, Shaktipada Mahato and Rajib Mahato were arrested from their homes in Buripal, the site of the attack. The district leadership admitted they were party workers but said they were merely guarding their homes and had attacked the journalists by mistake.        
	The arrested trio had recently returned home after fleeing because of Maoist terror, the police said.        
	Why dont you appreciate that the police have arrested our activists? CPM state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty said. His admission about our activists is a step forward from yesterday when he had wondered if overzealous villagers had carried out the attack.        
	CPM district committee member Meghnad Bhuniya, who is in charge of the Salboni area, claimed the attack was a result of panic reaction and it lacked party sanction.        
	The chief minister, who had yesterday said jani na (I dont know) over three hours after the attack, was not available for comment. Home secretary Samar Ghosh, who had echoed his boss, refused to respond today.        
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said the trio, arrested after police questioned several people, had been charged with rioting, attempt to murder, and arms act violation.        
	 But, he said, the police had been unable to find the two CPM leaders named in the FIR: Pirakata local committee secretary Madhusudan Mahato and Salboni leader Jagannath Mahato. The attackers had backed off only after the two leaders arrived at the spot.        
	The arrested trio have told the police that party bosses had asked them to look out for two cars bringing weapons to the area, an officer said. They said this was why they had stopped the two cars and the attack had taken place.        
	The police said the arrested men had provided some names and more arrests would be made soon.        
	From his hospital bed, Mondal said: We dont know whether these three are being made scapegoats to brush the matter under the carpet. We have asked the police for photographs of the (trio).... We will never be able to forget the attackers faces.        
	Mondal said the police had not confirmed if they would send the photos. He also questioned the trios purported claims. They made no attempt to search the car, as they should have if they were looking for arms. Nor did they ask for our identity cards. One of them had shouted: Cut his hands so he cant write any more copies.

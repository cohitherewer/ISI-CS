	Patna, Sep 6 (PTI): Expressing relief over the release of the abducted policemen by the Maoists, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today said such incidents could recur in the state where elections are due later this year and demanded that all polling booths should be manned by central forces.
    "I won't say this was the last incident. There is no guarantee that such incidents will not happen again. I request the Centre and the Election Commission to ensure that central forces are deployed in all polling booths," Kumar said.
    Addressing a press conference hours after the three policemen were released, Kumar said helicopters should also be deployed for aerial surveillance and the state government would bear the expenses for that.

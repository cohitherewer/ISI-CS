          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 1: The state vigilance bureau has begun tightening the noose around former chief minister Madhu Koda, his close aide Binod Sinha, and former chairmen and senior officials of Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB).        
	The bureau instituted a preliminary inquiry late yesterday into the income tax dossier and other documents forwarded by JSEB, which contain incriminating details of payment of crores of rupees in kickbacks to Koda, his associates and senior JSEB officials by Hyderabad-based IVRCL to bag rural electrification contracts in the state.        
	According to sources, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Ashok Kumar Rai has been asked to examine the dossier and sift out grounds for lodging an FIR under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Rai has been asked to submit his report within a week.        
	Sources said the bureau was also examining whether the JSEB decision to forward the dossier to it had state sanction or not.         
	There are certain formalities which have to be completed before lodging an FIR, said inspector-general (vigilance) M.V. Rao. He added that the bureau would certainly institute a case against those who figure in the dossier.        
	The dossier has been forwarded by JSEB to the vigilance bureau for action against those who were bribed by the Hyderabad-based company to bag the contract.         
	Koda, arrested by the bureau on November 30 last year in connection with a disproportionate assets case and currently in Delhi to attend the monsoon session of the Lok Sabha, has vehemently denied any role in the power scam.         
	According to the dossier, illegal payments to the tune of Rs 11.04 crore had been made to Koda and Lalit Jain.         
	Joint general manager of IVRCL D.K. Shrivastava had admitted to income tax officials that the Rs 11.04 crore was in addition to Rs 9.3 crore provided by the head office to meet the expenditure towards payment of commission to the chief minister and JSEB officials. Shrivastavas house was raided by income tax officials on October 31, 2009, and again later.         
	On the clout of Koda aide Binod Sinha, Shrivastava said that the letter of intent of the entire contract was held back for more than seven months after finalisation of the contract by Binod to extract a higher commission.         
	According to investigating agencies, Shrivastavas statement was extremely important as it explained the role of Koda, Binod Sinha and Abhishek Rajput. Rajput, the relative of a Congress MP, had introduced IVRCL to the Jharkhand government. He was initially paid Rs 50 lakh as commission.         
	Shrivastava also named former JSEB chairman B.N. Pandey, former member (distribution) S.N. Chaudhary, former chief engineer Anand Sagar and former finance controller Niranjan Roy as those who received kickbacks.                                      
	IVRCLs joint general manager (projects) A.P. Shrivastava named two other former JSEB chiefs  B.M. Verma and H.B. Lal as those who got cuts on the instruction of the head office.        
	Meanwhile, Koda reached Delhi yesterday, escorted by armed police personnel led by sub inspector Madan Chandra Singh, to attend the Lok Sabha session.         
	The district administration got Koda to board the train at Barkakana, about 60km from Ranchi. According to Birsa Munda jail sources, Koda was lodged in Tihar jail.

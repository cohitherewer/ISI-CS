  - Ministers stick to traditional version         ARCHIS MOHAN                            AR Rahman                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Group of Ministers watching over Commonwealth Games preparations has shot down a proposal by Bharat Bala to play a non-traditional version of Vande Mataram.        
	At its last meeting on September 6, the GoM also discussed the consequences of Delhi continuing to receive heavy rains up to and on the day of the opening ceremony on October 3. Already, deadlines set in the GoM meeting on September 1 have been missed because of bad weather.        
	Bharat Bala, who is the creative head for the opening and closing ceremonies, presented three renditions of the national song. One version was based on the song sung by A.R. Rahman and produced by Bharat Bala that was a chartbuster in the late 1990s.        
	However, sources in the GoM said that the group headed by S. Jaipal Reddy felt the contemporary version could hurt peoples sentiments.        
	Shri Bharat Bala presented three different renditions of Vande Mataram. After detailed discussions, it was felt that since Vande Mataram was the National Song, there should not be any deviations from the original version which would alter the essential form and character of the song. Shri Bharat Bala was advised to rework the rendition accordingly on the basis of the 2nd version that was played before the GoM, the minutes of the meeting said.        
	The national anthem will be played during the opening ceremony. Vande Mataram will be played in the closing ceremony. While Vande Mataram is being played, 2,000 children will perform on the ground, the minutes added.        
	Bharat Bala made a presentation on behalf of the Games organising committee on the current status of preparations of the opening and closing ceremonies.        
	The opening ceremony will feature a segment called the Great Indian Journey, which will be split into three segments  Human Train, Gandhi and Celebration. The Human Train segment will present the confluence of all aspects of rural India. The sights visible from the window of a train while travelling through rural India would be projected on the Aerostat.        
	The second segment will have a flute recital of the hymn Vaishnav Jan To. The Celebration segment will have about 800 performers presenting folk dances and also a rendering of a composition of Kabir.        
	The GoM wanted Bharat Bala to rework the rendition of Kabirs doha (couplet) as the one presented before it lacked phonetic clarity and did not bring out the doha in the recognisable and identifiable form as a doha of Kabir.        
	Bharat Bala was asked to consider Koi bole Ram, koi khudai, a shabad of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh guru.        
	The opening ceremony will reflect the pluralist character of the country. Bala informed the GoM that the music has incorporated the Hindustani, Carnatic and Qawalli traditions. The performers will wear costumes to reflect different aspects of Indian culture. Important monuments will be projected on the Aerostat or the Rs 40-crore blimp representing various periods of Indian history. In the opening segment, the theme song Swagatham will be sung in different regional languages.        
	Bala has incorporated Islamic and Buddhist influences on Indian civilisation after criticism from the GoM in earlier meetings that these were missing. Thus, Gautam Buddhas image will be projected on the Aerostat and there will be props related to the celebration of Id.        
	There will be sounds of azaan, Buddhist chants and Vedic chants in the soundtrack.        
	The closing ceremony on October 14 will have participants from different countries come together to represent Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is a family). It will also show Indian martial arts like the gatka of Punjab and the mallkhambh of Maharashtra after the security agencies allowed the use of sticks, swords and fire on the ground. There will be a Glasgow cultural show  the city will host the 2014 Games. The ceremony will end with the music of universal love  a 30-minute segment with folk, sufi, popular and world music.        
	Rain scare        
	However, Viraf Sarkari of Wizcraft, the event managers, said several segments of the opening ceremony will either need to be cancelled or scaled down if rains continue. A rehearsal stage which is much lighter would have to be used if the ground at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium does not dry. Several segments of the opening ceremony would then have to be dropped.        
	If the rain continues further, it would not be possible to build any stage and all the flying scenics would have to be dropped. Only ground-based choreography would be presented. It may also be difficult to present the different installations of the Great Indian Journey.        
	According to the GoM minutes, Sarkari also stated that incase of extremely bad weather it may not be possible to raise the Aerostat and it may have to be removed.        
	Bala requested the GoM to postpone the security lock down of the stadium from October 1 to 2 to give them another day of rehearsal.        
	The rehearsals which were to start at the venue from September 1 will now start only after September 22. The next GoM meeting is slated for tomorrow.

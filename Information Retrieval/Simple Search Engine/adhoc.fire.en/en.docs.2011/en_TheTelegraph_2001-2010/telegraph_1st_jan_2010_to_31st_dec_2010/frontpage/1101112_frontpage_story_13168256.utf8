                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Have enough MPs to make up the 18: Jaya
                                            
	Excerpts of J. Jayalalithaas interview with Times Now editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami follow:              
	Goswami: You have consistently raised the issue of (telecom minister) A. Raja, after the CAG reports findings. Where do you think the scam is headed to?         
	Jayalalithaa: As soon as this scam broke it was about 2 years ago; I was amongst the first leaders in this country to raise this issue. I have been consistently issuing statements on the spectrum scam to take action against the Union telecom minister Mr A. Raja and make him accountable for the great loss he has caused. Today, the matter has reached such a stage that everyone in the country is talking about the spectrum scam.         
	Initially around two and a half years ago, nobody knew what we were talking about and it took sometime to make people understand the implications and the enormity indulged in by Mr. Raja and the magnitude of the loss caused to the exchequer began to percolate to the masses.        
	Today even a child can speak about it. Today its not just me, not just political leader but everyone has been talking about it: why Raja hasnt been dismissed from the Union council of ministers? Why the central government and the Prime Minister havent been able to dismiss Raja for his crimes?         
	Goswami: Why do you think Mr Raja has got such a long rope?         
	Jayalalithaa: The reason is simple. It is coalition politics. To put it plainly, it is obvious that the Congress which heads the UPA at the Centre feels that any precipitate action against Raja will result in DMK withdrawing its support to the Union coalition government and the Congress obviously fears its fragile coalition will collapse and this will lead to mid-term polls.         
	The clamour for action against Raja has reached such a crescendo that further action against Raja will damage the very credibility of the Congress and put a big question mark on its future.        
	As an Opposition leader, I would say where the Congress is concerned, where theres a will, theres a way and if the Congress is able to summon the political will to act against Raja, I can show to the Congress that the political coalition doesnt have to collapse and the nation doesnt have to face another mid-term poll.        
	Goswami: Are you saying, Ms Jayalalithaa, if the Congress takes action against Raja and there are political consequences, then the AIADMK could consider supporting the Congress Party?         
	Jayalalithaa: I am saying this on the presumption and the perception that the hesitation of the Congress in taking action against Raja is because they fear the coalition government will collapse. As I said earlier, theres no reason to expect Mr Raja to resign on his own. He will not do that and theres no point expecting Mr Karunanidhi to ask Raja to step down. He will never do that.         
	So what is the alternative if the Congress wants to save its credibility from further erosion, the Congress has to act swiftly to remove Mr Raja from the Union cabinet and what is holding the Congress back from doing it? Since the whole nation is aware of the corruption indulged in by Mr Raja, the Congress knows very well what Mr Raja has done.        
	Every constitutional authority from the CAG to the Supreme Court has commented in detail on the massive scam caused by Raja. So what is still holding back the Congress when it is facing embarrassment in Parliament every day? Today a stage has been set where the Congress can no longer ignore this demand.        
	What is holding the Congress back is the fear that the coalition govt will collapse. So based on this presumption, what I am saying is that the DMK has 18 MPs in the Lok Sabha. The Congress does not want to lose the support of those 18 MPs. But now the DMKs position has become untenable. Rajas position has become untenable.         
	If the Congress wishes to avoid going in for a mid-term poll, the numbers have to be matched up. Now there are other like-minded leaders. I have spoken to some leaders of other parties. We have 9 MPs in the Lok Sabha and between them, other friendly parties have enough MPs to make up the 18 with one or two to spare. So what is holding the Congress back?         
	Goswami: Will you seek any condition for your party MPs giving support to the Congress?         
	Jayalalithaa: That would be premature. There will be no conditions from my side. All I would be interested in that probity is restored in public life. All I am interested in that a perpetrator of such a massive scam is not allowed to go scot-free simply because of the compulsions of coalition politics.        
	Just imagine, the CAG has mentioned that Raja has caused a loss of Rs 176,379 crore to the nation. This is a mind-boggling figure. The common man will be hard-pressed to find out how many zeros do you add to this number.                   
	So this a scam of a magnitude, never before witnessed in this country, perhaps unprecedented in the annals of this country and now it has been revealed that Raja fully disregarded the advice of the Prime Minister, the law minister and the finance minister and went ahead to get away with it. He should not be allowed to get away with it. He should be dismissed from the Union cabinet. He should face prosecution.        
	As a citizen of this country, not as an Opposition political leader but as a citizen of this country, I am interested in seeing the guilty is punished. That is all. There are no conditions from my side. I would also like to add, if a mid-term poll is inevitable, my party is ready to face it anytime.        
	Goswami: Who are these other like-minded parties who will be actually willing to support the UPA?        
	Jayalalithaa: I dont think it will appropriate to mention the names of those parties. But rest assured, I do not make idle claims. I am not in the habit of making idle claims. When I say I have 18 MPs to replace the 18 MPs of DMK, I mean what I am saying.         
	Goswami: Do you think the PMs image will take a hit on the Raja issue?         
	Jayalalithaa: I think there have been court proceedings where Raja has been castigated by the judges for having misused the name of the Prime Minister. But till today, Raja persists in saying that whatever he did was with the knowledge and consent of the PM. So, I think it is up to the Prime Minister to clear his own name and make it clear to the nation that he is not condoning Rajas crime against the nation; that the PM has had no part to play in this massive scam. It is up to the PM to prove to the nation that he means to take action against Raja.        
	Goswami: What would you like to tell the Congress? What would you like to tell Sonia Gandhi?        
	Jayalalithaa: Where the Congress is concerned, they have shown that they are willing to take action against those in their own party who have created embarrassment to the party like Mr Shashi Tharoor, Mr Ashok Chavan, Mr Kalmadi and some others. So its not that the Congress would not like to condone corruption. This is the message the Congress has tried to convey through the actions it has taken against the persons I have just mentioned. But that is not enough.        
	If the Congress wishes to prove to the nation, convey that it doesnt condone corruption, then it has to show that it is going to take action against Raja. I dont think the Congress really wishes to support Raja. Maybe there was a stage earlier when it did appear the Congress was ready to support Raja but now it is becoming increasingly clear that the only reason Congress is not taking action against Raja is the coalition politics or rather the numbers game. The Congress needs the numbers to stay in power.         
	If there is any other reason for not taking action against Raja, then I really dont know about it. But the delay in taking action against Raja is creating all kinds of speculation but that is not good for the image of the Congress.         
	Goswami: You have talked about the alliance in the Centre. But do you think the AIADMK is now ready to work closely with the Congress at the state level? Will you be willing for that?         
	Jayalalithaa: Thats for the Congress to ponder over!        
	Goswami: Your equation with Sonia Gandhi has seen many ups and downs in the past. Politics is all about personal equations. How do you view the relationship over the years?        
	Jayalalithaa: My party is 38 years old and I have a political career of 28 years. When you spent so much time in politics, there are bound to be ups and downs and theres bound to be a past. But in politics, if you keep harping (about) the past and looking back you cannot move forward. So its part and parcel of politics that you forget what happened in the past. We move towards future.        
	Goswami: What is the role that you see for yourself in the national arena? What are your aspirations in national politics and your role in the Centre?         
	Jayalalithaa: Speaking on a personal level, the first task is to win the Assembly elections which are due early next year, which is my first priority. We hope to win the elections next year and form govt in Tamil Nadu and give the state a strong and stable govt. Strong states make for a strong nation. As for the role in the Centre, this will be decided in the coming times. But since you have asked me this, I would like to tell you that today the security of the nation is causing a concern to every right-thinking citizen and to every responsible political leader like me. If at all, I get to play a role at the Centre, my first priority would be to strengthen the nations security.        
	We cannot ignore the treat posed by China and other neighbours. Today China has the most modern and well-equipped army in the whole world. Are we in a position to really take on Chinas military might? I feel not enough attention is being paid to providing our armed forces with the best equipment available in the world and with incentives to serve the country.        
	A greater percentage of the budget should be allocated for defence. Defence spending should be stepped up. I think our responses to the provocation from China and Pakistan are too mild. I can say this: China and Pakistan would not have been so arrogant and so emboldened with a person like Indira Gandhi. India is being increasingly perceived as a soft state which is not true but this impression has been created by the central government because of the lack of strong leadership at the Centre.        
	Today, I am just a leader in the Opposition. I am the leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly but I am an Indian citizen and very concerned about the countrys security. Therefore, I earnestly appeal to the central govt to pay more attention to strengthening our armed forces.         
	Goswami: What I understand is your focus is not only in politics in Chennai - but also its impact at the national level.        
	Jayalalithaa: I dont just belong to Tamil Nadu; I am also an Indian citizen. So my view, my vision is always national.

  Dont leave home without Laxman          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                            VVS Laxman on his way back to the dressing room after the Test victory against Australia in Mohali on Tuesday. With an unbeaten 73, Laxman scripted Indias unlikely one-wicket win. (AFP)                                         
	Bring me my Bow of burning gold; 
  Bring me my Arrows of desire: 
  Bring me my Spear: clouds unfold! 
  Bring me my Chariot of fire!        
	William Blake               
	They counted on that sore vertebra of his too much and forgot the man has a formidable spine. In the first outing, pain had chained his reach and rasp. He came late and left early, half cocking a benign dipper into the slips: V.V.S. Laxman, caught Michael Clarke bowled Nathan Hauritz for two.        
	This morning he put a bone to his back, like a warrior would put sword to scabbard, and strode into the field of slaughter, unbothered that it was already soaked in blood and more would leap to stain his whites. For him this was a classic double-relish moment.        
	Laxman favours the second innings, he favours a fight to the finish even more. But ever more than any of that, he has a fondness for favouring the Aussies with strokes of silken lashing. It began as an adolescent fancy, punishing the men from Down Under, and then flowered from hobby to habit to hallmark.        
	As a colt, he played three Under-19 Tests against the Australians in the spring of 1994. The visitors attack was laced with such lethal future stars as Brett Lee, Jason Gillespie and Andrew Symonds. Laxman hit three tons and ended the series averaging 110.25. Ricky Pontings men should have remembered.         
	Laxman, for his part, hasnt lacked for reminding them. A blistering 167 off 198 balls in the 2000 Sydney Test that almost saved the game for India and his place in the side after a wretched patch. A year later, that blockbuster 281 at Eden that won India the match by a mile after having followed on. In the 2003-2004 season, two spanking hundreds in the Adelaide and Sydney Tests that robbed Steve Waugh of victory in his farewell series.        
	In 2008, two more hundreds separated by 6,000 miles that lie between India and Australia  109 in Sydney, where he isnt allowed to score less than three figures, and a double-hundred at Delhis Ferozeshah Kotla.        
	But to count his contribution by the weight of runs  in Sri Lanka this July, Laxman quietly nudged out Sourav Ganguly to become Indias fourth highest Test scorer after Tendulkar, Dravid and Gavaskar  is to do him great discredit. Its the manner and mien in which he gets them. Like a swan picks its pearls, at will and on whim, with singular lan and entitlement.        
	Mythic? Sos Laxman. Who else can blaze the ball to midwicket when his essay has led everyone to believe hes played it to cover? Who else can give brutality on bowling the feel of a caress? Who else can reveal a smile as broad as his blade in the act of slaying? Who else could have done what he did, yet again, this day at Mohali? With a feeble back and feebler partners at the other end?        
	Look around and tell. Look around the Indian dressing room and tell if your gaze rests on anyone other than this delectable deliverer.         
	Its a gathering of too many gods, the Indian batting bench. Sehwag will destroy the opposition on his day, Dravid will stay and sparkle, Tendulkar has travelled where no cricketer has ever been and continues to cut his furrow beyond the reach of mortals.        
	In the starlit cradle of cricket celebrities, Laxman is quite the odd and ugly duckling. He rarely gets endorsements, he is shy and stumbling on camera, his life off the field isnt worth media pursuit.        
	But once hes crossed the ropes into the arena, he morphs into a swan; when he squawks and flaps his whiten wings, he scares and scatters the big fish.        
	When Indias batting gods have all departed and crisis is centre stage, like it was on Tuesday, its time for Laxman to parade the sublime human virtues  patience, fortitude, endurance, defiance.        
	There he was amid the mayhem of the Mohali pitch, as very often in the past, statuesque of build, gladiatorial of grit, unfazed of circumstance and unfussed of method, almost unaware of defeat echoing from where he taps his bat on the crease.         
	Consider this: the man they often disparage as a slow coach  unjustly, but will someone speak up for Laxman because hes too modest to do that himself?  got 73 unbeaten and match-winning runs today off 79 balls. Eight fours, each a scorcher this side and that of the wicket.        
	Then consider that when he walked in, half the Indian side lay plucked and they were still 140 adrift. Fifty runs on, three more wickets had tumbled, Tendulkar and Dhoni among them. The innings blown to rafters, Ponting licking his palms to grab his first Test conquest as captain on Indian soil. Laxman now had no more luxury than the company of Ishant Sharma and Pragyan Ojha, the frail tail of the wreckage.        
	Thats when he unveiled his spine; Ishant rode it particularly well and Laxman held it firm enough to frustrate his favoured opponents into a flurry of frantic byes. The toughest nuts on the field of sport, cracked under the persistence of Laxmans softened back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bruni to have Taj photo-op, finally
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bruni to have Taj photo-op, finally
          ARCHIS MOHAN                             Bruni and Sarkozy                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: This winter, Nicolas Sarkozy will keep a promise he made to the Taj Mahal and, presumably, to Carla Bruni two years ago.        
	When the French President had visited India in January 2008, he was in the middle of a headline-grabbing romance with Bruni. A customary photo-op in front of the monument to love would then have been just what the spin-doctor ordered.        
	But a protocol detail stood in the way: the former model had not yet walked down the aisle and become Ms Bruni Sarkozy. So, the President, the chief guest for Republic Day that year, went alone to Agra and wrote in the Taj Mahal visitors book: Unforgettable, see you soon again.        
	Whether the Taj effect cast a spell or not, Sarkozy did not wait for more than a week and married Bruni on February 2 the same year.        
	The annoying impediment out of the way, Sarkozy is expected to take Bruni to the Taj when the couple tour India for four days this December.        
	The Taj is not on the itinerary of Michelle and Barack Obama, the higher-profile couple set to touch down in India this week. The Obamas will instead visit Delhis Humayuns Tomb, on which the Taj is said to be modelled.        
	Bruni will visit another edifice that is becoming as familiar to the world as the Taj Bollywood. The Hindi film industry is slated to host a reception in honour of the Sarkozys at Mumbais Film City on December 7.        
	The Sarkozys are scheduled to land in Bangalore on December 4. The couple will fly to Agra on December 5 and meet the Prime Minister in Delhi the next day.        
	Agra should be bracing for more power couples. Childhood sweethearts Svetlana Medvedeva and Dmitry Medvedev, who also happens to be the Russian President, will visit in December. Featuring on best-dressed lists, Svetlana is no stranger to celebrity.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      GRIM FORECAST                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Indias overall monsoon is 4 per cent below normal despite eastern India reeling under severely deficient rainfall but the rain level could decrease further in the coming week.         
	The India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its weekly monsoon update today predicted that the overall rainfall across the country will remain below normal over the next two weeks  August 14 to 27.         
	Bihar, Gangetic Bengal, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, western Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have all had rainfall levels 20 per cent to 48 per cent below normal  zones of deficient rainfall this season.         
	The overall Indian monsoon rainfall deficit over the past week  August 4 to 11  was 26 per cent, the worst weekly performance since the start of the season in June. And current atmospheric conditions, according to weather scientists, predict below expected performance of the monsoon until August 27. This could further erode rainfall deficits in these areas.         
	The IMD had earlier predicted a normal monsoon with August and September wetter than June and July. While the 4 per cent deficit is still within normal limits, scientists are concerned about the forecast for two weeks of below normal rain.         
	September would have to be an extremely wet month to compensate for the deficit that appears set to rise during August. But, senior weather scientists point out that the monsoon begins to gradually withdraw during September.         
	Bihar was the most deficient among Indias 35 agrometeorological subdivisions over the past week with 88 per cent below-normal rainfall.         
	The relatively abundant rainfall across the southern peninsula has meant that 40 per cent of India has received normal or excess rainfall this season  the rest of the country has experienced deficient (20 per cent to 50 per cent below normal) or scanty (60 per cent to 99 per cent below normal) rainfall.

          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 29: No one really knows when the state Assembly will be in session again, but one thing is certain, heated debates among lawmakers will not end in chairs being hurled in the House by legislators trying to prove a point.         
	Heavy chairs bolted to the floor is only one of the features of the new look planned for the Vidhan Sabha, work on which started a couple of weeks ago.         
	Bose acoustics, ductile split air-conditioners and a soundproof main chamber are other comforts MLAs of the state can look forward to.         
	The Rs 2.34-crore project is being executed by the state building construction department, which has hired Godrej and Boyce Manufacturing Company Ltd for the purpose.         
	We are working round the clock to ensure the renovation is complete by September. It will be an entirely different looking Vidhan Sabha, said Anirban Dey, who is co-ordinating the project on behalf of Godrej and Boyce.         
	According to Dey, there was little scope to work on Vastu, which some politicians and officials blamed for the states jinxed political scenario. No chief minister in Jharkhand has completed a five-year term and the state is now under Presidents rule for the second time in 10 years.        
	Dey said as the main building was quite old, it did not permit too many changes which had to take into account the security concerns of VVIPs of the state.         
	Once renovations are complete, the Speaker will be able to get a better view of proceedings as his stage is being elevated to a height of 600mm from the ground, from the earlier 450mm.         
	The treasury and opposition benches will be arranged in steps of 150mm (front benches), 300mm (middle benches) and 450mm (rear benches) height to ensure that all MLAs can be seen by the Speaker.        
	The state being under Presidents rule notwithstanding, the Assembly is witnessing a complete makeover. The last session was held in February-March 2010 after which the House has remained in suspended animation.         
	Junior engineer in the state building construction department, Md Noor Hassan, who is looking after the project, said he was racing against time to complete the work and hoped everything would be in place by September 22.        
	Among the other changes, the seating capacity of the House has been increased to 92 from the earlier 86, with a provision of increasing it to 106 if required. Galleries and curves have been introduced in the 24m x 14m space to ensure visibility amongst MLAs.                                                  
	Special attention has also been paid for members of the media. A three-tonne air-conditioner has been fitted in the media gallery while a glass partition will ensure that photographers can take pictures without entering the well of the House.

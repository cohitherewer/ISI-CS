  - Limited, not revolutionary, change in long-held policy          RACHEL DONADIO AND LAURIE GOODSTEIN                                    
	Rome, Nov. 21: Pope Benedict XVI has said that condom use can be justified in some cases to help stop the spread of AIDS, the Vaticans first exception to a long-held policy banning contraceptives.        
	The popes statement on condoms was extremely limited: he did not approve their use or suggest that the Roman Catholic Church was beginning to back away from its prohibition of birth control. In fact, the one example he cited as a possibly appropriate use was by male prostitutes.         
	The Vatican today cautioned that there is nothing revolutionary in the popes assertion that condom use in exceptional circumstances can be a responsible act in the fight against the spread of HIV.        
	The Holy Sees chief spokesperson, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, issued a statement stressing that the popes comment neither reforms or changes church teachings that forbid use of condoms and other contraceptives.        
	The pope maintains that condom use to lessen the danger of infection is a first assumption of responsibility, the statement said.        
	Still, the popes statement was something of a milestone for the church and a significant change for Benedict, who faced intense criticism last year when, en route to AIDS-plagued Africa, he said condom use did not help prevent the spread of AIDS, only abstinence and fidelity did.         
	The relaxation of one of the Vaticans most controversial positions  while limited in scope  was nonetheless greeted as a breakthrough by dissident Catholics, AIDS workers and commentators.                    
	It is a marvellous victory for common sense and reason, a major step forward towards recognising that condom use can play a vital role in reducing the future impact of the HIV pandemic, said Jon Brien, head of the US group, Catholics for Choice.        
	The pope made the statement in interviews on a host of contentious issues with a German journalist, part of an unusual effort to address some of the harshest criticisms of his turbulent papacy.         
	The interviews are to be published this week in a book, and excerpts were posted online by the Vaticans newspaper, LOsservatore Romano, on Saturday afternoon.         
	In the book, Benedict said condoms were not a real or moral solution to the AIDS epidemic, adding, that can really lie only in a humanisation of sexuality.         
	But he also said that there may be a basis in the case of some individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute uses a condom, where this can be a first step in the direction of a moralisation, a first assumption of responsibility.         
	The decision to grant the interviews was a rare effort to humanise a pope often seen as a distant intellectual whose papacy has lurched from crisis to crisis, including revelations worldwide last spring that called into question the Vaticans handling of cases of child abuse by priests.         
	Although Benedict, 83, took pains to explain his most controversial decisions, he did not veer from them. That included his defence of Pope Pius XII, whose tenure during World War II has been criticised by Jewish groups that say he could have done more to help Jews escape the Nazis.         
	Benedict also suggested several times that he was a victim of overly zealous critics, including those who criticised him for revoking the excommunication of a bishop who denied the scope of the Holocaust.         
	The pope did, however, acknowledge the churchs failings during the years that children were being abused. The deeds themselves were hushed up and kept secret for decades, he said. That is a declaration of bankruptcy for an institution that has love written on its banner.         
	The book, Light of the World: The Pope, the Church and the Signs of the Times, comes from a series of interviews conducted in July by Peter Seewald, a German journalist and the author of two previous books of interviews with Benedict when he was still a cardinal.         
	Benedicts concession on condoms, however slight, may have left room for debate on the issue of whether they may be used as part of campaigns against AIDS.         
	The use of condoms has been a contentious issue ever since Pope Paul VI denounced birth control in his famous 1968 encyclical, Humanae Vitae.         
	In recent years, bishops in Africa and elsewhere have been calling on the Vatican to allow for condom use as part of a broader approach to fight the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. At a news conference at the Vatican last year, Cardinal Peter Appiah Turkson of Ghana suggested, for instance, that condom use was worth considering for married couples if one partner is HIV-positive.         
	The Vatican has also faced pushback at some church-run health clinics in Africa, according to experts who say health care workers often ignore the teachings and distribute condoms.         
	Although the popes statements did not go nearly as far as some church leaders in Africa might like, the Rev. James Martin, who has written about the Vaticans stance on the issue in America, a Jesuit publication in New York, said even a slight shift by the pope was noteworthy. Whats significant is that this is an exception thats being voiced by the pope, whereas previously there were no exceptions, he said.         
	The Rev. Joseph Fessio, a former student of Benedict and the editor in chief of Ignatius Press, which is publishing the English-language edition of the book, said the popes new remarks on condoms were among the most surprising in the volume. But he also stressed that they were very carefully qualified.        
	It would be wrong to say, Pope Approves Condoms, Father Fessio said. Hes saying its immoral but in an individual case, the use of a condom could be an awakening to someone that hes got to be more conscious of his actions.

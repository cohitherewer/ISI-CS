          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Sharad Yadav                          
	New Delhi, May 15: A caste census may offer a remedy for ills but caste councils are an illness themselves. So Janata Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav suggested today.        
	The NDA convener slammed the khap panchayats of Haryana, accused of ordering honour killings, whose recent demand for a ban on same-gotra marriages appears to have received some politicians support.        
	Sharad said the khaps were an illness to society and infringed on citizens right to marry according to their choice.        
	Congress MP Naveen Jindals support to the khap panchayats was unfortunate. The rule of law and not the writ of khap panchayats should prevail in this country, he said.        
	Jindal, the young Congress MP from Haryana, was recently reported as having assured the khaps that he would take their demand before the Centre. Congress sources claimed Jindal had clarified to the party, after it demanded an explanation, that he did not support khap panchayats.        
	Sharads uncompromising opposition to the caste councils contrasts with ally BJPs hesitation about taking a strong stand against them. The BJP has described Jindals alleged support for the khaps as unfortunate but stressed the need to understand the councils views.        
	Sharads party has little political stakes in Haryana, though.        
	The khaps  traditional caste councils with no official standing but wielding immense influence  have been accused of holding kangaroo courts and ordering many executions and bans that are promptly implemented.        
	Sharad today cited a recent court order to justify his call for a caste census. I welcome the decision of Madras High Court, which has asked the government to conduct a caste census, he said. We want each and every caste  backward or forward  to be counted. Let the country know where each section stands.

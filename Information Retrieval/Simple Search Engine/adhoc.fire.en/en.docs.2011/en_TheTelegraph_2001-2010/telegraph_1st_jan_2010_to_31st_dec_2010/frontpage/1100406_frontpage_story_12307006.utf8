	Dibrugarh, April 5: After lying low for some time, Ulfa is said to have stepped up activities across some pockets in Upper Assam with a group entering Borhat in Sivasagar district and the Kakopathar-Pengeri areas in Tinsukia district, prompting security forces to sound an alert.        
	The development comes ahead of the outfits Raising Day on April 7, a day when it has carried out strikes in the past.         
	Sources in the Military Intelligence Unit (MIU) said a five-member group is being led by hardcore Ulfa cadre Nitul Gogoi of Tingkhong Nasoni village in Dibrugarh district.         
	The group is equipped with sophisticated weapons like AK-series rifles, hand grenades and a huge quantity of explosives. We are tracking them and hope to get them soon, an MIU source said.        
	The sources added that the group had come from the Myanmar camps of the outfit and entered Assam through Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh.         
	It might be mentioned that for almost two years now  after the dreaded Alpha and Charlie companies of the outfits 28 battalion came out of the jungles with a unilateral ceasefire  most parts of Upper Assam had been incident free.        
	However, the tardy progress in the peace process made a severe dent in the confidence of the pro-talks Ulfa group and boosted the morale of the anti-talks faction.         
	There is another report of yet another seven-member group entering the Pengeri-Kakopathar-Bordumsa area in Tinsukia district. All these areas had always been a hotbed for the outfit.         
	The armys 2/11 Gorkha Rifles unit had an encounter with one such group at Litong-Betoni village under Pengeri police station in Tinsukia district last evening.         
	After an exchange of fire for around 15 minutes, the group, which had taken shelter in the residence of Bhoben Moran of the village, fled from the area.         
	We are tracking the movements of this group. An alert had been sounded throughout the district and we are confident that we will be able to prevent this group from carrying out any acts of violence, a senior police official of the district said.         
	Mrinal Hazarika, a leader of the pro-talks Ulfa camp, blamed the state as well as the Centre for the reported resurgence of Ulfa in Upper Assam.         
	Talks are the only possible way out. We will keep on repeating this. Direct talks between the Centre and the outfit is the only solution, Hazarika said.

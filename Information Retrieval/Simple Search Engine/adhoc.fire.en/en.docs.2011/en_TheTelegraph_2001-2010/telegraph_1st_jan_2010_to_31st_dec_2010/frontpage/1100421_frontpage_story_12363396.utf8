  - BJP ducks for cover as Sita backs brother-in-law Hemant           SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             Shibu Soren                                        
	Ranchi, April 20: Former chief minister Babulal Marandi has said Shibu Soren was the victim of his son Hemants chief ministerial ambitions, in what is the strongest criticism yet of Gurujis continued dithering over contesting Assembly elections to remain in the saddle beyond June 29.        
	Marandi, now MP from Koderma, alleged Soren wasnt announcing a seat to contest elections under pressure from his MLA son Hemant to whom he will then hand over the baton.        
	Yesterday, cornered by journalists on his pending decision, Soren came up with a typically cryptic reply. Larenge, batayenge (will contest, will tell), he told them at Sri Krishna Institute of Public Administration here after chairing a meeting of deputy commissioners.        
	When contacted, Hemant refused to comment. It is better to ask Guruji, he said.        
	Marandi claimed Sorens game plan was clear, but in the process he was leading the state towards political instability. He also criticised the BJP for being a mute spectator to what was going on. The BJP was fast becoming irrelevant in the country with such opportunistic actions, he maintained.         
	A senior BJP MP confided that a move was indeed on to install Hemant as chief minister. But, the central leadership hasnt reconciled to it as yet, he said.         
	Deputy chief minister Raghubar Das, who has refused to come out in the open on the issue, has spared no effort to convince Soren about the need for contesting a byelection.         
	But it doesnt seem to have worked. And now, the party will find it difficult to publicly accept and justify such an ad-hoc change-over at the top. The BJP with 18 seats accepted Guruji for his contribution to the creation of Jharkhand. It will not be politically comfortable for the saffron brigade to accept Soren, Junior as CM, confided a senior BJP leader.        
	Significantly, a confirmation of sorts came from Jama MLA and Sorens daughter-in-law Sita, who said she was under no pressure now to vacate her seat.         
	Jab kuchh nahin ho raha hai, toh wahi ho raha hoga (Since Guruji isnt doing anything on fighting elections, it is clear he wants Hemant as chief minister), she said, adding that she would support her brother-in-law if and when he became chief minister.         
	But, the dissenting voice within the JMM came from party legislator Teklal Mahto who said others like him would not accept Hemant as chief minister.         
	State agriculture minister Mathura Prasad Mahto said that their party would hold its executive committee meeting on April 25 to take a final decision on the issue of Gurujis by-election so that he retain his chair.

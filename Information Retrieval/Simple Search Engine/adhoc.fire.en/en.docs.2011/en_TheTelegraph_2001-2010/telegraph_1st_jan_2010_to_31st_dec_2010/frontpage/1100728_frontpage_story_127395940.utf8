	Islamabad, Jul 28 (PTI): A Pakistani passenger plane carrying 160 people today crashed into the heavily forested Margalla Hills overlooking Islamabad in rain and bad weather and large number of casualties were feared, officials said.
    Private airliner Air Blue operated Airbus A-321, flying from Turkey to Islamabad via Karachi, hit the Margalla Hills near Daman-e-Koh viewpoint around 10 am in thick fog, police and a state-run rescue service officials said.
    Police said bodies were strewn across the low mountains near the scene of the smouldering wreckage in inaccessible hills, shrouded in heavy cloud and fog during a downpour.
    Up to 10 people were confirmed dead but five injured survivors were airlifted from the crash site by helicopter, according to Interior Minister Rehman Malik.
    The inaccessibility of the site and bad weather were hampering rescue efforts, he said.
    "Rescue teams, paramilitary Pakistan Rangers and senior police officials have reached the site.

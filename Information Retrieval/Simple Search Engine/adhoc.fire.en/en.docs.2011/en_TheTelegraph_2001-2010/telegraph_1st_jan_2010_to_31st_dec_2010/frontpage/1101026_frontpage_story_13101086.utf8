          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Ranchi, Oct. 25: The state government today set a three-week deadline to prepare a report on the status of land that will be required for the ambitious expansion project of Birsa Munda Airport (BMA) to facilitate landing of larger aircraft.         
	In an effort to start work on the project that is to increase the length of the runway and ultimately get a license from Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), chief secretary A.K. Singh chaired a meeting that was attended by revenue and land reforms secretary Santosh Kumar, his civil aviation counterpart B. K. Tripathy and senior army officials from Ranchi and Patna.        
	The entire airport area is about 546 acre. Airport Authority of India (AAI) requires about 500-600 acres more for the proposed expansion project. Most of the land, around 400 acre, in and around the airport belongs to the army which has indicated its willingness to part with it. Some other stretches belong to private holders.        
	Special secretary in state revenue and land reforms department A.K. Rastogi, who also attended the meeting, told The Telegraph they would now need to verify the land stretches minutely and find out details like the name of the village, khata, mouza, area and names of holders.         
	The local circle office will be entrusted with the job, he added.

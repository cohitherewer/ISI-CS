  - As RS awaits bill, snapshots of those who cracked glass ceiling          OUR BUREAU                                                
	Navsari is Gujarats only district whose children are taught English at government primary schools. It happened after the district panchayat elected a woman, Jyotiben Desai, as its chairperson              
	Councillor Mala Roy of Calcutta stepped into sweepers quarters and learnt from their wives that the men squandered their salaries on liquor. She got the civic board to approve salary payment to conservancy staff through cheques              
	Desai and Roy have a lesson for the likes of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad who have promised to resist the womens bill in the Rajya Sabha on Monday, which happens to be International Womens Day.        
	They and many other women in Indias rural and civic bodies, where 33 to 50 per cent seats are reserved for the gender, have taken striking initiatives to make a difference to their constituents lives.        
	The women of Devipattinam in Tamil Nadu dont have to make the demeaning trip to the fields at night any more. Panchayat president Jamruth Beevi has built public toilets for them.        
	Sanju Devi, a Maha-Dalit and Class IX dropout, has so far settled 250 of the 300 cases  related to dowry, land and family disputes  that she found pending in the gram kachari (village court) when she became the sarpanch of Baikathpur in Patna district.        
	Women can make a difference because they are generally less dishonest, Bengal Congress leader Debabrata Bose said, citing how councillor Roy had changed the face of Keoratala crematorium that used to be a haven of criminals.        
	Unlike their male colleagues, the women must balance all this hard work with household chores  a fact gleefully cited by womens bill opponents to argue lady MPs and MLAs would be overworked.        
	But Namita Das, chairperson of Shabadpur panchayat in East Midnapores Contai, laughed off such claims.        
	I have two daughters and a son and have to take care of household chores. My husband does farm work and doesnt earn much. Still, as an elected representative, I have a responsibility to the people, she said.        
	I attend office every day and meet local people to find out what their problems are. Why should public work be a burden for me? I enjoy it thoroughly.        
	The leader of the Opposition in Bengal, Partha Chatterjee, concurred. A woman representative may have to look after the installation of a tube-well, then return home and rush into the kitchen. But they dont complain, he said.         
	Anupam Dutta, Trinamul Congress councillor from Salt Lake, mentioned another advantage: the womens presence has lowered the pandemonium quotient at local bodies.        
	At the board meetings of councillors or panchayat samitis, the presence of women discourages their male colleagues from being rude or disorderly, Dutta said.        
	Officials and politicians in most states agree that this has happened.        
	Many of the women, especially in the rural areas, come from extremely underprivileged backgrounds and could not have made it without reservation of panchayat seats.        
	Bimla Devi was a widow and an HIV carrier but became mukhiya of the Dhibar panchayat in Gaya, and now leads an AIDS/HIV awareness campaign in her constituency.        
	Sandya Banerjee, 31, was an auto-rickshaw driver before being recently elected the panchayat president of Neendoor in Keralas Kottayam district. I worked here as an auto driver for the past three years. I was able to build contacts thanks to this job. Later I decided to contest elections and won, she said.        
	The quota has also brought in inspirational leaders such as Dalit woman Norti Devi of Ajmer, who had angered the upper castes in 1987 by opposing Roop Kanwars sati act and whose fight against panchayat corruption has brought her UN recognition. Norti, 60, became sarpanch of Harmada this year.        
	Rajni Pal of Uttar Pradesh, married off at 18 and virtually imprisoned in the kitchen  her husband had raised hell when she had asked to join a self-help group  is a panchayat pradhan in Jalaun at 40.        
	She wants to be an MLA. I will try to get a ticket from an established political party for the 2012 Assembly polls, she said.        
	That ticket may not be easily forthcoming if the Mulayams and Lalus succeed in blocking the womens bill which sets aside a third of Parliament and state legislature seats for the gender.

          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 23: The final test is also the toughest.         
	The state administration today prepared for the fifth and last phase of panchayat elections tomorrow  when all sensitive and super-sensitive blocks, including the bastions of Maoist leader Kundan Pahan, go to polls  even as rebels tried to spread terror.         
	As many as 376 companies of security forces  of which over 200 companies will comprise central paramilitary forces including CRPF, BSF and ITBP among others  will hold fort in 242 panchayats spread across 14 blocks in five districts. Bundu, Tamar, Sonahatu and Rahe of Ranchi district, where CPI(Maoist) area commander Kundan Pahan holds sway, have been completely fortified with over 50 companies of security forces.         
	However, reports suggest that these blocks  which had recorded low voting percentage in the Lok Sabha and the state Assembly elections  will witness a huge turnout tomorrow.         
	Besides the four blocks of Ranchi, other areas going to polls are Palamaus Chainpur and Panki; Bhandaria, Ramkanda and Ranka in Garhwa, Dumri and Pirtand (Giridih) and West Singhbhums Manoharpur, Nowamundi and Anandpur.         
	All these are sensitive areas. A majority of booths have either been declared sensitive or super-sensitive. But we are adequately prepared to thwart any attempt by Naxalites or any other outlawed group to disrupt the polling process. Security forces and poll personnel have already reached the respective cluster points, inspector-general of police (operations) R.K. Mallick said.         
	The assurances notwithstanding, the rebel fear continues to cloud the democratic process with two can bombs being recovered from two school buildings to serve as polling stations in Naxalite-hit Panki block, Palamau, today. The buildings are located in Hotwar and Dwarika villages. Both bombs were later defused.         
	A concerned Panki officer-in-charge, Rajesh Mandal, said: The bombs have been defused, but as a security measure, the administration may hold the voting process on the school premises and not the buildings.         
	In the evening, another can bomb was recovered from a forest track near village Konjhia in Pirtand block, Giridih. Yesterday, the rebels targeted a police party on its way to Bhandaria villages in Garhwa for election duty. But there was no casualty, as the security personnel strictly stuck to standard rules like travelling on foot.         
	State election commissioner S.D. Sharma urged the voters to come out in large numbers and vote fearlessly tomorrow. I will make the same appeal as I had been doing in the last four phases, he said.

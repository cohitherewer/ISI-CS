	Feb. 27: A 507-carat gem discovered in South Africa last year has become the most expensive rough diamond ever sold.        
	Hong Kongs Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Company bought the Cullinan Heritage stone for $35.3 million, Petra Diamonds announced yesterday. Petra recovered the gem, the 19th largest ever found  described as the size of a chickens egg  from its Cullinan mine near Pretoria in South Africa in September last year .        
	 Petra said that the record price reflected the incredible rarity of stone based on its remarkable size and exceptional colour and clarity. It is fitting that the Cullinan Heritage should achieve a sale price of $35.3 million, the highest on record ever achieved for a rough diamond, as it has the potential to produce one of the worlds most important polished gems.         
	The sale proceeds further bolster Petras treasury and will be invested in the growth of our core assets. said Johan Dippenaar, Petras chief executive.        
	Chow Tai Fook has yet to outline its plans for the stone.        
	The worlds biggest diamond, the 3,106-carat Cullinan, was discovered in the same mine in 1905. That was cut to form the Great Star of Africa and Lesser Star of Africa, set in Britains crown jewels.        
	Petra got $9.48 million at a sale in May for a polished 7.03-carat blue gem, also from the Cullinan mine, setting a per-carat record. A carat is a fifth of a gram.        
	Diamond prices have soared as producers cut output after the credit crunch. Rough diamonds rose 48 per cent in the first 11 months of 2009, according to WWW International Diamond Consultants. Demand in China, which overtook Japan as the second-largest gem market, added to the jump in prices.        
	Petra reported first-half profits of $37.9 million after racking up losses of $88 million a year earlier.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

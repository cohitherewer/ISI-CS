          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Sonia and Chidambaram: Positive vibes                                 
	New Delhi, June 23: The Centre today said it wanted Ulfa leaders to come for a dialogue with dignity but left the issue of the release of those in jail to the judiciary and the Assam government.         
	Most of the Ulfa leaders, including chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, are lodged in a Guwahati jail since they were handed over by Bangladesh to India in December last year.         
	The release of the leaders was discussed threadbare during a 55-minute meeting between prominent Assamese citizens, led by litterateur Hiren Gohain, and Union home minister P. Chidambaram this afternoon.         
	Gohain later told reporters, Chidambaram said those who come for talks will be allowed to come with dignity and not as criminals with charges.         
	He said the home minister had made it clear that the Ulfa leaders release could be a lengthy process as some of them faced serious charges. He also pointed out that two of the leaders were already out on bail. The minister also apparently told the citizens group that some decisions needed to be taken by the state government.         
	Sources said there were differences of opinion between Chidambaram and the delegates, but both sides agreed on the need for talks.         
	Earlier during the day, the six-member delegation of the steering committee formed during the Sanmilita Jatiya Abhibartan held in April met Congress president and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. She is understood to have told them that although she had no executive powers (to facilitate the release of the jailed leaders) she would convey the message to the appropriate platform.         
	Given the developments in the past few days, the prospects of talks seem bright. Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi had recently said though releasing Ulfa leaders was a legal problem, his government was willing to extend all possible help to facilitate a dialogue, thereby hinting that the state government may not oppose the bail petition of the jailed leaders.         
	Two days ago, the members of the steering committee had called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with a plea for the release of the jailed Ulfa leaders so that they could hold a meeting of the outfits central committee and deliberate freely. According to Ulfas constitution, the outfit can take decisions only through its central committee.         
	The delegation was satisfied by Singhs response and felt that the government was committed to resolving the problem.         
	The steering committee has been trying to persuade the jailed Ulfa leaders to give up their demand for sovereignty and settle for something less. Gohain today said it was entirely up to the outfit to decide what it wanted to do.         
	He also said Ulfa may have done stupid and wrong things but the issues on which it came into being remained and could be resolved with more autonomy in terms of economy and politics for Assam.

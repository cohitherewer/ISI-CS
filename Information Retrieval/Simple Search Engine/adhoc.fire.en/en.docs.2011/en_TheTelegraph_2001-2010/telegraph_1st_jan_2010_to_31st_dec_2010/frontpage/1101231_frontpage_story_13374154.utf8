  - Visit to Delhi unlikely before January-end, say officials           A STAFF REPORTER                                                      
	Calcutta, Dec. 30: P. Chidambaram today invited Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to Delhi to discuss the subject of their recent correspondence but state government sources said the chief minister was unlikely to go before January 25 because of his packed schedule.        
	The Union home minister today faxed two letters to Bhattacharjee, the first of which denied that Chidambarams December 21 letter was politically motivated. He reaffirmed the existence of armed camps in Jungle Mahal but this time did not mention which party had set them up.        
	The second letter was short, inviting Bhattacharjee to Delhi at his earliest convenience to discuss the subject and agree upon the way forward.        
	When reporters asked the chief minister on his way out of the state secretariat whether he would meet Chidambaram, he only said: I have replied to the letters.        
	But a senior official at the chief ministers secretariat told The Telegraph: He (Bhattacharjee) has a packed schedule till January 24, including his partys politburo meeting in Calcutta between January 15 and 17. If he goes to Delhi to meet the Union home minister, he is not likely to go before January 25.        
	We welcome Chidambarams invite, a CPM leader said after the partys state secretariat discussed the home ministers letters. Buddhada has a tight schedule in January and may not find time to go to Delhi.                    
	He then added: We feel that the chief ministers reply to the home ministers (December 21) letter has been a strong one. Thats why, its better that Buddhada stays away from Delhi now and keeps up the heat on Chidambaram for a while.        
	Writers Buildings officials said both of Chidambarams letters were faxed as well as despatched by speed post. The December 21 letter, sent only by post, had been leaked three days before the chief minister received it.        
	In todays first letter, Chidambaram insisted there were armed camps in Jungle Mahal and said it was the chief ministers responsibility to make sure that all such camps were disbanded, a Writers source said.        
	The home minister also stood by the figures he had furnished about CPM, Trinamul Congress and Congress activists killed in political clashes in Bengal, the source said.        
	The chief minister had given a different set of figures in his reply, but Chidambaram said his figures were based on CRPF and central intelligence reports.        
	After Bhattacharjee entered Writers at 4.40pm --- he had been away at a party programme in Sonarpur ---- he sent a short reply acknowledging the receipt of both letters and accepting the invite.        
	He also hinted at his inability to go to Delhi soon, a senior official said.        
	CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim, asked if the December 21 letter reflected over-activism on Chidambarams part since law and order is a state subject, absolved the home minister.        
	We dont think it was over-activism. Rather, it was a result of the compulsions of coalition politics, He said.        
	What emerges from the latest development is that the Centre will have to combat the Maoist menace thats growing every day. Another thing is clear: the joint forces are there to stay in Jungle Mahal.        
	CPM MP and secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty today wrote to Chidambaram demanding a probe into the media leak of his December 21 letter.        
	He should identify and fix responsibility; otherwise, he will have to own responsibility, Chakraborty told reporters.

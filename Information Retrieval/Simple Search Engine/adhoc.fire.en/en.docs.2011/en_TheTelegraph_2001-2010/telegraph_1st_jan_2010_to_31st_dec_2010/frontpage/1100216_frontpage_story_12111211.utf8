          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Feb. 15: A suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba operative in Calcutta police custody has told investigators that the outfit was plotting an attack in Pune for over a year, according to an officer.        
	Sheikh Abdul Khwaja, who was arrested from Hyderabad last month following an Interpol lookout notice, apparently confessed after cops started grilling him for possible clues to the Pune blast.         
	Our suspicion proved right. He confessed that he had attended a meeting organised in one of the Lashkar camps in Karachi last year, where clippings of some Pune sites were shown, the officer said. We have already informed our counterparts in Pune about the revelations made by Khwaja.        
	Special task force officials brought Khwaja, a key accused in the Hyderabad Mecca Masjid blast case, to Calcutta following intelligence inputs on his alleged involvement in distributing fake currency in eastern India.         
	According to the officer, Khwaja told the investigators they were shown video clippings of the Osho ashram, the Jewish prayer centre Chabad House and several marketplaces in Pune. He has told us that his Lashkar bosses had asked him whether he could carry out operations in these places, the officer said.         
	Khwaja, named as a key member of the economy cell of the Lashkar who later co-ordinated with the Indian Mujahideen (IM), was initially shortlisted for the mission. As he had visited several parts of the country and was well versed with Indian conditions, he was selected for carrying out the operation in Pune, said Rajeev Kumar, special additional commissioner of police, STF.        
	But his name was apparently struck off after some IM operatives were arrested in the past few months in connection with blasts in Jaipur, Bangalore and Hyderabad.         
	Khwaja was known to the IM operatives. Probably, the plotters of the Pune attack didnt want to take any chance and replaced him with new recruits, Kumar said.

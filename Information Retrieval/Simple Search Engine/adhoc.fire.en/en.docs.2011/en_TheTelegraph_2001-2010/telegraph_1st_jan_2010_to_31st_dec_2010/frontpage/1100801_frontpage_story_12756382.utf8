  - Indian researchers join global scramble to develop anti-obesity pill           G.S. MUDUR                                                    
	New Delhi, July 31: A team of industry researchers in India has synthesised novel compounds that interfere with weight-gaining mechanisms in the body and joined an international scramble to develop a new class of anti-obesity pills.        
	The team at Dr Reddys Laboratories (DRL), Hyderabad, has shown in laboratory studies that one of these compounds, code-named 22g, helped gluttonous and obese mice lose 8 per cent of their body weight after seven days of oral medication.        
	The compounds block a molecule called melanin-concentrating hormone receptor (MCH-receptor), which is predominantly found on the surface of some types of brain cells and which bolsters craving for food and contributes to weight gain.        
	A few drug companies in the US have already developed their own compounds that block the MCH-receptor, but all are under various stages of testing, and none is ready for human use yet.        
	This receptor is seen as an attractive target for drugs  and our compounds also show promise as candidate anti-obesity agents, said Pradip Sasmal, an organic chemist at DRL, Hyderabad, and member of the team.        
	Their anti-obesity action, he said, appears to be based on two mechanisms. They suppress appetite and they increase energy expenditure, Sasmal told The Telegraph. The scientists have published their findings this week in the journal Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters.         
	The researchers caution that the new compounds would need to pass a series of animal studies and human clinical trials before they can be considered for use in humans.                                 
	We still need to establish the complete safety profile of these compounds through rigorous animal tests, Sasmal said.        
	The Hyderabad team constructed the compounds through a combination of computational chemistry and pure intuition  a sophisticated process of designing drugs molecule-by-molecule, taking into account molecular affinities and the structure of the target MCH-receptor. A collaborating research group in Denmark conducted the studies on mice.        
	Attempts to develop drugs against the MCH-receptor over the past decade have sometimes encountered toxicities even during animal studies  one compound appeared to have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system.        
	Another effort that had advanced into phase I human safety studies appears to have been abandoned after the participants reported vivid and disturbing dreams, a member of the Hyderabad research team said.        
	Each company is pursuing the same target  the MCH-receptor  but with different candidate compounds. Which one will pan out as a safe and effective drug is still unclear.        
	Given growing obesity levels, at this point in time, any new strategy to treat obesity is worth pursuing, said Anoop Misra, a specialist in metabolic disorders and director of the Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol Disorders, New Delhi, who was not associated with the research, but has been tracking obesity trends in the country.        
	Earlier this month, the US-based Albany Molecular Research Inc (AMRI) announced the launch of a Phase I study of its compound code-named ALB-127158[a] which also blocks the MCH-receptor.        
	Animal studies of the AMRI compound have also suggested promise for the treatment of human obesity. Mice showed a weight loss of 18 per cent after 28 days of treatment  an effect that AMRI has described as substantially higher than available from the current anti-obesity medications.        
	The research efforts, a member of the Hyderabad team said, are driven by prospects of a potentially vast market for anti-obesity agents. Sure, drug design and development is a risky business  the molecules may or may not hit the market. But the rewards with success are huge.

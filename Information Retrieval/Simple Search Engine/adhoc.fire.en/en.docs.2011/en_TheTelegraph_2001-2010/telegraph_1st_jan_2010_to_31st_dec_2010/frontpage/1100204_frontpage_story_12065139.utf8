  - What should I apologise for, asks Shah Rukh          AMIT ROY                                                     
	London, Feb. 3: Shah Rukh Khan, who was in London on a day Shiv Sena activists tore down posters of My Name is Khan in Mumbai, said he was willing to apologise but only if his critics could tell him what he should be apologising for.         
	Flanked by director Karan Johar and co-star Kajol, Shah Rukh managed to stick to his guns in the most conciliatory way possible.        
	Shah Rukh was asked at a packed news conference about threats from Shiv Sena leaders who have warned they would not allow the film to be screened unless he apologised for his remarks regretting the exclusion of Pakistani players from the IPL.        
	What I said was not connected to a person or a group of people, he said. What I said was true of any person from (brought up in the culture of) India, Pakistan, Bangladesh  thats how I have been brought up. My country is nice, I am very proud of it. I am very proud to have been born there. I wish people to come to my country and participate in the goodness of my country. If that is wrong, then my children are studying wrong things (at school), Shah Rukh said.                           
	He clarified that what he had said is not a statement against anyone. I have said what I believe to be true. It is not nice for a Hindi film hero who is thought of as an icon to say this but the stakes are very high.         
	Shah Rukh did apologise but to his colleagues on the movie. I am very, sorry, I would like to apologise to Kajol and my business partners  because of what I say or what I believe in, their film is going to be affected. I have no idea how to change that.         
	He went on: I am very happy taking my film to the world, I am very happy interacting with audiences.         
	There was an emotional moment when he admitted: I am very sad (about this controversy  and it is not jet lag. I am very sad because this is a very special film. I dont know why it (my comments) should be taken personally. It is not meant to be that way.         
	In his own way, Shah Rukh managed to wrong foot the Shiv Sena. I dont know why there is so much confusion about what I have said. I have no idea why there should be. If you have differences of ideas, three people having different points of view, (you discuss it). I have not pointed to a party or a group or a person  I mention no names. (It was) something I said about me and about what I believe in. I think 99.99 per cent of Indians are with me. I dont know the issues, what it is about, I dont know what it is I am supposed to regret ...(am I supposed to say) that I dont want anyone to come to my country, what (that is) all I have been taught by my father, who was a freedom fighter for this country, is wrong, my kids are studying wrong?         
	He appealed to Indians all over the world: I have no idea what people would like me to say. If this (the above) is what they want me to say, I will say it. What do I have to apologise for? If somebody explains that to me and I have done wrong (I will apologise). I have done that in the past... I have apologised to a segment of a Muslim group (because they felt) a song of mine was wrong. Whenever my film has come out, it has never come out with the intention of hurting anybodys sentiments and I hope it will never happen. If I am in the wrong I would like to apologise.         
	He stressed again: Somebody will have to explain to me what is wrong  so many peoples lives, futures are riding on this. I just request everybody, Just leave the film alone and deal with what I said.        
	Did he find it ironic that his loyalty was being questioned in Mumbai at the very moment academics at the University of Vienna were planning a whole seminar on the importance of Shah Rukh Khan as a symbol of all that was best about Bollywood and India, he was asked.        
	It is very humbling, he responded. Much more love is given than I deserve, similarly much more importance is given to the negatives that I get. I never get it straight  I get either too much or too less and that is the beauty of being a superstar. Sometimes I am very, very happy and sometimes I am very, very sad. I have never been normal. If you ask, How does it feel to be a superstar?, it is very, very unbalanced.

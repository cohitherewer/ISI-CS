  - Chief pins hope on cancer centre in Rajarhat          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Ratan Tata in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 23: Ratan Tata was reticent and yet conveyed a lot during his second visit to the city since the Singur pullout.        
	We have not exited Calcutta. Our visits might be less but we have very warm feelings for this part of the country. We regret that we have not been able to do what we wanted to do, the chairman of the Tata Group said at the annual general meeting of Tata Tea today, his first statement in public since checking into the Taj Bengal yesterday.        
	Once he stepped out of the Oberoi Grand after the shareholders meeting, Tata was back to being tight-lipped. A courtesy call to Raj Bhavan and a 50-minute meeting with governor M.K. Narayanan followed.        
	Tata capped his trip with a visit to the upcoming cancer hospital in Rajarhat  the project he had earlier in the day hoped would make those elements in Calcutta who feel alien towards us understand that West Bengal is very much a part of our total corporate identity.                          
	At the shareholders meeting, he spoke about the under-construction cancer super-speciality Tata Medical Centre in Rajarhat.        
	 This year, we hope to open and dedicate the cancer centre in Calcutta (to the people) We hope it will save many lives in this part of the country. We have not changed our view in terms of investment, in fact we have increased the investment in the hospital, he said.        
	The irony in the hope of a pre-Puja launch  officials confirmed that they were eyeing an October inauguration  was hard to miss.         
	On October 3, 2008, on the eve of Durga Puja, Tata had almost sounded the death knell for investment in Bengal by announcing that the Nano was pulling out of Singur. We have taken this decision today, perhaps not the best day to make such an announcement on the eve of your Puja, he had said.        
	The 640 acres in Singur are still leased to Tata Motors. Tata had said last year that the company would not come in the way if the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government wanted to hand it over to some other investor. He also said that Tata Motors would relinquish the plot if compensated suitably for the loss incurred because of the forced relocation to Sanand in Gujarat.        
	At the Rajarhat site today, Tata took stock of the progress of the project for around half an hour and apparently told officials that he would like the 150-bed hospital to open its doors in October.        
	 After seeing the progress of work, he is hopeful about commissioning the hospital before Puja, an official said after Tata left for the airport.         
	The 73-year-old had arrived at the hospital around 5.20pm. His last visit to the project site was during his trip to the city for last years annual general meeting.        
	Sources said most of the infrastructure was ready and some medical equipment had already been installed. The brick and cement part is complete and the finishing touches, including painting, are being given. All radiology equipment have been installed, a senior official said.        
	The installed equipment include precision medical imaging devices like the PET-CT machine, the single-photon emission computed tomography scan system, a 64-slide CT scan and a TX high-energy linear accelerator.         
	Helical tomotherapy, a type of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, will be available at the hospital subject to approval from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. The nuclear medicine unit has already received the green signal from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.         
	The hospital, to be managed by the Tata Medical Centre Trust, Calcutta, is spread across 13.3 acres.

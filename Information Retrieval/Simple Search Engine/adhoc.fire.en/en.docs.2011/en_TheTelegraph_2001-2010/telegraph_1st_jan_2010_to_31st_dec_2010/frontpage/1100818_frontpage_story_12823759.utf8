The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Great Games ahead, says Sheila
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Great Games ahead, says Sheila
          SANJAY K. JHA                            Sheila Dikshit                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: Sheila Dikshit today expressed confidence that Delhi would eventually deliver a great Commonwealth Games and asserted this was not the time to get bogged down in controversies.        
	The Delhi chief minister admitted that the allegations of corruption in the build-up to the October event and the delays had created an image crisis and demoralised everybody involved with the preparations.        
	I am not saying corruption has taken place or not taken place. Every agency is accountable for the work it has been assigned and the expenses it has made. Nobody is running away. We have agencies that will look into every aspect. But right now, the priority is to complete the preparations, Dikshit told The Telegraph.        
	The chief minister cited the Prime Ministers words to suggest it was time to get on with the work. The Prime Minister has said so, we have been saying inquiries must be done and the guilty be brought to book. But you cannot hang somebody before he is proven guilty.         
	Asked if she was blaming the media for the negative propaganda, she said: I am not blaming anyone. It is medias job to highlight deficiencies but the impression that CWG is nothing but loot is not correct. So much work is being done. It is not the Congresss games, not Kalmadis games, not Sheilas games.         
	The call to focus on the job at hand came with a sense of relief. We have got over much of the negativity. Over 90 per cent of work is over. The delays are part of such large preparations. It was seen in China, in Greece and elsewhere. I can assure people that Delhi will be a much better place after the Games.

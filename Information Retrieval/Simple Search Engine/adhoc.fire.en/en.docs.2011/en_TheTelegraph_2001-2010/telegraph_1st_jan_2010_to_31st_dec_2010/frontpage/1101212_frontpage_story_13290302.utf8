	Cancun (Mexico), Dec. 11: The worlds nations today adopted a package dubbed the Cancun Agreements, projected as a building block for a future legal treaty to combat climate change but devoid of key elements needed to avert an unacceptable level of global warming.         
	Negotiators from 194 countries agreed on a set of documents that the UN climate change secretariat said would set all governments more firmly on the path towards a low-emissions future and provide support to developing countries for their actions on climate change.         
	But environment groups said the Cancun talks had failed on the most crucial element of climate change actions  ensuring steep, legally binding cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries.         
	They fear the Cancun text will provide a platform to abandon the Kyoto Protocol, the global treaty that sets legally binding targets for cuts in emissions for the industrialised countries.         
	The alternative that appears to be emerging  a system in which nations pledge their actions and throw them open for international scrutiny  could lead to a devastating 3-5C rise in average global temperature, the Friends of the Earth warned.         
	India played a key role in the talks, proposing a mechanism to allow international scrutiny of all countries  including Indias  actions to curb emissions, a plan that received wide support.        
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh also signalled that India would, eventually, consider legally binding curbs on emissions, a shift from its long-standing position.         
	Analysts said Indias proposals for international scrutiny reflected an acceptance of the principles of transparency. (Rameshs) statement is an indicator that India is willing to shift from doing nothing to joining the global community in fighting climate change, an analyst in Cancun said. But this doesnt mean India will accept legally binding cuts next year.         
	The Cancun documents recognise emission targets set by industrialised and developing countries and require that inventories of the national emissions are shared annually by industrialised countries and once every two years by the developing countries. The agreements are expected to be transformed into a legal treaty at next Decembers conference in Durban, South Africa.         
	The Cancun decisions pledge $30 billion in fast-start finance from industrialised countries to support climate action in developing countries. The goal is to raise this to $100 billion by 2020. The agreements also recognise the need to work towards keeping the rise in the average global temperature below 2C.         
	Cancun has done its job, said Chistiana Figueres, head of the UN climate change secretariat, after the agreement today. It is not what is required, but it is the essential foundation on which to build greater, collective ambition.        
	Environment groups said the pledges so far were way below what was required.         
	The weak pledge-and-review system that appears to be emerging will not guarantee that the emission reductions required will be achieved, Meena Raman, executive secretary, Friends of the Earth, Malaysia, told The Telegraph from Cancun.        
	The pledged emission cuts will put the world on course for at least a 3C rise in average temperature which will be devastating for the poorest and most vulnerable, the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment said.         
	The developing countries had three years ago agreed to take on voluntary actions to curb emissions on the condition that the industrialised countries would extend technological and financial support. But the environment groups said the Cancun Agreements had failed to establish any mechanism to ensure that the industrialised countries did not renege on their commitments.         
	In a statement released today, the CSE said India had betrayed its poor by agreeing to a weak text that paves the way for ineffective reduction targets for industrialised countries. We see this as a sign of a subservient India keen to be part of a global alliance of polluters at the cost of its poor , the CSE said.

	New Delhi, May 15: Arjun Munda has emerged as the frontrunner in the battle for Jharkhands top job with BJP president Nitin Gadkari asking him to go to Ranchi tomorrow to talk tough with the Sorens and set the terms of his government with the JMM.        
	But before that he has been asked to meet BJP MLAs and gauge their mood on having a renewed coalition government with the JMM.        
	Munda would have left New Delhi today, but this morning he was diagnosed with high blood sugar and hospitalised. Till late tonight, it wasnt certain if doctors would permit him to leave tomorrow.         
	However, irrespective of his departure date, the message from Gadkari and the RSS was, If the coalition government was not secured on our (the BJPs) terms, we will not let it happen.        
	Munda himself has said that if he was to head a government, he would run it on his terms and not that of the Sorens. It is also learnt that the BJP is not too keen on going for a rotational chief minister, which means sharing the chief ministers post with the JMM equally for the governments remaining tenure.        
	This is the overwhelming sense in the BJP, a source close to Gadkari claimed.        
	According to high-level party sources, the Sorens  chief minister Shibu and son and legislature party leader Hemant  will now have to deliver on their promised letters of support without which the BJP was unwilling to make a formal announcement on its chief ministerial candidate.        
	The BJPs announcement of its chief ministerial candidate got delayed for various reasons: the partys Delhi leaders were busy condoling the death of BJP veteran and former vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.         
	At last nights meeting with L.K. Advani, Arun Jaitley and Rajnath Singh, BJP president Nitin Gadkari gave clear indications that the claims of Yashwant Sinha, who was Advanis candidate, and Jharkhand deputy chief minister Raghubar Das would not be considered.        
	Gadkari was apparently peeved with Das for his alleged attempt to scuttle Mundas chances by egging on the JMM to press for the continuance of Shibu Soren as chief minister.         
	The RSS, it is learnt, has also not taken kindly to reports that the Jharkhand episode had re-drawn the faultlines in the central leadership with some leaders trying to back individual claimants against the consensus choice.         
	Sangh bosses have given the green signal to Gadkari to finalise the name of whoever he thought was best fit for the post without getting carried away by the demands and pressures from the BJPs lobbies.         
	The message from Nagpur to Gadkari was that he should be firm and unyielding, regardless of who was upset with his decision, a source said.         
	Gadkari, who was in Nagpur today and was to fly out to Europe from Mumbai on Monday, rescheduled vacation because of Shekhawats death. He will be in Jaipur on Sunday and will now leave on Tuesday. Therefore, a decision might be announced on Monday, depending finally on the JMMs response.         
	Even if it didnt, Gadkari was unlikely to defer his trip any more. He might then authorise Rajnath to make an announcement at the appropriate time, said a political aide of the BJP president.         
	The choice of Rajnath, sources said, indicated that Munda had Gadkari, and by implication, the RSSs backing because the former chief minister and Rajnath were supposed to be close.

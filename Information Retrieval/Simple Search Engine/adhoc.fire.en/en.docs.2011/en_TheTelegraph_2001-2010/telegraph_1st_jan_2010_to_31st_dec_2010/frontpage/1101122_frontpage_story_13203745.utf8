  - Mercury dips by 6C in Daltonganj, Ranchi; further drop predicted          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Jamshedpur, Nov. 21: Its time to unpack those woollens and brace for a severe winter.         
	After several places in the state witnessed a sharp fall in minimum temperatures in the last 24 hours, the meteorological department predicted clear skies with no trace of clouds and plummeting relative humidity over the next couple of days. Minimum temperatures are likely to fall further by two to three degrees in many places because of this.         
	According to officials at the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore in Calcutta, the fall in minimum temperature was the result of north-westerly winds blowing over the state since last evening.         
	Several places including Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Daltonganj shivered through the night as the chill set in well and proper.        
	Conditions are favourable for a further dip in minimum temperatures over the next 48 hours in Jharkhand due to the north-westerly winds. The weather chart analysis and other observations suggest that the weather will improve steadily, said the duty officer at the Regional Meteorological Centre.         
	The meteorological office at Jamshedpur today recorded a minimum temperature of 17.3C against yesterdays 20.4C, a fall of about three degrees. The mercury dipped by over six degrees at Daltonganj and in the capital. Against yesterdays 19.9C, the observatory at Daltonganj today recorded a minimum temperature of 13.7C, while the mercury plummeted to 11.8C today from yesterdays 18.5C in the capital.                     
	Director of Patna Meteorological Office Animesh Chanda said the minimum temperatures would continue to fall because of the prevailing wind pattern. Most parts of Jharkhand will witness clear skies over the next 48 hours. There will also be no moisture incursion into the atmosphere, he said, adding that dry weather would prevail in Jharkhand in the next few days, barring a sudden change in weather conditions.         
	Winter has been disappointing in the first half of November, which was unusually warm. Adverse weather conditions prevailed in the first fortnight and the minimum temperature remained three to four degrees higher than normal.         
	After November 15, the minimum temperature climbed six to seven notches above normal at several places, including Jamshedpur and Daltonganj.         
	Weathermen said frequent low pressure formations over the Bay of Bengal coupled with western disturbances had hampered the flow of the north wind over Jharkhand, causing the warm spell. However, things now look favourable due to the dry wind, which is blowing from Rajasthan through Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.         
	A senior weather analyst at the Patna Met office said the wind flow had become normal since last evening. The north-westerly winds bring a nip in the air. The sun will shine brightly in most parts of the state and it will be chilly, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: An expert panel today advised the government to immediately ban production and sale of rosiglitazone  an anti-diabetes medicine banned by European regulators two weeks ago. US authorities had also independently announced rules that restrict its use to only patients not responding to other drugs.         
	The panel has urged the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation to take a quick decision because, sources said, rosiglitazone  which increases risk of heart attacks  continues to be used by an estimated one in 10 diabetic patients in India. This drug could easily be replaced by newer drugs for the treatment of diabetes which likely do not pose a risk of heart attacks, said Anoop Misra, an endocrinologist and head of the National Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation.

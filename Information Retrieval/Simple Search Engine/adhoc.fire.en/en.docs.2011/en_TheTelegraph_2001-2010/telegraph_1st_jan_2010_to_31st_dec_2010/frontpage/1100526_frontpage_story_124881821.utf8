	Beijing, May 26 (PTI): President Pratibha Patil arrived Bejing today as the first Indian Head of State to visit China in a decade. During the visit, she will meet the top Chinese leadership and sign a number of agreements. Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister, Hu Zhengyue and Indian Ambassador to China, S Jaishankar, warmly welcomed Patil at the Beijing International Airport.   
	During her six-day visit, the President will meet her Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao, Chairman of the National People's Congress Wu Bangguo and Premier Wen Jiabao to discuss ways and means to expand the bilateral ties. Political dialogue, cultural diplomacy and economic co-operation will be the agenda of the visit.  
	Besides Beijing, Patil will travel to Loyang in central China, where she will inaugurate the famous White Horse Buddhist temple. The president is also slated to visit India and China Pavilions at the Shanghai Expo 2010 and address members of India-China business forum at Shanghai.   
	Ahead of her visit, Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao said in New Delhi that Patil's visit also ldquo;signals our unequivocal commitment to deepen and expand our strategic and co-operative partnership with China. rdquo;  
	A number of agreements are under discussion between the two countries and are likely to be signed during the visit. China said the two countries would use the opportunity to deepen their bilateral understanding and co-operation to upgrade the Sino-India relations to a higher level.   Patil is the first Indian head of state to visit China in a decade. The then President K R Narayanan had paid a visit to China in 2000.

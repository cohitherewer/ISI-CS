          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        The Jam Bungalow. (Darshan Thakker)      
	Ahmedabad, Jan. 4: The willow that plundered runs has fallen to plunderers. Ranjis bat has been stolen from his palace.        
	Burglars broke into the legendary cricketers ancestral home in Jamnagar, 300km from here, ransacked 15 rooms, damaged paintings and left with antiques, police said today.        
	The two security guards at the palace, Jam Bungalow, apparently noticed the theft this morning and called the police. Officers said the break-in possibly happened sometime in the past fortnight or month.        
	We dont know exactly how many expensive articles have been stolen. At the moment, we only know that a theft has taken place, police officer Kashyap Bhatt said.        
	Sources said most of the stolen articles belonged to Ranji (as opposed to an ancestor or descendant) and confirmed that a bat was among them. It is unclear if the bat dates from Ranjis glory days in the 1890s and 1900s, when he was the worlds greatest batsman in crickets Golden Age, and if he had used it in a Test.        
	Sources said the palace housed several precious articles such as a diamond-studded crown, swords and paintings, many of which the burglars had damaged. For years, no one has lived in the sprawling palace.        
	K.S. Ranjitsinhji (1872-1933) was the ruler or Jam Saheb of Nawanagar, a Test cricketer for England, and the inventor of the leg glance. He was described as the most famous Indian on the planet before Mahatma Gandhi arrived on the scene, and lends his name to Indias foremost inter-state cricket tournament, the Ranji Trophy.        
	The exact list of stolen articles can be drawn up only after the current owner of the palace, Ranjis descendant Jam Shatusaliaji Jadeja, arrives from Mumbai where he lives. He is expected to reach Jamnagar tomorrow, Jadejas lawyer Shailesh Mehta said.

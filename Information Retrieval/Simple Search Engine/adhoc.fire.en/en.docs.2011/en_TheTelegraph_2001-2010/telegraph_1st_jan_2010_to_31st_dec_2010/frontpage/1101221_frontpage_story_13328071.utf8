The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Manmohan springs Caesars wife
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Manmohan springs Caesars wife
  - PM offers to face BJP-headed panel        RASHEED KIDWAI                                                     
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today declared his readiness to appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), now headed by the BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi, to face questions on the 2G spectrum allocation.         
	The Prime Ministers personal manoeuvre, being labelled a masterstroke in Congress circles, puts his probity at the forefront of the partys strikeback, the ground for which was paved by Sonia Gandhi yesterday when she catalogued Singhs strengths.        
	The defining moment came during the concluding session of the 83rd AICC plenary when, taking most by surprise, he deviated from his prepared text to offer himself before the PAC.        
	As soon as the days proceedings began at Burari in north Delhi, Singh was invited by Sonia to address about 12,000 national and state-level party delegates.        
	The Prime Minister, while dealing with the issue of corruption in the context of the 2G scandal and the Parliament standoff, said: The BJP has been falsely propagating that the UPA government is against a joint parliamentary committee because we do not want the Prime Minister to be questioned by a parliamentary committee.         
	Then, amid pin-drop silence, he continued in a deliberately raised pitch: I wish to state categorically that I have nothing to hide from the public at large and as a proof of my bona fides, I intend to write to chairman of the PAC that I shall be happy to appear before the PAC if it chooses to ask me to do so. I sincerely believe that like Caesars wife, the Prime Minister should be above suspicion.         
	The Prime Minister said he has decided to take such a step even though there is no precedent to that effect. A rule revision decades ago has ensured that the PAC cannot summon ministers but if Joshi wants, he can approach the Speaker for permission to call the Prime Minister.        
	Singh, who pointed out that the PAC was presided over by a senior leader of the BJP, Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi, described the committee as an acknowledged watchdog. He said the PAC has all the powers that can be given to the JPC.         
	Congress leaders said Singh, upset by the BJP propaganda that brought his name under a shadow, consulted both Sonia and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee before making a commitment to appear before the PAC.        
	Party sources said that following his offer, in Singhs assessment, the BJP and other Opposition parties would not be able to continue the Parliament boycott during the budget session. The sources said Singh was keen that the budget and other crucial financial bills should not face any problem.         
	The BJP dug its heels in and rejected Singhs offer, saying that Caesars wife did not get to choose the form of inquiry. But Congress insiders said the Prime Minister was confident that the weight of public opinion would force a rethink in the Opposition.        
	Since some weeks are left before the budget session starts, the issue is expected to play out over a period of time.        
	If the Prime Ministers immediate objective was to enthuse the Congress rank and file, he seems to have succeeded. Normally at such party fora, Singh is not perceived to be an effective speaker but on Monday, his offensive against the BJP became the talking point.        
	At lunch, party delegates, while helping themselves to five variations of bread, kofta, chhole, dal makhani and numerous vegetarian preparations, were heard showering praise on Singh.        
	AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh termed Singhs offer brave and extraordinary. It is a masterstroke, Digvijay said.         
	Does Arun Jaitley not have faith in the intelligence of Murali Manohar Joshi? he asked.

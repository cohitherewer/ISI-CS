	New Delhi, Sep 6 (PTI): The Supreme Court today stayed the death sentence of two terrorists -- Adam Bhai Suleman and Abdul Qayum Mufti, whose conviction for killing 37 people at the famous Akshardham temple in Gujarat in 2002 has been upheld by the High Court.
    A bench headed by Justice B Sudershan Reddy while staying the execution of the sentence issued notices to the CBI and the Gujarat Government on an appeal filed by the duo challenging their conviction in the case.
    A special POTA court had in July 2006 awarded death sentence to Suleman and Mufti for one of the worst terrorist attacks and the Gujarat High Court had confirmed the sentence in June this year, following which they appealed in the apex court.

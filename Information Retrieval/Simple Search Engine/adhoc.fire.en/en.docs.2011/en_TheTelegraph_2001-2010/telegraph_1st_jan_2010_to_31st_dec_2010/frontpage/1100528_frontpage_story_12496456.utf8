The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ghost unit spiced up Kargil lies   Fictitious formation to belittle officer
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ghost unit spiced up Kargil lies     -  Fictitious formation to belittle officer
          SUJAN DUTTA                                                 
	New Delhi, May 27: The military tribunals judgment for a rewriting of the armys official history of the Kargil war has thrown up questions on generalship during the conflict, especially after it was found that a general established a fictitious formation  a ghost brigade  up front to devalue the role of Brigadier Devinder Singh.        
	It is ironical  maybe even fitting  that a ghost brigade should resurrect the ghosts of the Kargil war to haunt the armys generals and their political masters over a decade after the hostilities.        
	Devinder Singh, the now-retired brigadier, commanded the 70 Infantry Brigade in the tough Batalik sector with some of the most forbidding heights. The landmark judgment of the Armed Forces Tribunal is a belated restoration of his military reputation as a soldier after an 11-year-long battle, more bitter than any that he led in the war itself.        
	But the documents presented during the proceedings that finally convinced the tribunal, comprising former Supreme Court judge A.K. Mathur and former vice-chief of the army Lt Gen. Milan Naidu, show just how generals pulled rank to mask their own failures and pass the buck on field commanders like Devinder Singh.        
	More questions are likely to be thrown up when the petition of Brigadier Surinder Singh, who commanded the 121 Kargil-based brigade and was sacked in the middle of the hostilities, is heard.         
	This afternoon, Brigadier Surinder Singh told The Telegraph that his tell-all book would be published shortly. He has detailed his communications with his superiors and with higher headquarters in his account.        
	But there is a difference in the way the generals treated Surinder Singh and Devinder Singh. Devinder Singh was denied credit for his leadership and personal example.        
	Surinder Singh alleges he was discredited and made a scapegoat on charges of having allowed the intrusions by Pakistan Army regulars and irregulars in his sector to build up.        
	Surinder Singhs case is yet to be disposed of. But Devinder Singhs case illustrates just how far superiors can go to doctor accounts.        
	In his reports on the war, Devinder Singhs (15) corps commander, Lt Gen. (also retired) Kishan Pal, stated categorically that success in operations, particularly in the last 10-12 days came about by superimposing Brigadier Ashok Duggal, deputy general officer commanding 3 Infantry Division, who positioned himself at Ganasok (up front) and helped in conduct of operations.        
	Pals doctored battle performance report on Devinder Singh was approved by the then Northern Army commander, Lt Gen. H.M. Khanna, without any questioning, and passed on to the Military Operations Directorate in Army Headquarters then headed by Lt Gen. N.C. Vij who reported to the then chief, Gen. Ved Prakash Malik.        
	Pals report was designed to give the impression that Duggal had established a new brigade headquarters and was commanding it from the eastern flank of the sector. In reality, Devinder Singh was actually on the western flank, executing diversionary tactics before launching a major attack on the heights from three directions.        
	The government was forced to set aside this battle performance report by Lt Gen. Pal because not only Devinder Singhs battalion commanders but also the Colonel General Staff of his higher (3 Infantry Division) headquarters  and Duggals and Pals junior  denied that Duggal was in charge.        
	In his affidavit, the Colonel GS, Col. Avtar Singh (also retired), said he was fully conversant with the operational and all other aspects of the operations that took place in the Batalik sector from May 8 to August 9, 1999.        
	He added that Brigadier Devinder Singh commanded and controlled the entire operations in the Batalik sector solely and exclusively and that at no stage did the command and control ever change or devolve on any other individual other than him. This pertains to both the western and eastern flanks.        
	Avtar Singh said Brigadier Duggal was asked to be in the Batalik sector for just 72 hours from July 1 to July 4 1999 as the divisional representative for the largescale operations of the 70 Infantry Brigade (being conducted by Brigadier Devinder Singh) and specifically to oversee the functioning of the LSA (logistic support area) set up by headquarters of 3 Infantry Division in support of the operations of 70 Infantry Brigade.         
	This forward positioning of a representative of the higher headquarters in the remote sector of the lower formation often happens in war to facilitate interaction and timely support.        
	Lt Gen. Pal was actually saying that Brigadier Duggal had achieved in just 72 hours what took the Indian Army 80 days to accomplish!        
	It was this LSA that was being passed off as the ghost of a brigade and that was later used by Devinder Singhs superiors to deny him his due.

	Mumbai, Aug 25 (PTI): City police, awaiting the custody of four foreigners detained in Dubai for allegedly stealing diamonds worth nearly Rs 6.6 crore from an exhibition here, are probing if the accused had any Indian accomplices.
    Such a meticulously planned theft could not be possible without the help of local hand and we are trying to find out if the accused had received help from anybody here, police said.
    "No doubt that they (accused) had conducted reccee before striking. They waited till the last day of the show and then decamped with the diamonds. It was meticulously planned. It appears that they were provided assistance from one or more Indians...," said a senior crime branch official.
    "Since we are yet to get the custody of the accused, at present we are focusing on to uncover the help of locals, if there was any," the official added.

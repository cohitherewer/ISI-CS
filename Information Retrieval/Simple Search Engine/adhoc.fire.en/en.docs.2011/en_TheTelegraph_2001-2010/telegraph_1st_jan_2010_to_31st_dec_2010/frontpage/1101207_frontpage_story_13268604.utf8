The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | French seek nuke liability clarity
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                French seek nuke liability clarity
          OUR BUREAU                       Areva CEO Anne Lauvergeon                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: The French company Areva which signed a 7-billion-euro deal with India to set up two nuclear reactors and supply uranium today said it wanted more clarity on Indias nuclear liability laws but asserted that liability would not be a deal breaker.         
	It is very important for us to know the rules of implementation (of the liability law)... and the responsibility of suppliers after years and years of operations after the start of a nuclear power plant, said Anne Lauvergeon, chief executive officer of Areva.         
	Indias Nuclear Power Corporation (NPC) has earmarked Jaitapur, a coastal site in western India, for six of Arevas 1650MW nuclear power reactors. Each of these reactors would have thrice the installed capacity of Indias largest indigenous 540MW reactors.         
	An agreement for two of Arevas European pressurised reactors (EPR) for Jaitapur was signed between Areva and the NPC on the sidelines of the talks between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy.         
	The liability bill passed by Parliament in August gives the right to NPC to seek damages from suppliers if there is a nuclear accident. India is the only country with such a provision that was introduced after a political debate. Nuclear sector analysts have cautioned in the past that a law that imposes liability on suppliers would deter suppliers.         
	Asked whether Indias liability law would prove to be a deal breaker, Lauvergeon replied in the negative. It is not a deal breaker, she said, adding that Areva was looking forward to start the first nuclear power plant at Jaitapur in 2018.         
	Arevas EPR has a 60-year life and the French company has assured India the supply of uranium fuel for the lifetime of the reactor. We have our own (uranium) mines. We can give such a guarantee, Philippe Knoche, the companys executive vice-president for reactors and services said. Areva owns or controls mines in Canada, Kazakhstan and Niger.         
	Areva is also building 1,650MW reactors in Finland, France and China. The first such reactor is expected to become operational in Finland in 2013  four years beyond its original schedule.         
	The company has said its project in Finland was initiated after a decade of nuclear de-industrialisation and loss of associated skills in Europe. Areva had to train personnel and develop the supply chain  often from scratch, it said.         
	No matter whatever happens, we are going to deliver uranium to the NPC for lifetime (of the reactor)... whatever the bilateral or political situation there may be, Lauvergeon said today.         
	Lauvergeon said there were still some pending issues with the NPC on the financing scheme for the deal and finalising the banks for this purpose. We also need to do some finetuning on interest rates for the deal, she said.         
	Regarding work on the remaining four EPRs at Jaitapur, she said the pace of the project has to be decided by the NPC, but she would like work to begin on a new reactor every one or two years.         
	The NPC is hoping that a number of Indian private and public sector companies that have supplied engineering components to Indias own nuclear reactors would also contribute to Arevas reactors.         
	Arevas CEO today appeared to echo that view. Lauvergeon said she would like the EPR to evolve as an Indian reactor and not as a foreign technology.

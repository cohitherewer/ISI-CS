The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | China strategist bar lifts

  - Maverick academic invited to Delhi defence event          SUJAN DUTTA                            Shen Dingli                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: India has quietly lifted a bar on visits by Chinese defence officials and strategists that it had imposed since July after Beijing refused a visa to northern army commander Lt Gen. B.S. Jaswal.        
	Shen Dingli, a professor and a top strategist who advocates that China should set up military bases in Pakistan  a worrisome scenario for Indias defence planners  is scheduled to give a lecture during the two-day golden jubilee celebrations of the National Defence College (NDC) here from tomorrow.        
	The NDC is Indias top military institution that runs year-long courses for policy makers (of brigadier and equivalent rank) from the armed forces and the civil services and counts among its alumni such rulers as the king of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk, and Gen. H.M. Ershad, the former President of Bangladesh.        
	After Beijing refused a visa to Lt Gen. Jaswal, India also kept in abeyance the proposal to induct two Chinese military officers in the latest course of the NDC.        
	The golden jubilee celebrations at the brand new Sam Manekshaw Centre in Delhi Cantonment will be opened by President Pratibha Patil and will be concluded by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday.        
	A physicist by training, Shen Dingli is professor and executive vice-dean of the Institute of International Affairs at Fudan University, Shanghai, and director of its Centre for American Studies.        
	To my knowledge he is also a (Chinese Communist) party member, says Shrikant Kondapalli, professor of Chinese Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University who says he has interacted with Shen for close to 20 years.                    
	Kondapalli said Shen was a bit of a maverick. The Chinese military detests him because he is too bold in expressing his views. He has said at several conferences, even inside China, that China has supplied nuclear and ballistic missile technology to Pakistan. Officially, Beijing denies such a role.        
	This means, Shen has obliquely said that China has proliferated. Ironically, in the NDC golden jubilee seminar on the role of force in strategic affairs, Shen will be speaking on nuclear deterrence in the Chinese context in the session Nuclear deterrence today.        
	Then, in January this year, on the official Chinese government portal, Shen again went against the official line from Beijing and advocated that China should set up military bases overseas just like the Americans, the British and the French have done.        
	The article raised immediate concerns in the strategic establishment in New Delhi. China is deeply committed to developing the Gwadar Port near Karachi in Pakistan. Gwadar sits on the Straits of Hormuz, the waterway through which much of Indias oil supplies from the Gulf comes.        
	China needs to enhance the power in safeguarding our overseas interests. And the power should be comprehensive enough to demonstrate our political, economic and military forces. As for the military aspect, we should be able to conduct the retaliatory attack within the country or at the neighbouring area of our potential enemies. We should also be able to put pressure on the potential enemies overseas interests, Shen argued in a paper titled Dont shun the idea of setting up overseas military bases.        
	Shen does not represent nor does he claim to represent  the Chinese government. But his views are heard for the Chinese perspective to be interpreted in international fora often because independent academic voices from China on military and strategic issues are rare.        
	More than 60 foreign alumni from 20 countries are visiting the NDC for the celebrations. Among them are Bhutans king, who is the chief guest, Ershad, the chiefs of the Sri Lankan army, navy and air force, the Nepalese army chief, and the chiefs of the Indonesian and Nigerian air forces.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CM Soren feels trustworthy 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CM Soren feels trustworthy 
  - Cong-JVM vow to make it tough for JMM-BJP in Assembly        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                     
	Ranchi, Jan. 6: With the numbers in his kitty, Shibu Soren looks set to sail through tomorrows vote of confidence in the Assembly, but the Congress-JVM Opposition indicated it would go all out to embarrass the JMM-BJP government by exposing the opportunistic alliance.        
	On a day when C.P. Singh of the BJP was elected Assembly Speaker, Soren looked unperturbed and confident knowing his coalition had the support of 45 MLAs in the House of 81.        
	There is no hitch. We will prove our majority on the floor of the House comfortably, Soren said, after chairing a meeting of JMM MLAs at his office in the Assembly.         
	But the JVM seemed determined to make it unpleasant, if not difficult, for him and his government. Well use the occasion to expose the BJP and JMMs unholy alliance, sealed solely to satisfy their lust for power, said JVM legislature party leader Pradeep Yadav.        
	The BJP, he recalled, had stalled Parliament in 2004 demanding Sorens sacking from the Union Cabinet. The same BJP now finds Soren a clean man. The BJP will have to answer, he added.         
	The JVM leader maintained that former BJP president Rajnath Singh had agreed to launching full-scale action against Naxalites, and the party had even adopted a resolution favouring the use of force against the rebels citing Andhra Pradesh at its Lucknow national executive in 2007.         
	The BJP was now singing paeans to Soren, who is inviting Maoists for talks. Both parties have struck a deal to stop Operation Greenhunt, Yadav alleged.         
	Congress legislature party leader Rajendra Prasad Singh agreed with his ally, saying the party would hold a mirror to expose the ruling parties and their inner contradictions.         
	RJD legislature party leader Annapurna Devi said they would oppose the trust vote.         
	However, we are committed to supporting any decision which the government may take in the states interests, she maintained.         
	Unruffled, both the JMM and the BJP maintained they were confident of sailing through the trust vote.         
	There should be no difficulty in gaining the trust of the House to run the government, said JMM legislature party leader Hemant Soren.         
	Apart from BJP, JMM and Ajsu MLAs, we will be getting the support of at least three others  Bandhu Tirkey, Videsh Singh and Chamra Linda, he said, adding a whip had been issued to all supporting MLAs to be present in the House during voting.         
	Later in the evening, JMM MLAs met for dinner at Nalin Sorens residence.         
	BJP legislature party leader Raghubar Das was confident, too, and ruled out any possibility of cross voting.        
	Jagannathpur MLA and former chief minister Madhu Kodas wife Geeta has declared she would remain neutral  meaning, she would abstain  while Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai, two MLAs in jail fighting corruption charges, were yet to be sworn in.        
	MCC MLA Arup Chatterjee said he was out of station, and was likely to take oath on January 8. I will vote against the government if I reach Ranchi tomorrow, he said.

	Canberra, July 25 (Reuters): Both sides of Australian politics committed to cut immigration numbers on Sunday, angering business, as the campaign for the August 21 election enters its second week.        
	Opposition leader Tony Abbott promised to curb the immigration intake from 3,00,000 people a year last year to around 1,70,000 a year, and to ensure population growth slows to around 1.4 per cent from more than 2 per cent.        
	What we would do is manage the programme to bring it down to what we think are sustainable long-term numbers, Abbott told reporters on Sunday.        
	But the government hit back and said the immigration intake was already falling to around 2,30,000 people this year due to a crackdown on student and temporary work visas, and would fall further to around 1,45,000 people by 2012.        
	All that he has done is look at the projection for the following year, claimed that it is his own policy and thought he could get away with fooling the Australian people, population minister Tony Burke told reporters.        
	Australia is going through an immigration boom as it seeks skilled workers in a tight labour market. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd had championed population growth from about 22 million to 36 million by 2050.        
	But the move had upset many people in crowded outer suburbs around the biggest cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, where government services are struggling to keep up with the growth.

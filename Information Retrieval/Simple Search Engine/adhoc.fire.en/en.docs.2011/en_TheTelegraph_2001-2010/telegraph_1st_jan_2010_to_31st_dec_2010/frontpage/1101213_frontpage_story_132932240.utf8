	Kolkata, Dec 13 (PTI): A bomb threat call today threw authorities into a tizzy at the G D Birla School .
    The management immediately informed the police while the school complex was evacuated after the anonymous caller warned that a bomb was planted in the building but disconnected the line thereafter, officials said.
    Police said a bomb squad went to the spot along with sniffer dogs and conducted a search operation, but nothing has been found as yet.
    All the students were safely brought out and anxious parents assembled near the school at Ranikuthi under Jadavpur police station area, police said.

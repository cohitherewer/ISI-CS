          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                    Modak in hospital.   Picture by Naeem Ansari       
	Varanasi, Dec. 8: Gopal Modak, 45, was at his stall selling jhal muri, as he has done for a decade since he moved here from Midnapore, when the bomb went off at Sitala Ghat last evening.         
	He was lying on bed No. 10 at Shivprakash Gupta hospital today with injuries to his left leg, waist and right hand and unable to see with his right eye. He has also suffered hearing impairment.        
	We searched him out from a cloud of smoke that engulfed the area. He was lying unconscious, said his wife Alka, 33.         
	The couple and their 11-year-old daughter live at Munshighat, an old Bengali settlement with over 2,000 families from the state. It used to be called Bengali tola, said Modak.         
	My small jhal muri outlet was fixed on the wall between Sitala Ghat and Dashashwamedh Ghat. I was serving muri to tourists One foreigner who bought the jhal muri thanked me for this spicy taste of India, he said.         
	Plainclothes policemen came and looked around the area and left about an hour before the blast, Modak said, adding there are frequent checks by bomb squad sleuths at the ghats. The cops would often tell me to keep a lookout for miscreants, he said.         
	Business at the stall is double on Tuesdays, the day of the biggest Ganga Aarti. By 5pm, with half an hour still to go for the aarti to begin, at least 500 people had gathered and more were coming.        
	It was a normal aarti evening. I could see at least 70 of the 84 ghats busy conducting the evening aarti, Modak said. Around 6.30pm, the pilgrims were descending the steps to get near the aartis flames as it came to a close.        
	That is when the bomb went off. I was on the other side of the wall. Had I not ducked closer to the wall, my body would have been torn apart like the rubble from the concrete. I saw small pieces of concrete flying around, Modak shuddered.         
	As I lay bleeding, I could see hundreds of legs running over my shop. The muri, masala and the vegetable containers were overturned. I fainted soon after, he said. I have lost everything.         
	The doctor attending to Modak, Ritwick Sharma, said he might need a small operation on his eye.         
	On a nearby bed, Devkant Maharaj, 75, lay with head injuries. Hailing from Samastipur in Bihar, he had come for the aarti after praying at the Sankatmochan temple.         
	Prasad and Premlata Verma, a couple from Patna, also suffered head injuries. They had come to pray at Vindhyachal temple. Before returning home, we thought we would watch the aarti. But this is what was in store for us, Prasad said.         
	Most of the 45 injured were local residents or from Bihar, one was from Bengal and four were foreigners.

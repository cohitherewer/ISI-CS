                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Zeta-Jones stands up for the older man
          TIM WALKER                            Real softie                                  
	London, Jan. 9: Filmmaker Sam Taylor-Wood, 42, is expecting a baby with her 19-year-old fianc and Madonna, 51, is enjoying a romance with a model called Jesus Luz aged 22, but Catherine Zeta-Jones is prepared to stick with an older man.        
	 I know that young men are more unbiased, playful and firmer, says the 40-year-old wife of Michael Douglas, 65. Theres no question about that, but they are also more selfish and narcissistic. This is why they never had a chance to go out with me.        
	Of Douglas, she says: He knows exactly what he wants and what life is about. That impresses me, but Michael can also be a real softie. He sends me flowers and cries when his kids say something particularly pathetic.        
	I need a man who is sensitive and caring. Someone who is superior to me and I can lean on. But that doesnt mean not that I fancy old and fat men, she added.         
	The mother-of-two, who married Douglas in 2000, believes the Oscar-winning actor is her ideal man and has never worried about the 25-year age gap between them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Slap in Debs face as Manab returns plot 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Slap in Debs face as Manab returns plot 
          OUR BUREAU                             Manab, Gautam                          
	Calcutta, Aug. 26: Bengal tourism minister Manab Mukherjee has returned a plot allotted to his wife from the Hidco chairmans quota in Rajarhat, underscoring the misgivings within the CPM over a fresh land controversy that has erupted around housing minister Gautam Deb.        
	Deb, whose wife was also allotted land, has refused to emulate Mukherjee. The diverse responses of the two ministers suggest that not all in the party have endorsed the housing ministers defence.        
	CPM sources told The Telegraph that Mukherjees gesture signalled a public rebuff from the party to Deb who doubles as Hidco chairman.        
	Mukherjee has given back to Hidco a four-cottah plot allotted to his wife Ishita, a professor of economics in Calcutta University, through a draw of lots.        
	I know for sure that there was nothing illegal in the allotment of the plot to my wife. But as we want to steer clear of any controversy, we have sent a letter to the Hidco authorities informing them of our decision to return the plot, Mukherjee said.         
	But Deb said that his wife Debjani Sengupta, a professor of sociology in Kalyani University, would not return the 4.5-cottah plot allotted to her. The question of returning the plot does not arise at all because my wife got it through lottery to construct a house, he said.         
	Manab telephoned me this morning to return the land allotted to his wife in order to steer clear of the ongoing controversy centring on the Hidco land distribution by me, Deb added.        
	A senior CPM leader admitted that the divergent responses of Mukherjee and Deb and the possible impact on the partys rank and file had become a talking point in the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street. The chances of Opposition parties playing up the issue also came up for discussion, the sources said.         
	The process of allotment of 294 plots from the chairmans quota and 184 plots from a one-time special quota has come under the partys scanner as Deb, being the chairman of the agency, had the power to decide on allotments.         
	There was no irregularity in the allotment process, Deb has repeatedly stressed.         
	His party colleagues, however, are not convinced. Several CPM leaders have started questioning the process of land allotment in Rajarhats New Town, which Deb christened Jyoti Basu Nagar yesterday.         
	A similar controversy had haunted the late Basu, once considered Debs mentor, over the allotment of plots in Salt Lake from the chief ministers quota and the matter had reached the Supreme Court. Dealing a blow to the state government, the apex court in 2004 overturned the allotment of a four-cottah plot in FD block to a judge.        
	Although the Rajarhat land row has not yet reached the courts, it has already ruffled the party. Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, whose name cropped up during the Vedic Village controversy, was the first to come up with a jibe at Deb.         
	We have been passing through a hard time in the past few years because of successive poll reverses. The present controversy over the Hidco land distribution would show us in a poor light, said Mollah.         
	It is an open secret in the party that Mollah and Deb do not share a cordial relationship. But it is not only Mollah or his followers in the partys South 24-Parganas unit who are raising questions about the land allotment and the functioning of Hidco.

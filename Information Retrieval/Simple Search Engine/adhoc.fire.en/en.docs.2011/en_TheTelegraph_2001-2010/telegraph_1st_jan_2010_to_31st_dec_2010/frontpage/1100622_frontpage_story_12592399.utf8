                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Liz, alls forgiven
  - Royalty relents before celebrity          AMIT ROY AND RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                            Hurley in Mumbai                                        
	June 21: Gaj Singh of Jodhpur appears to have surprised seasoned observers of the international social circuit by inviting British actress Liz Hurley as a personal guest to one of his charity banquets.        
	Liz (who prefers to be addressed by the more formal Elizabeth) and her businessman husband Arun Nayar were guests at a fundraising dinner in Mumbai held last week for a cause close to the erstwhile Maharajas heart: the Indian Head Injury Foundation.        
	What appears to have caught the eyes of the social jury more than the lovely Liz  the first from the celeb stable that is famous for being famous  was a little detail. The same Liz had skipped a dinner the Maharaja hosted in London last year for the same cause.        
	The foundation was set up when Gaj Singhs son, Shivraj, went into a coma after an accident on the Rambagh polo ground in 2005. Shivraj has recovered and is scheduled to marry Princess Gayatri of Uttarakhand on November 18 this year.        
	Lizs conspicuous no-show then and the appearance now have prompted suggestions in the British media that she is back in the good books of the Maharaja, a deduction that has been backed up by the assertion that she sat next to the Maharaja at the dinner in Mumbai.        
	However, those with one eye on the social register and the other on history have suggested that the Maharaja should not have forgiven Liz in such a hurry, especially considering the way Jodhpur had once stood up to invaders and the likes.        
	The Maharaja should not have rolled out the red carpet for Liz after she did not turn up for the London event. What does it speak of the regal Rajasthani tradition? asked a person who is well-versed in such matters, the question popped only half in jest.        
	After all, other than a few films, her biggest celeb quotient is that she is the former girlfriend of an actor (Hugh Grant), the social observer added.        
	A British paper helpfully pointed out that the Maharaja generously hosted the models second wedding reception, at the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, in 2007.        
	Strictly speaking, Gaj Singh did not host Lizs wedding extravaganza during which everyone, including members of the resident royal family, were banned from using mobile phones within the palace precincts. Umaid Bhawan was hired on a commercial basis.        
	Cameras and phones were prohibited to ensure no photographs leaked out and undermined Lizs reported 2-million exclusive picture deal with a magazine.         
	The Maharaja absented himself during the event but Nayars father, Vinod, who lives in Mumbai, was unwise enough to take out his camera and was immediately ejected from his own sons wedding by his no-nonsense new daughter-in-law.        
	But an invitee who attended the Mumbai event defended Gaj Singh as well as Liz. The Maharaja was delighted that Liz had come and certainly did not think that she could be placed in the same category as the wives and girlfriends of British footballers who tend to teeter around in micro skirts and high heels, he said.        
	Kabir Bedi, the actor who compered Fridays banquet and attended with his British Asian girlfriend, Parveen Dusanj, reacted angrily to suggestions that Liz was an inappropriate guest at such an exclusive event. Those who say she lowered the tone of the event are being downright snobbish, snapped Bedi.        
	The actor told The Telegraph: She flew from LA to support the evening. She met the Maharaja at her wedding and they have been friends since.        
	Gaj Singh, accompanied by his wife, Hemlata Rajye, posed for a photograph with Liz and Arun, and Bedi and his girlfriend. An estimated 320 guests, among them industrialist Adi Godrej, graced the occasion.         
	 Bedi also expressed appreciation for the HDFC chairman, Deepak Parekh, and his wife, Smita, who co-hosted the evening. Most people were invited by them but Liz was the Maharajas guest.        
	I dont know how much but we raised a lot of money, said Bedi. There were silent auctions  there was one for a Nano signed by Ratan Tata. A Bernini designer bag alone raised Rs 25 lakh.        
	Bedi emphasised that Gaj Singh was committed to helping all Indians who had suffered head injuries. His son was wearing the right kit, helmet and so, but during the polo match, the horse fell on top of him. With the help of (a hospital) group, he now wants to set up the right treatment in hospitals in India.        
	Conspicuous by his absence was the British Indian financier, Deepak Kuntawala, who had attended the Maharajas dinner in London last year and caused a stir with some generous bidding for tickets to the premiere of Avatar. Kuntawala also claimed that he had personally rescued 150 guests from the burning Taj on the night of 26/11. Later, he admitted he had not rescued anyone but had fled the hotel with his elderly father.        
	Asked if Kuntawala had been invited, Bedi replied: I should hope not!

          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Dec. 14: Call it coincidence if you like, but it was just like Richard Holbrooke to have been in the care of a Pakistani doctor during his final days at the George Washington University Hospital here.        
	Holbrooke died last night after a 21-hour unsuccessful heart surgery for a torn aorta. He was 69.        
	In the last nearly two years of his eventful life, Holbrooke was consumed by Pakistan. In his special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, US President Barack Obama had someone who sneered at the idea of a half-way house.        
	Holbrooke wanted to transform Afghanistan and Pakistan from failed states into robust outposts that would anchor American interests in South Asia.        
	Had he lived for the remaining two years of Obamas presidency, the man whose style earned him sobriquets such as the bulldozer, may have travelled a considerable distance along that road with its inevitable impact on India.        
	J.N. Dixit, who was Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs first national security adviser, said in his last conversation with this correspondent that in six months, India and Pakistan would reach a solution on Kashmir. But three months after that conversation, Dixit was gone, leaving behind absolutely nothing on paper about what he was working on.        
	Nearly six years after Dixits death, another brilliant diplomat, this time an American who had a clear vision of what South Asia should look like  whether one liked it or not  is gone.        
	His departure is truly  at the risk of using a clich  a tragedy for Obamas South Asia policy.        
	After several false starts towards creating a recipe for the complex problems of the region during much of the two years of this presidency, clarity was finally emerging in Washington, with Holbrooke winning treacherous battles for control of how to deal with Obamas most important strategic priority.        
	Obamas visit to New Delhi had cemented the direction of this policy and Holbrooke was to build on it. But now he is gone, and once again, there are wide open questions about what to do with Afghanistan, Pakistan and by way of a consequential spillover, how to fit India into this conundrum.        
	Indias relations with Holbrooke were testy or worse to begin with. Indeed, predictably so even before he was formally appointed as Obamas special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the early decisions made by this President.        
	It is a tribute to Holbrookes qualities as a diplomat, to his understanding of realpolitik  and to Indian diplomacys relatively new willingness to identify its core interests  that by the time Holbrooke died, his office and New Delhis key men dealing with Kabul and Islamabad had created an unprecedented and wide-ranging dialogue on Afghanistan.                                                  
	S.K. Lambah, the Prime Ministers special envoy for Afghanistan and back channel to Pakistan came to Washington in July for talks with the Americans for what was a new start, as Holbrooke belatedly took effective control of what is known here as Obamas Af-Pak strategy. Lambah was here again last week, this time with institutional backing from South Block.        
	Holbrookes demise does not damage this process, but raises question marks about its effectiveness.        
	As about the only American diplomat  with the exception of Henry Kissinger  who has been an editor, academic, development official, author and investment banker, Holbrooke respected depth, range and vision both in his interlocutors and adversaries.        
	He reached out to foreign secretary Nirupama Rao every time she was in New York or Washington and their lively sparring is testified to by officials present on both sides.        
	When Lambah came to Washington in July, Holbrooke was still haunted by shadows of his failed plans for regime change in Kabul through the backdoor. His failed plan was to replace President Hamid Karzai with former World Bank official, Ashraf Ghani, who was Washingtons first choice, and later with Abdullah Abdullah, a former foreign minister.        
	A key conspirator in this plot was Peter Galbraith, the UNs second ranking representative in Kabul during the elections in which the US orchestrated a campaign against Karzai, accusing him of fraud.        
	UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon appointed Galbraith in Kabul on the express recommendation of Holbrooke. Karzai got the better of the Americans and managed to retain power.        
	By the time Lambah arrived in Washington, Holbrooke was reconciled to dealing with Karzai in his new term as President, but Washington kept harping about corruption and lack of democracy in Karzais Afghanistan.        
	Lambah had one question to which no one in Holbrookes team had an answer. Why were the Americans harping on democracy and corruption in Kabul when they were willing to put up with similar failings in the entire region  in Pakistan and in every single -stan in Central Asia?        
	The Pentagon is in bed with dictators in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, they are bending over backwards to protect their oil and gas interests in Turkmenistan, so why this public fuss about Karzai alone?        
	Holbrooke had great admiration for people who put pragmatism above everything else and he was one to set policy goals and doggedly toil to achieve them.        
	This was one of several episodes in Holbrookes recent engagement of India which changed Indo-US equations on Afghanistan and laid the foundation for Holbrookes work with New Delhi which could have been.        
	During the last US presidential primaries, Holbrooke threw his lot with Hillary Clinton and was mentioned as possible secretary of state in a Clinton administration. When she became secretary of state instead, Holbrooke was chosen for the most sensitive diplomatic job in the Obama administration.        
	But Holbrookes heart was on an expanded South Asia portfolio: deep down he hoped to repeat his biggest success as a diplomat in ending the war in the Balkans by trying his hand at resolving Kashmir.        
	The then Indian ambassador in Washington, Ronen Sen, told President-elect Obamas transition team in Chicago that appointing Holbrooke as a special envoy to South Asia, including Kashmir, would be a non-starter.        
	Lambah, who attended a Track II Indo-US meeting during the transition said what Sen could not put in black and white owing to diplomatic correctness. Lambah said Holbrooke would be denied an Indian visa if he were to meddle in Kashmir.        
	Holbrooke believed till the end that there could be no solution to the problems in Af-Pak without including India. But it is a tribute to the man that he and Lambah became friends and created a working relationship. The question is whether that relationship will endure with Holbrookes successor.

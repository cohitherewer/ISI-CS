  - Only Messi can make it to Cups Top 5                       
	Fifas World Cup circus came to town with Leo Messi, Kaka, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Didier Drogba as the star attractions. Top billing. Masters of the universe. Supermen for a super tournament.        
	All, with the exception of Messi, have catapulted down in less than a month to the status of super flops, to one degree or another.        
	Messi was in a class of his own in Argentinas progress to the quarter-finals. Then, against a far superior German team, he played as well as he was allowed by opposition tactics and his own team-mates inability to play, well, as a team in support.                        Mesut Ozil, Thomas Mueller      
	He can remain up there. Status quo. But the other four vacancies in the top five might more notably be filled, after their performances in South Africa, by Germanys Thomas Mueller and Mesut Ozil, Japans Keisuke Honda and Hollands Wesley Sneijder.        
	Mueller, 20, has been the greatest revelation. He was a new, young, bit-part player this past season with Bayern Munich who came ever more into his own during their march to the Champions League final defeat by Italys Internazionale. He has the build and power of a centre-forward but the pace and passing vision of an old-fashioned attacking winger. He made a goal-scoring impact in the opening 4-0 thrashing of Australia, then scored twice more and added an assist in the second-round dismissal of England.        
	Again, in the quarter-finals, his electric pace and fearless, knife-through-butter style frightened the wits out of Argentina. He scored again but, regrettably, collected his second yellow card of the tournament, which rules him out of the eagerly awaited Durban semi-final against Spain.         
	Fans can hardly wait to see more of Mueller, either in the final or the third-place play-off and certainly as a main player in the Champions League and Bundesliga next term.        
	Outstanding in support of Mueller has been team-mate Ozil, from Werder Bremen. England hate the sight of him. Ozil sparked their 4-0 defeat in the 2008 European under-21 final and then contributed mightily to their downfall in Bloemfontein. His roving role at the apex of Germanys midfield diamond also brought him a decisive goal against Ghana in the group and accolades for his maturity against Argentina.        
	Not that Germany have monopolised the new talent. Honda made a greater impact on the World Cup finals than any individual Japanese player up to now, proving that he can play effectively and aggressively as both striker and attacking midfielder and also that he can hit a free kick with a Beckham-like whip and control.                      
	How long CSKA Moscow can hold him is another matter: even before the World Cup he was enhancing his value in becoming the first Japanese player to appear in the Champions League quarter-finals and the first one to score in the competitions knockout stages.        
	Finally, Sneijder might seem a contentious addition to the list of candidates for superstar progression: he is, after all, now 26 and made his debut for Holland at 18 back in 2003. He has been in and around the international scene for seven years.        
	But this is the moment when Sneijder has stepped up from being potential to being a power. He was outstanding in Inters Champions League victory  both in the campaign and in the final dismissal of Bayern  and has risen head and shoulders above his Dutch team-mates here in South Africa.        
	Suddenly, Sneijder is not only contributing along with the rest but commanding the midfield and contributing crucial goals such as those in the group stage against Japan, in the second round against Slovakia and  most notably  the two with which Holland beat Brazil in the quarter-finals.        
	Mueller, Ozil and Sneijder may yet enhance their reputations in this remaining week of competition.        
	As for Kaka, Ronaldo, Rooney and Drogba, they risk joining World Cup mascot Zakumi. Suddenly the little leopards World Cup merchandise is all in the bargain basement.

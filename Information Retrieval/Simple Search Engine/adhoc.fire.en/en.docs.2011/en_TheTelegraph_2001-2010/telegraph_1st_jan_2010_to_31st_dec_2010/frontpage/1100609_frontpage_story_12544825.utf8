          SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRA BISWAS                               
	Ranchi, June 8: The BJP, despite being on a sticky wicket, has not given up all hope.         
	BJP nominee Ajay Maroo today called on JVM chief Babulal Marandi, seeking his partys support for the June 17 Rajya Sabha elections. He requested Marandi to ask his 11 legislators to at least cast the second preference votes, if not the first, in his favour.         
	Marandi, however, told The Telegraph that he had expressed his inability to oblige the BJP nominee, as Dheeraj Prasad Sahu was the joint nominee of the Congress and the JVM. But the former chief minister gave some tips to Maroo so that the latter could turn the tables on JMM nominee Kanwar Deep Singh. The BJP-JD(U) has 20 MLAs in the House.        
	Meanwhile, Left parties today alleged that the Election Commission of India had failed in its duty to check corruption and to ensure free and fair polls in Jharkhand.        
	In a representation sent to the chief election commissioner in New Delhi, leaders from the CPM, CPI, Forward Bloc, RSP and Marxist Coordination Committee said for the elections to the two Rajya Sabha seats, huge amount of money was being spent by some candidates to buy votes.         
	Elections for the two Rajya Sabha seats are slated for June 17. Three candidates are in the fray  Dheeraj Sahu of the Congress, JMMs Singh and BJPs Maroo.        
	The representation, signed by CPM state secretary, J.S. Majumdar, added that the chief electoral officer in Jharkhand was aware of the developments. Requesting immediate intervention, Left leaders demanded that the Election Commission take suo motu notice of media reports, file an FIR against all those indulging in corrupt practices and ensure free and fair Rajya Sabha polls in Jharkhand.        
	The CPI(ML) declared that its lone MLA, Vinod Singh, would boycott the Rajya Sabha polls to register the partys protest against widespread use of money by some candidates to buy MLAs.        
	Meanwhile, Jharkhand Alternate Development Forum, a body of intellectuals headed by Ram Dayal Munda, today appealed to all MLAs not to allow themselves to be bought or sold and resist attempts by outsider candidates to be elected to the Rajya Sabha from Jharkhand.

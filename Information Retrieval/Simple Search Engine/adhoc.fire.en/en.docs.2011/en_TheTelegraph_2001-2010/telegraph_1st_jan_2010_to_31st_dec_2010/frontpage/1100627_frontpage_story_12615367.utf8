	Ranchi, June 26: In a pre-dawn swoop, Khunti district police and CRPF arrested two Maoists, one of whom was wanted for several murders including that of JD(U) MLA Ramesh Singh Munda in 2008, and seized a huge cache of high quality explosives from Masanga forest, 40km from the district headquarters.        
	The two, arrested after policemen from Arki and two CRPF companies cordoned off the forest from opposite directions around 4am today, were identified as Santosh Munda, who was in police uniform, and Bipul Lohra.         
	Based in West Singhbhum, Santosh is sub-zonal commander of areas in Bundu, Tamar and Arki and looked after the operations of Kundan Pahan in the absence of the dreaded rebel zonal commander.         
	While Santosh was carrying a loaded double barrel rifle, bullets and a mobile phone with two SIM cards, Bipul had with him two can bombs and Maoist literature.         
	Based on their confessions, the police dug out 285 bars of plastic power gel explosives  labelled Indian Explosives Limited, Gomia  from a forest a km south of Pahans native village of Barigarha.        
	The explosives seem to be of very high quality. They were sufficient to make hundreds of can bombs, said Khunti SP Manoj Kaushik.        
	He said Santosh was involved in the 2008 killing of JD(U) legislator Ramesh Singh Munda who was gunned down in Bundu while presiding over a school function.        
	As the man in-charge of Pahans operations in his absence, Santosh was in our list of wanted Maoists, he said.        
	Kaushik said Santosh was also involved in several other killings and Maoist operations. He was involved in the abduction and murder of special branch inspector Francis Indwar, the killings of JD(U) worker Upendra Sah last year and Bhata Munda in 2008, the killing of a rural bank security guard in Arki and killing of four villagers in Poradih in Arki, he said.        
	Bipul is said to be an area commander operating in the Khunti-Arki zone.        
	During questioning, the rebels led the police to the house of one Jeetlal Ahir in Mosanga village from where they seized Rs 50,000, apparently collected as levy, receipt books marked Nari Mukti Sangathan, Maoist pamphlets and empty cans for making bombs.        
	According to sources, the police received a tip-off around midnight last night about a Maoists meeting to be held at Mosanga forest, 70km from the state capital.         
	The officers in charge of Arki police station, Anup Kumar Karmakar, and Murhu police station, Krishna Murari, headed for the area along with the district armed police and B and D companies of the CRPFs 94 batallion posted at Arki.

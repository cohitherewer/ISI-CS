          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                        
	Calcutta girls and rugby?        
	Yes, thats right. A gang of girls from town may even make it to the Asian Games, Chak De! India style.        
	The SAI Jungle Crows senior girls team are fresh from victory at the Indian National Rugby Sevens, played between games at the 2010 Asian five-nation international rugby competition in Delhi on June 5. Theres more. The clubs under-16 girls made their Games debut and managed to finish runners-up.        
	We are very excited. It was our first time at a national tournament but we were not at all nervous. Next year, we will come back with the Cup, smiled Tamalika Sarkar, 15, the captain of the junior girls team, after a Saturday friendly at the CC amp;FC.        
	As she called for her team-mates excitedly, the 5ft-something barely looked like she could take on a squad of 10. But once on the pitch, Tamalika and her team are no less than tigers  or rather, jungle crows.        
	So who are the Jungle Crows? Named after a common species of crows, this city-based rugby club was formed in 2004. We coach young people and run extensive rugby development programmes, sometimes providing educational support. The members are from regular families and they are all very interested in the game. The under-16 team was formed less than a year ago and they are already making us proud. In fact, the girls have surpassed the boys in performance, said a smiling Paul Walsh, the force behind the club.        
	The team too is all smiles as they catch up with their captain. Tackling is the best part about the game. The move that works best is grabbing the opponents knees. If the opponent is running fast, we get her around the ankles. We take out all the anger that is inside us on the opponents on the field, laughed Mitra Roy, 16, from the seniors team.        
	Here, look at this, said Tamalika, pointing to the injury marks on her chin. I took three stitches for this a month ago but I still love to play rugby.        
	Her mother, Joya Sarkar, standing close by and listening in, had a silent wish. My daughters are very keen to play the game despite their injuries. I wish more parents encouraged their daughters to play rugby see how well my daughters are faring! Football and cricket are very well publicised but more awareness and support are needed for rugby. Look at how much effort they put in, she said, proudly.        
	The girls start training from six every morning. Rugby requires a lot of physical stamina. The girls practise till 8.30am at SAI (Sports Authority of India) where they do long jump and 100m and 500m runs. In the evening, they go to the gym for leg squats and weight-lifting, said Sunny Singh  Sunny sir to the girls  and coach for the SAI Jungle Crows.        
	A daily dose of being teased does not deter these power-puff girls. The boys often tease us. They say youre like a guy but they stop there because they know I can take them down in a single move. Sometimes they ask me, do you work out? and I reply, Yes, cant you make out from the build of my body or do you want a demonstration? giggled Tamalika, her grey eyes lighting up.        
	Next up for the senior girls is the Indian National Womens Camp at Pune this month. Eight of them will participate in this camp of 24. From these 24, the best will be selected to play at the Asian Games, so they have a fair chance, says Walsh.        
	The girls at Jungle Crows are flying high but the sport itself is desperate for some wind beneath its wings. Rugby has changed over the years. It used to be a social game but now it is quite professional. We are on the lookout for sponsors, and we need more coaches to train the young ones, said Vece Paes, the president of the Bengal Rugby Association.        
	The scarcity of pitches is a big problem. There are only two rugby pitches, at SAI and CC amp;FC  we are thinking of approaching schools like St Thomas, La Martiniere and St James to use their fields after school. The good thing about rugby is that you dont need much equipment like other sports, only a ground, said Paes.        
	And the good thing about the Jungle Crows is that any ground for them can be a rugby ground.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rahul matinee show in Maya land
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rahul matinee show in Maya land
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                            Mayavati                                  
	Ambedkarnagar, April 14: The Congresss matinee idol was at work, and Mayavati didnt exactly enjoy the show.        
	Rahul Gandhi today took the battle for Dalit votes to a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) bastion in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress event followed by a rally a few furlongs away organised by the chief ministers party.        
	The public meetings  held within the space of only a few hours and on opposite sides of the airstrip where the Gandhi scion had landed  were held ostensibly to mark the 119th birth anniversary of Dalit icon B.R. Ambedkar.        
	When I began visiting Dalit homes (earlier) in rural Uttar Pradesh, I was ridiculed (by the BSP). Let me assure you I will continue to raise the issue of Dalits, Rahul told the two-lakh-strong gathering in this town near Faizabad in his speech. On the dais were Congress MPs Azharuddin and Raj Babbar, and actress Nagma.        
	Rahul, derisively referred to by some BSP leaders in the past as the Congresss matinee idol, had picked the venue with care: Ambedkarnagar has elected Mayavati a legislator thrice earlier and the BSP now has four MLAs. The Congress has no MLA from Ambedkarnagar, nor does it control or run a single panchayat in the area.        
	The ground was adorned with cutouts of Ambedkar, Rahul and Maulana Azad, the last an apparent bid to also woo the Muslims with whose support Mayavati had turned the area into a laboratory for her Dalit politics.        
	Rahul didnt forget to mention the recent controversy over Mayavatis cash garlands, tying the reference to his criticism of the state government for allegedly misusing central funds. I dont know where the crores of money being sent to the state goes... they dont reach Ambedkarnagar. They are gone into making currency garlands, Rahul, with a deadpan look, said, as bursts of laughter rippled through the crowd.        
	Mayavati, who didnt attend the BSP rally in Ambedkarnagar but addressed meetings elsewhere, hit back by telling a gathering in Lucknow that the Congress was trying to mislead Dalits. Later, she chose to use Ambedkars anniversary to declare she would continue her statue-building spree.         
	My government was constructing parks and memorials in the names of Dalit icons. No one can stop me taking up more such projects, she said, alluding to the row and court stays on the constructions, criticised for alleged waste of public funds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata pushes, Delhi parries
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mamata pushes, Delhi parries

	Oct. 6: Mamata Banerjee today said her party would hit the streets from tomorrow to seek the withdrawal of joint security forces from Jungle Mahal, a demand the Centre is not expected to concede as it is relishing a win-win situation.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief said her party MPs would stage a dharna in Delhi, if necessary.        
	 Mamata, who was speaking at a huge public meeting in Midnapore town where the chief minister had addressed a Left Front rally four days ago, based her demand on the allegation that the CPM is using the joint forces to recapture territory from Maoists.        
	The Trinamul charge is not without substance. But the home ministry feels that the undeclared symbiotic relationship between the security forces and CPM cadres is helping it inch closer to its single-minded objective of tackling the Maoists.        
	No withdrawal is planned. The anti-Naxalite operations will continue, a source said in Delhi.        
	Sources said the tactical line adopted by the joint forces was suiting their purpose. By letting the armed CPM cadres operate in Jungle Mahal, the joint forces are getting the home ministrys job done without sullying its hands.         
	Mamata Banerjee is blaming CPM cadres for terrorising the people, a source said. However, no accusation is being hurled at the joint forces. This is suiting the home ministry fine.         
	Central force officers indicated that as far as the home ministry was concerned, its prime aim was to ensure that the Maoists are forced on the backfoot. The joint forces are unofficially encouraging the CPM cadres to set up camps so that the security objective can be achieved.        
	The ministry would not be unhappy if the CPM wins the seats in the Maoist-affected areas of the state in next years polls as the cadres would then keep the pressure up on the Maoists, a source said. If Trinamul wins in these disturbed pockets, it is likely to go soft on the Maoists. The home ministrys only concern is security, not politics.

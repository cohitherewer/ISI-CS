The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bhajji blast, on and off pitch
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bhajji blast, on and off pitch
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Feb. 18: It wasnt bravado when, a month ago, Harbhajan Singh disdainfully asked Who is Ian Chappell?        
	After all, the garam-garam off-spinner followed that up with a match-winning five for 59 in the second innings at the Eden to help Team India level the series against South Africa and retain the No. 1 ranking in Tests.        
	It was, in many ways, a passionate performance with almost everybody (led by the captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni) making a contribution.         
	Later, in a one-on-one with The Telegraph, Harbhajan thundered: I hope Chappell has seen that, on the last day today, we won a Test with only three bowlers. Can he still argue that we cant remain at the top for long?        
	Humne apna jawaab de diya.... Taking 20 wickets matters and weve shown the world that we didnt fluke it (becoming No. 1 last December).        
	Ians younger brother Greg didnt question the bowlers credentials, or else Harbhajan wouldve torn into him, too.         
	For the record, Greg and Harbhajan just didnt get along during the formers 23-month association with India as coach.         
	South Africa needed to win the two-Test series in order to regain the top position on the ICC table. But while they won by an innings in Jamtha, they lost by an innings in Calcutta, despite captain-in-waiting Hashim Amlas hundred in each innings.        
	Amla, in fact, was adjudged both the MoM and MoS for a total (and mind-blowing average) of 490. Cant get more awesome than that.        
	A maximum of 16 minutes remained when the series finished with Harbhajan ending Morne Morkels defiance which had consumed 76 minutes.         
	It did get that close, bringing an edge-of-seat excitement not seen even in T20s, but South Africans have themselves to blame for not surviving on a day the hosts were short of one specialist  actually, spearhead Zaheer Khan.        
	South Africas senior pro Jacques Kallis had been hoping for a hero to emerge, but he surely didnt have Harbhajan in mind. Nor, for that matter, the weather God.        
	Getting back to Harbhajan, he used the occasion to take a swipe at a section of the media as well.         
	Offended by his portrayal as an idiot on national television, Harbhajan said: I have been hearing a lot of things from them. But, today, they were at the receiving end. They should know what to play on national television and what not to.        
	We play for our country with a lot of passion and its disappointing sometimes to see what characters they make out of us.... If we dont do well on the ground, they will show us as 3 Idiots... Harbhajan is one, Mahendra Singh Dhoni the other.... That is not right... Its a shame and should not be done.        
	Harbhajan did become a bit thanda as day turned to night, but we may not have seen the last of his anger. Emotionally, hes like a grenade with the pin off.

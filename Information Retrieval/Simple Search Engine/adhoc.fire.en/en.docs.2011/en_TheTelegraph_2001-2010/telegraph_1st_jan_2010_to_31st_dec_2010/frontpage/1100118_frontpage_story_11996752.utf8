	New Delhi, Jan. 17: One word assailed the CPM today from every direction.        
	Blunder.        
	It was a word Jyoti Basu had used 13 years ago, describing as an historic blunder the partys decision in 1996 not to join the United Front government that had offered him the Prime Ministers post.        
	Hours after Basus death, past and present Left allies like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Sharad Yadav regretted the way the CPM had prevented him from occupying the countrys highest political chair.        
	The CPMs closest ally, the CPI, used a more diplomatic word: unfortunate.        
	H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral recounted how they became Prime Minister in the United Front governments of 1996-98 because Basu had bowed before his partys wishes.        
	Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav and Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi admired Basus sense of discipline and commitment to the CPM that had made him put his party before personal ambition.        
	CPM leaders could only look the other way or avoid direct answers.        
	However, the party that has till now refused to accept that it had blundered in 1996 appeared to be learning to recognise some of the values Basu lived by, even if they ran counter to the beliefs of the die-hards who wouldnt let him be Prime Minister.        
	The CPM today acknowledged that Basu was not a dogmatic Marxist.        
	A misty-eyed Sitaram Yechury, who and mentor Harkishen Singh Surjeet were two of the staunchest supporters of the Basu-as-PM line in the CPM, read out from the party politburo resolution: He was a Marxist who was not dogmatic and continued to learn from his vast experience in charting out the course for the party.        
	However, the life sketch of Basu that the party released merely said: In 1996, his name was proposed by the secular allies for Prime Ministership. But the CPM central committee decided to support the government from outside.        
	The CPI central secretariats condolence message said: The secular-democratic and Left parties, who had been elected with a majority in Parliament, offered him the post of Prime Minister. This was a recognition of his genius in providing leadership and running the government. Unfortunately, this did not materialise for reasons that are well known.        
	Historic blunder it was; Basu himself had said it, said Sharad Yadav, who was a key minister in the United Front government. That (CPM general secretary) Prakash Karat or the CPM have not acknowledged it even today is irrelevant. However, we should admire Basus commitment and discipline in bowing to his partys decision.        
	Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam, who was defence minister in the United Front government, said the day the CPM prevented Basu from becoming Prime Minister was the day of his (Mulayams) biggest regret.        
	Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad said the situation in India would have been different today had Basu been allowed to accept the United Fronts offer to head its government. The CPIs D. Raja said Basu would have made a great Prime Minister.        
	Basu belonged to an era of gentlemen politicians, the Congresss Singhvi said. He was a disciplined soldier of his party and a leader who paid a price as high as the Prime Ministers post for his discipline.        
	Yechury evaded a direct reply when asked if the party now repented the decision. He (Basu) was a disciplined worker of the party, he said.        
	But he later recounted how on that day in May 1996 he had gone to New Delhis Karnataka Bhavan to relay the central committees decision to Mulayam, Deve Gowda, N. Chandrababu Naidu and others.        
	They said, Nothing doing. Go back to your central committee and convey our request to reconsider, Yechury said.        
	The central committees decision did not change. Later, when the issue came up for discussion in the 1998 party congress in Calcutta, Karat defended the decision not to join the government. Then general secretary Surjeet expressed the opposite view.

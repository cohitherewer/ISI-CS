The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cup for Qatar, windfall chance for India
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cup for Qatar, windfall chance for India

	Dec. 2: For football fans in India, this is the best they can hope for until the year 2030.        
	Twelve years on, in 2022, they can be at a huge, new air-conditioned stadium in Doha  in roughly the time it takes to fly from Mumbai to Delhi for the football World Cup and watch all the matches.        
	After the chaos that gripped New Delhi during preparations for the Commonwealth Games this year, it will be a relief to city-dwellers in India that even if some bright spark in the countrys sports administration might have got the idea of bidding for the football World Cup in 2026, it will come to nought.        
	Not that it was likely that India would have won any such bid after the bad publicity associated with the Commonwealth Games.        
	The relief for Indians is that the same continent cannot host consecutive World Cups: with Fifa, the international governing body of football, awarding the 2022 Cup to Qatar today, another Asian country such as India or China can make a bid only for 2030.        
	Fifa awarded the 2018 World Cup to Russia today. It will be the first time that Russia or the former communist East Europe will host the Cup. This years World Cup in South Africa was similarly the first such event on the African continent.        
	The successful bid by Qatar, which will be the smallest nation in the world to host the World Cup ever, will bring a windfall for Indians, though.        
	Thousands of businesses in the Gulf country are Indian-owned and will get a boost from the massive amount of construction and other work that will have to be undertaken for the event in the next 12 years.        
	The emirate told Fifa that it plans to renovate three stadiums and build nine new ones at a total cost of $3 billion. In addition, about 50,000 hotel rooms are to be added to the existing availability of accommodation.        
	Qatar, whose economy is expected to grow next year at 21 per cent despite the global economic woes, projected ticket sales of just under three million for the Cup.        
	All this will mean an influx of migrant labour from India to Doha as preparations get under way for the global sporting extravaganza. India is the biggest source of labour in the emirate and modern Doha has largely been built on the sweat of Indian workers.        
	Like Russia and East Europe, it will be the first time that a West Asian country is playing host to Fifas quadrennial global tournament.        
	Qatars argument that a sporting event like the World Cup would bring hope to a region torn apart by conflict for decades won favour with Fifas 22-member executive committee which voted on the bids in secret in Zurich this afternoon.        
	Rocked by allegations of corruption, the Fifa executive committees strength is down to 22: two members have been suspended following a media expose in the UK about corruption.        
	The committee may also have been swayed by Qatars offer to dismantle the stadiums after the World Cup and ship them to poor countries where they will be reassembled to promote sports worldwide.        
	Qatar beat a US bid to host the World Cup in 2022. Coincidentally, the American bid was led by an Indian, Sunil Gulati, who heads the US Soccer Federation and has been criss-crossing the world in the past six months in a determined effort to bag the Cup for his country.        
	He was with former President Bill Clinton in Zurich: Clinton and actor Morgan Freeman led the US presentation before Fifa.        
	The thrust of Gulatis arguments was that the US already had readymade sports and other infrastructure needed to host the event in 12 years.        
	He also forecast that the profitability of American sporting telecasts would bring rich football sponsorships during the Cup and greatly benefit Fifa. Obviously that was not enough to convince those who voted for Qatar over America.        
	The World Cup has been hosted by the US only once, in 1994, when 3.58 million tickets were sold. It was a record for any World Cup, according to sports statisticians.        
	Born in Allahabad, Gulati has been promoting football, known in the US as soccer, since the early 1980s and is easily the most powerful Indian in any American sport.        
	Gulati was instrumental in Americas successful bid to host the Cup 16 years ago and was re-elected president of the US Soccer Federation for a second four-year term in 2010.        
	An economist by profession, he taught at Columbia University in the 1980s before joining the World Bank.

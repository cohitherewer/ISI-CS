The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Territory, tenure delay deal 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Territory, tenure delay deal 
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Aug. 17: The contentious issues of territory, tenure and composition of the interim set-up for the Darjeeling hills remained unresolved in Delhi today, but the participants in the tripartite talks hammered out a consensus on the administrative and legislative powers of the new body and the subjects under it.        
	The pending issues will be discussed at the next round of official talks to be held between the Centre, the Bengal government and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha on September 7.         
	Roshan Giri, general secretary of the Morcha, told The Telegraph after the official-level talks: The meeting was a success and an agreement has broadly been reached on issues like the number of subjects to be transferred to the new body as well as its administrative and legislative powers. However, a home ministry official expressed disappointment. We had hoped to clinch the deal at todays meeting, he said. We hope the three stakeholders reach a consensus on all issues at the next meeting.         
	It is only after this consensus that political-level talks will be held to finalise and announce the interim set-up.        
	At todays meeting the Centre proposed that the tenure of the new body should be extended to December 31, 2012, instead of the 2011-end suggested earlier.         
	The Centre was of the opinion that the 2011 deadline was too short a duration, Giri said. We have not yet given our opinion in this regard. The Morcha is expected to hold a meeting with party chief Bimal Gurung before conveying their response to Delhi.         
	The Centres draft had proposed that there should be 20 members in the interim authority that would replace the DGHC. But the Morcha today insisted that it should have 55 members. We are flexible on this, a ministry source said. We could concede this if the Morcha is reasonable on the others. The issue that may pose a stumbling block even in the next round of talks is the territorial jurisdiction of the set-up. While the Centre and the state government have made it clear that they are willing to concede only the hill subdivisions of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong, the Morcha is insisting that the Dooars and the Terai should also be included in it.        
	In Darjeeling, Binay Tamang, assistant secretary of the Morcha, said there was no question of compromising on the inclusion of the Dooars and the Terai. Morcha leaders said they are soon to tie up with the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, the main political entity in the Dooars, for a joint movement for a separate state.        
	However, a home ministry official said this was posturing by the Morcha to play to its support base in the hills. We are sure we can negotiate on this, he said.         
	The talks were attended by joint secretary in home ministry Nirmaljit Singh Kalsi, Bengal home secretary Samar Ghosh and a seven-member Morcha team led by Giri.

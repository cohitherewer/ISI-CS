          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, March 10: Congress leader and 1984 anti-Sikh riots accused Sajjan Kumar today walked into the Delhi court where he hadnt appeared for over a month despite summons, but left relieved after being given bail.        
	Kumar was granted bail in two cases along with nine others on a surety and personal bond of Rs 50,000 each. The Central Bureau of Investigation, which is probing the cases, provided a copy of the chargesheet to the accused.         
	Riot victims cried foul at the bail. There is no justice in this country, we have no hope left, said Babu Singh Dukhiya, one of the representatives of the victims. Senior advocate H.S. Phoolka, who has been fighting the case on behalf of the victims, said he would move the Supreme Court. This is miscarriage of justice, he said.        
	The city court had issued non-bailable warrants against Kumar and others on two occasions, after which he went missing. Days later, on February 26, Delhi High Court granted him anticipatory bail.         
	Shoe attacker        
	Jarnail Singh, the Sikh journalist who had hurled a shoe at home minister P. Chidambaram almost a year ago over lack of progress in the riot cases, alleged he was roughed up outside the court by Kumars supporters. I was pushed and manhandled while I was leaving the court. The people who pushed me around were supporters of Kumar. One of them even threatened me with dire consequences, said Singh after filing a police complaint.

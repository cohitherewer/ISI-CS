The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hitman Dhoni gets gun licence 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Hitman Dhoni gets gun licence 
          SANTOSH K. KIRO                               
	Ranchi, Jan. 22: The blazing blade is not enough for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, he has got himself a gun licence. A second one at that.        
	The Union home ministry has cleared the India captains application for a 9mm pistol licence, given to civilians only under a special provision of the Arms Act.        
	Since the cricketer, known for his explosive batting, already enjoys Z-category security and has had a licence for a 7.65mm pistol since 2006, some observers are asking why he needs further protection.         
	State home secretary J.B. Tubid said: The Union home ministry has cleared the application of M.S. Dhoni and sent the documents to the state home ministry three days back.        
	He refused to comment on why Ranchis most famous son, who had yet to buy a weapon against his earlier licence, had asked for another one.         
	The licence of a prohibitive bore (9mm) is not allowed to civilians under the Arms Act but there are administrative orders which empower the Union home ministry to issue such a licence under special circumstances, said Ranchi deputy commissioner K.S Soan.         
	The licence has been issued under the rule, he said, but did not elaborate what the special circumstances were.         
	He (Dhoni) happens to be the Team India captain, so we want to ensure that there is no loophole in his security, he added when it was pointed out that Dhoni enjoyed Z-category security.         
	Former advocate-general Anil Sinha agreed there were special provisions under which the Centre could issue a 9mm pistol licence. The government has also categorised various persons who are entitled to such a licence, he said.        
	Dhoni had expressed unhappiness at the security provided to him in his home state Jharkhand in December 2008 when the guards were missing as he drove from his home to the Birsa Munda airport.

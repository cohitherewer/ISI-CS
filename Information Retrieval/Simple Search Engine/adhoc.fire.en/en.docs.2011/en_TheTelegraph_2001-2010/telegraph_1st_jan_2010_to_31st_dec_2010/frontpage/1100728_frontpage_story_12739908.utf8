  - Mumbai glitterati place ads to greet Uddhav on birthday           SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                                    
	Mumbai, July 27: Happy birthday, Uddhav, heres a Rs 1-lakh olive branch.        
	Sender: Shah Rukh (My Name Is) Khan.        
	Nearly Rs 300 crore riding on his films this year, the actor seems to be in the mood to mend fences.        
	If it was dinner in London yesterday with rival Aamir Khan, Tuesday provided the perfect occasion to patch up with a man whose party had branded him a traitor.        
	Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray turned 50 today, and Shah Rukhs company sent its best compliments in the form of a half-page ad in party mouthpiece Saamna.        
	 The black-and-white advertisement from Shah Rukhs production house Red Chillies cost Rs 1.12 lakh.        
	 The 100-page Saamna issue ended up with 96 pages of ads.        
	Amitabh Bachchan, whose movie and gameshow roles Shah Rukh has reprised, too, placed an ad but a quarter-page one.        
	Shah Rukhs people called in and asked if they could place an ad for Uddhavji on his birthday. We were planning a 100-page-plus issue of Saamna for his birthday and all the sales and marketing people in Mumbai were aware of it, said a Sena leader associated with the special issue.        
	Less than six months back, SRK and Uddhav were at the centre of a public row over the inclusion of Pakistani players in the Indian Premier League. Shah Rukh had spoken out for the Pakistani cricketers and the Sena had called him a traitor.        
	A series of statements and counter-statements followed, leading to a Sena ban on the release of Shah Rukhs My Name is Khan in the city and the rest of Maharashtra.        
	Shah Rukhs fans decided to defy the ban in a show of solidarity with the actor. The Congress government in the state stepped in to ensure smooth release of the film by giving police protection to theatres screening MNIK.        
	Rahul Gandhi, with whom Shah Rukh shares a close friendship, also sent a symbolic message by defying Sena protests and criss-crossing Mumbai on a local train.        
	As the spat panned out over various media platforms and cyberspace, Uddhavs party gained some mileage and regional mind space at a time the Sena seemed to be losing clout.        
	MNIK, too, logged a lot of publicity, thanks to the controversy, though the actor had been livid at such suggestions.        
	Today everything seems forgiven and forgotten. I am accepting best wishes from everybody, is all Uddhav chose to say when asked about the advertisement.        
	A source in Red Chillies Entertainment said Shah Rukh had taken the decision to place the ad in Saamna before leaving for London to attend a schedule of his forthcoming film Ra One.         
	Shah Rukh has been dogged by one controversy after another since he was singled out for interrogation at a US airport last year. MNIK broke even but did not make as much as expected. Now, Ra One and Don 2 are in the pipeline and SRK does not want any problems with them, said the Red Chillies source.        
	My Name Is Khan, co-produced by Shah Rukh and Karan Johar, had gone under the hammer to 20th Century Fox for nearly Rs 100 crore. Fox had lost about one-fifth of its investment on the film. Many blamed it on the controversy, though some held the movie itself responsible.        
	With Ra One being pegged at a sale value of Rs 175 crore and Don 2 at Rs 125 crore, Bollywood sources said Shah Rukh was taking no chances.

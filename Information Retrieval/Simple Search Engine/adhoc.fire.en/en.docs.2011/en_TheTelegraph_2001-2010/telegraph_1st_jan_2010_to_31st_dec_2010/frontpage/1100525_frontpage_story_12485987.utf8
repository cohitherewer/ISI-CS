                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Under Section 144 GJM chiefs convoy stopped 
                          Bimal Gurung and Roshan Giri, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders                                
	Siliguri (WB), May 25 (PTI): Following an anti-GJM sentiment running high in Darjeeling hills after the killing of Gorkha leader Madan Tamang, an irate mob in the district blocked Gorkha Janmukti Morcha president Bimal Gurungs convoy, police said.        
	Inspector General of Police (North Bengal) K L Tamta said the large convoy of the GJM president, which was on its way to Darjeeling from Kalimpong, was mobbed at Ghum near Darjeeling town. The mob mostly comprised of AIGL supporters, he said. However, there was no untoward incident and the convoy passed through after GJM supporters cleared the road.        
	Tamta said that prohibitory orders under Section 144 were imposed in Darjeeling town as a preventive measure.        
	Gurung made a brief address at Ghum, saying the GJM would continue its agitation for Gorkhaland and would hold a rally in the Hills to apprise people of the partys stance. The GJM chief accused the state government of hatching a conspiracy to discredit the party.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri denied that the convoy had been blocked by a mob and said party supporters had converged on the vehicles.        
	He alleged that no police protection was provided to the convoy. Giri said there was a move to provoke the GJM but his party was not afraid to face it as the party was committed to achieve Gorkhaland.        
	The general secretary also alleged that the turn of events following the killing of All India Gorkha League (AIGL) chief Madan Tamang on May 21 smacked of conspiracy on the part of the state government.

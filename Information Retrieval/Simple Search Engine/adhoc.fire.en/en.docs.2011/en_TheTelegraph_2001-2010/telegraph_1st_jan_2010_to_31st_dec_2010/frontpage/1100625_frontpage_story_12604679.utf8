	New Delhi, June 24: Soft-cushioned chairs might some day make a difference to the outcome of India-Pakistan negotiations. And job candidates might fare better when they present their resumes on heavyweight paper.         
	New research suggests that sensations of touch such as hardness, texture or weight, that are experienced by people in everyday situations can profoundly influence their impressions about other people and even steer their decisions.         
	Experiments conducted by a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and Yale University have shown that heavy resumes make job candidates appear important, rough objects make social interactions appear difficult and hard objects appear to increase rigidity during negotiations. The findings will appear in the US journal Science on Friday.         
	Touch shapes both the impressions we form about other people and the decisions that we make, Joshua Ackerman, assistant professor of marketing at the MIT Sloan School of Management and lead author of the study, told The Telegraph.         
	Experiences of touch may work in combination with other cues, he said. There are many unconscious influences in the world -- however, certainly, what we touch does affect how we perceive the world and our social interactions, Ackerman said.         
	The study builds over research two years ago by Yale psychologists John Bargh and Lawrence Williams who found that people view other people to be more generous after they had touched a cup of warm drink  rather than a cold drink.         
	In the new research, Ackerman, Bargh and Christopher Nocera, a graduate student of psychology at Harvard, designed a set of six experiments that draw on real-world situations to explore how touch sensations influence judgements and decisions.        
	The experiments have shown that features such as hardness, texture or weight can influence impressions and decisions even when the people or the events are entirely unrelated to the object touched.        
	The experience of touch need not be limited to the hands.        
	In one experiment, 86 participants sat on a hard wooden chair or a soft cushioned chair and engaged in a simulated negotiation where they try to get a car dealer to reduce the price of a car with a sticker price of $16,500.        
	The results suggest that hardness produces perceptions of rigidity and strictness  people seated on the hard chairs were less flexible to negotiate than the people who sat on soft chairs.        
	In another experiment, resumes on a heavy clipboard improved impressions of job candidates. Volunteers who had touched rough pieces of a jigsaw puzzle rather than smooth pieces interpreted a social interaction as harsh.         
	The researchers say the findings have practical implications in a variety of situations. First impressions may be influenced by experiences of touch that could be controlled through the choice of appropriate objects.         
	Clearly, people interested in negotiations could shape the environment of meeting rooms quite easily, Ackerman said.        
	Touch experiences could also be harnessed in product design and packaging. Paying attention to touch-related cues that consumers experience with packing or with products themselves can help manufacturers (or retailers) shape the reactions that people are likely to have to those products.        
	Team member Bargh points out that sensations of roughness, hardness or warmth are among the first that infants develop and these could influence how children and adults develop abstract concepts about people and relationships. These sensations help create a mental scaffold upon which we build our understanding of the world as we grow older, Bargh said in a statement issued through Yale University.

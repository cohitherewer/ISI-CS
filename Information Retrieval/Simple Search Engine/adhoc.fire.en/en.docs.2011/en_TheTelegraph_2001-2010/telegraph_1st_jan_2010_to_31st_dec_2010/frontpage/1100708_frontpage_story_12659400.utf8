The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Spain guarantee new champs
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Spain guarantee new champs
                            
	So, we have it: Sundays 2010 World Cup showdown will see a new champion  a fact confirmed when Spain edged Germany out by a far slimmer margin than they deserved in Durbans magnificent Moses Mabhida Stadium.        
	Whoever wins in Soccer City on Sunday, Spain or the Netherlands, Europe will edge 10-9 ahead of South America in their 80-year duel. Also, just for the record, it will be the first time a European team has won the World Cup anywhere but in Europe.        
	The irony is that Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk admires Barcelona and told me months ago that he hoped his team would play like them at the World Cup finals.        
	Thus, we have a double twist of historical fate. The first was that, back in 1973 and 1974, Barcelona signed Dutch heroes Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens because they wanted to play like Holland. The second twist is that no fewer than seven Barcelona players started the semi-final (if one includes new signing David Villa).        
	The others were defenders Gerard Pique and Carles Puyol and midfielders Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Pedro  the surprise choice in place of out-of-touch Fernando Torres.        
	Last calendar year, 2009 that is, Barcelona achieved the unique feat of winning all six possible prizes: the Spanish league and cup and supercup, the Champions League, the European Supercup and the Fifa Club World Cup. It seemed as if there was nothing more for their players. Now, suddenly, there is: the World Cup itself, the most glittering prize of all.         
	The key to the strategy with which Spain outplayed a disappointingly tentative German team was also sketched out months ago by Van Marwijk.         
	He told me: What is most important about what you see when you watch Barcelona  and Spain and, I hope, Holland  is in that very important moment when they lose the ball.        
	Then, as a team, you see Barcelona exert pressure to get the ball back as soon as possible. Its easy to say, not so easy to do. The whole team has to believe in it and do it and, for the most creative players, this can be very difficult. But with Barcelona you see Xavi do it, Messi do it, Iniesta do it        
	And that is exactly how they ran down Germany.        
	So superior was the Spanish passing game that it seemed as if they had an extra man on the pitch. Yet the number of times German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer needed to handle the ball  apart from rescuing it for goal-kicks  could be counted on the fingers of one hand.         
	Ultimately, Spains coach Vicente del Bosque was thus richly rewarded for contentiously bringing in wide-running Pedro in place of Torres.        
	Pedros inclusion meant a lone role up front for Villa but it allowed Spain to display far more fluidity and aggression than in any of their earlier games.        
	Just after the hour, Germany brought on youngster Toni Kroos. Within minutes Kroos should have scored, only to see Spanish captain Casillas drop alertly to the ground to beat the shot away.        
	That proved the crucial moment. Spain flowed rhythmically back on to the attack and were rewarded with their winning goal as Xavis left-wing corner was headed home unstoppably by Puyol, charging like a bull with the matador in his sights, scattering opponents and team-mates alike.        
	Can the Netherlands and Spain match that  who knows? One fact is certain: at the end of play in Soccer City on Sunday, a new name will be inscribed both on the World Cup and in football history.

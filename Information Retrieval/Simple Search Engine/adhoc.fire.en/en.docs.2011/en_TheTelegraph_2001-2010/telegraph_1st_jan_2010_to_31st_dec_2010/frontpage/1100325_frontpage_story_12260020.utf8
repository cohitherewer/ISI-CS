	Ranchi, March 24: Deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto may be hoping that IOC president Suresh Kalmadi will announce fresh dates for the much delayed 34th National Games here tomorrow, but allegations of financial irregularities continue to pour in against the organising committee that was notified in 2007.        
	Now, the office of the states principal accountant-general (PAG) has detected gross anomalies in awarding the tender for providing vehicles for transportation of sports persons and officials and pointed to excess payments to the tune of Rs 3.47 crore.        
	The PAGs office passed on its probe report to Raj Bhavan in January after Presidents rule was lifted. The report is now with the state government.         
	We have sent the report to the state government for appropriate action, confirmed Sudhir Tripathy, the principal secretary to Governor M..H. Farook.        
	National Games Organising Committee (NGOC) office-bearers dismissed the PAG report as inconsequential and one that dwells on procedural techincalities, even justifying cost escalations as the price to ensure quality.        
	Useless and silly questions are being raised by the office of the principal accountant-general, Jharkhand. Perhaps they have no understanding of any kind in regard to sports, commented NGOC working chairman R.K. Anand.        
	Madhukant Pathak, the NGOC treasurer, supported him and said the PAG report would not affect the preparations for Games.        
	According to the PAG report, only one transport firm, M/s Surendra Tourist Transport Services, New Delhi, responded to the NGOCs offer of tenders. And ultimately, NGOC awarded the contract to it for arranging AC luxury cars, AC cars, non-AC cars, AC buses and non-AC buses for use during the games.         
	But the PAG found rates quoted by the firm to be higher than the rates being offered by Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation (JTDC). Awarding the work to M/s Surendra Tourist Transport Services, New Delhi, on single tender basis without undertaking market survey and obtaining prevailing rates of JTDC for similar types of vehicle is a serious matter especially when the difference worked out to Rs 3.47 crore, the PAG noted in its report.        
	On NGOCs contention that JTDC stayed away despite four invitations to participate in the tendering process, the PAG said it was not tenable. It noted that NGOC should have obtained its (JTDC) rates for different types of vehicles before finalising the order on a single tender because it is a state government undertaking.         
	Compared to JTDCs, the rates quoted by M/s Surendra Tourist Transport Services, New Delhi, were higher.         
	For example, Surendra Services would provide an AC luxury car at a rate of Rs 25 per km with a minimum-use clause pegged at 200km per day. This means, a minimum payment of Rs 5,000 per day per would have to be made for an AC luxury car.        
	However, JTDC charges Rs 20 per km for an AC luxury car. This works out to only Rs 4,000 plus Rs 150 for 200km.        
	State sports secretary R.S. Verma said he had gone through the PAG report and was waiting to hear from Mahto, who holds the sports portfolio.         
	NGOC organising secretary S.M. Hashmi was unfazed, but promised to reply to the PAG on its findings. We are a registered society and we are organising the games as per the Host City Contract and the Memorandum of Association, he said, We are also guided by the IOA, its steering committee and the Games Technical Conduct Committee. We do not object to audit but that should be done with the by-laws of the NGOC society in mind.        
	The 34th National Games, originally scheduled for November 2007, has already been postponed four times, the last time on November 21, 2009, when it was rescheduled due to Assembly elections.         
	As of now, the Rs 600 crore-worth infrastructure is ready. It comprises nine stadiums, including the main athletics stadium, indoor stadium, a sports hostel and around 1,200 flats at the Mega Sports Complex. Besides, the renovated Birsa Munda Stadium and the astroturf hockey stadium, both at Morabadi, were also ready.

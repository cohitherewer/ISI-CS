  - Opposition unity would have beaten Left in more wards           ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                              
	Calcutta, June 5: Comrade Biman Bose, your 22-to-33 vital statistic is shrinking by the day.        
	The Lefts tally in the Calcutta corporation would have been far fewer than the measly 33 wards it eventually bagged had the Trinamul Congress and the Congress fought the civic elections together.        
	CPM state secretary Bose had been holding aloft the figure 33  which is higher than the 22 the Left would have won if last years Lok Sabha poll results were to be extrapolated in the wards as evidence that his front had improved its position compared with 2009.        
	However, according to figures collated by the State Election Commission, the Congress and Trinamul have polled the majority of votes in at least six wards which the Left eventually won because its candidate bagged the single-largest number of votes (see chart).        
	The same would have happened in one more ward, according to figures collected by The Telegraph from the candidates. The State Election Commission has yet to give the break-up in 20 more wards, which raises the possibility that the full picture could be worse for the Left.        
	If the full figures for the seven wards are taken into account, it becomes clear that a united Opposition would have confined the Left to not more than 26, considerably weakening Boses argument against calling the early elections demanded by Mamata Banerjee.        
	The results of the Lok Sabha elections show that we were ahead of Trinamul Congress in 22 of the 141 wards of Calcutta. This time we have got 33, Bose had said on the day the results were announced, explaining the improvement.        
	Boses wafer-thin statistical edge will become slimmer if two more wards where the results were too close enter the picture. In wards 92 and 109, won by the CPI and the CPM, if the votes of Trinamul and the Congress are added, they fall short of that of the winners by just 66 and 67 votes.        
	Theres no doubt that the Lefts numbers would have gone down drastically if there was an alliance between the Congress and Trinamul, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said. The vote division enabled the CPM to win some wards of Calcutta. But we were helpless and had to field candidates after Trinamul broke the alliance.              
	We cant help it if the Opposition splits its vote, CPM state committee member Rabin Deb said. But we are studying the results and the wards where such things happened.        
	In east Calcuttas ward 36, CPI candidate Mosumi Ghosh won because of the Congress-Trinamul vote split. The votes the two parties got are more than what Ghosh polled.        
	In ward 46, the Congress fielded a weak candidate and lent unofficial support to an Independent, described as its dummy. It paved the way for CPM nominee Sheila Kapoors victory.        
	In ward 47, the Left-backed Rashtriya Janata Dal candidate Suman Singh got 900-odd votes less than the Congress-Trinamul combined score.         
	In central Calcuttas ward 59, the Left candidate polled 11,989 votes, over 1,800 less than the combined votes of Trinamul and the Congress.        
	Javed Khan, Trinamuls leader of the Opposition in the CMC and who was tipped to be the mayor, lost by a narrow margin to the CPIs Farzana Choudhury in ward 64 as the Congresss Shammi Jahan ate into his votes.        
	Here, too, the combined votes of the Congress and Trinamul exceed the Lefts, a tale repeated in wards 75 and 94, which is close to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Assembly constituency Jadavpur.        
	Although the Congress proved a spoiler in some wards, it gave Trinamul the chance to have a straight fight with the Left in 33 wards by not putting up candidates.        
	Trinamul would have found the going tough if Congress nominees were there in these 33 seats. That way, the Trinamul chief should be grateful to us, said a Congress leader.         
	State Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi said the Left would have fared worse had there been an alliance.        
	Yes, we lost some seats due to this. But the CPM always tries to divide the Opposition, Bakshi said.

	Drushkhela (Pakistan), Nov. 13: People here felt a surge of optimism last year when the military declared the Swat Valley cleared of Taliban insurgents, who had bullied their way to power by publicly whipping and beheading opponents.        
	But more than a year after millions of residents returned home, the absence of virtually any government follow-through has turned that hope into despair.        
	Throughout the valley, tens of thousands of students are sheltered by broken-down walls and flimsy tents supplied mostly by international aid groups. The government has yet to rebuild even one of the more than 150 schools levelled by the Taliban in their methodical campaign to prevent girls education.        
	Running water, electricity and school supplies are widely absent. The floods that ravaged the country this summer, and hit Swat especially hard, have only compounded the hardships and diverted money and attention away from reconstructing war-torn areas.        
	The lack of any visible progress has fed the frustrations of local people and international donors over the governments incompetence and corruption, raising fears that it has squandered a chance to win over a pivotal population in its war against militancy, which has been urged on by the US. In the minds of these little kids, the frustration against our own government is developing, and against the West is developing, said Esanullah Khan, a landlord here. Theyll go into Talibanisation or miscreants because that is their only option left. What do they have to lose?        
	And who is the one to blame? he said, parroting the students reasoning. Its the United States of America.        
	Jamal Uddin, a ninth grader who missed nearly two years of school because of the conflict in Swat, used to detest the Taliban, who bombed his school in the village of Baidera in 2008. Now, he says, he has no reason to support either side.        
	He has watched as a parade of government leaders has visited his school without removing even one brick from the rubble.

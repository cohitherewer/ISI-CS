The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bollywoods bad company
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bollywoods bad company
  - Not mafia but moneybags. The Telegraph tracks how boom turned into bust          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                                    
	The shooting floors in Mumbai are empty. The post-production labs are not in use. The sound studios are silent.        
	Only the Twitter accounts of stars and lesser-mortal actors are active. After a long time, they have a lot of time in hand.        
	Its easy to blame the drift on the recent debacles of Kites and Raavan, whose combined losses are being put at more than Rs 100 crore, which means the first-half crater of 2010 has widened to almost Rs 500 crore.        
	But the slowdown is not an overnight phenomenon. Many factors have combined to muddle the movie mathematics of Mumbai, all of which point to an unsavoury suggestion.        
	Bollywood is paying the price of kid-in-a-candy-store corporatisation.        
	The arrival of big moneybags masquerading as studios instantly made many stars several times richer and also expanded the bottom line of dozens of production houses. But the industry economics went so haywire that the failure of the films meant there was only one button left on the remote  pause.         
	In the past 12 to 18 months, the elevated prices of the stars have come down, bringing down the cost of production. Some of the top-rung stars like Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar have wisely chosen to concentrate on their own productions so that they can not only do the kind of films they want to but also take home both the actors fee and the producers fee.        
	The lesser names  those who dont have the star power to ensure a big first weekend opening for their films  havent been that lucky. These one-hit wonders, who bagged a series of movies in the boom of 2006-2007, are now sitting idle at home, waiting for the phone to ring.                  
	Till a couple of years ago, they wouldnt even take your call if you didnt have their Rs 5 crore fee now they keep calling producers for work, says trade analyst Vinod Mirani.        
	Earlier, uncle producers would bail out these so-called stars, or a plum TV-hosting appearance would bring in some money or the long line of inane ensemble comedies would ensure at least one part. But no longer so.         
	Things have gone so bad that many of these actors are now contemplating switching to television soaps. Wait for some announcements soon, says an industry insider.        
	But how did the entertainment economics take such a wrong turn? Who called the shots and who were game? The Telegraph met the big bosses of the biggest corporate houses to understand what went wrong between 2005 and 2010, who were the winners and who lost out and what can bail the industry out of the mess that it has got itself into.        
	It was in 2005-2006 that corporate investors invaded Bollywood. Companies like UTV and Eros, which were involved in other showbiz activities like TV software production and international distribution, ventured into film production. One of the first steps was to raise money for the company from the market.        
	But they did not produce movies!        
	Making a film from scratch involves a gestation period of a minimum of 18 to 24 months. And when you have picked up hundreds of crores from investors, you have to make them happy almost instantly, says Sanjeev Lamba, CEO of Reliance BIG Pictures.        
	So the corporate houses started acquiring or buying movies, instead of producing them directly. The production houses quickly learnt of the companies desperate need for software and asked for astronomical amounts for their ready films.         
	A minimum of 100 per cent premium  a film costing Rs 30 crore was priced at Rs 60 crore  was being levied on the movies. Add to this the companies cost on prints and publicity.        
	It was also the time for individual, territory-specific distributors to take a back seat as the corporate houses developed and strengthened their distribution chains. By selling the films directly to exhibitors  multiplexes and single screens  the companies wanted to maximise their profits. But in the process, they were also maximising their risks.        
	It proved too big a risk. Barring an Om Shanti Om (which Eros had bought at a then-record price of Rs 75 crore), the acquisitions hardly managed to come close to the acquisition fee.        
	The movies didnt fail, the prices did, sums up Ram Mirchandani, who was earlier with UTV and is now the chief creative officer of Eros. If you take into account just the production cost of the same movies, many of them were in the green. But they were bought at such outrageous prices, they were deemed as flops.         
	A shocker was Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Saawariya which released on the same day as Om Shanti Om. The Ranbir Kapoor-Sonam Kapoor launch vehicle nearly shut down Sony Pictures India and sent tremors across the big corporate houses.        
	That was in end-2007. By end-2008, acquisition as a model had failed in India.        
	But the four-year period had done more damage. In a star-driven industry, the money game cannot be played without the stars. The moment the stars realised that their films were being sold for crazy crores, they demanded their cut, a huge cut.        
	In an attempt to associate themselves with the big stars and thus keep investors happy, the corporate houses went a step ahead and started signing the Kumars and the Kapoors directly for multi-film deals. Following Hollywoods studio model, they even sponsored personal vacations of certain superstars.        
	If anybody approached a talent (thats corporate speak for actors and directors), a couple of other studios would call up to offer more money.         
	Now we look back at that period as a boom time but in actuality, that phase has only done harm to the industry, says analyst Mirani.         
	Not that the corporate houses were buying films from producers completely at random. Their approach was scientific and practical, rules that seldom make sense in the business called Hindi cinema.                                                   
	Priti Shahani, who was a senior vice-president with Studio 18 and has just joined BIG Pictures as the chief strategy and marketing officer, explains: If you see a piece of paper with A Mani Ratnam film starring Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan with music by A.R. Rahman written on it, wouldnt you put money on the table? Or maybe A Rakesh Roshan production starring Hrithik Roshan and directed by Anurag Basu? Their track records clearly suggest that the projects had a lot of promise.        
	 That explains the acquisitions of Raavan and Kites, both of which were bought at inception in 2008. Both the movies would have been evaluated very differently if they were bought now and not led to this huge loss of Rs 100 crore, making 2010 one of the worst years for Bollywood, says trade analyst Komal Nahata, referring to the devaluation of acquisitions in the intervening period.        
	But Lamba of BIG Pictures, which had acquired both the box-office disasters, asks how the industry as a whole could have lost money if the Anil Ambani-owned company paid all those crores to the production companies  Rs 100 crore to Madras Talkies for Raavan (both language versions) and Rs 105 crore to Filmkraft for Kites.        
	That sounds logical. But in the strange world of business, bad news travels fast and hits where it hurts most. Any scent of loss usually pervades the market and acts as a speed-breaker.        
	The same BIG Pictures has made no fresh acquisitions in almost a year now. The other corporate houses like Eros, UTV and Studio 18 have also cut down on their movie-buying spree. In fact, last year, five major films, including hits Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (Ranbir-Katrina), Wanted (Salman) and flop Blue (Akshay), did not have any corporate buyers and the producers had to sell the films to different individual distributors themselves.         
	As a result, the production companies are now wary of making films at their own cost and taking the ready movies to the big studios. The studios themselves are no longer buying films at just face value.        
	The way forward is through productions and co-productions. We are involved from the script stage and know exactly what we are getting into. Also, productions are way cheaper than acquisitions and the money lost in a flop can be balanced with the money earned in a hit, says Lamba.        
	Creating fresh software as opposed to buying ready software is a much slower process and the studios are taking their time to design the right projects. Only UTV, which had started out earlier than the others, has now got a spate of own productions and co-productions, partnering with biggies like Karan Johars Dharma Productions and Aamir Khan Productions.        
	Prakash Jha, who co-produced and directed Raajneeti  one of the rare big hits of the year  says: My experience with UTV as a co-producer has been extremely comfortable and welcoming. They are an easy and understanding team who can look after creative man management, scripting and everything else.        
	So its now slow and steady for big bad Bolly. Quality, not quantity, has finally become the key, the effects of which will only surface next year.         
	In 2008 and 2009, two to four films released every Friday. Come 2011, getting even one major film to release in two weeks will be a tough ask. But if the plot unfolds true to the business script, that one film could be a much more watchable experience.

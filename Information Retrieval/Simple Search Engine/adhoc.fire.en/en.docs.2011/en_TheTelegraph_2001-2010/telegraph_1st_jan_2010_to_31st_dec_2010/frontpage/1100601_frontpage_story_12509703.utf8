The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maoist eyes and ears at work
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Maoist eyes and ears at work
          PRONAB MONDAL                                              
	Indraboni (West Midnapore), May 31: The teenager on the gravelled road looked like a goatherd, holding the end of a rope running from a goats neck, a eucalyptus tree shielding him from the sun.        
	Then he started punching the keys of a mobile phone, stealing a glance at our white Ambassador.        
	I didnt realise it then but our journey to the house of Bapi Mahato, who allegedly led the sabotage that triggered the Jnaneswari Express tragedy in which 150 people were killed, had already been relayed over the air waves.        
	One-and-a-half kilometres later, in front of a level-crossing at Indraboni, four youths stopped us.        
	Kotha theke ashchhen? Kothay jaben? (Where are you coming from? Where will you go?) asked a youth in a green-and-black T-shirt, clutching a cellphone.        
	Told the reason, he asked me to get off the car and sit on a bench made of bamboo sticks.        
	Dinabandhu, etai shei gari to (Dinabandhu, is this the same car)? he asked over his phone.        
	Then I realised that the teenager  referred to as Dinabandhu on the phone  under the eucalyptus tree was a village defence squad member posing as a goatherd to watch the road.         
	After convincing the youth that my intention was not to portray Bapi as a villain but to write about his old parents, the youth in the green-and-black T-shirt asked me to wait and entered a mud-walled hut on one side and voices were heard. After some time he came out, apparently with instructions from Maoists inside.         
	OK. You can go anywhere in this area but not alone. Our men will escort you. It is my duty because I am a member of the gram suraksha bahini (village defence squad), said the youth in the green-and-black T-shirt, who identified himself as Chottu.         
	Chottu described how security forces have been torturing poor villagers in the name of raids and pointed to another boy about his age.         
	You take him with you. He will arrange your meeting with Bapis father, said Chottu, who is a Class VII dropout.        
	A bumpy ride on the gravelled road followed and we reached Rasua. A man in his late forties was waiting in front of a closed roadside shop.         
	Aager bochhor bari theke chole gelo bollo desher kaj korte jachchhe. Aar asheni (He left home last year saying that he was going to serve the country. He never came back), said Bapis father Sudhir Mahato, a small farmer.        
	Asked about Bapis name being associated with the train tragedy, Mahato said: I do not believe that. He cannot kill innocent people. The government is framing false charges against him.         
	My question whether Bapi is a Maoist and part of the squad remained unanswered as my escort told me, Hoye giyechhe, ebare cholun aar kotha bolte hobe na (It is enough, now move, no more questions).         
	My escort refused to take me to Bapis house.        
	On the way back, I met Chottu again. Bapi is our leader. The local Trinamul Congress-dominated Sardiha gram panchayat did nothing for us. It is he who is behind digging of wells at Indraboni and making moram (gravelled) road for easier communication. We, not the government, have won villagers hearts. How can the administration portray us as enemy of the state? Chottu asked.         
	He did not allow me to take a photograph of a culvert under construction. The joint forces will come and destroy it, Chottu said.         
	In the next phase of my journey to villages around the spot where the train tragedy occurred, I was accompanied by another young village squad member who refused to disclose his name but kept talking  no surprises here  on his cellphone.        
	 Most people below 60 years in villages like Jhunjhuni, Lalgeria, Borobari, Manikpara and Kushtoli had fled their homes. Only women, children and old men could be seen. We asked the villagers to leave as we know security forces will start raids shortly. We are here to protect the women and provide them safe passage before the police enter, he said.        
	But how will the village squad come to know if police conduct a raid? We have our men planted everywhere. Our men are keeping a close eye on all the joint force camps and roads, the youth explained.        
	On the way back to Jhargram, Chottu, sitting on the bamboo bench, waved and said: Bhalo kore likhben amra desher shotru na (Write properly, we are not the enemy of the state).        
	Dinabandhu was standing under the same tree with the goat. He started fiddling with the mobile. Probably to inform Chottu that I was leaving.

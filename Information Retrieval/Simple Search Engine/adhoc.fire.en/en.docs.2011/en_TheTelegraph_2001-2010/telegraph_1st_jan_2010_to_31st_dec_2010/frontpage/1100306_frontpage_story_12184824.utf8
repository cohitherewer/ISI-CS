          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                               
	Mumbai, March 5: A former Shiv Sena legislator has been asked by the high court to cough up Rs 5 lakh and compensate a five-star hotel which was attacked during a protest organised by his party.        
	The ruling comes as a shot in the arm for public and private entities that have often been the target of political vandalism.        
	Sitaram Dalvi, a former MLA from Andheri, had led the violent Sena protest against Hotel Sahar Intercontinental in January 2009 against the retrenchment of some employees.        
	Bombay High Court, hearing Dalvis petition for a stay on a penalty order issued by the Mumbai collector, had yesterday granted a days time to the Sena leader to find out if his party would bear the cost of the damage caused to the hotel.         
	Dalvi informed the court today that he had been unable to contact party chief Bal Thackeray, executive president Uddhav Thackeray or senior leaders such as Sanjay Raut. The division bench of Justice Ranjana Desai and Justice Mridula Bhatkar then ordered Dalvi to deposit Rs 5.88 lakh with the court by Monday.        
	This is not a question of money, but is a question of what signal should go to the people. This breaking of property, burning (of) buses and trains must be banned, Justice Desai said.         
	The bench remarked that political parties had a constitutional right to organise protests, dharnas and sit-ins, but destruction of private or public property could not be permitted. The bench cited the Supreme Courts 2009 judgment that laid down guidelines for recovering damage from organisers of political protests.        
	Bengal has often seen similar attacks by political parties on public properties and private entities, but no one has been made to pay up for the damages caused.         
	The Maharashtra government has taken a strong view of the violent protests by the Sena and the MNS over the last two years, and amended the Bombay Police Act to ensure that damage caused to private and public property could be recovered from the political parties concerned.         
	Last year, the Mumbai collector had invoked this Act to order Dalvi to pay Rs 7.88 lakh as compensation for the damage caused to the hotel.         
	In January 2009, over 500 workers had staged a dharna outside Hotel Sahar Intercontinental, close to the airport, to demand the reinstatement of 21 sacked employees. The group had vandalised the hotel when the management refused to give in to the demand.                     
	Following the collectors order, Dalvi deposited Rs 2 lakh but moved the high court questioning why he alone had been asked to pay the fine when the Sena group consisted of several people, including senior leader Sanjay Raut.        
	Raut said the party would help Dalvi deposit the amount.        
	In 2006, Bombay High Court had directed the Sena-BJP combine to pay Rs 20 lakh each as fine for organising a Mumbai bandh in 2003 in the aftermath of a terror attack. Both parties had deposited the amount.

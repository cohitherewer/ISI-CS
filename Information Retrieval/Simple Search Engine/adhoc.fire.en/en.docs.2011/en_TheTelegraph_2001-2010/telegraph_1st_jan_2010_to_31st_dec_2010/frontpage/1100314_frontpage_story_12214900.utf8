The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Safety catch in Nayachar deal

  - Pact allows alternate projects        SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, March 13: The Nayachar land cannot be used for any purpose other than building a chemical hub but a de facto exit clause has left room for alternate projects if all approvals do not come through, according to a copy of the agreement accessed by The Telegraph.        
	The agreement was signed by businessman Prasoon Mukherjees PCR Chemicals and the Bengal government in November last year. PCR Chemicals is a joint venture between Mukherjees Universal Success, the Indonesian Salim Group and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.        
	The virtual exit clause  the agreement does not use such a term  assumes significance against the backdrop of the public posture by Mamata Banerjee that she would not allow a chemical hub there because of environmental concerns.         
	Mamata has been speaking of using the land  running into 12,000 acres on an island  for eco-tourism without going into specifics. We dont want a danav shilpa (demon industry) there. We shall build an eco-park instead of a chemical hub, she had said in January this year.        
	The agreement uses the word alternate project but the subsequent explanation makes it clear that the document means alternative.        
	According to the agreement, the state government has the right to terminate the lease agreement if the land is used for any purpose other than building an additional processing area for a PCPIR (petroleum, chemical, petrochemical investment region).        
	However, one clause adds that if the developer (PCR Chemicals) fails to implement the project for reasons beyond the control of the company and the state government, both parties can look for another mutually acceptable project.         
	The deciding situations will include unexpected and disruptive events (force majeure) and the want of statutory approvals or sanctions or permissions or clearances in spite of the best efforts.         
	The mention of such situations is not unusual but giving the same developer the option of exploring the possibility of another project in the same area is not very common, an analyst said.         
	The Union environment ministry, run by the Congress that shares power at the Centre with Mamata, has not yet given its clearance to the project.        
	The agreement gives the parties three (2+1) years to come up with the alternative plan. After that, the developer can exit and return the land to the government.        
	The developer will be given compensation for development of infrastructure thereon as may be decided through due and recognised process at the material time, says the document which has not been made public, although at least one application has been filed under the Right to Information Act.        
	This clause means the agreement has factored in the possibility of a change of guard in Bengal after the Assembly elections next year. Unwittingly or otherwise, the agreement does leave room for manoeuvre by Mamata, who has been courting investors since the Lok Sabha elections, if she comes to power in Bengal and is required to take a decision on the fate of the Nayachar project.         
	PCR Chemicals needs to submit a master plan by the end of May.

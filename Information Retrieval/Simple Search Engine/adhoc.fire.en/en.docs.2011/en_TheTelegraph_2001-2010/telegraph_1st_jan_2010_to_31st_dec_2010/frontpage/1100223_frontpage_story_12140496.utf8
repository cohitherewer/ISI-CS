                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Accused turn judge in Bengal 
  - Two odd names on Shilda panel         A STAFF REPORTER                            A masked EFR special IG, Benoy Chakraborty, addressing the media on Saturday                                        
	Calcutta, Feb. 22: IG Benoy Chakraborty at least wore a mask. The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government does not need any such fig leaf.        
	The state home secretary today announced a three-member panel to fix the responsibility for the Shilda fiasco, taking care to handpick two of the accused to play the role of judges.        
	The committee is made of home secretary Ardhendu Sen himself; the inspector-general of police (western range), Kuldiep Singh; and the additional director-general of the CID, Raj Kanojia.        
	The committee has been asked to establish if there had been lapses that led to the Maoist attack on the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in which 24 policemen were killed and, if so, who should be held accountable.        
	The director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh, is not part of the committee, possibly because of his differences with Sen on suggestions that intelligence alerts were ignored.        
	However, other than Kanojia, the two other members have been linked to alleged oversights or inaction related to the camp  the very issues the panel is expected to probe and fix blame.        
	Home secretary Sen and IG Kuldiep Singh were in a position to prevent the camp from being relocated to a vulnerable market or shift it later in the face of reported warnings from officers in the field.        
	A day after the police massacre, Sen had said that three hours before the attack, he had an intelligence input about a Maoist build-up in Shilda. However, because of the remoteness of the place, there was delay in the information being relayed. Sources later said the input was vague and hardly actionable.        
	However, several officials today wondered if it was ethical of Sen to sit on such a committee when he himself had hinted at an intelligence lapse.        
	 If he had the information  and by his own admission he did  then being one of the top bureaucrats in the state, couldnt he have ensured that it got relayed to the EFR camp at Shilda? an official asked. How long would it have taken?        
	The same officials said that there were lapses on the part of Kuldiep Singh as well. As IG western range, it was his duty to ensure that the EFR camp was not shifted out of the secure premises of the irrigation department to the unsafe primary health centre in the middle of a bustling market.        
	Even if the transfer had been done under CPM pressure to protect its party office, he should have ensured that it was relocated to a safer area, especially since the special IG, EFR, Benoy Chakraborty, had written to the police directorate in November last year pointing out the risks associated with housing the camp in the health centre, the officials said.        
	The CRPF, which was also asked to set up a camp at the primary health centre, refused to do so after spending a night there because the central force realised that security would be severely compromised. The team found that the sight of defence or line of sight  visibility of the enemy in the field for clean shots  was poor.        
	There were too many things obstructing the line of fire, an official said. So why was there so much delay in relocating the camp to a safer location? Can a person involved in the process of relocation, the delay of which led to the killing of the policemen, be on the committee probing lapses?        
	Explaining the delay, Kuldiep Singh said today: Shifting a camp takes time and we were looking for a suitable place.

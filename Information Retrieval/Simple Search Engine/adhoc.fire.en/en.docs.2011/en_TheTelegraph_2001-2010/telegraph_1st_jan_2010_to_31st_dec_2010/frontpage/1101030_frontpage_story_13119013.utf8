	New Delhi, Oct. 29: Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan has been left with few friends in his party after the controversy over a Mumbai high-rise that was apparently planned for Kargil widows but was allotted to bureaucrats, defence officers, politicians and well-connected people.        
	Congress sources said Chavan would definitely have to go if the investigations uncovered any wrongdoing on his part. The chief minister is expected to reach Delhi tomorrow and meet the party leadership.        
	The mood in the party seems to have turned hostile towards the chief minister amid reports that five of his relatives were among the beneficiaries. Chavans role as revenue minister in the erstwhile Vilasrao Deshmukh government is also under the scanner.        
	What has incensed most Congress leaders is that the list of flat allottees contains an S.B. Chavan which happens to be the name of Chavans late father, who was a Union home minister. The name of the chief ministers mother-in-law, who died recently, also figures in the list along with those of three other relatives.        
	If these are correct information, he will have to face the music. There is no way he can survive, a senior leader told The Telegraph, revealing that Sonia Gandhi had taken a grim view.        
	Asked if Chavan would be sacked, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said: A.K. Antony has said there will be a thorough inquiry. Action will be taken against those found guilty.        
	Told that there was a strong prima facie case against Chavan, Tiwari said: We would not like to shield anybody found involved. But we cannot put the cart before the horse. Wait for the outcome of the inquiry.        
	His words indicated the Congress was not in a mood to brazen it out.        
	Antony, the party leader in charge of Maharashtra affairs, may not want to brush the controversy under the carpet after having built his career on the plank of personal integrity. This is especially so because the controversy involves his ministry of defence.        
	The Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society in Colaba, built allegedly on defence land, was originally planned as a six-storey building for Kargil widows before being mysteriously converted into a 31-storey high-rise for powerful people, reports have said.        
	But the Congress high commands dilemma is that the crisis has come at a time it had almost made up its mind to sack Maharashtra unit chief Manikrao Thakre for his indiscretion of talking money matters on camera.        
	If both the state president and the chief minister are removed at one stroke, the partys position will weaken in relation to Sharad Pawar.        
	Senior leaders are also aware of Sonias general reluctance to axe chief ministers. She has removed only two in the past 12 years: Antony from Kerala once, and Vilasrao from Maharashtra twice.        
	There were strong campaigns against other chief ministers, such as Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Sheila Dikshit and Amarinder Singh, but she chose to stick with them.

  - Good mental faculties make organ ideal sample: Nimhans           G.S. MUDUR                       The bed in AMRI Hospitals on which Basu died.   Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: The neuropathologist who built Indias first and only human brain bank wants to turn Jyoti Basus brain into a potential resource for scientists trying to fathom fine differences between healthy and diseased brains.        
	The brain repository set up 15 years ago at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans), Bangalore, has a collection of brains of deceased individuals from all age groups, chemically preserved for pathological analysis.        
	Basus brain would be extremely useful for the kind of research that our repository facilitates, said S.K. Shankar, professor and head of neuropathology at Nimhans. Basus body is to be donated to the SSKM Hospital, Calcutta, on Tuesday. He appeared to have good mental faculties until the end. His brain could become a normal control sample that we need for studies comparing healthy brains with the brains of aged people with neurodegenerative diseases.        
	Nimhans has adopted a standard operating protocol under which every donated brain is anonymised  a code with an age is assigned to the brain, so that not even scientists who work on the brain have knowledge of who it belonged to.        
	If we do indeed get Basus brain, we will follow this procedure. Well assign a code and indicate the age of the brain  that is it. Scientists who use the tissues for studies have no need to know its origins, he said.        
	Brain tissue viable for research may be extracted up to 24 hours from a body preserved with ice. But a brain may be extracted from an embalmed body after any duration. Structural and genetic studies may be done on such brains.        
	Shankar said the brain of a nonagenarian would be of particular value to research aimed at comparing healthy brains with the brains of people who were suffering from Alzheimers disease.        
	In such studies, neuropathologists typically pick tiny sections of tissues from healthy brains and Alzheimers brains and seek out differences that might provide clues about the pathology of the disease.        
	The preservation process would allow certain structural and genetic studies on the brain, Shankar said. Present-day technology allows us to extract small amounts of proteins for molecular biology studies, he said.        
	A senior anatomist at the SSKM Hospital had said on Sunday that the body would be embalmed for preservation and possible use for medical lessons in human anatomy.        
	Shankar declined to say how many brains the Nimhans repository contains.        
	You dont ask someone how much they have in their bank, do you? he said. But we dont get enough. So every brain is valuable to us.

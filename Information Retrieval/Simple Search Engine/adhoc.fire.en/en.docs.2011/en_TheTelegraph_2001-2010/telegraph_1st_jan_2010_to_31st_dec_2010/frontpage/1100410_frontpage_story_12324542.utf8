  - Qazi declines in absence of Shoaib papers          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Sania, Shoaib: Another hurdle                                
	Hyderabad, April 9: Sania Mirzas marriage with Shoaib Malik was deferred this evening at the last minute after a surprise announcement in the morning that the wedding was to be held today and not on April 15 as widely expected.        
	The saying  Miyan biwi razi to kya karega qazi (when the couple are ready the priest has no choice)  was turned on its head as the qazi advised postponement because the families of the bride and the groom could not produce Shoaibs passport or a certified copy.        
	The Pakistan cricketers passport was impounded by Hyderabad police following the criminal complaint filed by Ayesha Siddiqui who had claimed to be his first wife. Although that case has now been settled, the passport is still lying with the police.        
	Ahmatullah Jafri, the deputy qazi of Golconda, who had supervised the talaknama between Shoaib and Ayesha on Wednesday, said late in the evening the wedding could not be performed without the passport or a copy as well as a copy of the visa.        
	Sanias father Imran Mirza sent a text message to reporters, informing them that the wedding had been postponed and a new date would be announced later.        
	The qazi said the passport was required as it would provide proof of the grooms age and of his legally tenable presence in the country for entry in the nikaahnama.         
	Qazis have become careful after a Hyderabad woman, Ameena, travelling to join her much older husband in the Gulf, was detained because the papers were not in order.        
	Family sources said when Shoaib landed here the plan was to hold the nikaah on April 9 and the reception on 15. But the developments earlier this week in the wake of Ayeshas claims had made all plans uncertain.         
	The ceaseless swirl of rumours and demonstrations almost daily in front of the Mirzas home in tony Jubilee Hills, however, led the families on both sides to decide to go ahead with the nikaah today.        
	Initially, the clerics had agreed but expressed helplessness later in the absence of the passport.

  - Panel member says September 3 too early to finalise names          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: The Bengal government is in danger of tripping on its own plan to fast-track Presidencys autonomy.         
	Even before efforts to find a suitable candidate  acceptable to the education czars of Alimuddin  formally take off, a member of the one-day-old search committee has ruled out the possibility of meeting the government deadline for appointing a vice-chancellor of Presidency University.         
	I have no idea about the deadlines for submitting the names of shortlisted candidates. In my opinion, September 3 will be too early for us to complete even the shortlisting of candidates, said P.N. Ghosh, the vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University and the convener of the search committee.        
	Ghosh, along with economist Amiya Bagchi and former director of Indian Statistical Institute Sankar Pal, is part of the three-member committee the higher education department has constituted to select the vice-chancellor.         
	Higher education secretary Satish Tiwary had told The Telegraph yesterday that the search committee would come up with its recommendations by September 3. Sources in his department said the government was expecting the search committee to draw up its first shortlist by August 20.         
	Ghosh, however, suggested that he might not be able to remain on the panel if there was pressure on him to complete the selection process in haste. I will not accept the invitation to join the committee if there is a deadline to finalise the selection of the vice-chancellor by September 3, said Ghosh.        
	Presidency has been given freedom with the hope to upgrade it to a world-class university. We have to be careful in selecting the vice-chancellor, Ghosh added.         
	The standard procedure to select a vice-chancellor has several steps starting with the formation of the search committee, which prepares a first list of around 10 candidates either on the basis of recommendations from academicians or from a pool of applicants. A scrutiny whittles down the list to three or four probable candidates, which are then forwarded  with names arranged alphabetically  to the chancellor, the governor in this case.                                       
	In most cases, the search committees in Bengal had hardly followed the standard process as the government and the party wanted their nominees for the top jobs, said a retired professor of a central university, adding that the process of selecting a vice-chancellor normally takes two to three months.         
	Setting a one-month deadline even before the delivery of formal appointment letters to two of the committee members  Bagchi and Ghosh  was too ambitious, added the professor.        
	If such deadlines are set even before the search starts, it raises natural questions about the process. Has the government made up its mind? Do they want to use the search committee only as a rubber stamp? asked an alumnus of the college.         
	According to the rulebook, the institution must have its first vice-chancellor within three months from the date of governors assent. As M.K. Narayanan had put his signature on the Presidency University Bill on July 7, the Bengal government has time till October 7.         
	The provisions in the act also specify that the duration of the term of the first vice-chancellor is only for a year. The first vice-chancellor can be re-appointed for the second term after the constitution of the policy-making bodies of the university.        
	Ghosh being the convenor of the panel, it is his responsibility to convene the meetings of the panel. The first meeting is likely to be convened sometime next week.         
	Although the process of selection of the search committee  familiar faces with known Left connections  has raised doubts about the intention of the government, sources in Writers Buildings said that the committee was given the mandate to find the best possible candidates.         
	The search committee will take suggestions from outsiders and go through the track record of all the candidates diligently before selecting the vice chancellor, said the government source.        
	Correction: The Telegraph report on Tuesday had said erroneously that Kaushik Basu, the adviser to the Union finance ministry, was an alumnus of Presidency College. We apologise for the mistake.

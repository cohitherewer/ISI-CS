	Yangon, Nov. 14: Aung San Suu Kyi today began her immediate mission of speaking and listening to human voices after seven years of incarceration with the radio but reconciliation seemed to be the overriding theme of her tightrope walk on the first full day of her freedom.        
	Suu Kyi told thousands of wildly cheering supporters that she would continue to fight for human rights and the rule of law in the military-controlled nation.         
	But, freed from seven years of house arrest, she also called for face-to-face talks with the juntas leader.        
	The Lady  as she is referred to in Myanmar  indicated she might urge the West to end sanctions that many say hurt ordinary people by allowing the junta to monopolise the countrys resource-rich economy. Besides, neighbours like India and China are already engaging themselves with the junta to pursue their strategic and energy interests.        
	The measured tone of her remarks indicated she was well aware that she was walking a tightrope in balancing the expectations of the countrys democracy movement and the realities of limited freedom under a tough military regime.        
	Speaking to more than 5,000 people at the dilapidated headquarters of her political party, the National League for Democracy, she urged her followers to work for national reconciliation  a phrase handpicked by India while reacting to her release yesterday.                                
	If we want to get what we want, we have to do it in the right way; otherwise we will not achieve our goal, however noble or correct it may be, she cautioned supporters at the party headquarters  the first stop for the Nobel Peace Prize laureate after leaving the lakeside residence that had been her prison.        
	Suu Kyi, 65, has come to symbolise the struggle for democracy in the isolated and secretive nation once known as Burma, which has been ruled by the military since 1962.        
	Energised as her supporters are, she still faces a military determined to cling to power, and any collision between the two could well land her back where she was until this weekend  house arrest and isolation.        
	The top-ranking US diplomat in Myanmar, charge daffaires Larry Dinger, was among diplomats who met her after her release. He said she spoke about the need for pragmatism and unity. The absence of fire-breathing rhetoric was no surprise to him.        
	Shes made clear to us that shes a pragmatic politician who wants to find pragmatic solutions to this countrys problems, he said.        
	Asked by a reporter what message she had for junta leader Senior General Than Shwe, Suu Kyi replied: Lets meet and talk. The two last met in secret talks in 2002 at the encouragement of the UN.        
	I am for national reconciliation. I am for dialogue. Whatever authority I have, I will use it to that end. I hope people will support me, she said.        
	She said she bore no grudge against those who had held her in detention for more than 15 of the last 21 years, adding that she had been treated well.        
	Suu Kyi thanked her followers and asked them to pray for those still imprisoned by the junta. Human rights groups say the government holds more than 2,200 political prisoners.        
	If my people are not free, how can I say I am free? Either we are all free together or we are not free together, she said.        
	Speaking of her isolation while under house arrest, Suu Kyi said she always felt free within myself. I kept myself pretty much on an even keel.        
	But she said that for years she had only listened to the radio, adding: Id like to listen to human voices.        
	Her release came just days after an election that was swept by the ruling juntas proxy political party and decried by western nations as a sham designed to perpetuate authoritarian control.        
	Many observers have questioned whether her release was timed by the junta to distract the worlds attention from the November 7 polls.        
	In what seemed a gesture of conciliation, the government mouthpiece, The New Light of Myanmar, reported her release in positive terms, saying that she had been granted a pardon due to her good behaviour and that the police stand ready to give her whatever help she needs.         
	It said she was being treated with leniency because she is the daughter of the nations founding hero, the assassinated General U. Aung San, and viewing that peace, tranquillity and stability will prevail and that no malice be held against each other.         
	On the sanctions, Suu Kyi said: If people really want sanctions to be lifted, I will consider this, she said. This is the time Burma needs help. We ask everyone to help us. Western nations. Eastern nations. The whole world. It all starts with dialogue.        
	Diplomats expect Suu Kyi to work with the West to end sanctions she once supported but which are now seen by many as contributing to chronic economic problems in the country of 50 million people where a third of the population lives in poverty.        
	Aside from political snares, Suu Kyi also faces possible threats to her personal well-being. In a 2003 incident that preceded her most recent detention, pro-junta thugs ambushed her motorcade, killing and brutalising supporters in what many believed was a military-orchestrated attempt on her life.        
	The Irish rock band U2, which has long campaigned for her freedom, expressed cautious joy at her release, explaining that it still feared for her safety.        
	We can only pray that those in the junta who decided on her release will start to see sense and seize this opportunity to begin a genuine dialogue towards democracy, the band said on its website.

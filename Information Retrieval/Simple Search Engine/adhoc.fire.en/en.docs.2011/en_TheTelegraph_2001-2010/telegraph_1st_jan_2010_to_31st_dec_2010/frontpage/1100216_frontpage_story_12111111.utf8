  - Home secy ready to relook cases        AMIT GUPTA KUMUD JENAMANI                       Chief minister Shibu Soren meets the wife (third from right) and daughter of abducted BDO Prashant Kumar Layek in Ranchi on Sunday				                                       
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Feb. 15: Helicopters began scouring the forests of Ghurabandha to search for the abducted Dalbhumgarh BDO amid indications that the state government was ready to make some conciliatory gestures in exchange of Prashant Kumar Layeks freedom.        
	The first official level statement in this regard came from home secretary J.B. Tubid who offered to reinvestigate cases against some Ghatshila villagers who the Maoists alleged had been falsely implicated by the state machinery.         
	We are ready to reinvestigate the cases disputed by the Naxalites. We will take special permission from the court as all the concerned villagers have already been chargesheeted, Tubid said in Ranchi.         
	Tubid maintained the reinvestigation would be done by a senior police officer and due process of law would be followed. I appeal to the Naxalites to safely release the abducted BDO and expect a fair deal from the government as far as reinvestigation of cases against the villagers is concerned, he said.        
	With the efforts to trace the 34-year-old BDO coming a cropper in the last two days, even the police arent averse to partially meeting the conditions of the rebels who have sought the release of a number of innocent villagers picked for sympathising and helping Maoists in the last six months.        
	In the absence of any written communique from the rebels, various numbers are doing the rounds. While some reports said Maoists wanted the release of three women who had surrendered in 2008, others put it at anything between 8 and 14.        
	According to intelligence sources in Ghatshila, the police were apparently thinking of releasing Ruia Munda and Ashwini Murmu, who were among those who had been apprehended during the time.        
	While Ruia was picked up from Gian village in rebel-infested Ghurabandha block, Murmu, a rural medical practitioner, was arrested from Maheshpur village.         
	DGP Neyaz Ahmad, who was camping at Ghatshila, said they could release those who had been held only if local villagers vouched for them. The villagers have to give us in writing that those arrested were innocent and had nothing to do with Maoists, he said, adding that the police would then look into their case afresh.                          
	If the claims of the Naxalites were genuine, we will certainly release those who have been arrested, Ahmad said.        
	The DGP, however, did not confirm the move to release Munda and Murmu.         
	Till now, the police have drawn a blank in their search for Layek, who was abducted in the afternoon of February 13 in the presence of over 200 people who had gathered at his office in Dalbhumgarh to attend a lok adalat.        
	As of now, the police were scanning Pawda Pahad and Dangra Pahad, both located deep inside the dense forests of Ghurabandha. Besides para-military forces and special task force jawans, we have also pressed into service choppers for air surveillance. The operation is on for tracing the BDO, Ahmad said.        
	According to intelligence sources, the BDOs abduction was the handiwork of CPI(Maoist) Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army at the behest of the outlawed outfits Mayurbhanj-Ghurabandha zonal committee.        
	Predictably, the move to free some of their supporters has drawn the criticism of Nagarik Suraksha Samity (NSS), a citizens vigilante group working against Maoist terror.         
	The government should not bow to the demands of Naxalites, said NSS president Shankar Chandra Hembra. Otherwise, this would give them (the Naxalites) a tool to set more and more rebels free from jails in Jharkhand and neighbouring states.

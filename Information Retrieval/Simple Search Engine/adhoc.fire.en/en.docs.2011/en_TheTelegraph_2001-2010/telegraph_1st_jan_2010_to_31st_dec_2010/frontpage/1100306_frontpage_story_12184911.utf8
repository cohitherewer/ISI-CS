  - 3-year-old found dead in Melbourne days before return to India        PTI AMP; OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  (From top) Gurshan Singh Channa, a three-year-old Indian boy who had gone to Australia with his family, was found dead 30km from where he was staying in Melbourne; the boys mother Harpreet Kaur Channa; toys and flowers outside their home on Friday.                                      
	Melbourne/Chandigarh, March 5: A three-year-old Indian boy visiting Australia was found dead by a road 30km from home yesterday with police clueless about how he died.        
	Gurshan Singh Channa, from Punjabs Faridkot district, was to return to India with his parents  father Harjit and mother Harpeet  on March 13.        
	His body was found by a municipal worker on a patch of grassland near Melbourne airport yesterday, six hours after he had vanished from his home in the northern suburbs of the city.        
	Harpreet, studying in Australia, rang the police after her son couldnt be traced for 45 minutes.        
	Sir Ken Jones, deputy police commissioner of Victoria, said it was clear that this wasnt a death from natural causes, but added that we dont yet have a 100 per cent conclusion on what the actual cause was.         
	The police said the autopsy had failed to determine the cause of death. There is no visible sign of the cause of death, Jones said, adding his officers were speaking to the boys parents for clues. But the lack of witnesses appeared to hinder the probe.         
	Were pretty convinced there are people out there who may have seen something, he said. The body was found fully clothed, in blue jeans and a grey top.         
	Six to eight adults shared the residence with the toddler being the only child. The Age newspaper of Melbourne quoted one of the housemates, Sim Kaur, as saying she was home when the child disappeared.        
	The family initially feared the boy had tried to follow his father to a local library, which they visited regularly. The mother called her husband only to find that the boy was not with him and then alerted the police, the newspaper said.        
	Sim told the paper that the front and rear doors of the house were often left unlocked when there were people inside. It is easy to unlock. He could unlock it himself, she said. The boys uncle, Darshan Singh, said over the phone from Faridkot: It is hard to comprehend that he is no more. His death is shocking to all of us.        
	Neighbours left cards and flowers outside the family home in Melbourne. Another innocent life is taken, what is the world coming to when children are not safe in their own home, said a card, according to The Age.

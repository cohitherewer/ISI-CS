The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Patta power to fight rebel menace
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Patta power to fight rebel menace
          SANTOSH K. KIRO                      Saranda forests                          
	Ranchi, March 21: Implementation of the Forest Act may have been dismal in Jharkhand so far, but Operation Greenhunt has made the district administrations realise that speeding up the task of distributing pattas or land documents to tribal villagers would only add teeth to the ongoing fight against Maoist rebels.        
	In some areas, deputy commissioners have got down to implementing the Act in the face of stiff opposition from Maoists, who do not want them to succeed so that the villagers can continue to feel disillusioned.        
	In other districts, the process of withdrawing cases of encroachment in forests, filed against villagers by the forest department, too has picked up tempo, in a bid to woo tribals away from the Maoists.        
	People are not coming to claim the land they are tilling. Those whose pattas are ready, are also not coming to take them. And its all because the rebels have threatened them not to take any benefits from the government, said Sunil Kumar, deputy commissioner of West Singhbhum.         
	Kumar has already distributed 950 pattas and another 200 would be distributed within the next three or four days. He said the district was carrying out a special drive in 14 forest villages of Chaibasa, considered Maoist strongholds.         
	In Manoharpur and Goelkera blocks, the Maoists have warned villagers against collecting pattas from us. I am sending my officials to the villages  which are inaccessible by road  to get the pattas distributed, Kumar added.         
	Jharkhand has a sizeable tribal population and over one lakh tribal households stand to benefit from the Act. Former Governor K. Sankaranarayanan had taken the implementation of the Act very seriously and even ordered the administration to distribute one lakh pattas by December 2009. However, only 800 pattas could be distributed during the period.         
	The state has since made rapid progress and till date has distributed 4,835 pattas. Another 27,000 applications are being verified by different district administrations. The work of inviting and verifying the applications and making pattas has now picked up tempo. We are speeding up the work so that the faith of the villagers in the government increases, said M.N. Kerketta, tribal welfare commissioner, the nodal officer ensuring implementation of the Act.               
	In the rebel heartland of Palamau, deputy commissioner Amitabh Kaushal has already distributed 174 pattas and another 300 applications are being verified. He has also instituted a committee to study the cases of encroachment of forests filed by the forest department, so that they can be withdrawn.         
	After verifying the authenticity of encroachment cases, we will refer them to the public prosecutor in order to legally withdraw them, said Kaushal.         
	The districts of West and East Singhbhum, Ranchi, Latehar, Lohardaga, Palamau, Gumla, Simdega and Khunti are areas with large concentration of tribal population. Though 18 of the 24 districts of the state are considered rebel prone, it is in these districts with huge forest tracts that they are at their strongest. Therefore, winning the confidence of the tribal villagers is important for the battle against the Naxalites to be won.         
	 The anti-Naxalite operation has not deterred the work of implementation of the Act. In fact, we are speeding up the task, said Rahul Kumar Purwar, DC of Latehar. He, however, accepted that he had not been able to perform well in implementing the Act. He blamed it mainly on lack of circle officers and forest range officers in the district.         
	 His Gumla counterpart Rahul Sharma will distribute 250 pattas in the next couple of days. We are now verifying about 800 applications, he said.         
	The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 grants title rights or ownership to land that is being farmed by tribals or forest dwellers as on December 13, 2005, subject to a maximum of four hectares. Ownership is only for land that is actually being cultivated by the concerned family as on that date.

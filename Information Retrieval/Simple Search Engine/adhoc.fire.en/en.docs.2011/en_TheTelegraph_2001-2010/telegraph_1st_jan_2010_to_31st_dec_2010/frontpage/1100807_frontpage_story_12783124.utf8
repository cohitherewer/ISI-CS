The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Assam at risk on I-Day: Delhi
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Assam at risk on I-Day: Delhi
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: Assam is the most threatened among the states this Independence Day and eyes are fixed on two individuals  Rifikhang Goyari of the anti-talks NDFB and Antu Choudang of Ulfa  capable as they are to inflict damage.         
	Top officials in the Union home ministry, led by home secretary G.K. Pillai, held a meeting to review security in Assam with state chief secretary N.K. Das and director-general of police Shankar Barua this evening. The lengthy meeting chalked out measures to reduce chances of another blast or shootout on or around August 15.         
	While we have sent advisories to everyone regarding Independence Day, the threat is most pronounced in Assam because of Ulfa and NDFB, said a home ministry official.         
	Assam was rocked by blasts in Dhekiajuli and Goalpara districts last month.         
	Antu and Rifikhang alias Rajen have assumed importance previously accorded to Ulfa leader Arabinda Rajkhowa and NDFB chief Ranjan Daimary, both of whom are in jail now.         
	Antu, a field commander of Ulfa and a close aide of the outfits commander-in-chief Paresh Barua, was suspected to be behind the current spate of violence in the state while Rifikhang, also a field commander, took over charge of NDFB after Daimarys arrest.         
	If Antu is arrested, I am sure Barua will be upset. He is one of the most important cogs in the Ulfa wheel for Barua, a source said. Going by intelligence agencies intercepts, Barua himself is believed to be in Pakistan for the past four months.         
	While Rajkhowa and many others are contemplating a dialogue, Barua has obstinately stayed away from talks.         
	Sources said Barua is relying heavily on Antu and his men who are experts in supply of arms and in logistics.         
	They said with the disappearance of leadership and political understanding in the top echelons of these militant outfits, chances of wayward action by renegade field commanders have increased. What are left are the real extortionists, the home ministry official said.

	Any visitor, wandering through the lobby of a certain city-centre hotel in posh Sandton, just outside Johannesburg, may be greeted by the sound of an amateur pianist caressing the keys as he seeks peace of mind away from the madding football crowds of the 2010 World Cup.        
	Most of the few hundred who have had this singular pleasure probably did not recognise the pianist with his face down, concentrating on his finger work.        
	But this is because these visitors are seeing him out of context: they are more used to seeing him on their television screens, face locked in serious concentration, with his football team bidding to win the World Cup.        
	This is the idiosyncratic Bert Van Marwijk, manager of Holland, who are about to emerge from the shadows, the forgotten team of the 2010 finals, when they take on Brazil or Chile in the quarter-finals.        
	One goal in each half from the revived Arjen Robben and the outstanding Wesley Sneijder drove Holland through to the victory over Slovakia.        
	That almost put a smile on the face of the coach who so much admires Barcelona and set his team the tough challenge of playing like the Catalans at these finals. That is an odd twist of historical fate: back in 1973 and 1974, Barcelona signed Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens because they wanted to play like Holland.        
	Van Marwijk also wants to turn history around. He has brought Holland to South Africa determined to see them win the World Cup for the first time by exorcising the personal and professional arrogance that has cost the Dutch at so many tournaments down the years.        
	Its a Dutch problem, he told me. Its something in our national character and in our football character. We are a small country but a creative country and we have what Johan Cruyff always described as a kind of arrogance. We cannot let that arrogance become negative. It must be a positive arrogance. When Holland are good we are very, very good and then you are in danger of losing.        
	Holland were late arrivals on the grand stage. This was largely because they did not adopt professionalism until the mid-1950s, far later than England, Spain, Italy, France, etc. But they made up for lost time.        
	Cruyffs Ajax Amsterdam won the Champions Cup (forerunner of the Champions League) three times at the start of the 1970s, playing a breathtaking style known as total football in which players of enormous skill, pace and versatility exchanged positions on the pitch at will.        
	Ajax  along with Feyenoord for whom Van Marwijk then played  provided the nucleus of the Dutch team who were runners-up in the World Cups of 1974 and 1978. Later, a new generation inspired by Ruud Gullit, Marco Van Basten and Frank Rijkaard won the European Championship in 1988.        
	But the defining achievement of World Cup glory continues to elude them. They were fourth in 1998, missed 2002 and fell in the second round in 2006. Hence this is already Hollands best World Cup in 12 years.        
	Van Marwijk does not want to spoil his teams potential by adopting the closed ritiro existence which most of their rivals prefer. Hence the city-centre hotel.        
	He says: I remember, when I was a player, how boring it was being shut up in a hotel for even just two or three days.         
	So I know that it is not good for Dutch players to be in the same hotel over six weeks. This is why we chose the hotel we did: so the players can walk out and mix with ordinary people in their day-to-day lives.        
	And the coach, of course, can play the piano whenever he likes, for as long as he likes or, at least, until Friday.

  -Ovation fills Liu vacuum
          OUR BUREAU                            Liu Xiaobo                                  
	Dec. 10: An empty chair today became large enough to seat the planet, never mind it was a world without China and 15 other nations. India, too, found a toehold  among the audience and on the podium.        
	Jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in a ceremony where he was represented by the empty chair.        
	Liu dedicated it from prison to the lost souls of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. True to style, China called the award in Oslo a political farce.        
	Inside the Oslo City Hall where the ceremony was being conducted, Norwegian Nobel Committee chairperson Thorbjorn Jagland called for Lius release, receiving an unusual standing ovation at the international gathering.         
	He has not done anything wrong. He must be released, Jagland said. He noted that neither Liu nor his closest relatives were able to attend the ceremony. It was the first time in 74 years that the $1.4-million award was not handed over, because Liu is serving an 11-year sentence in China on subversion charges for urging sweeping changes to Beijings one-party communist political system.        
	This fact alone shows that the award was necessary and appropriate, said Jagland, who was blunt with his words, though he acknowledged the might of China.        
	Among the audience, which responded with a resounding round of applause, was Banbit A. Roy, Indias ambassador to Norway. This year, 16 ambassadors, including those from China, Russia and Pakistan, declined to attend, Nobel officials said, although not all characterised their absence as a direct result of the intense pressure and threats of reprisal from China.        
	India figured in Jaglands speech too  on one count that China cannot browbeat its neighbour on: democracy.        
	Decolonisation after the Second World War gave a number of countries, first in Asia and then in Africa, the chance to govern themselves with respect for basic human rights. With India in the lead, many of them seized the opportunity, Jagland said, eulogising the crusade of activists like Liu.        
	Jagland did acknowledge Chinas achievements. We respect Chinas extraordinary accomplishment in lifting millions out of poverty.        
	Admitting that China cannot be ignored, Jagland said: The fate of China will be the fate of the world. If China is able to develop a social market economy with full civil rights, it will have a positive impact on the world as a whole.        
	Norwegian actress Liv Ullman read Lius statement, I Have No Enemies, which he delivered in a Chinese court in 2009 before he was jailed.        
	But the standing ovation for Liu that reverberated around the world was not allowed to waft across the Great Wall. Both CNN and BBC TV channels went black at 8pm local time for nearly an hour, exactly when the Oslo ceremony took place.        
	Security outside Lius Beijing apartment, where his wife Liu Xia has been held incommunicado, was heavy. In a text message, one of Lius brothers apologised, saying his phone was being monitored.        
	Perhaps, last years Peace Nobel winner President Barack Obama summed up from Washington the mood of most of the world today. Liu Xiaobo is far more deserving of this award than I was, Obama said.        
	Beijing is unlikely to be able to dismiss that statement in its entirety.                    WRITTEN WITH REPORTS FROM NYTNS AND AP

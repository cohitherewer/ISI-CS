	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Feb. 18: Maoists continued to keep the Jharkhand government on tenterhooks today ignoring chief minister Shibu Sorens promise of accepting their demands yesterday in return for the safe release of abducted BDO, Prashant Layek.        
	Throughout the day, there were conflicting reports that the rebels may have released Layek at an undisclosed location. Two TV news channels claimed Musli village near Gura police picket as one such location, but senior police officials refused to confirm it.        
	The Maoists, who abducted the Dalbhumgarh BDO on 13 February, have asked the state government to release 14 villagers lodged in Ghatshila sub-divisional jail in East Singhbhum for over two years.        
	Today, the state administration got permission from a Ghatshila court for re-investigating six of the 14 cases, which the chief minister promised to reopen to ensure BDOs freedom.         
	Zonal IG Rezi Dung Dung said in Jamshedpur that their request to the court was for all 14 undertrials. But, the court has accepted only six cases, he said from Dalbhumgarh.        
	The Soren government indicated its willingness to negotiate the release of the BDO within 48 hours of the abduction when it realised that search operations in the forests of Ghurabandha werent leading anywhere.        
	There was no communication from the Maoists till late evening, said Dung Dung, indicating that the police as well as senior officials were hoping for some good news, given that the chief minister had committed to reopening the cases.        
	Yesterday, the zonal IG visited the jail and met eight of the 14 who the Naxalites claimed had been jailed on false charges. While six of the eight were jailed for providing food and firewood to rebels, he said two appeared to be victims of police highhandedness.        
	The two, a father-daughter duo, were reportedly framed by a sub-inspector who was once married to Jasmi, the woman in question. He colluded with some officials of Ghurabandha police station and implicated them in Naxalite cases.         
	He said the two cases would be fasttracked.        
	A senior official in Ranchi confirmed that search operations had been put on hold to make it easier for the rebels to free their hostage.         
	Sensing that the state government was cornered, Maoists stepped up their demands yesterday, but home secretary J.B. Tubid called them bogus.

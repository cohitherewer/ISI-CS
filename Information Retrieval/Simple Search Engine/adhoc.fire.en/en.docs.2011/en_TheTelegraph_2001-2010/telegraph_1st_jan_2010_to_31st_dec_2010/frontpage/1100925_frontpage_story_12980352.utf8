          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Qureshi, Ahmedinajad                          
	New York, Sept. 24: Foreign minister S.M. Krishnas crowded schedule of bilateral meetings yesterday led to a chance encounter between him and Pakistans foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.         
	Fatefully, the Iranians played an unintended role in that encounter.        
	Krishna had left the General Assembly for a bilateral meeting and was already waiting for his car when Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad walked into the VVIP tent from where cars pick up leaders. In protocol-bound UN, this meant that Ahmadinejads car got precedence over the others since he is a head of state.        
	That meant Krishnas car was held up by UN protocol to let Ahmadinejad leave first and in the interval Qureshi walked into the tent to catch his vehicle. It was then that the two foreign ministers came face to face with each other.        
	Indias ambassador to the UN, Hardeep Singh Puri, said Krishna and Qureshi exchanged pleasantries and the Indian minister enquired about flood situation in Pakistan. Qureshi thanked Krishna for Indias flood relief contribution of $25 million. Puri said there would be more such chance encounters in coming days, adding that nothing more should be read into the incident.

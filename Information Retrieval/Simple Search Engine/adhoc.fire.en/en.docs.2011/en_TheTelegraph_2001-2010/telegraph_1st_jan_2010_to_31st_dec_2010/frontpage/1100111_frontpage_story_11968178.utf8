          VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR                            Teklal Mahto: Little to cheer                                  
	Hazaribagh, Jan. 10: Senior JMM leader and Mandu legislator Teklal Mahto is upset.        
	Teklal left the Raj Bhavan in a huff yesterday when he realised his name did not figure in the list of new ministers. However, he refused to speculate why he was not inducted in the cabinet. His son, Prakash Patel, though admitted that his father had left for Vishnugarh today after losing hope of a ministerial berth.        
	While Teklal chose to stay mum, party workers and those considered close to him insisted that he was kept out by Soren as the latter wanted to teach him a lesson. Sources added that Teklals revolt in undivided Bihar had not been forgotten by Soren. Teklal played the lead role in saving the then Lalu Prasad government by forming JMM (Mardi) with eight other legislators.        
	This time, not only did the chief minister keep Teklal out, he dealt a double blow by inducting the veterans relative, Mathura Mahto, as minister. Mathuras daughter is married to Teklals younger son, Jai Prakash Patel.        
	JMM leaders confirmed that when Teklal realised during the oath-taking ceremony that he would not be among those being sworn in, he went up to Soren and vented his anger. He reportedly reminded the chief minister of his contribution to the party. He then left the venue with his supporters.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph on behalf of his father, Prakash acknowledged the Raj Bhavan episode. When nothing was there for him, then what was the use of staying? he asked, defending his fathers decision to leave the venue.         
	Sources said Teklal would decide his future course of action after talking to partymen in Mandu. But he was not expected to do anything in a hurry and would wait and watch.         
	Teklals political career has seen many ups and downs. He was MLA for four successive terms from Mandu between 1985 and 2004. He contested the parliamentary elections from Giridih in 2004 and won. JMM supported the Congress-led government at the Centre and two berths, one cabinet and another minister of state, was given to the party. Soren became Union coal minister but refused to back Teklals candidature as a minister of state.         
	Partymen said Teklal had a good base in the party and would definitely create trouble for Soren in the future.

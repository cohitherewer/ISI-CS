The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sonia amp; Singh pull two ways on Omar
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sonia amp; Singh pull two ways on Omar
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                  Manmohan Singh, Omar Abdullah and Sonia Gandhi                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Differences have slowly surfaced between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi over the continuance of Omar Abdullah as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.        
	The Prime Minister has, for a while, favoured a change on account of Omars failure to contain violence and restore public confidence.         
	Sonia, and Rahul Gandhi, have consistently blocked any anti-Omar move on two grounds: one, he is the elected leader of both his party and the Assembly, and, two, easing him out could reopen the long, and temporarily shut, chapter of recriminations between the Nehru-Gandhis and the Abdullahs with adverse consequences for the strife-torn state.        
	But as Congress bosses continue to back Omar, the Centres sense is that the chief minister is using high-quarters support in Delhi not only as cushion but also as cover for his political and administrative failures.         
	Yesterdays shrill anti-New Delhi posturing by Omar in the Assembly has served to bolster the case of those who argue that the chief minister has been masking his poor performance by shifting the onus for the crisis on the Centre.        
	They have taken a particularly dim view of Omars virtual repudiation of the Prime Ministers economic and employment initiatives as part of corrective measures and the manner in which he chose to shift blame from himself.        
	Arguing that Kashmir is not an ordinary problem, Omar told the Assembly that the crisis was not going to be solved by packages and jobs dont blame me if things go wrong, he warned.         
	He also sailed fairly close to the Hurriyat line in demanding that Pakistan as well as PoK be involved in any solution, which would have to be a political one.        
	The chief minister suddenly seemed to up his ante, questioning the Centres interventions, protesting being treated like a puppet and even rubbing the delicate integration issue in a manner that has created some alarm in Delhis power corridors.        
	The accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India has taken place but the state has not merged with the country, only acceded to it under certain conditions. Hence it cant be placed on a par with Hyderabad or Junagadh, Omar told the Assembly, displaying a sudden belligerence of temper.        
	Almost livid that the autonomy demand has found no takers, Omar went on to say: If this is not carried forward, where does seriousness lie on the issue?. When we talk of autonomy we do talk of granting it under the Indian Constitution, we are not breaking Jammu and Kashmir from the rest of the country but we do want autonomy, we are not puppets, there can be no remote control.        
	Omars Assembly speech has rankled more than just the BJP, which demanded his resignation. Officially, the Congress appeared unperturbed by his sabre-rattling. Toeing his top brass, general secretary Digvijay Singh said there was nothing to be upset about in Omar saying he wasnt a puppet. But beyond what was said for form, the response is more layered.        
	A Congress leader from the state told The Telegraph: This is classical Abdullah family tactic; when they cannot manage the ground or are found lacking, they blame New Delhi. We have given Omar all the support he needs politically and administratively, but as chief minister he is the man the buck stops with, he has to take responsibility for what has been happening.        
	One sense among Kashmir policy makers is that Omar adopted a shrill tone to regain some credibility with his home constituency and should, therefore, not be taken seriously.         
	But they also believe it to be a double-edged thing  Omar is trying to put New Delhi on the defensive on the autonomy issue and projecting himself as one who is ready to make sacrifices for the Kashmiri cause.        
	Unable to break the deadlock, Manmohan has been despondent on the Kashmir situation and increasingly convinced that Omar is unable to get his act together.         
	Manmohan has also, on occasion, articulated his pessimism even as he has personally backed efforts to contain the drift.        
	Speaking to newspaper editors last month, he had said the government was groping for a solution in Kashmir. The drift emerging from politicians and officials who interact with Manmohan is that Omar has belied expectations despite getting unstinted support.        
	There is no confirmation whether the matter of Omars continuance in office has come up directly between Manmohan and Sonia. But the Abdullahs have, in the recent past, betrayed anxiety on this count. Particularly when Manmohan decided to host PDP patron Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and daughter Mehbooba for undercover talks around the time of the all-party meeting on Kashmir in mid-September.        
	Although he did not attend the all-party session, the elder Mufti happened to be in Delhi for a series of health checkups. Sources have told The Telegraph that extreme care was taken to keep the meeting between Manmohan and the Muftis under wraps.        
	They were driven from Kashmir House to Ashok Hotel in a private car sans escort. There, they were picked up by SPG chief Bharat Wanchoo and brought to 7 Race Course Road.        
	The meeting, sources said, lasted an hour and was immediately followed by talks with Sonia at 10 Janpath. Nobody quite knows whether there was any talk of reviving the Congress-PDP alliance. Although Manmohan is known to respect the Mufti and was a little miffed when he was made to give up chief ministership as part of the power-sharing arrangement in 2005, Sonia is firmly for the Congress-NC alliance and Omar as chief minister.         
	PDP sources have confirmed, though, that the Muftis told both Manmohan and Sonia that removing Omar had to be the starting point for any turnaround in the Valley.        
	The meetings prompted the senior Abdullah, Farooq, to embark on a panicked set of meetings with top central leaders, including the Prime Minister and Sonia.

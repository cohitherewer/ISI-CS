          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Anarkali with a picture of her son Asfar. Picture by Ashim Bhaskar                                  
	Burwan (Murshidabad), May 6: Anarkali Bibi broke her two-day Roza after news flashed on television that Ajmal Kasab had been handed death.        
	The 50-year-old Murshidabad resident, whose 21-year-old son was killed at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) during the 26/11 attack, had been observing Roza, a ritual when one does not eat anything during the day time and breaks fast after sunset, since Monday after the lone-surviving gunman of the Mumbai massacre was found guilty of the attacks.        
	I have been praying since Monday that Kasab be given the death sentence, Anarkali said, tears streaming down her cheeks.         
	Her son Asfar, an employee of a parcel-handling firm, was waiting to unload consignments on CST platform 14 on November 26 when Kasab and his associate Abu Ismail opened fire.         
	Asfar died after taking bullets in his chest, stomach and right leg.        
	These are tears of joy. I am so happy today that Allah has finally answered my prayers, said Anarkali, a housewife living in Murshidabads Bodua village in the Burwan police station area.        
	As the news of Kasabs death sentence reached the village, residents flocked to Anarkalis house to express their happiness. They embraced her husband Allarakha Sheikh, 58, a farmer.        
	I and my wife prayed every day to Allah that Kasab be hanged. We are yet to get over the shock of our sons death. We demand that all those who are responsible for the attack and who are still alive be arrested and given death sentence. Only then will our sons soul rest in peace, Allarakha said.        
	Asfar, the second among four brothers and a sister, used to send Rs 1,000 every month from Mumbai from his salary of Rs 4,800 to his family.         
	After his death, his family got Rs 15 lakh as compensation from the government and a job in the railways for his third brother, Asmar Sheikh, 20. Asmar is now posted as a group-D employee at Chowrigachha railway station in Murshidabad.        
	I had an acre of land. But the yield was not enough to maintain my family. So I often had to work as a labourer in other peoples farms. With the money we got as compensation, I bought 2.33 acres of land. We also replaced our thatched roof with a corrugated tin and bought a colour TV and some furniture. I have managed to save some money even after all these expenses, Allarakha said.        
	Even in death, Asfar has become a messiah for us. We are sad but we are also grateful to him, the father said.         
	Asfar was a very helpful boy, childhood friend Abdul Majid said. He said Asfar had gone to Mumbai with his uncle Jabbar Sheikh to help his family.        
	Even now I miss him.

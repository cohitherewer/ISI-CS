  - Police top brass holds strategy meet with Bengal, Orissa          OUR BUREAU                            CRPF jawans of 94th Battalion arrive at Hatia railway station on Friday. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                        
	Ranchi/Calcutta, March 19: Jharkhand along with Bengal and Orissa police today held what looked like a final strategy session before the launch of another round of joint operations  more specific and intensive this time to flush out Maoists in the border areas of the two states.        
	Apparently cornered by the ongoing internal operations in Jharkhand, Maoists have called for a 48-hour bandh in five states, including Bihar and Chattisgarh, beginning on March 22, ostensibly against the rise in prices of essentials, but police sources believe the strike call was a last-ditch attempt by the rebels to generate public opinion against the offensive.        
	According to CRPF DIG Alok Raj, who took part in the meeting in Midnapore in Bengal along with IG(operations) D.K. Pandey and IG(special branch) S.N. Pradhan, both sides shared intelligence gathered during the first phase of joint operations in Ghatshila, Patamda and other border areas.        
	The police now intend to go deep into the forests. This time, the strategy would be different, conceded a senior officer, indicating that phase II of the joint operations would be far more severe in the border areas of Jharkhand and Bengal, identified by the Union home ministry as the epicentre of Maoist terror.        
	A police officer in Bengal corroborated this and said the coming joint operations were expected to carry on for at least a fortnight and across a wider territory.         
	We discussed the information we gathered as the ensuing joint operation is expected to be specific and intensive and would be carried out across a distance of 120 km to 200 km. If necessary we might even go to areas on the border of West Midnapore and Orissa, the officer said.         
	As announced earlier, six companies of the 94th battalion of CRPF reached Ranchi from Delhi  on the New Delhi-Ranchi Swarna Jayanti Express  to add bite to the ongoing operations that has already seen the deployment of over 40,000 personnel belonging to state and central forces.        
	The 94th battalion will be stationed at Khunti for now. The same forces served the state during the elections so they have a fairly good idea about the terrain, said Raj.        
	In Khunti, senior police officers stopped a group of 500 villagers who were on a march from Sindir village to Serenghatu, about 70km from here, to demand an end to the operation.        
	Khunti SP Aseem Vikrant Minj and other officials, who had prior information about their attempt to lay siege to the Arki police station, stopped them about 500km away.        
	Though the villagers, comprising women and children, werent carrying arms, they seemed aggressive. They claimed the police operation against the rebels would not achieve anything other than inconveniencing poor villagers like them.        
	In fact, Minz was surprised at they way they readily left once the police asked them to. Apparently the Maoists had mounted pressure on them to create a show, he said.        
	But when we told them, they left peacefully and did not misbehave with the police officials. They acted as if they were waiting for some instruction from us, he said.        
	Surrounded hilly forests, Arki is a Maoist stronghold. The district police, along with para military forces, have intensified search operations in the area for the last three days.        
	At todays meeting, Bengal was represented by its DG Bhupinder Singh, IG Zulfikar Hasan and other senior police officers, including SPs of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia among others.

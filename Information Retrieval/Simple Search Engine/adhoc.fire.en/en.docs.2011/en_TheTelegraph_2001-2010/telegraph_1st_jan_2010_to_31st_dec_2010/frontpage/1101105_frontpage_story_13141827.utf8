The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blank wards throw up new challenge
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Blank wards throw up new challenge
          AMIT GUPTA                             Officials examine the nomination papers for the panchayat polls at the district collectorate in Ranchi on Thursday. Picture by Hardeep Singh                                   
	 Out of 350 posts of ward members in 36 panchayats of Kanke block, 35 wards will go unrepresented as no one filed nominations for the lowest rung of the panchayati raj system. BDO and returning officer Rajeshwar Nath Alok is in a fix.         
	 In neighbouring Ratu block, no nominations were filed for at least seven out of 122 posts of ward members.               
	Ranchi, Nov. 4: Worrying news such as these may only be a trickle now, but state election commission officials steering Jharkhand through its first-ever panchayat elections fear that around 500 posts of ward members, among the over 13,000 going to polls in the first phase, would go unrepresented.        
	Whats worse is that this number would increase manifold when nominations for the remaining four phases are in by month-end. There are 43,916 posts of ward members.        
	Voter apathy could be one reason behind the trend. But the other most telling factor is a faulty voters list which has led to a peculiar situation in several reserved seats where no member of the community/scheduled caste or tribe, for which the seat has been reserved, exists.        
	During nominations for the first phase of polls, we came across at least 15 cases wherein the voters list of a ward lacked the name of a community for which the seat had been reserved. Once we get specific details we will issue directives to ensure voting is held there in later phases, state election commission secretary M.K. Jha told The Telegraph.         
	Officials are also sensing widespread reluctance among the rural populace to contest the less important posts of ward members. The election commission has received over 100 cases, mostly from Ranchi, Ramgarh, Latehar, East Singhbhum, Godda, among others, where wards have recorded zero nominations.        
	As per norms, areas reserved for a particular caste/community but with any representative of that caste/community, should be declared a general category seat after completing certain processes, said Jha.         
	District magistrates and district election officers are to nominate an officer to visit the ward/panchayat, go through the voters list and certify the area does not have anyone from the particular caste/community for which it has been reserved.        
	The genesis of the problem, experts say, is the use of 2001 census figures as the base for the voters list which in most Maoist-hit areas hadnt been updated.         
	A deputy commissioner acting as a district election officer confided that the task of splitting the voters list before the panchayat polls wasnt done properly as 19 out of 24 districts lacked a panchayati raj officer.         
	As far as OBC reservation and reserving seats for a particular community is concerned, it was done erratically as the 2001 census was not on caste lines, he revealed.        
	But, the election commission promised to ensure that by-elections would be held for the seats, either in the later phases or at the end of the entire exercise.

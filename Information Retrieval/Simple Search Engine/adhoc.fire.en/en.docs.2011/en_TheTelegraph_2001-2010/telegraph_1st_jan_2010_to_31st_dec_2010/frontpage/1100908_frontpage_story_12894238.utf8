The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Festive frown: alls not fair with park pujas 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Festive frown: alls not fair with park pujas 
          POULOMI BANERJEE                             Rifle shooting stall at a city puja. A Telegraph picture                                   
	Worship yes, joyrides no. That seems to be the mantra from the civic body to pujas held in parks this year.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has decided not to allow puja organisers to set up fairs, food stalls and rides or offer other forms of entertainment in parks.         
	The reason? Curbing pollution and protecting the greenery.         
	Some of the most popular pujas across the city are held in parks, like Park Circus, Maddox Square, Deshapriya Park, Triangular Park, Jodhpur Park, Mohammad Ali Park and Bagbazar Sarbojanin.         
	If put into effect, the directive will not only make for a very different pandal-hopping experience this Puja but also affect the earnings of the organisers and thus their budget.         
	We are granting permission to organise pujas in parks but not to put up any stalls or rides like the giant wheel. Such activities destroy the greenery and add to the pollution, said Debasish Bhattacharya, chief engineer (parks and gardens), CMC.         
	The directive has left the organisers grumbling. Most pujas held in parks are not theme pujas. We have a traditional puja and the fair is a prime attraction for visitors. This directive will dampen the festive mood, rued Neelanjan Deb of the Deshapriya Park puja.         
	Many organisers are still in the dark about the CMCs plans. If they are planning to ban fairs, they should have informed us well in advance. Stall bookings are already over, said Sibsankar Basu of Maddox Square.         
	He argued that parks were better venues for holding pujas than roads. Such pujas create little disturbance or traffic chaos. Yet, road-hog pandals are allowed to have stalls but not us. We understand there should be rules to safeguard the greenery, but how much harm can a three-day fair cause? The authorities should not forget that Durga puja is our biggest festival, said Basu.         
	Others punched holes in the pollution point. Every year after the puja, we clean the park at our own expense and fill up holes that are dug, said Deb of Deshapriya Park.         
	Agreed Goutam Neogy of the Bagbazaar Sarbojanin puja. Its not as if we are cutting down trees to hold the fair. The fair is held in the vacant, barren spaces of the park.        
	Last year, the joyrides at puja venues had raised eyebrows within the CMC but they were allowed after the operators submitted a certificate saying the rides were safe.         
	The other worry is the puja budget. We do collect subscriptions, but a chunk of our funds comes from stall bookings. Many corporate houses take up stalls to advertise their products and that brings in half the funds for our budget. The money earned from the rides and stalls constitute another quarter of the total budget, said Neogy.         
	The fairs also provide many with an avenue to make some money. The people who earn a living from working these rides during festivals will become jobless, said Deb.         
	A CMC official, however, said the only reason the organisers were upset was because they would lose revenue.         
	The proposed ban hasnt found much favour with green activists either. Puja is also about eating out and children look forward to the rides. If the CMC is concerned about the greenery, even playing football affects the grass, but they regenerate themselves, pointed out Bonani Kakkar of the NGO, PUBLIC.         
	She suggested the civic body should collect a hefty deposit from those putting up stalls or rides to ensure that they clean up the grounds once the festivities are over.

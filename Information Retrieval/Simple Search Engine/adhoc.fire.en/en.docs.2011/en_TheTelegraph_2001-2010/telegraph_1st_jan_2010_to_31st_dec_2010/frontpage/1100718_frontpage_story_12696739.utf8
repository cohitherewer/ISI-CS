                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dhaka arrests 2 Ulfa rebels
                            
	Dhaka, July 17 (PTI): Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), the elite anti-crime force of Bangladesh, today arrested two Ulfa rebels from Bhairab in north Kishorganj in a pre-dawn raid.        
	The duo  Ranjan Chowdhury, 45, and Pradip Marak, 55,  were taken into custody from the Lakkhipur area of Bhairab early today, RAB spokesperson lieutenant commander Mohammad Sohail told reporters later in the day.         
	A sophisticated pistol, a revolver and four small bombs were recovered from the duo, he added.         
	Confirming the arrests, Assam inspector-general of police (law and order) Bhaskarjyoti Mahanta said, We have been informed of the development by the home ministry over phone. He said the two arrested Ulfa rebels were middle-rung cadres wanted by Assam police, adds our Guwahati reporter.         
	At the news meet in Bangladesh, where the two Ulfa operatives were produced briefly, Sohail said the arrests were made on the basis of a tip-off that several Indian trespassers were staying at Bhairab. The duo were arrested while they were waiting to board a bus to Sherpur district, he added.         
	Sohail said during initial interrogation, Chowdhury told RAB officials that he hailed from Madhusolmari at Gauripur in Assams Dhubri district. He had joined Ulfa in 1988 and undergone three months of training.         
	He then went to Bhutan to meet Ulfas top commander (military wing) Paresh Barua in June 1995 and was arrested by Indian security forces on his return a month later, Sohail said.         
	Chowdhury, he said, was detained in a Guwahati jail for a year and released in 1996.         
	The arrests coincide with an ongoing investigation on an abortive smuggling of 10-truckloads of weapons believed to be headed for Ulfa hideouts in Assam.         
	Security sources said Chowdhury was arrested soon after the seizure of the consignment in 2004 but was released within 24 hours. Ulfa general secretary Anup Chetia, who was arrested in Dhaka in December 1997 by the Awami League regime, is still in security custody in that country.

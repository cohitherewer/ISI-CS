                                Busy actress                            
	Los Angeles, April 14 (PTI): Actress Rachel Weisz is reportedly all set to portray former US First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in a film directed by Darren Aronofsky, Weiszs fiance.        
	Weisz, 40, will play Kennedy in the biopic Jackie written by Noah Oppenheim. The film follows Kennedy during the four-day period between President John F Kennedys assassination and his burial in November 1963, reports Entertainment Weekly.        
	This will be the second collaboration between Weisz and Aronofsky after the 2006 film The Fountain.        
	Jacqueline served as First Lady during JFKs presidency from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. She was later married to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis from 1968 until his death in 1975. In later years, she had a successful career as a book editor.         
	Weisz, who grabbed the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in The Constant Gardener in 2005, will be seen in thriller Dream House with Daniel Craig and Naomi Watts and a western drama Unbound Captives with Robert Pattinson and Hugh Jackman. She has reportedly been approached for a role in the 23rd James Bond film.

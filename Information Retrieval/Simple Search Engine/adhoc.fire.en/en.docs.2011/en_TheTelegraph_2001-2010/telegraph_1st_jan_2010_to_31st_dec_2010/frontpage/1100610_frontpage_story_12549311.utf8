          J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, June 9: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is scheduled to hold talks with Mamata Banerjee tomorrow on the sidelines of a cabinet meeting in a bid to get her to agree to an increase in fuel prices.        
	The Trinamul chief is learnt to be determined not to give in, although the Centre may stand a better chance of securing her reluctant consent if the hike is confined to petrol.        
	Trinamul leaders said Mamata had dissented, not verbally but in black and white, and had already written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in her dual capacity as railway minister and Trinamul Congress chief saying that any hike in fuel prices was unacceptable to her.         
	The government appears to be more concerned about oil companies than the masses, the Trinamul chief is learnt to have said in her letter.        
	Sources said Mamata had said that it would be foolish to burden the common man more by increasing fuel prices when they were already feeling the pressure of inflation. She is said to have also pointed out that international oil prices had not gone up recently.         
	Mamata, who was upset with the finance minister for refusing to withdraw a surcharge on railways he had reinstated in his last budget proposals, is also said to have written about the negative impact an increase in diesel prices would have on railway revenues. The two leaders had also traded barbs during the Bengal civic poll campaign.        
	 She is in a mood to oppose the price hike to the maximum extent possible, a source said. If the government pushes ahead despite her opposition, she will not be a part of the decision.        
	Trinamul sources said if Mamata failed to stop the government from increasing fuel prices, she wouldnt attend the meeting of an empowered ministerial group (GoM) where the decision will be announced. Mamata and Sharad Pawar had skipped a GoM meeting on Monday.         
	Sources said Mamata wouldnt come in the way if the government increased only petrol prices and spared diesel, kerosene and LPG which she feels affect the common man more.

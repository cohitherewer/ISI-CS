          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                            Devotees pray facing Amritsars Golden Temple, which is blanketed in fog on Saturday morning. (PTI)                                        
	Jan. 2: Fog blinded northern India today, causing two train collisions that killed 10 people, triggering fatal street accidents, sending airline schedules haywire and inconveniencing VIPs as much as the common man.        
	The fog and cold also caused a snag in transmission lines causing the northern grid to trip, plunging Punjab, Haryana and parts of Jammu and Kashmir into a power crisis and further derailing the already fog-hit train services.        
	Delhi airport wore a chaotic look as serial delays, diversions and cancellations  compounded by a fault in the instrument landing system left passengers stranded and exasperated at what they said was lack of information. Passengers were handed out food coupons but the long queues deterred many.        
	The airlines deflected the blame, Air India spokesperson Jitender Bhargava accusing the airport authorities for not providing updates that could be passed on to the passengers.        
	Of the Calcutta-Delhi flights, an Air India plane was diverted to Jaipur where it was still waiting late tonight while a Jet Airways plane, diverted to Lucknow, later returned to Calcutta. Other Calcutta-Delhi flights were delayed by an average of three hours.        
	A pregnant woman on a Dubai-Delhi Air India flight complained of exhaustion after her plane was diverted to Jaipur and had to disembark there. The flight reached Delhi 16 hours late.        
	On Delhis streets, a motorist died in a car crash while another car ran over and killed a cyclist and then hit a divider, killing a 13-year-old boy passenger. Five people were injured in the two accidents.        
	Many arrived late in office because of poor visibility in the morning, and left early as fog descended again at 4pm.        
	I left office around 5pm; I didnt want to take risks. In the morning it was so difficult to drive that I stopped for at least 30 minutes on the roadside, said PR executive Samar Chadda.                    
	Visibility was near zero on the tracks in Uttar Pradesh when two trains rammed two others, both stationary, from behind in the morning. Many, though, pointed to possible human error and instrument failures too, asking why the drivers were not alerted about another train being on the same track.        
	The Bhiwani-Gorakhpur Gorakhdham Express ran into the Delhi-Allahabad Prayagraj Express 1.5km from Kanpur. The Delhi-Sitamarhi Lichchavi Express hit the Magadh Express near Etawah.        
	Former Union minister Murli Manohar Joshi was in the Prayagraj Express but escaped unhurt. He accused railway minister Mamata Banerjee of not making even the basic arrangements to cope with the winter fog.        
	Another fog-hit VIP was Union home minister P. Chidambaram, whose Delhi-bound flight left Chennai at 1.30pm instead of 10am.        
	The only one to have loved the fog would be the man who tapped on a car window at Delhi airport, told passenger Anju Bhutani some money had fallen out of her pocket and, when she stepped out to check, vanished into the mist with her purse.

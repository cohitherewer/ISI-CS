  - Jawans mistake ritual fireworks for attack on camp, kill one by shooting at car        AMIT UKIL                                                    
	Balarampur (Purulia), Oct. 2: Ritual cracker bursts during Sashthi puja misled paramilitary jawans into presuming a Maoist attack on their camp here on Thursday night, leading to tragedy for two Bokaro youths passing by in their car, eyewitnesses said.        
	Balarampur residents said the Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) personnel, recently arrived from Nagaland to join anti-Maoist operations in rebel-hit Purulia, fired at the Indica that had ignored their orders to stop  possibly mistaking them for disguised gangsters, it has emerged.        
	The bullets killed Vikas Mishra, who was at the wheel, and grievously injured his businessman friend Ganesh Gupta, both 23.        
	The picture emerging from the various accounts suggests the tragedy was caused by mistaken assumptions, poor coordination within the security perimeter, jangled nerves, a hair-trigger mentality in and around conflict zones, and civilian helplessness in telling lawkeepers from lawbreakers.        
	The incident also underscores how everyday activities such as a night ride in a car can have unforeseen consequences in areas that need not always be in the middle of inhospitable terrain.        
	Vikas and Ganesh were returning to Bokaro from Jharkhands Chandil on a route passing through Balarampur. It isnt fully clear why they ignored the orders to stop, but Ganesh today told police from his hospital bed in Bokaro that he and Vikas had earlier dodged a purported police picket 20km away at Chandil, suspecting the cops could be criminals in uniform.        
	As their car approached the Balarampur camp, Ganesh said, the flash of a very powerful light blinded us. We saw people in military uniform and camouflage jackets. Then we heard gunfire. Later, I found blood oozing out of my abdomen and Vikas lying lifeless next to me.        
	Residents said that minutes earlier, around 10.30pm, the cracker explosions had brought the jawans rushing out of their camp, all of them firing wildly from their automatic weapons. Some were in uniform and the rest in bermudas and vests, said Samir Kundu, who owns a shop opposite the IRB camp.        
	No one was injured in this burst of firing but bullet holes have been found in a door and a refrigerator in the locality.        
	The jawans then stopped passers-by, asked them if they had heard gunshots and beat many of them up without any apparent reason, Samir said. Ten people were hauled to the camp where they were allegedly beaten some more.        
	The Indica arrived around 10.40, said Samir who claimed to have watched the unfolding events with his brother Dilip through a crack in the shop window. The jawans beckoned it to stop and shouted roko, roko but the Indica sped off. The jawans then fired at the car from both sides.        
	Samir said the car slowed to a halt by the roadside about 500 metres from the spot. The jawans then returned to their camp. Personnel from Balarampur police station arrived at 11.15pm, following a call from the IRB commandant, to find the area peaceful.        
	While looking round, I suddenly saw someone wave to me from the Indica, sub-inspector Dipankar Sarkar said. I found one of the occupants seriously injured and the other lifeless.        
	The IRB has filed an FIR saying its camp was attacked, but its commandant said he was not authorised to speak to the media. Purulia police chief Rajesh Yadav too refused comment, saying the CID was probing the case. All those taken into the IRB camp were released last night.

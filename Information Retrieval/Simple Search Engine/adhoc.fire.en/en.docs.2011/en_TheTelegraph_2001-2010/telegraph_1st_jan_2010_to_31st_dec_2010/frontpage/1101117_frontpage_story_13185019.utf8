                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rural polls pass the test

	Ranchi, Nov. 16: Name of exam: panchayati raj. Examinees: candidates for zilla parishad polls. Examiners: rural vote bank. School: grassroots democracy.        
	Yes, its a litmus test of democracy that many political bigwigs would possibly flunk in, but its happening right in the heart of the hinterland. The electorate of Kolebira block in Simdega district will hold a written exam for its five zilla parishads candidates tomorrow to test their knowledge on panchayati raj in the run-up to the actual rural polls on December 13.         
	The five candidates, er, examinees  all women of the Bhokta community which falls under the Scheduled Caste (SC) category  are Shakuntala Devi, Gajmati Devi, Urmila Devi, Manorama Devi and Indrani Devi. This time, the seat is reserved for an SC woman candidate.        
	Through the test, well try to judge how much the candidates know about the different aspects of panchayati raj. Well finalise the one who gets the most marks for the post of member of zilla parishad. We want an informed candidate and also representation of our community women for the coveted seat of the zilla parishad. We dont want to divide votes, Bhokta Samaj Vikas Sangh member Heera Singh told The Telegraph.        
	Sources said villagers were preparing questionnaires for tomorrows test that would precede a meeting. Notably, all five women have already filed their nominations. Candidates can withdraw their name either on November 22 or 23. Scrutiny of their papers would happen between November 18 and 20.        
	Records suggest Kolebira zilla parishad consists of 41,195 voters, which include voters of 11 panchayats, with 35 per cent voters belonging to the Bhokta community. In an arena where caste equations will be fully played out, villagers have squeezed in room for merit.        
	In another offbeat incident on November 9 at village Siyalgudri in Dhanbad, villagers held a mock vote to choose the candidates of their choice to contest the prestigious mukhiya post in Siyalgudri panchayat. Out of 750 voters of that village, about 388 took part in the voting.         
	In Naxalite-infested Lawalong block of Chatra, villagers have decided on their own on who their mukhiyas, ward members and members of panchayat samitis and zilla parishad would be, without succumbing to strong-armed tactics. Only those who had the electorates nod have filed their nominations.         
	Panchayati raj is creating a quiet revolution in Jharkhands heartland, where instead of money or muscle power, its the mind of voters that is deciding who stays in the fray and who bites the dust.

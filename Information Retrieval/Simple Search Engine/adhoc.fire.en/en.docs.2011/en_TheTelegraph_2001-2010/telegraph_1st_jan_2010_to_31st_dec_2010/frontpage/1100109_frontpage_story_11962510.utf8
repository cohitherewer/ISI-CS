          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Nagaon, Jan. 8: Kaziranga National Park today sounded an alert, asking its staff to be on constant vigil after several migratory birds were found dead in the park under mysterious circumstances yesterday.         
	A team of forest personnel, on a routine patrol, recovered 10 dead bar-headed geese on the northern bank of Sohola  the largest waterbody inside the national park at 2pm on Thursday.         
	After preliminary investigations by veterinarians at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation at Kaziranga, samples of the birds were sent to the Bhopal-based High Security Animal Disease Laboratory today for tests to ascertain the cause of death.         
	D. Gogoi, the parks divisional forest officer, today said no fresh cases of bird deaths had been reported.         
	Till now we have no clue as to whether the geese died of bird flu or poisoning. We will have to wait for the report from the Bhopal-based laboratory, he said.         
	When we asked the veterinarians to complete their investigations and finish their analysis on the spot, they refused, saying such an analysis is possible only in a highly secured biological laboratory, the DFO said.         
	They have asked us to wait for about a week to get the final report on the bird deaths, Gogoi said.         
	According to him, all officials, including the park veterinary staff have been placed on alert and asked to take prompt action whenever necessary to prevent further deaths of birds in the park.         
	Bar-headed geese generally migrate to the park from Siberia in November.         
	Sources said the birds could have died of poisoning, after consuming water contaminated by pesticides in tea gardens close to the park.         
	When we saw the birds from a distance, we thought they were alive. But as we moved closer, we found that the birds were not moving. We waited for a while and confirmed that all the 10 birds had died, said Agratoli range officer K.K. Deuri.

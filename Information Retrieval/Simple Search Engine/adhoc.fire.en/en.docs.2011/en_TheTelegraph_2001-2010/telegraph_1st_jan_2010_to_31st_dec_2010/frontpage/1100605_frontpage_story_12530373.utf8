	Imphal, June 4: The Manipur government today rushed additional forces to Ukhrul and Senapati districts to prevent any attempt by National Socialist Council of Nagalim (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah to enter the state through the two districts.         
	The deployment came within hours of Muivah leaving Viswema for Pfutsero this morning.        
	Yes we have sent strong state forces, led by senior officers, to Ukhrul and Senapati to bar Muivahs entry. We are on high alert and have taken maximum precautions. We will not allow him to enter Manipur, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, who is also the home minister, told a news conference at his office secretariat this afternoon.        
	The chief minister deployed about 300 state forces, comprising police commandos, India Reserve Battalion and Manipur Rifles personnel under the command of Imphal East superintendent of police Th. Radheshyam Singh to Liyai Khunou in Senapati district.         
	A similar strength of state forces, under the joint command of 1 Manipur Rifles commandant E. Priyokumar Singh and superintendent of jail Themthing Ngashangva, also reached Jessami in Ukhrul early this morning.        
	The state forces left Imphal at 10 last night and reached their respective deployment areas this morning.         
	The Manipur government dispatched the forces after receiving reports that Muivah would head for Pfutsero either last night or early this morning and thereafter enter Lia Khunou and head for Jessami.        
	The chief minister said two companies of BSF also moved to Jessami to assist the state forces. The army would also help the state forces, he added.        
	 With the elections to the six autonomous district councils now over, the chief minister appealed to the All Naga Students Association, Manipur to lift the ongoing economic blockade along Imphal-Dimapur and Imphal-Jiribam highways.        
	The student association imposed the economic blockade from April 11 against the ADC elections.         
	Ibobi Singh said his government had sent a formal invitation for talks to the Naga students body two weeks back, through Senapati deputy commissioner Nidhi Kesarwani, but to no avail.         
	With a ban imposed on the movement of Manipur-bound vehicles on the Imphal-Dimapur highway by the Naga Students Federation, the chief minister said he would use the Imphal-Jiribam highway for regular supply of essentials.        
	In the meantime, a division bench of Gauhati High Court (Imphal bench) today gave the Manipur DGP Yumnam Joykumar Singh 10 days time to arrest and produce David Choro, president of All Naga Students Association, Manipur, before the court, for imposing the blockade.         
	Justice T.N.K. Singh and Justice Mutum B.K. Singh asked the police chief to produce Choro on June 15 before the court following a petition filed by R. K. Joyson, a resident of Imphal city.

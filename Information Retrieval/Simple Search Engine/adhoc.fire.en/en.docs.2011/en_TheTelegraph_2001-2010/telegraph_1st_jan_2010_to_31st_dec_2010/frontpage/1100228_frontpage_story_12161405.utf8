The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Apex court refuses to answer RTI queries
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Apex court refuses to answer RTI queries
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Supreme Court has refused to answer several queries filed under the right to information law on whether judges of the top court conversant with the affairs of Karnataka High Court had been consulted by the Chief Justice of India before a decision was taken to elevate Chief Justice P.D. Dinakaran to the apex court.         
	The collegium, headed by the Chief Justice of India, had recommended Dinakarans name to the law ministry for elevation but it was stalled after allegations of financial irregularities were made against him by activists pushing for more transparency and accountability in the judiciary.        
	The RTI questions, filed by activist Subhash Agrawal, had specifically sought to know whether Justices Markandey Katju, V.S. Sirpurkar and A.K. Ganguly had been consulted as mandated by an earlier judgment of the apex court. It had also sought a complete copy of records regarding Dinakarans proposed elevation.        
	However, in a reply on February 23, the central public information officer of the Supreme Court refused to answer the queries, saying they were confidential and were exempt under Section (j) of the RTI Act, 2005.        
	The officer said the information was neither held by him nor under his control, and hence, the request could not be acceded to under the RTI. The information officer pointed out that the top court had earlier stayed similar orders from the Central Information Commission (CIC) that wanted the disclosure of information on appointment of judges.        
	At least two such orders passed by the CIC had been stayed by the apex court on December 4, 2009. While one order asked the court registry to share information on judges appointments, the other sought details of an alleged attempt to influence a judge.                    
	Agrawal had sought the information from the court, and had been turned down twice. He had then appealed to the CIC, which had ruled in his favour on November 24, 2009.

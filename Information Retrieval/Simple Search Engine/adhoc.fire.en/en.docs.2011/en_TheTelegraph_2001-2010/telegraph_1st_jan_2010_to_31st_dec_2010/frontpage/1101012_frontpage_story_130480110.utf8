	New Delhi, Oct 12 (PTI): Satisfied with Indian paddlers' show in the team events in the Commonwealth Games, country's foreign coach for table tennis, Massimo Constantini wants to continue with the job to help them do well in the 2012 London Olympics.
    India's hope for gold in the team event went up in smoke after defending champions men's team lost the semifinal to England, and even their women counterparts went down to world champions Singapore in the summit stage.
    "I am happy with the improvement the paddlers have showed in the recent times. I took up the responsibility as the coach in February, 2009 and now want to finish my job in 2012 London Olympics," said Constantini, who succeeded Belorussian Aleksey Yefremov last year.
    "It is up to the government whether I could continue with this job.

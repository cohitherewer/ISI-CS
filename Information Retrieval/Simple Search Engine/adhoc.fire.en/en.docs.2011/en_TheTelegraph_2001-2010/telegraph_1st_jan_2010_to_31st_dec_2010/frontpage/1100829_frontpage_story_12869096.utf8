The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Assam student unions lift blockade
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Assam student unions lift blockade
  - Congress accuses NSCN (I-M) of triggering flare-up at Charaipung          OUR BUREAU                                     
	Guwahati/Dibrugarh, Aug. 28: The All Assam Students Union and Asam Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad today temporarily lifted the economic blockade in Assam on two routes to neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh, as the ruling Congress accused NSCN (I-M) of triggering the flare-up in Charaipung to merge Assams villages with the outfits proposed greater Nagalim.         
	Twelve organisations, spearheaded by the AASU and AJYCP, lifted the blockade on the routes to Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh from 5pm today.         
	The organisations had blocked the Bimalapur-Charaipung-Longding Road and the Kanubari-NEFA Road since August 19 in protest against the recent atrocities on Assam villagers at Charaipung by people from Arunachal Pradesh, allegedly backed by suspected NSCN (I-M) militants.         
	We have decided to lift the economic blockade temporarily purely on humanitarian grounds. We had never intended that the common people should suffer. Through the blockade, we wanted to leave a message for the government of Arunachal Pradesh that they should rein in miscreants, Biplob Gogoi, the president of the Borhat Regional Students Union of AASU, told newspersons.        
	On the other hand, senior Assam PCC leader and MLA of Sonari constituency Sarat Barkatoki, who led a fact finding team to Charaipung, told the media that Naga villagers, who were otherwise living peacefully with the Assamese people on the inter-state boundary, are now being instigated by the NSCN (I-M).                          
	The flare-up started on August 14 with militants and people from Arunachal Pradesh damaging a half-constructed building of Charaipung police station in Sivasagar district.        
	Members of the fact-finding team interacted with both Assamese and Naga villagers in Charaipung to know the root of the skirmish between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. There are enough reasons to believe that a third and divisive force was instrumental in the flare-up. Even though villagers refused to speak directly, they gave enough hint of the involvement of the NSCN (I-M) in the border clash, Barkatoki said.         
	The ruling partys allegations comes a day after Assam and Arunachal Pradesh set in motion a joint action plan to douse the flare-up. Even though a joint meeting between representatives of Assam and Arunachal held yesterday in Dispur spelt out various initiatives for normality at Charaipung, both states were guarded against naming the NSCN (I-M) in the incident.        
	 Barkatoki denied reports that Charaipung is a case of the governments negligence and said land pattas were being issued to the small tea growers with gardens along the boundary to keep lands under occupation of Assam. Various development projects, including drinking water supply schemes, have been taken up in the area, he said.         
	There are around 650 Assamese small tea growers at Charaipung. On the other hand, some Naga people are also running small tea gardens by leasing them out to local Assamese youths. Since the number of tea growers from Assam is more, a third force is involved in instigating the Naga villagers to grab lands at Charaipung. In other words, the flare-up is part of Naga peoples economic aggression fully backed by the NSCN (I-M), Bolin Kuli, another member of the fact finding team, said.         
	Kuli said the need of the hour was to initiate confidence-building measures among the people and development of the area.         
	The student organisations also held a public meeting at the Nagahat weekly market auditorium to discuss the calls and appeals being made by various organisations to lift the economic blockade on humanitarian grounds.         
	The organisations set September 10 as a deadline for the government of Assam to fulfil some of its demands, failing which it threatened to resume its agitation.         
	The student groups further threatened to start a border chalo programme if the problems are not settled within the stipulated timeframe.         
	Arunachal Pradesh finance minister Setong Sena was also present at the meeting along with parliamentary secretary Newlai Tingkatra and Deomali MLA Wanki Lowang. Sena said he had come to the location to physically examine the implementation process of the agreements, which both sides agreed upon during a discussion in Guwahati yesterday.

	Yangon, Nov. 13: Military-ruled Myanmar today freed Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from seven-and-a-half years of house arrest, giving the country a powerful pro-democracy voice days after a widely criticised election.        
	Suu Kyi stood waving and smiling in a pink, long-sleeved shirt at the gate of her compound as thousands of supporters cheered and sang the national anthem in a blur of camera flashes.        
	We havent seen each other for so long, I have so much to tell you, she said, holding a white handkerchief and clenching the red iron gates, hair pinned with flowers given by a supporter.        
	She is our mother, she is our mother! a woman said, near tears.        
	If we are united, we can get what we want. When the time comes to talk, do not be quiet, Suu Kyi, 65, said before walking back inside her home.        
	She said she would address supporters tomorrow at the headquarters of her now defunct party, the National League for Democracy.        
	Her latest house arrest term, during which she was denied even a phone, expired today but it was not clear if she would be freed until police removed the barricades and withdrew from her home.        
	Suu Kyi has spent 15 of the last 21 years under house arrest. When her British husband Michael Aris died in the UK in 1999, she had declined the juntas offer to go there for his funeral, fearing she would not be allowed back if she left.        
	In neighbouring Thailand, the younger of her two sons, Kim Aris, is waiting to see his mother after 10 years. Kim lives in Britain and has been repeatedly denied visas.        
	She is a hero of mine, US President Barack Obama said. The United States welcomes her long overdue release. It is time for the Burmese regime to release all political prisoners, not just one.        
	Analysts said Myanmars ruling generals might now see less need to isolate her because this weeks elections, held after 20 years and widely seen as stage-managed, resulted in victory for the party they backed. Also, by freeing her, the junta may be trying to gain some legitimacy for the political process it has initiated.        
	However, Suu Kyi, known as the Lady to the public, is believed to retain her old mesmerising appeal and with a few words could rob the election of any shred of legitimacy it might have, possibly seeking to have the results annulled on grounds of fraud.        
	Western diplomats said they would assess the degree of liberty she would be given and watch the militarys behaviour towards her. The possibility of future confrontations remains: Suu Kyis lawyer says she intends to plunge into political activities, no matter what restrictions are placed on her.        
	Sundays elections were the first since 1990, when the National League for Democracy won in a landslide. The generals annulled that result and clung to power.        
	Suu Kyis party refused to take part in the latest election, saying it was undemocratic. As a result, it was forced to disband as a political party, and Suu Kyi now has no official standing as a political leader.        
	Experts say the junta would likely need to release more political prisoners before the West lifts sanctions. However, Suu Kyis release could rekindle the debate whether the embargoes are viable at a time Myanmars neighbours, such as China, are tapping its vast resources and propping up the regime.        
	Suu Kyi had previously backed sanctions but has reviewed her stance. Analysts say she could mediate between the generals and the West.        
	Suu Kyis most recent term of house arrest began in 2003 after an attack on her motorcade by government-sponsored thugs that many believe was an assassination bid. Her detention was extended in August 2009 when an American, John Yettaw, swam across a lake uninvited to her home, leading to a trial that convicted her of violating the terms of her detention.        
	In the past, as her terms neared completion, extensions would be imposed. But yesterday, it had appeared that she might be freed as promised.

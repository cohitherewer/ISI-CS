          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata Banerjee in Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	Calcutta, May 29: Mamata Banerjee today dismissed the question of her resignation in the wake of the Jnaneswari Express tragedy, turning her focus to persuading the Centre to order a CBI probe into the derailment.         
	What did the chief minister do when the Stephen Court tragedy took place in March claming 43 lives? the agitated railway minister asked this evening, referring to the fire in the city in March.        
	The Trinamul leader was responding to a question if she would offer to resign like her cabinet colleague Praful Patel. The civil aviation minister had offered to quit after the Mangalore plane crash a week ago but it was rejected by the Prime Minister.        
	Mamata had stepped down as railway minister from the BJP-led NDA government in March 2001, demanding the resignation of the then defence minister, George Fernandes, in the wake of the Tehelka expose.        
	On her return to Calcutta from the train tragedy site yesterday morning, Mamata spoke to the Union home minister to ensure that the CBI probes the incident, Trinamul sources said.        
	According to rules, the Centre cannot order a CBI probe without a state governments consent, though higher courts can do so in extraordinary circumstances.         
	Sources in Delhi said they did not get the impression that the Bengal government would oppose a CBI probe.        
	Asked if the matter has been discussed with the Centre, Bengal chief secretary Ardhendu Sen said in Calcutta: Ive spoken to (Union home secretary) G.K. Pillai about the matter. However, this is not an opportune moment to discuss it and I will comment on it later.        
	Mamata today seemed to blame her political rivals for the disaster. Yesterdays train disaster was a sabotage and a deep-rooted political conspiracy, hatched by some persons just two days before the civic polls. This was a heinous crime. This is why I asked for a CBI probe to identify those involved. The home ministry has agreed to conduct a CBI probe on the basis of a letter from the railways, she told a media conference at her Kalighat residence.        
	Mamata condemned the manner in which the CPM had planned to exploit the train disaster. The CPM had decided to take out a condolence procession yesterday hours after the train disaster in an effort to exploit it for cheap political gains. The partys main purpose was to slight me before the electorate on the eve of civic polls. But the State Election Commission thankfully stopped it. Going by all this, only a CBI probe can identify the persons behind the train disaster, Mamata said.        
	On the Maoists involvement, Mamata, however, remained non-committal.         
	Asked why the names of the Maoists did not figure in the FIR lodged with the police yesterday, the Trinamul chief said: This is a matter of investigation. The FIR was lodged by the driver of the train who had heard an explosion. This is why a case was registered under the Explosives Act. Now I want the police to probe the matter and find who the culprits are.        
	Told that Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities had pointed fingers at the CPM, Mamata said: I dont know who said what. I will wait for CBI to identify the culprits.        
	Silent on clips        
	Mamata said there were no fish plates on the tracks, but did not refer to the clips that were removed. This is a long-welded track and this is why fish plates are not required, she said.         
	Fish plates link rail tracks while Pandrol clips fix them to the sleepers. At Rajabandh, the clips were removed on a 50-metre stretch on two tracks.

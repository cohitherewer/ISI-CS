  - Contentious issues kept aside for political talks           OUR BUREAU                                     
	Delhi/Darjeeling, Oct. 11: The Centre today indicated that it wanted to set up an interim authority for the Darjeeling hills by December with at least four contentious issues being kept aside for discussion at the political-level talks, likely to be held before Diwali.         
	Pending issues like composition, election and legislative powers would be dealt with in the political level talks that would be held very soon, general secretary of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha Roshan Giri told The Telegraph today.        
	Territorial jurisdiction of the Gorkha Regional Authority or the set-up, its mode of selection, its legislative powers and the transfer of the tauzi department will be taken up for discussion in the political round.         
	At the end of the meeting all the representatives were of the opinion that they did not have the mandate to take a decision on (the) four issues, said Harkabahadur Chhetri, the spokesperson for the Morcha, one of the three participants in todays official-level tripartite talks.         
	The state, another participant in the talks, was represented by chief secretary Samar Ghosh and home secretary G.D. Gautam. The central team was led by joint secretary (Centre-state) N.S. Kalsi.         
	The Centre is in a mood to set up the authority by December, said a home ministry source. The set-up would be similar to the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, he said.                          
	Chhetri claimed that the Centre had not been able to work out a method for the transfer of legislative powers to the new set-up.         
	The transfer of legislative powers to the GRA could pose a problem for the government because the Morcha has been demanding that all members of the interim body be nominated by the hill party. The Centre and the state want either a direct or an indirect election to the interim body.         
	An administrative source said a nominated body could not be bestowed with legislative powers, as this would be against the established rule of the law.         
	The Morcha, however, claimed that the Centre today proposed to increase the number of seats in the interim body to 45, though the hill party preferred it to be 50. Earlier, Delhi had maintained that the body would have only 20 members.         
	The interim set-up will also be given powers to issue licences, which is now vested with the Regional Transport Authority, the Morcha claimed. Issues concerning the regularisation of the casual workers of the DGHC were also raised. The chief secretary of Bengal maintained that the state had no problems in regularising the workers provided certain norms were fulfilled and that the process had already started, said Chhetri.

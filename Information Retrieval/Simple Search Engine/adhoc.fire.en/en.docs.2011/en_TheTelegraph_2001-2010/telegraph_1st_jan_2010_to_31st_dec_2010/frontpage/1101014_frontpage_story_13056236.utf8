                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Munda gets into Puja spirit
  - Late evening shopping spree has cops on toes          AMIT GUPTA                                           
	Ranchi, Oct. 13: Five kurta and pyjama sets and four maroon Nehru jackets, chief minister Arjun Mundas Puja shopping is complete. And Munda wrapped up the festive buying on his own, during a late evening shopping spree yesterday.         
	Just when shop owners at GEL Church Complex, the main shopping destination in the state capital, were getting ready to down shutters past 9pm after a hectic day, the chief ministers motorcade rolled in  sirens blaring and beacons flashing.        
	Munda stepped out of his car accompanied by BJP functionary Gama Singh, who along with the owner of Big Shop, Santosh Kumar Jain, assisted the chief minister in selecting materials at the shop on the second floor.        
	I am a common man and I decided to do the Puja shopping myself. Due to my busy schedule, I rarely manage to shop. So today I decided to drop in here, said the chief minister, as he inspected the materials on sale.        
	The master tailors employed by the shop will have the clothes ready in a day or two.        
	Outlining his Puja plans, Munda said he would spend Vijaya Dashami in Ranchi, probably for the first time in years.         
	I will be in Jamshedpur on Ashtami and Navami, but I will return to Ranchi on Dashami, said Munda, without disclosing whether he was going to enter the chief ministers official residence on the auspicious day or not.         
	Munda, who is known to be close to his mother Saira, has requested his better half Meera to do the Puja shopping for the rest of the family. I have entrusted my wife to do the shopping for my mother, sons and other family members. Today I took out some time for myself, he said.                                             
	Traffic policemen, who are never at their post past 9pm, could be seen manning the traffic till 10.10pm, when the chief ministers motorcade zipped past Albert Ekka Chowk.         
	Incidentally, before he went shopping, Munda attended a Dandia dance event at Ashoka Hotel.        
	However, today Munda was back at work. He started meeting people at his residence in the morning before spending the better part of the day at Project Building where he reviewed the planning department.         
	Munda is scheduled to leave for Bihar for poll campaigning tomorrow. During his whirlwind trip, Munda will address people in at least in 10 places in Katihar, Purnea and Araria. A helicopter from Patna is scheduled to reach Ranchi airport tomorrow for the purpose.         
	Munda will come back to either Ranchi or Jamshedpur tomorrow itself.

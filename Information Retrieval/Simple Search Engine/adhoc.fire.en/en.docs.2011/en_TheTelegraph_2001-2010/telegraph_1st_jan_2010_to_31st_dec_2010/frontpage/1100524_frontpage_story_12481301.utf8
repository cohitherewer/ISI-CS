                                Obama                            
	New York, May 23 (PTI): US President Barack Obamas childhood years in Indonesia will come alive in a telefilm.         
	Little Obama will trace the Presidents childhood spent in Jakarta with his mother and step-father, reported the New York Daily online.         
	The first black President of USA has inspired millions of people with his life and the film will premiere in Indonesia on June 17, coinciding with Obamas visit to his former home.         
	The young Obama will be played by 12-year-old Hasan Faruq Ali, a New Mexico native who, too, moved to Indonesia as a toddler.         
	Hasan has the walk, he has the posture of Barry. But Barry was a better ping pong player, said Slamet Djanuadi, a childhood friend of Obama.        
	Screenwriter and co-director Damien Dematra has made it clear that it is not a film about Obama the world leader-to-be, but it is about Obama the kid.         
	The film is being produced by Indonesian company Multivision Plus.         
	Hasan, being fluent in both English and the Indonesian language, was a natural choice.         
	He is the son of a white mother and African American father.         
	It feels great to play Obama. I was shy about it at first... But then it became easy and fun, especially acting as a very important character who left here to become president, said Hasan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | All-party meet on 2G fails to end deadlock
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                All-party meet on 2G fails to end deadlock
				       
	New Delhi, Nov 22 (PTI): An all-party meeting called to end the deadlock in Parliament on 2G spectrum failed today as the Opposition stuck to its demand for JPC probe and rejected the government's proposal for attaching multi-disciplinary probe teams with the PAC to go into CAG report.
    After the hour-long meeting, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee told the opposition parties that he would get back to them after consulting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
    Mukherjee had called the leaders of all parties to discuss ways to end the logjam over 2G probe because of which Parliament has remained paralysed ever since the Winter Session began on November 9 as the Opposition has been insisting on setting up of Joint Parliamentary Committee to go into the scam.

  - Jharkhand RTI Forum felicitates 11 for their vigilance                                  
	The Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI)  enabling every Indian citizen to seek information from a public authority, to be given within 30 days  completed five years on Tuesday. People have used the Act to question, probe, demand transparency and voice dissent. Meet 11 citizen vigilantes of the state, who were felicitated by Jharkhand RTI Forum on Tuesday in the capital for ushering in winds of change         
	Road runner         
	Dipesh Kumar Nirala (25), social activist, Simdega         
	RTI push: Joram-Deobahal-Ambapani Road on Jharkhand-Orissa border was built in 2008 under Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana. But the 8km stretch wilted so soon that Dipesh filed an RTI query.         
	Citizenspeak: Investigations by district authorities  an executive engineer and an assistant engineer of rural engineering organisation department  revealed poor construction. I forwarded a copy of the probe to chief secretary Ashok Kumar Singh this May, who constituted a probe committee, which said the same. I also forwarded a copy to the Prime Ministers Office (PMO), which sent a probe team of the National Rural Road Development Agency. Action against erring officials is still awaited.        
	Class act         
	Pushpa Kumari (25), student, Ranchi        
	RTI push: Pushpa, an underprivileged political science student of Ranchi University (RU), learnt from a newspaper advertisement that a varsity must admit two BPL students free of cost in each PG department. But her varsity did not follow the rule.         
	Citizenspeak: Through RTI, I got a document from RU about the free admission provision. Now, I dont pay any fee. My using the RTI Act has helped other BPL students pursue higher education.         
	Red tape trim         
	Mukesh Lakra (44), bureaucrat, Ranchi         
	RTI push: As public information officer, Lakra has helped many RTI applicants. Even semi-literates seek his directions on the application process.         
	Citizenspeak: I believe in the RTI Act as it prods an official to be more responsible and empowers people with the right to know what government officers are doing for them.                                       
	Honour roll         
	Abhishek Pandey (25), student, Ranchi         
	RTI push: A Ranchi University topper in 2008, Abhishek was to get Rs 40,000 as scholarship from University Grants Commission (UGC). But varsity officials said they had no idea about it.         
	Citizenspeak: Through an RTI application, I learnt that UGC had already sent money to the varsity. My application helped eight more students to get their scholarship.                
	Scam show        
	Vikas Kumar Sinha (33), journalist, Ranchi         
	RTI push: An organisation, Vikas Evam Kalyan Samiti, advertised for recruitment of 450 employees. Sensing fraud, Vikas sought information from Ranchi district authorities about the organisation.         
	Citizenspeak: The so-called Samiti was cheating the unemployed. RTI has the power to clean the system.               
	Exposing the rot        
	Julius Ekka (35), unemployed youth, Ranchi        
	RTI push: Julius was selected by Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) as a vehicle operator in 2005, but the organisation took more than two and half years to get his tribal status verified from Ranchi district administration. Then, his appointment was cancelled, citing delay in the process.         
	Citizenspeak: I exposed the rotten system of BCCL, but I am still unemployed.

	Sanjeev Kumar (35), businessman-cum-activist, Ranchi         
	RTI push: Sanjeev joined the Jharkhand RTI Forum, Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries and Citizen Club through which he stepped up awareness about the Act.         
	Citizenspeak: More people, including advocates, should work to make the RTI Act popular among the masses.              
	Public benefit        
	Suchita Devi (50), housewife, Ramgarh        
	RTI push: The Public Distribution System (PDS) dealer of Gola in Ramgarh district had withheld benefits from some PDS card holders, saying they did not have their names on the list. Suchitra Devi filed an RTI to get the complete list of beneficiaries.

	Geeta Devi (71), housewife, Dhanbad         
	RTI push: She filed an RTI petition, seeking payment from the district administration for work that her late husband, a contractor, did way back in 1981. Using the Act, she obtained proof that payment was due, and officials had to pay up.        
	Citizenspeak: The courts had not been able to help me. When I got Rs 58,513 in March this year, after 29 years, I could not control my tears. The Act is so powerful.              
	Right marks        
	Madhu Mishra (38), lecturer, Ranchi

	Citizenspeak: My marks were better than some others, whom the JPSC had recommended for appointment. I filed a case in Jharkhand High Court, which directed Ranchi University to appoint me. I now teach in Doranda College.               
	Corruption vigil        
	Baijnath Mahto (30), social activist, Dhanbad

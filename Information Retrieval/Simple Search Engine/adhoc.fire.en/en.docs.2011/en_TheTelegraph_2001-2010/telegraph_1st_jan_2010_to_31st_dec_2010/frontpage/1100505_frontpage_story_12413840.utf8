The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kerala IT seeks hartal waiver for three years 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Kerala IT seeks hartal waiver for three years 
          JOHN MARY                             A deserted street during a Calcutta hartal. File picture                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, May 4: The information technology industry in Kerala, Bengals bandh sibling, has a wish involving little digital mumbo jumbo: exemption from hartals for the next three years.        
	Leaders of an industry umbrella called Group of Technology Companies (GTech) told reporters here today that such momentous declarations were needed to undo a wrong perception about Kerala as being the least investor-friendly among Indian states.        
	Such an appeal may look like making a mountain out of a molehill in most parts of India, but not in Bengal, which along with its southern comrade-state, suffered another shutdown a week ago.        
	GTech president V.K. Mathews said that although Kerala was the first in the country to set up the electronics technology parks (Technopark) in Thiruvananthapuram, the states annual IT exports were only around Rs 2,500 crore whereas Karnataka accounted for more than Rs 75,000 crore and Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh over Rs 30,000 crore each.         
	The reason for the huge gap is that Kerala has failed to draw more than a few IT majors, which strengthened the perception that doing business in the state was risky  something Bengal is familiar with since the late 1970s.        
	This is not the truth as our own experience (of homegrown companies) would testify but the image lingered, said Mathews. For instance, if an American firm proposes to invest in Kerala, it will check with its embassy in New Delhi and the feedback will add to the perception, though IT companies could work without crippling hitches during some recent shutdowns.         
	A GTech delegation will soon meet leaders of the ruling Left Democratic Front and the Opposition United Democratic Front with the hartal-free demand and recommend steps to attract more IT companies to Kerala.        
	Asked about trade unions in the IT sector, the leaders said they were not averse to staff associations. But, they said categorically, transporting the conventional union culture would be deleterious to the fragile IT sector in the state.         
	The GTech Employees Forum and the GTech Womens Forum were being formed to address common issues. GTech had scrapped an anti-poaching gentlemans agreement in favour of mobility of employees.        
	The GTech officials also sought to put in perspective the employee profile at Technopark, the IT hub on the outskirts of the state capital, which is seen as elitist. The reality is that 50 per cent of the employees come from families with a monthly income of less than Rs 15,000 and an equal number came from schools that had Malayalam as the medium of education, the officials said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Power failure? Call the commissioner
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Power failure? Call the commissioner
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 1: If you are an electrical engineer and are looking for a job, put in an application for the Calcutta police commissioners post.        
	The berth is not vacant yet, but when it becomes so, chances are that your ability to tell between a schematic diagram and a circuit diagram could be the clincher for landing the job.        
	The current police chief, Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, put up a valiant fight on live television today to defend his departments role in the ever-multiplying investigations into the Eden Gardens lights collapse during the one-dayer against Sri Lanka.         
	But he found himself tied up in knots when challenged over the phone by an adviser of the Cricket Association of Bengal, and the police version was tweaked during the question-and-answer session beamed live on STAR Ananda.        
	The police chiefs bosses were also not helping matters at Writers Buildings.        
	The chief minister ordered a new inquiry (see chart) even as the chief secretary commissioned another by a panel supposed to implement the recommendations of the first, reducing the hunt for the cause of the Eden floodlight fiasco into a probe-a-day farce.        
	Commissioner Gautam Mohan, whose threat not to allow the Eden to host matches under lights until the system is made foolproof has raised questions about where his responsibility begins and ends, added to the confusion by claiming that the CAB hadnt submitted any circuit diagram of the tower with the police.        
	The CAB adviser on stadium lighting, Sadhan Mukherjee, was then called on air via telephone. Mukherjee insisted he had submitted a circuit diagram. The police chief then said it was best to ask special additional commissioner Debasish Roy, who had been told to probe the matter because the police officer has an electrical engineering background, and gave the phone number to the anchor.        
	After repeated attempts the anchor said kete dichchhen (the line is being cut)  Roy came on the line and a debate on circuits ensued. Roy conceded he did receive a diagram but it was schematic, not a circuit diagram, and it was hand-drawn and illegible.        
	The hair-splitting continued for some time after which the police chief cut the argument short by saying: I think were just playing with words here. Neither is lying, its just a difference of perception.        
	At one point, Gautam Mohan said: This is absurd I am looking for solutions here, not trying to keep the problem alive. I am not lying, neither is anybody else.        
	The police chief had earlier said Mukherjee had identified a circuit fault as the cause. But Mukherjee denied having come to any conclusion on the cause of the partial blackout. Thats a complete misrepresentation of facts. I never pointed out the reason, Mukherjee said over the phone as the police chief listened in the studio.         
	Gautam Mohan, accused by CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya of submitting a politically motivated report and by Mamata Banerjee of exceeding his brief, claimed during the television debate in the evening that he had been quoted out of context. I had only placed a condition that I could not allow matches to take place under floodlights at the Eden till the lighting system had been made foolproof. I was quoted out of context by the media, the police chief said.        
	Earlier in the day, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met sports minister Kanti Ganguly at Writers Buildings and asked him to probe the December 24 mess and compile a comprehensive report.         
	 The chief minister has asked the sports minister to collect reports from different agencies responsible for holding the match, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said.        
	Letters announcing the inquiry were despatched to the CAB, CESC, Lalbazar, and the public works and sports departments within two hours of the meeting between Bhattacharjee and Ganguly, sources said.         
	I have received a letter requesting our department to submit our side of the report by January 7, said Goswami, whose department is in charge of overall maintenance of the Eden.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti seemed to be the only one at Writers unaware about the chief minister appointing a third umpire.        
	As far as I know, the first inquiry report was submitted to home secretary Ardhendu Sen on Tuesday, while another by a five-member committee headed by the principal secretary of the sports department will be ready in six weeks. I am aware of the new five-member committee being formed because I signed an official order commissioning a second probe a little while ago, Asok Mohan said.         
	The five-member committee was announced by Sen yesterday, but not as a probe panel. It was meant to help implement the recommendations in the report submitted to him by the police commissioner.  
	probe a day  
	 CAB says it will form  seven-member committee, including police  commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti  
	 Police chief says only   one-man inquiry by a   special additional commissioner of police who is a former power engineer   
	 Chief secretary and  police chief rsquo;s brother  Asok Mohan Chakrabarti announces five-member committee  
	 Chief minister tells sports minister Kanti Ganguly to collect ldquo;all reports rdquo; and probe the matter

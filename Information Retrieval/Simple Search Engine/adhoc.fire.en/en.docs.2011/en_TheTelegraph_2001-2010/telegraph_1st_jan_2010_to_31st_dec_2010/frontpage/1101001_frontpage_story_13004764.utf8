                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Verdict: divide land     Hope: unite nation     3-way split plan leaves room for reconciliation 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                           
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: After the bated expectation on contemporary Indias most divisive tangle, an inclusive verdict that gives no party the run of Ayodhyas disputed site and makes room and time for political reconciliation or the final legal resolution in the Supreme Court.        
	Allahabad High Court ruled that the disputed area should be divided equally among the Sunni wakf board, the Nirmohi Akhara and representatives of Ram Lalla Virajman, after a three-month status quo to permit appeals to the Supreme Court.        
	The Ram idol will stay put where once the Babri Masjid stood and the area will go to representatives of Ram Lalla, who may build a permanent temple. The rest of the inner courtyard will belong to both the wakf board and Ram Lallas representatives.        
	The Nirmohi Akhara will get the Ram Chabutra, Sita Rasoi and Bhandar; and the rest of the outer courtyard will be shared by the Akhara and Ram Lalla. But the wakf boards share must not be less than a third of the total area and, if necessary, it will be given some portions of the outer courtyard.        
	Todays ruling left the temple claimants triumphal that the claim of Ram Lalla to the sanctum sanctorum had been given a constitutional emboss, but it also gave a toehold to mosque protagonists, which they now hope to employ to make a case in the apex court.        
	But above all, and to widespread relief from taut apprehension, it inhibited any resort to precipitate action on the streets by ordering a three-month moratorium.        
	The security establishment is still keeping its fingers crossed  the first 48 hours do not afford a lowering of guard, as was evident in 1992  but the respite rang palpably through a statement Prime Minister Manmohan Singh issued after a meeting of the cabinet committee on security (CCS) this evening.        
	By three separate orders, the honourable judges have given their findings on each of these issues and, in the operative part, moulded the reliefs to the parties in a particular manner, the Prime Minister said. The correct conclusion, at this stage, is that the status quo will be maintained until the cases are taken up by the Supreme Court.         
	Singh renewed his appeal for calm and held out a stern message to potential mischief-makers. Let me also state that the government on its part remains fully committed to upholding the rule of law and maintaining peace, order and harmony, he said, alerting the nation to be vigilant against disruptive elements.         
	That little untoward erupted in the immediate aftermath of the Lucknow pronouncement is a matter of some relief to the government, but it remains harnessed to the requirements of tackling exigencies. The hawkeye alert is likely to be in place at least until the commencement of the Commonwealth Games on Sunday. India remains on test, and the worlds watching. Nobody in authority is taking chances.         
	As details of the complex and divided ruling sink in, both the UPA dispensation and the Congress brace for adverse political fallouts, in particular of the manner in which Ram Lallas installation at the disputed site has been sanctified by all three judges.         
	Although minority voices were guarded, pinning their hopes on an appeal to the Supreme Court, there is an underlying sense of injustice and disappointment.        
	Syed Shahabuddin, a spearhead of the agitation for Babri Masjid, was dismissive of the judgment: How can Ram be treated as a legal entity? This is not a sensible judgment  and another leading Muslim voice, MP Shahid Siddiqui, said that the crime of the demolition of 1992 had been completely washed aside.         
	In contrast, the Sangh parivar, fronted today by RSS boss Mohanrao Bhagwat and BJP senior L.K. Advani, could barely conceal its glee. Both abjured flashy celebration of the verdict but both appeared happily convinced that even though an appeal is pending, todays verdict had sanctioned the construction of a grand Ram temple at the disputed site.        
	Indeed, Bhagwat indirectly hinted at what BJP MP and counsel in the case, Ravi Shankar Prasad, made into a blunt demand: that Muslims should now refrain from appealing to the Supreme Court and accept a Ram temple in the interests of creating a new peace and brotherhood.              
	Advani, who had refreshed his temple call at Somnath only days ago, appeared elated after a meeting of the BJP top brass this evening. Insofar as the judgment upholds the right of Hindus to construct a Ram temple on the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), this is a significant move in the direction of the construction of a grand Ram temple, he said, reading out from a statement. This opens a new chapter for national integration and a new era for inter-community relations.         
	It is the celebratory conviction of the Sangh parivar that nothing now lies in the way of a temple that has begun to worry the UPA and the Congress.         
	 For all their surface composure, nerves are jangling in the Congress over how the BJP could turn the judicial verdict into a political windfall.        
	Although the party officially welcomed the ruling, some Congress leaders are expressing serious anxieties over the sense of victory being projected by the Sangh parivar; their sense is that the BJP may now revive the pseudo-secular campaign against the Congress and justify its Ram temple movement in light of the court ruling.        
	It is not for nothing that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was closeted with top Congress leaders at his residence as the verdict rolled off, bit by bit, on television.         
	The look of triumph on Sangh parivar leaders is a cause for worry, not merely because of the impact it may yet have on the minority psyche, but also because of its implications for the Congress, a senior Congress leader said. This is not over yet, the challenge may only have been renewed today.

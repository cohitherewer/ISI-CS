	Ranchi, Jan. 25: State Congress president Pradeep Balmuchu has blamed Union home minister P. Chidambarams planned offensive against Maoists as the reason behind the Congresss poor showing in the Assembly elections.        
	In a report submitted to party president Sonia Gandhi days after the election results were announced in December, the state Congress chief had said that Chidambarams announcement of launching Operation Greenhunt proved to be a major factor behind the partys poor performance.        
	Though Chidambaram announced the offensive, he did not give the green signal to launch it. It proved to be disastrous for the party as the Maoists used their prowess to ensure the defeat of the Congress, said the 47-year old tribal leader from Ghatshila, who has been under fire from all sections of partymen, especially in his home district of East Singhbhum.        
	Reacting to reports in a Hindi daily claiming he had resigned as PCC chief, Balmuchu revealed to The Telegraph he had sent in his resignation to Sonia Gandhi on 23 December 2009, the day the results were announced.         
	I had sent in my resignation to her as election results were not as we expected. Even though the Congress emerged as the largest pre-poll alliance with JVM (25 in an 81-member House), we could not form a government. Later, I also met her and submitted a report on the poll debacle, he explained, but refused to say why he had kept his resignation a secret.        
	The high command was yet to appoint his successor, but some names were already doing the rounds, like Rameshwar Oraon, Sukhdeo Bhagat, Niel Tirkey, Theodore Kiro and Sawna Lakra. Except Lakra, all others had lost the Assembly elections this time.         
	Both Oraon and Bhagat, at the forefront of the anti-Balmuchu campaign, welcomed news of his resignation. The organisation had become quite weak under his long tenure, which proved to be one of the main reasons for the partys debacle in the elections, Oraon said.                          
	Bhagat said party discipline was the biggest casualty under Balmuchu. We expect a new state party president to take over by mid-February, he added.         
	On his possible successor, Balmuchu played on tribal sentiments. I hope a tribal leader replaces me soon. I have also advocated for it after we chose a non-tribal leader as leader of the Opposition, he said.        
	Balmuchu did not spare Subodh Kant Sahay, too. A non-tribal leader projected himself as a chief ministerial candidate, sending a wrong message among tribal voters who shifted their choice to pro-tribal parties like the JMM, he said, but did not name the Union minister and Ranchi MP.        
	Balmuchu said he believed the partys support to the Koda government, widely perceived to be corrupt and inefficient, wasnt a factor. We paid for that (supporting Koda) in the parliamentary polls. By the time Assembly elections were held, it wasnt an issue. Had it been so, people like Geeta Koda, Anosh Ekka and Hari Narayan Rai would not have won, he reasoned.        
	In fact, he alleged, that Naxalite outfits forced Congress workers to quit or sit at home in several constituencies. For example, over 15 block unit members of Ghatshila quit the party ahead of the polls, said Balmuchu, who lost to the JMMs Ramdas Soren in Ghatshila.

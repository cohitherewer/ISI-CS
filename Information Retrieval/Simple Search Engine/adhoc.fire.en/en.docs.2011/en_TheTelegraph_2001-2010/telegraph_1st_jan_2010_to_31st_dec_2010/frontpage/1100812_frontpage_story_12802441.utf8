The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State defends Khelgaon deal
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                State defends Khelgaon deal
  - Affidavit bares details of 12:88 sharing          AMIT GUPTA                                                     
	Ranchi, Aug. 11: Caught on a sticky wicket over the allegedly lopsided Khelgaon deal, the state sports department is understood to have justified its bargain with Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Construction Company (NCC), the developers of the housing complex in Hotwar for the 34th National Games.         
	While the department has submitted an affidavit on the matter, Jharkhand High Court  acting on a PIL seeking names of officials at the helm of affairs when the 12:88 flat-sharing agreement was signed between the then Arjun Munda government and the private firm  is yet to fix the next date of hearing.        
	Sources said the affidavit had been prepared after going through the nitty-gritty of processes adopted by the Munda government while finalising the deal with NCC. We have submitted the affidavit to the advocate-general and are waiting for the high courts response, A. Lakra, deputy secretary, sports, told The Telegraph.         
	The affidavit suggests that the plan to develop Khelgaon under a public-private-partnership (PPP) model was conceived by the Munda government in 2005 for which a cabinet approval was taken.         
	Since the state lacked prior experience in giving shape to such a project, Mumbai-based consultancy firm IL amp;FS was roped in on nomination basis. It was IL amp;FS that invited expression of interest (EoI). The firm also prepared the request for proposal (RFP) documents for technical and financial bidding.         
	Out of five developers who participated in the EoI process, only two responded to the RFP documents. They were NCC and Metro Builders of Orissa.         
	A high-level empowered committee headed by then chief secretary P.P. Sharma and comprising then development commissioner Rahul Sarin, then planning secretary S.K. Choudhary and then sports secretary N.N. Sinha was formed to finalise the deal. The panel was to act on recommendations of an evaluation committee of technical experts drawn from School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi, and BIT, Mesra.         
	Metro Builders scored only 42 per cent against the minimum qualifying percentage of 65 in the technical round. The Hyderabad firm, on the other hand, notched 74 per cent. The empowered committee then recommended opening of the financial bid, said a sports department official.         
	Initially, NCC offered only nine per cent to the state, but the consultants recommended between 10 and 15 per cent. Finally, a deal was struck, with the state agreeing to a paltry 12 per cent. The NCC contended that the project envisaged not just flats/duplexes, but an entire township with all amenities and keeping over 80 per cent open space.         
	The state handed over 56 acres  most of it acquired from tribals in the Sixties for an animal husbandry department set-up  and agreed to take possession of only 220, roughly 12 per cent, of the 1,796 flats constructed once the National Games were over. The remaining 1,576 flats were to be sold by the developer.        
	In May this year, a division bench comprising then acting Chief Justice M.Y. Eqbal and Justice R.R. Prasad, expressing surprise over the deal, directed then Shibu Soren government to furnish the names of officers who were responsible for finalising the deal. The court was hearing a PIL filed by Adivasi Unnati Samaj, an organisation representing tribals who owned portions of the 56-acre land, that alleged misappropriation of funds in the Khelgaon project.         
	The high court was irked with the alleged lopsided agreement that was detrimental to the government. It observed that the deal was nothing less than plundering of government coffers and held state officials responsible for the losses.         
	Senior office-bearer of Adivasi Unnati Samaj Shiv Shankar Oraon claimed that norms had been blatantly flouted at every step of the deal with NCC. The purpose for which the acres were acquired does not exist anymore. Legally, the land in question should be given back to its original owners, he said.

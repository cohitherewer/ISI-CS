	April 2: Michael Douglas pulled out of the American stock market after losing up to 40 per cent of his fortune in the 2008 crash.        
	The actor, who popularised the motto Greed is Good in his role as Gordon Gekko in the film Wall Street, admitted that he had enjoyed playing the stock market during the boom years. He told Esquire magazine: I lost 35-40 per cent of my net worth on the 2008 crash.        
	At the end of last year, I took a whole bunch out. The 65 year old said: I played. Years ago, through the tech booms, I definitely did it.

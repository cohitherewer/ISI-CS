	Jamshedpur, Dec. 17: Special athletes from Jharkhand took Shimla by storm, clinching gold in the floor hockey nationals yesterday.         
	The state outfit edged out Goa in their pool to pocket the top slot. It drubbed Goa 6-2 and followed that up with a 5-2 win over Bihar in the Special Olympics championship, which concludes at the hill station tomorrow.         
	Jamshedpur lad Vijay Mishra lived up to his reputation of one of the finest floor hockey strikers in the country. The 24-year-old slotted as many as five goals, playing a pivotal role in the achievement.         
	The boys are very happy with their performance, Jharkhand assistant coach Harpal Singh told The Telegraph from Shimla. The co-ordination was perfect and the boys seldom missed scoring goals. Besides Vijay, Krishna Verma pulled in three goals for the team, he said.         
	Vijay is a former student of Asha Kiran while Krishna is from Path. Besides the duo, the 13-member state squad for the Shimla nationals had Abdul Saquid, David Bensior, Purshottam Singh, Rahul Kumar Singh, Rohit Nag and Tushar Das from Asha Kiran, Mamun Rashid from School of Hope and N.K.V. Prasad Rao, Rajiv Singh, Udai Shankar and Vishwanath Tiwary from Society for Technical Assistance and Remedial Training Assistance.        
	Special athletes from 20 states participated in the national floor hockey championship organised under the auspices of Special Olympics Bharat (SOB), a social organisation that takes up the cudgels for the mentally challenged. The teams were divided into four separate pools. Jharkhand was in pool B, along with Bihar and Goa.         
	Singh said the Jharkhand team had two free days at their disposal. The boys are in a mood to celebrate. We are going for local sightseeing tomorrow. The boys are so excited that they wanted to make the trip today, he added.        
	The medal ceremony for the championship is slated for December 19. The winning team will return to Jamshedpur on December 22.         
	Expressing happiness over the feat, Avtar Singh, regional trainer of SOB, said the short-duration camp conducted in the steel city had helped the boys in several ways. They were taught how to concentrate and co-ordinate with each other. We also laid stress on safety orientation as well as fouls, which are committed very often, he said.         
	Assistant area director, SOB Jharkhand chapter, Satbir Singh Sahota, sports director Gautam Bannerji, coach J.N.M. Raju and his deputies Harpal Singh and Raj Kumar had toiled hard for this glory, he added.

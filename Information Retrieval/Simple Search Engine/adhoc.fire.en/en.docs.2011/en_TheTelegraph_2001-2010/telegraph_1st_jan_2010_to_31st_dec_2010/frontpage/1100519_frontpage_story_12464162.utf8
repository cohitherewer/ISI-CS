	Ranchi, May 18: A definitive end to the states 21-day political crisis appeared to be in sight with the JMM and BJP claiming that a final agreement on power-sharing had been reached with Arjun Munda getting to lead the government for the first half of its remaining term.        
	We have decided that BJP and JMM will share power for 28 months each with the BJP taking over in the first phase, JMM chief Shibu Soren and Munda, the BJPs chief ministerial nominee, told newspersons at a joint news conference after a three-hour marathon meeting.        
	The deal, which means Soren would step down on May 25 to pave the way for Munda to take over as the new chief minister, was struck only after the Jamshedpur MP issued an ultimatum that the BJP had had enough and would withdraw support to the government by the evening if the JMM leaders did not keep their commitment.        
	For the BJP, agreeing on a chief minister by rotation was a major climb down, given that the BJP parliamentary board had earlier rejected the JMMs demand.        
	At the news conference, Soren did not say in as many words that he would step down on May 25. Asked about his position, he said, Abhi main hoon, aage BJP sarkar chalaygi (Right now I am chief minister. Thereafter, the BJP will run the government).        
	In fact, Munda had to prompt Soren to say that both the BJP and JMM would run the government on rotation with the BJP getting the first shot at power.         
	Later, it was left to BJPs Jharkhand in-charge Karuna Shukla to clarify that the transfer of power would take place on May 25 with Ajsus Sudesh Mahto also confirming it.        
	According to a senior BJP leader who was part of the negotiations, JMM would have five berths in the Cabinet, including one deputy chief minister. The BJP would have three, including chief minister, the JD (U) one and Ajsu three ministers, including one deputy chief minister.        
	Besides, a BJP leader would be Speaker, while the JMM would get to name a deputy speaker.         
	Shukla told The Telegraph that she had already informed Rajnath Singh, BJP chief Nitin Gadkaris pointsperson for Jharkhand. The BJP parliamentary board will meet again after Soren tenders his resignation. And since Gadkari was overseas, he could give his consent over telephone, she said.        
	Munda, too, appeared confident. I dont see in any hitch in government formation either in the BJP or in the JMM, he said. The deal, he said, was struck to give a stable and strong government in the state.        
	I have accomplished the task entrusted to me by the party leadership, he said, adding the party would now formally name the chief minister.         
	According to BJP sources, Soren agreed to attend todays meeting after Munda threatened to withdraw support by the evening. But he asked that the JMM be allowed to lead the government for the first 28 months.        
	Later, sensing the BJPs mood, he relented, but sought more time citing a series of programmes the party had lined up in blocks and districts to commemorate the first death anniversary of his elder son, Durga, on May 21.         
	It was clear though that even after todays meeting, the JMM was yet to pacify its own dissenters. Party MLA Simon Marandi reiterated that todays agreement was not acceptable to him and others with him.                                             
	The 10 MLAs (with me) are intact and will show their cards soon he told The Telegraph from Calcutta. Seraikela MLA Champai Soren said he would speak out after May 25.         
	According to sources, the BJP was also under pressure from Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar not to break the alliance with the JMM in view of the Bihar Assembly elections in November-December.         
	The JMM enjoys support in at least 28 seats in Bihar in the areas bordering Jharkhand. So, the JD(U) leader did not want the BJP to antagonise the JMM at this crucial juncture, said a source.        
	Among the others who attended todays meeting were human resources development minister Hemlal Murmu and JMM MLA Teklal Mahto, who has all along been opposed to the BJP leading the government.         
	State BJP leader Raghubar Das joined the meeting for some time, apparently to clarify that there was no confusion over the BJP leadership.         
	The JMM-led coalition government plunged into a crisis when on April 27, Soren attended Parliament and voted against the BJP-sponsored cut motion. As a result, the BJP parliamentary board decided to withdraw support to his but put it on hold its decision once his son, Hemant, wrote a letter of apology and proposed a BJP-led government.

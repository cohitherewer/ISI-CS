          SUJAN DUTTA                            Indian defence secretary Pradeep Kumar and Chinese deputy chief of staff General Ma Xiaotian. The two sides held talks on January 6-7                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: More fun and games for the armies of India and China are in store in the high-altitude border between the two countries this year because 2010 marks  or masks  the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.        
	It is an irony of the New Delhi-Beijing bilateral relationship that overtly friendly exchanges between their militaries keep pace with the increasing number of allegations of transgressions of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).        
	The defence secretaries of the two countries have decided their militaries will play more rounds of ping-pong and volley ball, will swap martial music through an exchange of brass bands and they will also raise toasts to one another at more frequent border personnel meetings (BPM).        
	Just last week, a meeting of civil and military officials in Ladakh concluded that India was losing territory to China along the LAC steadily.         
	That was at the same time that the defence secretaries of India and China met for the third annual defence dialogue in Beijing on January 6 and 7.        
	Government sources said here today after the return of defence secretary Pradeep Kumar that Indian and Chinese military officials along the LAC  the disputed border between the two countries  will meet more frequently to sort out disputes at BPMs, a confidence building measure that was begun in 2005.        
	The two countries are unlikely to hold a joint drill of their armies  an event that was begun in 2007 and was announced as an annual feature  even in 2010. There was no joint drill in 2009 either.         
	In 2007, the first joint drill was held in Kunming and the second in Belgaum in 2008.         
	Defence ministry sources said the process will begin to explore the possibility of a joint drill in 2011.        
	A new element that has been agreed is an exchange of information on anti- piracy drills.         
	The navies of both countries have been deployed off the east coast of Africa to tackle pirates based in Somalia.        
	Both sides have also discussed the possibility of high-level delegation exchanges between the military training institutes, the sources said.        
	Defence secretary Pradeep Kumar had led a 10-member delegation that held talks with the Chinese deputy chief of staff, General Ma Xiaotian.         
	The defence secretary also met Chinese defence minister General Liang Guanglie.

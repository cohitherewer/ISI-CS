  - India-born artist sculpts landmark symbol for museum
          AMIT ROY                      Turning the World Upside Down, Jerusalem, the sculpture by Anish Kapoor. Picture by Peter Lanyi, courtesy of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem                                                        
	London, July 25:It looks stunning and it does exactly what we hoped.        
	 The words of James S Snyder, the Anne and Jerome Fisher director of the world-renowned Israel Museum in Jerusalem.        
	 He was admiring Anish Kapoors latest piece of public sculpture, a 5-meter-tall (16.4-foot) hourglass made from polished stainless steel.        
	 Its typically Anish Kapoor for he plays once again with reflecting surfaces, which is his special thing, but this time he has been exceptionally clever for he has turned the Jerusalem skyline upside down.         
	 Hence, the sculptures name  Turning the World Upside Down, Jerusalem.        
	 It opens to the public on Monday but already there is a buzz about Anishs latest work spreading across the arts world.        
	 Its magnificent, its really great, Snyder told The Telegraph. It is quite simple and quite a pure piece.        
	 The sculpture is positioned on the Crown Plaza, the highest point on the museum campus. The site was dug up, new galleries built underground and then the hill restored ready for Anishs creation.        
	 Anish himself summed up his work for The Telegraph thus: Jerusalem is all about a very special relationship between the ground and the sky. This work attempts to bring the two together.        
	 Anish is today such a star that Indians naturally claim him to be Indian  after all, he was born in Bombay of an Indian father on March 12, 1954, and went to Doon, a school dubbed by critics (possibly unfairly) to be a dumping ground for dullards with rich dads.        
	 Despite the latter disadvantage (if it is a disadvantage), his genius is now manifesting itself in a bewildering array of works across the world.         
	 The Brits say he is British  he emigrated to London, where he now lives, in the early 1970s and studied at the Hornsey College of Art and later at the Chelsea School of Art and Design.        
	 Thats all very well, the Israelis argue, but, really, Anish is so gifted only because he is Jewish on his mothers side.        
	 The Israel Museum does not have a poster which proclaims, You dont have to be Jewish to get a commission from us but if you are Jewish we wont hold it against you.        
	 As Snyder explained: We picked him because he is a great sculptor. The flip side is it makes it quite interesting to work with him because not only was he born in India  he has an Indian father and a Jewish mother of Iraqi heritage  but he lived in Israel for a few years as a young man before he moved to the UK.        
	 So that actually adds another dimension but thats not the reason (why he was commissioned), said Snyder. We really felt that the spiritual and immaterial aspects of his work would really make for a strong statement with respect to a work paying tribute to Teddy.        
	 The Teddy is a reference to the late Teddy Kollek, long-time Mayor of Jerusalem and the museums founder, in whose memory Anishs work has been commissioned.        
	 Snyder said: We have known Anish for a long time. The museum acquired his work in the early 1980s initially and there was always talk of trying to think of an appropriate site specific commission with him. What actually happened is that after Teddy died, a dear friend of Teddy who is also close to the museum offered a grant to commission a sculptural work in Teddys memory. And it occurred to us almost on the spot that this might be just the moment to commission something from Anish.        
	 Snyder went on: We thought if we commission something for Teddy, it would be something that would reflect the spirit of his vision.                   Anish Kapoor      
	Anish was approached two years ago. And he was interested. And he came up with this very simple idea which was recognising that the location which we identified, which is an axial view straight up the main promenade of the museum at its highest point, would be the place where a simple hour glass form would offer the opportunity to invert the Jerusalem sky and built landscape. And thats what he created  and its a superb thing.  
	 The artist wanted to study the location, said Snyder. By inverting the sky and the built landscape it heightens your senses about both in this really remarkable way.        
	 But would the surface stay shiny since everything depends on being able to see the reflection?         
	 It will remain (shiny) most definitely, was the response. It will need periodic polishing  (but) its there (permanently).        
	 Snyder seemed fully aware that the museum can use culture to assert the Jewish right to the territory on which Israel stands  or to build bridges.        
	 Snyder stressed the latter progressive and liberal aspect. We see our purpose is to show the time line of material culture in this region and contemporaneously worldwide and to show the ways in which objects from disparate times and places connect. It is all about inter-culturalism.        
	 He said: People come from all over the world to see the museum  one of the few truly comprehensive art and archaeology museums in the world: the term these days is universal. The collection begins with pre-historic archaeology million plus years ago and comes to true contemporary art and we cover all world cultures.        
	 He was interested to learn that Calcutta proudly maintains its synagogues, thanks to the efforts of people such as the writer Ian Zachariah, one of a dwindling communitys leading lights.         
	 We actually have a synagogue interior from Cochin, from a community from the 16th century of which our synagogue is the 18th century remnant, remarked Snyder. We have a substantial amount of Indian traffic. We have an Asian collection and a component of it is Indian art.         
	 He said his museum would warmly welcome visitors from India.

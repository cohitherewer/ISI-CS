The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Slumdog director takes on survival tale
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Slumdog director takes on survival tale
  - ONE-MAN HORROR STORY                                Actor James Franco in a scene from 127 Hours. (AP)                                  
	Its one thing to create a thrilling movie set in the mad city of Mumbai with a pair of young lovers, romance and money. Its quite another to do it in the Utah wilderness with one man, one rock and a sawed-off arm.        
	But most film directors are not Danny Boyle, the Oscar winner of smash hit Slumdog Millionaire. His new film, 127 Hours, debuts in major US cities telling the real-life tale of mountaineer Aron Ralston, whose forearm becomes pinned against a canyon wall by a boulder. Ralston had to crack the bones, slice through muscle and sever nerve tissue to rescue himself from certain death.        
	The movie has earned strong praise, and even Oscar buzz, at festivals for its fast pace and dynamic retelling of a lonely tale. Yet to hear Boyle tell it, the allure is not its gory ending of self-amputation. Rather, it is the strength Ralston draws from family, friends and loved ones hundreds of miles away to get through his ordeal. He begins to realise theres a movement towards something that, in order to have that will to survive, you have to possess, Boyle told Reuters, and its grace, actually, its a kind of humility.        
	If ever there was a story that truly embodies the cliche of being stuck between a rock and a hard place, it is Ralstons. In 2003, the experienced hiker and climber made the ultimate outdoor mistake. He went camping and did not tell anyone where he was going.        
	When easing down a mountain trail, he slipped and fell. A small boulder came crashing down with him and pinned his arm against the canyon wall, and Ralston was trapped. He was the only person who knew he was there. After five days and roughly seven hours, he freed himself by cutting off his forearm with a dull pocket knife, walking out of a narrow canyon, scaling down a 65-foot rock wall and hiking eight miles before finally finding other hikers.        
	Ralstons tale won headlines worldwide. To many, it was a one-man horror story, but to Boyle, it was something else.        
	To get through his ordeal, Ralston drew on a spiritual connection to family and friends. A person who prided himself on being alone, Ralston discovered the key to survival was his desire to engage life and not withdraw from it. Its not about a mountain climber or a man in isolation, its actually about a man whos looking out and connecting to people on the outside and trying to get back to them, James Franco, who portrays Ralston in the film, said.

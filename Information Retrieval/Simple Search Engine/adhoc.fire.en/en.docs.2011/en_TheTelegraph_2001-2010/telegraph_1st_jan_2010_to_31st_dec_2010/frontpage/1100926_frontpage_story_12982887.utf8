	Jamshedpur, Sept. 25: Encounters in two places deep inside Saranda forest in West Singhbhum left four Maoists and two Jharkhand district armed police jawans dead and one CRPF officer injured.        
	Acting on intelligence inputs that the area, about 60 km from Chaibasa, was infested with a large number of rebels, two police teams comprising jawans of CRPFs 7th and 196th battalions, units of COBRA, Jharkhand Jaguar and local police left for Tirilposi and Ratamati near Manoharpur this morning.         
	While the CRPF, district police and Jharkhand Jaguars personnel took up position at Tirilposi, the COBRA personnel moved to Ratamati, about 7 km away.        
	We have recovered two bodies. The forces are still there in the forest and the search for more bodies is on, said CRPF deputy inspector-general Bhanu Pratap Singh.         
	Earlier, two district armed police jawans, Rajiv Ranjan and Jehangir Khan, and CRPF assistant commandant Nitish Kumar were rushed to Rourkela Steel Plant Hospital with severe injuries. While Ranjan and Khan, who suffered shoulder and abdominal injuries succumbed later, Kumar, an assistant commandant of CRPFs 7th battalion, took a bullet in his head.         
	Twenty-five-year-old Kumar hails from Jamshedpur.         
	We engaged a number of personnel keeping in mind the large Maoist presence in the area, said Singh, denying initial reports that some policemen had been abducted.        
	The CRPF DIG, who monitored the operation from Kiriburu on the border with Orissa along with his Kolhan counterpart Navin Kumar Singh, said the police busted a Maoist training camp at Ratamati. He said utensils, literature and tarpaulin were recovered from the spot.        
	Singh told The Telegraph that the raid started at 4pm at Ratamati, and an hour later at Tirilposi. They lasted over an hour. He described the encounters as fierce.

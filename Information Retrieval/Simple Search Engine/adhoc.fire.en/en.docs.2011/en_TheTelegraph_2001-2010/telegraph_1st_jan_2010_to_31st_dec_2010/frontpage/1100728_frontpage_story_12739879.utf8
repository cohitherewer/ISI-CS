	New Delhi, July 27: A 150-bed hospital coming up in Rajarhat will join a national cancer grid proposed by the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) to introduce uniform standards of care and reduce patient flow to its flagship hospital in Mumbai.        
	The proposed grid will link the departments Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, with the Tata Medical Centre, Calcutta, and a new hospital that the department plans to set up in Visakhapatnam, DAE chairman Srikumar Banerjee said today.        
	Tata Memorial Hospital, which provides the best standards of cancer care in India, gets patients from across the country, including the east, Banerjee said. The patients relatives have to arrange for their stay and patients sometimes have to return for follow-up visits. The grid will allow patients to access similar standards of care from a hospital closer to their own place of stay, Banerjee said. The DAE will hold a meeting on July 31 to finalise the proposal.         
	The grid will provide a network for seamless exchange and integration of data between the three participating hospitals and serve as a tool to expand training facilities for oncologists, a DAE source associated with the proposal said.        
	India faces a shortage of 200 to 400 medical and surgical oncologists, the source said. The cancer grid is also intended to help develop the human resources India will need in the coming years, the source told The Telegraph.        
	The Tata Medical Centre, Calcutta, is likely to be inaugurated in October this year, while the DAE hospital in Visakhapatnam is expected to be ready for operations about four years from now. The foundation stone for the hospital in Rajarhat, being built on 13.36 acres, was laid by Ratan Tata in February 2006.        
	Doctors at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, estimate that about 60 per cent of their patients come from outside Maharashtra  and one in five of these out-station patients are from either Bengal or the northeastern states.        
	The health ministry estimates that about 700,000 new patients are diagnosed with cancer each year. Doctors monitoring medical care standards have long argued that a standard protocol for treatment should be circulated across the country.        
	Tata Memorial Hospital had last year initiated an exercise to release guidelines for cancer care  the first of a planned series of guidelines aimed at reducing the complications associated with cancer therapy.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pak broom and balm
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                            (Top) Younis and Yousuf                          
	Islamabad, March 10: The Pakistan Cricket Board today slapped an indefinite ban on former captains Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf after an evaluation committee said their infighting affected the teams morale on its disastrous Australia tour, but appeared to backtrack hours later.        
	A release issued by the board in the evening said the media had misinterpreted its earlier statement.        
	Some media channels have interpreted the first recommendation of the inquiry committee regarding Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan as being a life ban, the new statement said.        
	The PCB wishes to clarify that the recommendation is not a life ban. There is no specified term in the recommendation for these two players. As and when the PCB deems appropriate, these players will be considered for selection for the national team.        
	The board also punished five other players for indiscipline and poor performance.        
	It handed out 12-month bans to Shoaib Malik and Rana Naved besides penalising them and also heavily fined Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal and Umar Akmal.        
	Pakistan lost every match against Australia in their three-Test, five one-day and solo Twenty20 series between December 26 and February 5.        
	We are going to stick to these decisions we have taken after much thought, PCB chairman Ijaz Butt said in Lahore. PCB legal adviser Tafazzul Rizvi, who sat on the inquiry team, told Reuters that Yousuf and Younis had the right to appeal.        
	This is a good decision which the PCB should have taken many years ago to implement strict discipline in the team, former captain Zaheer Abbas said.        
	The committee, headed by former player Wasim Bari, found Yousuf and Younis, two of Pakistans most accomplished batsmen, responsible for infighting.        
	Their attitude has a trickledown effect which is a bad influence for the whole team and they should not be part of (the) national team in any format, the PCB said in its earlier statement.        
	All-rounder Afridi was penalised for the shameful act of ball-tampering in the fifth and final ODI in Perth.         
	The decisions left new head coach Waqar Younis wondering how to rebuild the side in time for Pakistans defence of the Twenty20 World Cup title in the West Indies in April. I will be talking to the board about this and see what happens, Waqar said from Australia.

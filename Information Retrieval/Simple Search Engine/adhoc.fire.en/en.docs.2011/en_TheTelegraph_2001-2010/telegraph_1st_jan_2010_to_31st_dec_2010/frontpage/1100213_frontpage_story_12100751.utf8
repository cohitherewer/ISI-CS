The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State push for steel firm plea
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                State push for steel firm plea
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 12: The state government has recommended a second iron ore lease in favour of steel behemoth ArcelorMittal that has been unable to make much headway in its proposed 12MTPA greenfield project in an area covering parts of Khunti and Gumla districts amid land hiccups.         
	Already late, the latest recommendation  made in the first week of February  is an effort to undo the mistake committed by the state government in October 2008 when the Centre sent back the states proposal on a technicality.        
	The state government, then headed by Madhu Koda, had proposed the entire 1087.75 hectares of Karampada reserve forest land for granting an iron ore prospecting licence when it was supposed to send the recommendation in two parts, keeping in mind the notified and non-notified categories of the reserve forest.        
	We have now sent the recommendation in favour of ArcelorMittal for Karampada iron-ore reserve in two parts  notified and non-notified. The Centre is now supposed to take a final decision, state mines director B.B. Singh told The Telegraph.        
	Jharkhand has been under presidents rule during 2009 when former governor K. Sankaranarayanan had decided not to send any new recommendation for mining leases, preferring to leave such contentious issues for a popular government.        
	According to the provisions of the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulations Act, 1957, the Centre was keen that a distinction was maintained between notified and non-notified.         
	While areas within the forest for which the state government had already invited mining licence proposals were classified as notified, the areas with untapped mining reserves were designated non-notified.         
	So far, ArcelorMittal, despite its commitment to the Rs 40,000 crore greenfield project in Jharkhand, hasnt been able to make much headway because of local opposition to giving up land compounded by political instability and a pending rehabilitation and resettlement policy.

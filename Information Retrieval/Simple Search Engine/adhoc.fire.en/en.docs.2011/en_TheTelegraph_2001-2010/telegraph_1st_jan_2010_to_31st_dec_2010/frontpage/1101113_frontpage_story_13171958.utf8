  - Owners of first eight storeys want rest to be razed         SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                       The Adarsh housing society building in Mumbai. (PTI)                                
	Mumbai, Nov. 12: Residents of Adarsh housing society are fighting among themselves over whether or not to seek a stay order on a possible demolition attempt by the government, sources in the Colaba high-rise revealed.         
	The ministry of environment and forests today issued a showcause notice to the society, asking it to explain why the 31-floor building should not be demolished under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986. The written explanation has to be given within two weeks.         
	Its abundantly clear that Adarsh had no permission to build any structure either from the (Union) environment ministry or from relevant state government authorities, minister Jairam Ramesh said. The entire building is illegal.        
	An Adarsh office-bearer said: We have got to know that a showcause notice from the ministry of environment and forests is on the way. We will reply to it. But we are in touch with lawyers to stall any attempt at demolition.         
	But sources in the housing society revealed that the office-bearers were split into two camps on the issue.         
	Those whose apartments are on the first 7-8 floors feel that the demolition should be allowed  it does not affect their flats and after the demolition of the illegal floors, they will not face any problems with occupation certificate (OC), water and electricity supply etc, one flat-owner said.         
	The housing societys occupation certificate was revoked and its electricity and water supply cut last month after the scam was exposed, and the CBI and the environment ministry began an inquiry.         
	The building is 104 metres high. The stipulated maximum height for a building in this area is 45.6m. Around 60m is illegal and constructed in violation of all high-rise construction norms. Plus, they do not have environmental clearance for including a part of the adjoining government land within their premises, a senior Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority official said.         
	Around 23-24 floors could be demolished if Adarsh is unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the illegal construction.         
	Owners of flats on the higher floors want to approach the court for a stay on demolition.         
	But the main aim of people on the first few floors is to save their flats and get an OC, so they can sell their flats. For that, they are keen to co-operate with the authorities and want to avoid legal action, the Adarsh office-bearer said.         
	The flats, bought for Rs 85 lakh, cost about Rs 8.5 crore. With so much negative publicity about the building, some flat owners are keen to sell.         
	Even if the controversy brings down the price a bit, the owners will still make up to 700 to 800 per cent profit on them. Some of them are already in touch with us, said Sandeep Chheda of Parel-based Chheda Realties.         
	Lawyer-cum-activist Y.P. Singh, who had filed a PIL in Bombay High Court against Adarsh for flouting various rules and regulations, however says the decision to cut the buildings water and electricity supply was illegal.         
	Yes, the larger chunk of the building can be demolished as it has flouted all norms. Yes, the occupation certificate can be held back. But water and electricity lines cannot be cut on humanitarian grounds  there are 2,500 such illegal buildings in Mumbai and though their OCs are not released, their water and electricity lines are not cut as it would put people who live there and have invested in the flats in difficult spots, said Singh, one of the most vocal opponents of the Adarsh scam.         
	This precedent is enough for Adarsh members  none of whom has moved into the building.         
	But it will be near impossible to avoid demolition as Adarsh housing society is under tremendous public scrutiny, Singh said.

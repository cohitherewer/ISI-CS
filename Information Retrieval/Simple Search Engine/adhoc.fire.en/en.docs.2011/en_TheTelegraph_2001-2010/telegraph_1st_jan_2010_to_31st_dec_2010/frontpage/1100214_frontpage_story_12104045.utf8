                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tense Palin deters staff return 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Itanagar, Feb. 13: The staff of Don Bosco School, flown in here from Palin in the wake of a volatile situation after Wednesday nights hostel fire that charred at least 10 children in their sleep, today ruled out their immediate return to the remote township.         
	Twelve school staff were evacuated by the government to the Arunachal Pradesh capital after a mob vandalised the institutions building yesterday by throwing stones and damaging windowpanes.        
	Father Jose Karripai, the principal of the school, said that there was a sense of insecurity among the staff and they were still undecided on their return to Palin.        
	Given the prevailing situation at Palin, returning to the town seems out of the question for us, as of now. The situation is really tense out there, Fr Jose said at Don Bosco School, Jully, on the outskirts of Itanagar where he is now staying.         
	Three sisters of the Missionaries of Charity were evacuated to the state capital this afternoon. Four sisters of the Franciscan Clarist Congregation, however, preferred to stay back in the school, official sources said here.        
	Official sources here said that though chief minister Dorjee Khandu, along with MLAs Bamang Felix and Markio Tado, visited the school yesterday and tried to placate the angry people, the situation remains tense.        
	Fr Jose said soon after Khandu announced a sum of Rs 20 lakh for the parents of the dead and injured children, the situation took a turn for the worse with a restive mob showering stones on the two legislators. The MLAs thereafter urged the chief minister to make arrangements for the safe evacuation of the teaching staff and fathers from the school.        
	A chopper from Itanagar reached Palin at noon and brought us to Naharlagun helipad where we were received by provincial of Dimapur Don Bosco, Fr James and vicar general of Itanagar Diocese, Fr Jacob. We were brought to Don Bosco School here after having a discussion on our safety and stay at Itanagar with them, he said.              
	Fr Jose rued the fact that despite rendering selfless service to the people of the remote area, they faced the ire of the local people for an incident for which they cannot be held responsible. It was a shocking accident but we cannot be held responsible for that, he added.        
	Fr James is likely to call a meeting within the next few days to discuss the situation.        
	Fr Saji from Kerala, who was one among the evacuees, also expressed his unwillingness to return. I am yet to come to terms with the incident. I am not willing to go and risk my life.         
	Fr Andrew, assistant parish of Don Bosco School here, even pleaded with the media not to click photographs. No photographs please. It is a question of life and death for us.        
	Official sources said that Arunachal West MP Takam Sanjoy, his brother and Palin MLA Takam Tadar, food and civil supplies minister Tanga Byaling and rural development minister Takar Marde met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi today. The delegation also sought central financial assistance for the families of the fire victims.        
	A source said that the Arunachal government was likely to transfer the deputy commissioner of Kurung Kumey, R. Kamki, over the incident.        
	Khandu, who along with state education minister Bosiram Siram, flew to Palin yesterday, announced that a high-level committee would be constituted to probe the matter.         
	Khandu said his government was deeply saddened by the incident and instructed the education minister to initiate prompt measures, including preparation of a list of hostels, with special emphasis on security.

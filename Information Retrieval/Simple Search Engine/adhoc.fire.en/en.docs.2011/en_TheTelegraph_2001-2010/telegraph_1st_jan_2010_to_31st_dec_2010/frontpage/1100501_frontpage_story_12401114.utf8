The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP taps allies to feel JMM pulse
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                BJP taps allies to feel JMM pulse
  - Munda, Yashwant front-runners for chief minister, but Guruji-Hemant equation casts doubts        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Arjun Munda and (right) Yashwant Sinha                                        
	New Delhi, April 30: Unable to resist the temptation of having its own chief minister, the BJP started speaking to allies other than the JMM to put together a government in Jharkhand, even though it wasnt entirely convinced about the actions of father-son duo Shibu and Hemant Soren.        
	Arjun Munda and Yashwant Sinha, both Lok Sabha MPs, have emerged as contenders for the chief ministers post with Munda being the front-runner because he is the only weighty tribal leader the BJP has.         
	Munda is a former chief minister. Sinha is a Kayastha, a caste that is prized more for its ability to create public opinion in politics than its small numbers. But the fact that Jharkhands tribals are far more politicised than their counterparts in Chhattisgarh and might, therefore, feel alienated under a non-tribal leader was factored by the BJP when it shortlisted the names today.        
	Sinhas name was on the table because some leaders argued that with his experience as a central minister he was cut out for the task of straightening out the messy administration in Jharkhand and providing a stable government.        
	However, Sorens silence after Tuesdays vote fiasco, barring a written semi-apology from him to Sushma Swaraj and Nitin Gadkari, was a source of worry for the leaders who wondered if father and son, Hemant, were on the same page on installing a government the BJP would head and if the father had a plan B of ditching them and doing a deal with the Congress on more favourable terms  for instance, a berth for himself in the Union cabinet and installing a JMM MLA as chief minister in a dispensation supported by the Congress.        
	Central leaders who were familiar with the political dynamics worked the wires to Ranchi to find out where each MLA stood and whether the JMM was on the point of a split. We should not find ourselves in a situation in which Hemant promises everything but the MLAs go away with his father. We want to ensure we have a government that lasts at least a year, a source said.        
	The partys parliamentary board that met here this morning asked Hemant and Ajsu leader, Sudesh Mahto, to come to New Delhi for talks with BJP president Gadkari and other senior leaders on Saturday.        
	Gadkaris predecessor, Rajnath Singh, is expected to play a crucial role in the exercise because as party general secretary in charge of Jharkhand it was he who persuaded him to go in for a tie-up with the JMM although several other leaders were against Soren.        
	However, the meeting is not expected to come to a conclusion because three key leaders, LK Advani, Sushma and Arun Jaitley, will not be around on Saturday. They will be in Gujarat to attend a government function and will return on Sunday after which the parliamentary board will sit again to take a last call on whether the BJP was in a position to form a government or should go ahead and withdraw support to Soren.        
	Briefing the press after the board meeting, general secretary Ananth Kumar confirmed receiving letters from Soren and Hemant after the BJP announced withdrawal of support.         
	Shibus missive said Jharkhand should not be pushed to Congress misrule, while Hemant stated he was ready to have a BJP-led government, said Kumar.        
	According to a late night report from Ranchi, deputy chief minister Raghubar Das, accompanied by organisational secretary Ranjan Patel, regional organisational in-charge Prasanna Mishra and state JD(U) chief Jaleshwar Mahto left for Delhi today to talk to central leaders.

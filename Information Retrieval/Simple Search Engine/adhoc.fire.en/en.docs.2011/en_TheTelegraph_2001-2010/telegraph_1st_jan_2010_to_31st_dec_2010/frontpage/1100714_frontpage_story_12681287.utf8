	Ranchi, July 13: Gods, supermen, freedom fighters, entertainers and animals  everyone has had their comic book avatar. Finally it is the turn of Jharkhands very own Birsa.         
	Taking inspiration from Amar Chitra Katha series, Jharkhand Tribal Research Institute has decided to publish a three-volume comic book set based on the life and times of legendary tribal leader, Birsa Munda.         
	Students residing in Jharkhand are aware of Greek and Roman history and can recite Shakespeare impromptu. But unfortunately, only a few are aware Birsa Munda and the stiff resistance he and his Munda tribesmen gave the British for nearly three decades, said institute director Prakash Chandra Oraon.        
	Birsas dynamic leadership sowed the first seeds of nationalism in the tribal heartland, which is why we are now coming out with an extensively researched three-volume comic set on his life, he reasoned.        
	Oraon justified the comic book format. Comics are richly illustrated and cheap. They can be read and enjoyed by the young and old alike. We want to put the message across to both non-tribals and tribals alike, in a manner that is enjoyable and readable, he explained, adding that the research was in its final stage.        
	Although many books are available on Birsa, this is the first comic book on the subject. We want to get the entire world interested in Birsa, beamed Oraon.         
	The three-set series will trace the history of Birsa, spanning 25 years from his birth in 1875 till his arrest on February 1900 and his death at the then Ranchi Central Jail on June 9, 1900.         
	Oraon pointed out that the institute has already launched a mammoth R amp;D effort to trace many of the tribal leaders who had laid down their lives fighting the British Raj and record their life and times so that they can find their just place in history. In most cases, no official records existed, causing collective amnesia.        
	Sanjoy Bosumullik, leading activist of the Jungle Bachao Andolan, who has authored several books on Jharkhands culture and history, welcomed the innovative move. However he added that at the same time, institutes like JTRI need to conduct serious research on the subject.

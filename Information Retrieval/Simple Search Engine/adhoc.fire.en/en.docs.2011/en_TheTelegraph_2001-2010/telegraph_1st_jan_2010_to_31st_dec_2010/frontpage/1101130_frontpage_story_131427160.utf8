										      OUR BUREAU      
	Kolkata, Nov. 30:The Left Front led by Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya will head for a political demonstration in the Metro channel, to protest against the raging corruption and Maoist insurgency that has affected the state badly.   
	On the other hand BJP came up with their Mahakaran Abarodh programme to protest the atrocities of CPM. They mobilised more than ten thousand people in Central Kolkata, and threatened to march to Writer's building and block the CM's movement.   
	The CPM supporters are gathering in numbers from the city and its suburbs, to head towards the metro channel. Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya will reach the venue in some time.   
	Situation tense  
	Several BJP supporters pelted stones when police came to stop them from marching ahead from the Tea board. Lathi charge took place and several BJP supporters were arrested. Witnesses told of crude bombs going off in the area.   
	Traffic choked  
	Considering the gravity of the two rallies, traffic in Kolkata has slowed down in many parts and can worsen further.

          SANKARSHAN THAKUR AND ARCHIS MOHAN                       Krishna and Qureshi in Islamabad on Thursday.   Jay Mandal/On Assignment                          
	New Delhi, July 15: Deficit outscored trust on the subcontinent tonight as the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan spilled out prickly differences over cross-border terror, Kashmir and Balochistan at a joint news conference in Islamabad that barely escaped a breakdown and promised no breakthrough.         
	Conducted on the prospect of a tactile outcome, talks between S.M. Krishna and Shah Mehmood Qureshi, which were extended by over an hour, seemed to have run into predictable alleys of conflict.        
	The Pakistani foreign minister appeared to take offence to home secretary G.K. Pillais remark on the eve of the talks on the ISIs involvement in Mumbai, saying it was deliberately timed. It was not just a peripheral role... they (ISI) were literally controlling and co-ordinating it from the beginning till the end, Pillai had said in Delhi.        
	Asked about the Pakistani governments failure to stop anti-India hate speeches by Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, the Pakistani foreign minister said both sides should create an enabling environment for the peace process but pointedly brought up the Indian home secretarys statement on the eve of the dialogue. How did it help? We were of the opinion it was uncalled for, he said.        
	India later took strong exception to Qureshi comparing Saeed to the home secretary.         
	Pillais comment suggested the shadow of the home ministrys unassuaged grievances stretched far across the bridges the external affairs ministry was trying to build.        
	Unlike foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, who ended her talks with her counterpart last month high on expectations, P. Chidambaram went away surly, and rather unconvinced, about Islamabads commitment to its avowals on addressing Mumbai and dismantling the terror network.        
	Of no less import, perhaps, were the emergent meetings that the powerful Pakistani army chief, Ashfaq Kayani, held with President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani just before the two political leaders met Krishna this evening.         
	The Pakistani army, word in Islamabad went, had drawn the line for the government as far as dialogue with New Delhi was concerned.         
	If Pillais comments ruffled the feathers of the Pakistani establishment, what might rub New Delhi quite the same way is the spate of firing across the LoC in the Poonch and RS Pora sectors of Jammu and Kashmir, which came even as talks were coming to an end in Islamabad.         
	At the end of a frosty joint news conference that unwittingly or otherwise might have addressed the concerns of domestic hawks on either side, Qureshi told television channels he would love to travel to India to continue the dialogue but left nobody in doubt the talks were not moving beyond zero-sum lip service.         
	In fact, the news conference, which had started in a mood of bonhomie, degenerated into a tit for tat between the two ministers, reflecting a widening of the trust deficit the talks were meant to bridge.         
	On the question of India supporting insurgency in Balochistan, an uncharacteristically aggressive Krishna accused Pakistan of not having provided even a shred of evidence on Indias alleged role in Balochistan.         
	Krishna went on to indirectly accuse Pakistan of encouraging infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir from across the Line of Control. Qureshi denied the charge and said no Pakistani government agency was involved.        
	The two sides agreed on the menace that terrorism posed.

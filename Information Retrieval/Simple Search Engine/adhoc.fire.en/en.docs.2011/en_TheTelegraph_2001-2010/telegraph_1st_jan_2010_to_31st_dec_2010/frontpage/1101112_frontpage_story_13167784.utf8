          KUMUD JENAMANI AMP; AMIT GUPTA                            ArcelorMittal office in Ranchi                                  
	Jamshedpur/Ranchi, Nov. 11: The state government will be issuing notices to 16 mega investors, including ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel, for failing to acquire land for proposed projects within the stipulated deadline of October 31.        
	Industry secretary A.P. Singh said the notices, to be issued after Chhath, would seek to know the reasons behind the companies inability to acquire land. The idea, he said, was not to take immediate take action against them, but refer their explanations to a high-level committee headed by chief secretary A.K. Singh.        
	Companies planning investments of Rs 5,000 crore or more were asked to acquire a minimum of 10 per cent of their total requirement directly. After a departmental review, we found that 16 units in core sectors have failed to meet the directives, the industry secretary said.         
	Apart from the big two, among the other companies that would be served notices were JSW Steels Jharkhand Limited, Hindalco Industries Limited, Rungta Mines, Electrosteel, JSPL, Bhushan Steel and Monnet Ispat.         
	Jharkhand will judge the seriousness of the managements of the proposed industrial units by the quantum of land they have acquired on their own, A.P. Singh explained, but added the state government wasnt planning to take any action that might prove detrimental for the industries.         
	But at the same time we want to ensure that companies are proactive about their proposed plants for which iron-ore mines, coal blocks and water had already been allocated, he said.        
	A spokesperson of JSPL, that signed an MoU in 2005 to set up a 5MTPA steel plant, said he was confident the company would not face any action as it had met the states land terms in Asanboni in Potka block near Jamshedpur.        
	 So far, we have purchased 300 acre private land against our requirement of 3,000 acre and the process is on, he said, adding the company had applied for 2,300 acre government land.        
	Similarly, ArcelorMittal is learnt to have started buying land in Kasmar-Petarwar blocks of Bokaro district, the site for a Greenfield 3 MTPA steel plant. Besides, Monnet Ispat is also learnt to have purchased a few acres in Bokaro district.        
	During Presidents rule, Governor M..H Farook had reviewed the status of all 74 MoUs thee state government had signed between 2003 and 2008 and cancelled 15 as the companies had not fulfilled their commitments.        
	In June, the Governors advisory council set 31 October, 2010 as the deadline for companies to acquire at least 10 per cent of the total land they needed for their proposed projects.         
	Sensing an opportunity, outfits in East Singhbhum claiming to protect the interests of villagers on whose land some of the proposed projects are to come up, have decided to up the ante.        
	Visthapan Virodhi Ektra Manch, a group active in Potka where JSPL has interests, held a meeting of its key functionaries at Karandih recently and decided to stage a massive demonstration at the Assembly during the next session.        
	We will press the state government to cancel the MoUs of Bhushan and JSPL as they are not serious about their projects and are damaging cultivable land in the name of setting up steel plants, said manch convener Kumar Mardi.

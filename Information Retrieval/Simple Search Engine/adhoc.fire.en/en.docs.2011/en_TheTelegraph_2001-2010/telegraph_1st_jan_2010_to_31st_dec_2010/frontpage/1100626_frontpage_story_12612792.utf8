	Islamabad, June 25: After yesterdays optimistic toast to trust, it is time for the deficit end to be foregrounded.         
	Exit diplomacy, enter plainspeak.         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram flew in this evening dousing the pretty polish foreign secretaries Nirupama Rao and Salman Bashir had put on the bilateral table with doses of unbrushed realism.         
	He has barely a day to spend here and he was clearly in no mood to waste or waffle; his bag of unrequited grouses, in fact, lay unpacked ahead of landing, old whine in new throttle: weve given them a mountain of evidence, theyve run around it and nabbed only small frys, theyve spared the masterminds. The home minister was not letting the demands of politeness tone down his thrust or temper.         
	Hafiz Sayeed remains at large and kicking, and New Delhi isnt about to stop complaining of hurt.         
	The last time the Jamaat-ud-Dawa boss publicly turned on India was barely two weeks back in Lahore. He raged on the prospect of a water war and he had Pakistans mainline political parties, the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party included, on his platform. Hes advocated assaults on India from many more fronts  Kashmir, Mumbai, Hyderabad  and he appears free to pick more destinations.         
	That rankles in Indian ears and causes migraines to North Block. Thats what Chidambaram is here to tell his Pakistani counterpart, Rehman Malik, on the margins of the Saarc interior ministers conference: if you cant arrest this man, at least stopper him, proscribe his verbal crusade, meaningful dialogue cannot be had while Saeeds megaphone boom is resonating.         
	Careful not to violate the gingerly steps the Prime Minsiters Office (PMO) and the external affairs ministry are taking towards reconstructing a negotiating channel, the home minister hasnt come here brandishing an iron hand pressed upon his dossier-loads of evidence of guilt.         
	But he is not wearing kid-gloves either. As one of his officials said: The foreign office is guided by a larger internationalist worldview, we have pressing domestic concerns and will have come here to make them known. Terrorism is the core agenda, for the foreign office, for the home minister, for the nation. We have specific issues and we will make them known.         
	But having said that, the North Block bureaucracy isnt deluded about fetching immediate results. Dont expect anything dramatic, a top official cautioned, evidently trying to temper the mood emanating from the Rao-Bashir talks yesterday. We will continue to press for action but we are well aware it will not get results.         
	There appears to be some accommodation of Pakistani inaction against those it already holds guilty of the Mumbai attack on the grounds that conviction is indeed a tough quantity to secure in courts here.         
	More than 350 terror-related cases have resulted in acquittal just this year and the majority of them have to do with violence wreaked in Pakistan. But then, there are limits to how much understanding and patience New Delhi is prepared to grant.         
	There could be legal problems, even though we have given them enough evidence on Mumbai. There are voice samples of handlers that can be matched and produced in court, an official said.         
	But there is also the critical issue of political will. If Pakistan is genuinely concerned about goodwill with us, what stops them from reining in the likes of Hafiz Sayeed? They can see as well as us that he is a throbbing stumbling block to improvement in ties.

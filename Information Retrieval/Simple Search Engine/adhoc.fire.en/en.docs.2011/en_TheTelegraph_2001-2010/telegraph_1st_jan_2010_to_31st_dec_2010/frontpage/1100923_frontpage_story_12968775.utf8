The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Fresh names for forest watchdog
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Fresh names for forest watchdog
  - New government gets cracking on pending proposals that will benefit industry        OUR CORRESPONDENT                             Wanted: a keeper                                        
	Ranchi, Sept. 22: The state government is going to propose names of members who will make up the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority and State Expert Appraisal Committee afresh as the nine names sent earlier have been rejected by the Union ministry of environment and forest.         
	The authority and the committee will be entrusted with the task of screening forest diversion proposals of different upcoming mining and industrial projects in the state.         
	Among the nine names sent by the state forest department to the Centre were those of environmentalist Hem Shrivastava, Dhirendra Nath Sadhu, K.N. Sharma, Neeraj Kumar Singh, former member-secretary of JSPCB R.K. Sinha and Mecon.        
	The ministry reportedly said the individuals did not fulfill the required qualification for the post of committee members. The move to send the names again was initiated a day after chief minister Arjun Munda cleared the trust vote hurdle with ease, on September 15.         
	In order to put in place an authority/committee, the state administration during Presidents rule had sent a forest diversion proposal to the Union ministry regarding iron-ore mining by Jindal Steel amp; Power Limited (JSPL). The proposal was, however, sent without any specific recommendations.         
	Similar forest diversion proposals of ArcelorMittal, JSW Steels Jharkhand Limited and Horizon Ispat, among others, are lying with the state environment and forest department.         
	We will first wait for a response from the Union ministry regarding JSPL. The department has also readvertised the plan to constitute the authority/committee as the Centre has rejected the earlier sent names, M.K. Verma, deputy secretary in the state forest and environment department, told The Telegraph.         
	The advertisement suggests constitution of an authority and committee for a period of three years. While the authority will comprise three members (including chairman), the number of committee members cannot exceed 15.         
	No member can be a serving government officer or an industry representative or representative of any environmental activist group.         
	A majority of the iron-ore mining areas in West Singhbhum earmarked for steel sector are in reserved forests where non-forestry activities are prohibited.         
	In these circumstances, the role of a relevant authority and committee is important as they would act as agencies to suggest ways to minimise the effect of industry/mining on the environment.         
	A final call will be taken by the corresponding committees at the central level.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Office of profit finger at Singh
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Office of profit finger at Singh
  - Board chief post hurdle in RS race        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             Kanwar Deep Singh                                        
	Ranchi, June 10: Assembly secretary and returning officer for the Rajya Sabha elections, Kaushal Kishore Prasad, today issued a notice to Chandigarh-based JMM nominee Kanwar Deep Singh, directing him to explain his position in the National Meat and Poultry Processing Board (NMPPB) constituted by the Union food processing ministry.        
	Singh, said to be close to Union food processing minister Subodh Kant Sahay, is chairman of NMPPB.         
	The returning officers notice followed a report in a news portal which claimed that Singh was holding an office of profit by virtue of being chairman of NMPPB and was thus ineligible to contest the Rajya Sabha elections.        
	Singh has been asked to reply to the notice as early as possible. I will seek guidelines from the Election Commission if he does not file his reply within a day or two, Prasad told The Telegraph today, the last day for withdrawal of nominations.        
	Incidentally, the JMM nominee did not mention holding the NMPPB chairmans post in his nomination papers.         
	According to rules, a person holding office of profit is fit to be disqualified from the membership of the House.        
	In fact, the Supreme Court had disqualified Shibu Soren from the Rajya Sabha in 2001 on the ground of holding an office of profit in Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council.        
	Sources said NMPPB did not figure in the list of statutory bodies whose chairpersons have been exempted from disqualification for holding office of profit.         
	Singhs lawyer, A.K. Lall, however, said the election process had been set in motion and could not be stopped on these grounds. Nobody raised the issue during scrutiny of papers, he pointed out.         
	Meanwhile, 12 of the 14 Congress MLAs were in New Delhi to scout support of central party leaders to form the government after the Rajya Sabha polls.         
	They feared that the House could be dissolved after the Rajya Sabha polls under a commitment made by Congress Jharkhand in-charge K. Keshav Rao to JVM chief Babulal Marandi. The Assembly has been kept under suspended animation since June 1.        
	Leader of the Opposition Rajendra Prasad Singh, who is leading the MLAs, asserted that the response from central leaders had been positive.        
	We have met Ahmed Patel, Janardhan Dwivedi and Oscar Fernandes and sought time from Soniaji to meet her tomorrow, he said. The opposition leader was also a party to the meeting held at Marandis residence where the former chief minister was promised fresh polls to end political instability and also told that the Congress will have no truck with JMM for government formation.        
	JVM(P) general secretary Pravin Singh, when contacted, said his party was keeping an eye on the political developments.

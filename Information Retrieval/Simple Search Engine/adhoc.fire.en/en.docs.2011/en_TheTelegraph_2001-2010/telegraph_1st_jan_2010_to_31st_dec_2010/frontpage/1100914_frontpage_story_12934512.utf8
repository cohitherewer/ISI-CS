The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Monday the 13th: what a day to prove 19000 points!
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Monday the 13th: what a day to prove 19000 points!
          OUR BUREAU                                               
	Mumbai, Sept. 13: The sensex roared past 19000 today, signalling the possible end to 32 months of misery and raising hopes of exorcising the spook from recession-ravaged western markets.        
	The index also beat the usual Monday morning blues and, just in case the superstitious missed it, the jinx of the day dated 13.        
	The sensex soared more than 408 points to close a day of frenetic trading at 19208.22 points  a level that hasnt been reached since January 17, 2008.        
	Monday usually isnt a great day for stock markets. Some of the worst dog days for the markets have been recorded in the history books as Black Mondays  the Wall Street crash of October 28, 1929, the Market Meltdown of October 19, 1987 (earning its notoriety as the biggest one-day percentage fall in the global stock markets), or September 17, 2001 (the first day of trading after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York).         
	So, Monday, September 13, should surely go down as a new colour-coded, red-letter day when Dalal Street bucked the colossal weight of history to post one of the biggest gains in the sensex in recent times.         
	The euphoria hit the markets as the bulls came charging down the street.        
	The rally was underpinned by a host of local and global factors: the robust 13.8 per cent growth in factory output in July over a year ago, the scramble by overseas investors to funnel money into local stocks and the strong Asian and European markets on clear evidence of a surge in Chinese domestic demand.        
	We are probably heading towards an all-time high, said Parag Doctor, associate vice-president and senior technical analyst at brokerage Motilal Oswal. I see very little resistance ahead; once the indices have crossed the important levels, there seems very little reason not to buy.        
	Its the only economy in Asia driven by domestic demand, said Christopher Wood, a strategist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, explaining why the overseas funds are chasing Indian stocks.        
	However, Gaurav Dua of Sharekhan was astounded by the strong market momentum. It was a surprise for everyone. Sure, there were strong cues for the market but a 400-point rally was completely unexpected.         
	Several pundits felt that the market had finally shaken off the concerns over problems in other parts of the world and was starting to gain confidence in the Indian economy itself which is projected to grow 8.5 per cent this year.        
	The Indian equities will continue to be the sweet spot and gradually move upwards, said Angel Brokings chairman and managing director Dinesh Thakkar.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Childs play? Ask after 2012
          OUR BUREAU                            Sania Mirza at the news conference in Hyderabad. (AFP)                                   
	Hyderabad, March 30: Sania Mirza today revealed the date of her wedding but not the details of her first meeting with fiance Shoaib Malik.        
	She said she would marry the Pakistani cricketer on April 15 in Hyderabad and would retain her Indian passport even while residing in Dubai with her husband.        
	She, however, declined to answer the personal question about her first meeting with Shoaib, saying only that she had known him for the past seven years. Seven years ago, Sania was a little-known schoolgirl and Shoaib a struggling rookie.        
	Reports said the couple had met in Hobart last January when Pakistan was playing in Australia, days before Sania broke off her previous engagement with childhood friend Sohrab Mirza.        
	The tennis star and her family returned to Hyderabad this evening from Delhi, where they secured visas from the Pakistan high commission for their trip to Lahore to attend the wedding reception, and distributed sweets among journalists gathered outside their home.        
	Six members of Shoaibs family too are understood to have applied for Indian visas to travel to the wedding, a PTI report said.        
	I am very happy. Our wedding will be held in Hyderabad on April 15 and later we plan to hold a reception in Pakistan and once again in Hyderabad, Sania announced.        
	Sania said she was proud of Shoaibs sporting ability and personality. I was hysterical when he hit 90-odd runs in 24 balls and even phoned him then, the giggling bride-to-be said.        
	Whom would she support during an India-Pakistan cricket match? I will obviously support India but I will also support my husband, she replied.        
	She added: I will hold my Indian passport though I might become a resident of Dubai. Dubai is my second home where I have lived in my sisters place several times.        
	Asked whether her children would play tennis or cricket, Sania laughed and said: I will think of (raising a) family only after I play for India in the 2012 Olympics, and not till then.        
	One question seemed to annoy her. Did she want others to emulate her example of marrying a Pakistani, a reporter asked. We are getting married. We are not making any political statement or anything on (Indo-Pak) relations, Sania shot back.        
	Some Hyderabadis expressed surprise at Sanias new engagement following so quickly after her first ended.        
	Anupama Pitti, one of Sanias former classmates, said: Sania was a very orthodox and shy girl. I am amazed how fast she takes decisions nowadays. Earlier she used to brood for days even before she would return a hello to a boy.        
	Senior lawyer Ayesha Begum said: Sania is a celeb and so she can speak her mind and shift from Sohrab to Shoaib in a matter of days. Will every Muslim girl, however modern and rich, be able to do so?        
	Bajrang Dal activists shouted slogans in front of the Mirza home today asking Sania not to marry a Pakistani, but were removed by the police before the familys return from Delhi.        
	Asked about the demonstration, Sania told reporters: We are happy. You should not speak such things with mithai in your hands.

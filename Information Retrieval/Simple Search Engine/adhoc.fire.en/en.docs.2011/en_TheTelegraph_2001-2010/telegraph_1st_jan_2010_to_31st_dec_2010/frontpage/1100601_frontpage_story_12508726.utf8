	Ranchi, May 31: Governor M..H. Farook is understood to have apprised the Centre that none of the main parties in the state is in a position to form a government in Jharkhand after he held a series of meetings with key leaders throughout the day, indicating that the imposition of Presidents rule was perhaps the only way out.         
	The governors assessment came after he met leaders of BJP, Congress and JVM (P) who made a beeline for Raj Bhavan through the day, trying to facilitate formation of an alternative government in the state after Shibu Sorens resignation last night.         
	According to a senior Raj Bhavan official, the governors report clearly indicates that clamping central rule in the state for the time being was the only way out. He is waiting for directions from the Centre, instead of recommending Presidents rule right away, the official said.         
	While the BJP sought a days time from the Governor to put together its formal bid for a new government, the Congress told Farook that it did not have the numbers as of now to form a government.         
	The JVM stuck to its stand and sought the immediate imposition of Presidents rule.         
	Party chief Babulal Marandi explained the rationale behind his partys stand, his thoughts shedding light on some of the issues the Governor needed to consider under the given circumstances.         
	Marandi said, The governor would never allow the BJP to form an alternative government with JMM support because both parties had failed to run a coalition government of the same composition, he told The Telegraph.         
	He added that either the Congress-JVM alliance would form the next government, provided they could garner the requisite support, or the state Assembly should be dissolved.         
	The BJP will not be able to form a new government at this juncture, even if it mobilises support of 45 MLAs. How will the governor ensure that the same coalition, which failed to work even for five months, would remain intact for the remaining four-and-a-half-years and work for the welfare of state? Further, the JMMs character and style of functioning are completely different from other parties. The BJP too stands divided on the issue of forming an alternative government with JMM support, Marandi said, speaking exclusively to The Telegraph.         
	Earlier in the day, the stream of visitors to the Raj Bhavan started with a BJP-JD(U) delegation led by Raghubar Das meeting Farook first at 11am and then again at 12.30pm.        
	The governor asked us if we were interested in forming a government. We requested him to give us a days time. We will talk to our leaders at the party headquarters later this evening and try to chalk out a strategy, said Das, after meeting Farook, implying that the BJP had not given up on the idea of forming the next government in the state.        
	After the BJP-JD (U) it was the Congress turn to meet the governor at 1pm. The delegation included state party chief Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu and legislature party leader Rajendra Prasad Singh.         
	We are searching for numbers. Whenever we have sufficient numbers, we will stake claim to form the next government. We are talking with all the parties and looking for probable alliances, said Singh, adding that his party was against imposition of Presidents rule and mid-term polls at this juncture.         
	Leaders of the third biggest party in the state, the JVM (P), arrived at the Raj Bhavan at 2pm.         
	Before new political alignments are worked out, we asked the governor to impose Presidents rule in the state and put the Assembly in suspended animation. Raj Bhavan should not allow Soren to continue even as caretaker chief minister, Marandi said.         
	Meanwhile, JMM and Ajsu legislators, along with Independents Videsh Singh and Chamra Linda today authorised JMM legislature party leader Hemant Soren and Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto to hold talks with potential partners to form an alternative government.         
	We are talking to everyone. But it is too early to say anything. Let us hope that things work out well. Now we are busy discussing preparations for Rajya Sabha biennnials, said Hemant.         
	Insiders said the Ajsus sudden closeness with the JMM could be attributed to the fact that the party was more interested in sending a candidate of its choice to the Rajya Sabha. As far as forming an alternative government was concerned, it could take a different course.        
	The Congress, on the other hand, would go all out to gain power in Jharkhand. If it could not get the numbers, then imposition of Presidents rule would be its choice.        
	Our state president Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu and leader of the Opposition Rajendra Prasad Singh might soon be going to Delhi to seek necessary guidelines from the central leadership, said party spokesman Radha Krishna Kishore.        
	Under the present circumstances, an early solution to the political impasse ion the state appears a distant dream.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cong resists NCP berth push
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cong resists NCP berth push
          SANJAY K. JHA                       Sharad Pawar                          
	New Delhi, July 12: The Congress is reluctant to grant food minister Sharad Pawar more ministerial berths even if he sheds some portfolios under his charge.         
	There is no question of either a promotion or any additional berth, a Congress source said.         
	Pawar met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on July 5 and requested him to lessen his portfolio burden so that he is able concentrate on strengthening the Nationalist Congress Party, which he heads.         
	Pawar did not speak of ministerial berths for his party that day, not in public at least. But the next day, NCP spokesperson D.P. Tripathi said the portfolios relinquished by Pawar should remain with the NCP.         
	Sources later revealed that Pawar wanted civil aviation minister Praful Patel to be elevated to cabinet rank and another minister of state berth for his party.         
	An AICC functionary said: He told the media that he wanted his burden to be eased but didnt reveal the entire bargain. Later, the NCP spokespersons demand for the party retaining these portfolios was shocking.        
	The Congress leadership is averse to the idea of allowing more ministerial seats to the NCP as the quota was decided on the basis of each partys strength in the Lok Sabha. It cannot be changed arbitrarily.        
	The NCP has nine MPs and has been allocated three ministerial posts  one of cabinet minister, two for minister of state. Pawar is the cabinet minister, Patel a minister of state and Agatha Sangma the minister of state for rural development.         
	Congress leaders pointed out that the Prime Minister had gone out of his way to allow Pawar to retain three important portfolios  agriculture, food and civil supplies as well as consumer affairs and public distribution.         
	This was a mistake as the three departments have different and conflicting responsibilities though they are inter-linked. One minister cannot do justice to the requirements of these three portfolios and this is reflected in the mess that Pawar has created both on the supply and the price fronts, a Congress leader said.         
	Some Congress leaders also saw a scheme in the timing of Pawars July 5 request  he met Singh on the day of a nationwide bandh called by the Opposition and the Left to protest rise in oil prices. The Congress leaders suspect Pawar now wants to escape the heat that is on him because of rising prices of essentials.         
	What has emboldened the Congress to deny the NCP the prospect of more ministerial posts is Pawars political vulnerability at this stage.         
	The ministers role in the alleged IPL bidding scandal is under the radar and any adverse revelation will affect his position at the International Cricket Council that he heads. The IPL money mess is being investigated by the finance ministry and former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi too hasnt abandoned his combative posturing.         
	Many in the Congress are angry with Pawars periodic dalliance with the Third Front when the UPA I was in power.         
	He is said to be back to his machinations trying to lure railway minister Mamata Banerjee, a partner in the second UPA government, and Andhra Pradesh Congress MP Jaganmohan Reddy away from the ruling party.         
	The Congress is now cautious and unwilling to yield even an inch to Pawar.         
	His supposed ploys and the Congresss refusal to budge may delay the pending cabinet reshuffle to, most probably, after the monsoon session of Parliament. By then, the Congresss organisational elections would be over.         
	The two parties would carry on with their battle of nerves in the intervening period.

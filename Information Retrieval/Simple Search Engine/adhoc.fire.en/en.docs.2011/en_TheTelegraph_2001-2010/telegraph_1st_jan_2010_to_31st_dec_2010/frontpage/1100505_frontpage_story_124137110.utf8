The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Murdered scribe's viscera not preserved
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Murdered scribe's viscera not preserved
										                              Koderma, May 5: Nirupama Pathak rsquo;s murder case takes many turns. After post-mortem the doctors did not collect her viscera for further tests, which is abnormal from most murder case investigations. The district medical officer sought an explanation from doctors, who conducted autopsy on the body of journalist Nirupama Pathak, whose death is being suspected as a case of honour killing by her family. 
    District Civil Surgeon Dr B Mohan said, ldquo;the doctors did not feel that necessary as the 'nucoid fluid' in the nucosa walls of stomach of the victim was normal (three ounce) rdquo;. He further adds, ldquo;I do not think it will hamper the ongoing probe in anyway but still the trio Dr Shiv Kumar, Dr Ashish Kumar and Dr K B Singh should have preserved it rdquo;. 
    Forensic and CID officials yesterday collected documents, including letters and other articles from the house of Pathak's family and traced some mobile phone numbers to which the family members had called on the day of her death on April 29. 	Pathak's mother Subha, suspected to have a hand in her death, had already been arrested after post-mortem report confirmed that the scribe had died of asphyxia as a result of smothering.
    Nirupama rsquo;s father and brothers in a media statement held her boy friend Priyabhansu responsible for the death of their daughter. According to them he made her pregnant and thereby she had to face this day out of societal shame. But in an interview with The Telegraph Priyabhanshu, the Delhi based journalist says, ldquo; this is a false statement that they are making as post-mortem report has already revealed that it was not an act of suicide but a murder where not only one but most likely many people are involved. rdquo; He further adds that ldquo;we were living together as husband and wife, only the societal ritual of getting married was about to take place. rdquo; 
    Priyabhanshu also reveals he is afraid that Nirupama rsquo;s family might kill him too, as they did not think twice before killing their daughter and her foetus. A police team from Ranchi will visit New Delhi tomorrow to interrogate Priyabhanshu to get vital clues. He and his friends have committed to give full support to the police team, to bring out the murderers before law. 
    Two police teams from Koderma have been sent to Mumbai and Gonda in UP where Nirupama's brother Samarendra Pathak and father Dharmesh Pathak were posted respectively, to ascertain whether they were present there on April 29, Superintendent of Police J Kranti Kumar said. ldquo;We are verifying all the numbers to nail the culprits, rdquo; Kumar told. Pathak's father Dharmesh and her two brothers - Shailendra and Salil- have been asked not to leave the town till further directions. ldquo;We are investigating whether they were in the town at the time of the incident, rdquo; said the SP. Police was also interrogating the neighbours and some local persons at Koderma. 
    Till now, except the victim's mother, none has been arrested and further arrests would be made only after the return of the police teams from Mumbai and Gonda, the SP said. The three had been interrogated yesterday and had denied that they were present in Tilaya on the fateful day.
    The Delhi-based journalist, herself a Brahmin, was planning to marry her batchmate at the Indian Institute of Mass Communication, New Delhi, who belonged to another caste and her family members were against it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Congress fishes for cushion

          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, March 31: Congress managers have launched an operation to manage the numbers in the Lok Sabha after the political flux caused by the womens reservation bill.        
	The government is working on two tiers to build a cushion in case the BJP tries to push the UPA to the wall with the support of the Samajwadi Party, the BSP, the RJD and the Left.        
	A group of parties and MPs who can be co-opted directly into the ruling combine has been identified. The managers are also working on anther group made of MPs who are either averse to fresh elections or unhappy with their party leadership. We are confident there will be no problem in passing the Finance Bill, no matter cut motions are moved or not, and we may be able to push the womens reservation and nuclear liability bills, too, a minister claimed.        
	The first target of the Congress appears to be Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). The sources said talks were in an advanced stage with Ajit, though some of the difficult conditions set by the switchover artiste were yet to be worked out.        
	The Congress wants Ajit to merge his party with it, but he is keen to retain his independent identity and join the UPA as an ally. The RLD has five seats in the Lok Sabha, a modest number but a valuable buffer for the UPA which is just about holding on to the half-way mark of 272.        
	The Congress also expects Ajit to extend support to its lone candidate for the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh when a vacancy occurs in July. The Congress has 22 MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly but it requires 37 votes to get its candidate elected. With the support of the RLDs 10 MLAs, it can manage the shortfall with Independents and surplus votes of friendly parties.         
	The Congress is desperate to find Rajya Sabha seats for some leaders and ministers.        
	The sources said Ajit Singh could be sworn in a central minister in the next shuffle. The other targets for co-option are the Telangana Rashtra Samiti and some unattached members.        
	In the second category, the Congress managers are heavily relying on the disgruntled elements of the Janata Dal (United) and the Samajwadis. We can ensure their absence from the House on crucial days if they are not ready to come out in the open. We are definitely working on that, a Congress leader said.        
	The Congress is also in touch with the Biju Janata Dal for a limited understanding in parliamentary proceedings even as the two parties oppose each other in Orissa. There is a unity of purpose  fighting Maoists and clearing development projects  and Manmohan Singh has been generous to Patnaiks demands of late.

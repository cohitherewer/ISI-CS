	Calcutta, June 14: The principal of La Martiniere for Boys broke his silence today and admitted that caning Rouvanjit Rawla four days before his death was a mistake but categorically de-linked it from his death and announced that corporal punishment would never again be practised in the school.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Sunirmal Chakravarthi said that he had admitted to the board of governors of the school that the corporal punishment meted out to the Class VIII student was a mistake for which he had also apologised to them.        
	The board made it abundantly clear that corporal punishment was strictly prohibited. I apologised to them. It will not be practised any more, said Chakravarthi, putting up his hand.        
	Rouvanjit was found hanging in his home in Alipore on February 12, the day he was hauled up by teachers for gross indiscipline in the classroom  allegedly bursting stink bombs  and the principal sent for his parents.        
	An internal inquiry committee was set up immediately to investigate the issue. The committee found the principal guilty of administering corporal punishment to Rouvanjit but did not link it to his death.        
	The board warned the principal for using corporal punishment since under the rules of the school, warning is the first action against such an offence. According to the rulebook, if the offence is repeated a second time, it would lead to suspension and if repeated a third time, it would lead to termination.        
	Apart from the action taken by the board, Bishop Ashok Biswas, the chairman of the board of governors, wrote individual letters to every teacher in the school advising against corporal punishment.        
	The board and the chairman took appropriate measures to deal with the incident, said Chakravarthi.        
	Narrating the events that took place leading up to the day that Rouvanjit died, and de-linking the corporal punishment from his death, the principal raised questions about what had happened after Rouvanjit left school on February 12.        
	According to the principal, Rouvanjit was given two mild strokes of the cane along with two other boys on February 8 for bunking class. They were let off detention which the vice-principal had imposed upon them for the same offence and, apparently, went home happy.        
	He did not come to school on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Why, one must ask. On Friday, he was hauled up by teachers for bursting stink bombs in class and brought to my office. There was no caning on February 12; the head of middle school wrote in his diary that his parents were to meet me on Monday. Before leaving school he hit another boy without provocation. That was the last time any of us saw him, said Chakravarthi.        
	The principal iterated that the passing away of Rouvanjit was painful for him and the whole school family, but according to him, blaming the school for what happened was not correct.        
	Maintaining discipline in a boys school without using strong disciplinary measures may be a difficult task but one that the principal sees as the only way forward.         
	It may be difficult to manage boys without strong disciplinary measures but with it being banned we will look for other methods that are positive, innovative and effective. That is going to be the way forward, said Chakravarthi.

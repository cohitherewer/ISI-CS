The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Powers go rural on New Year
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Powers go rural on New Year
  - Panchayat officials to be   trained in self-governance        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                           
	Ranchi, Dec. 22: The marathon exercise to elect as many as 53,000 rural representatives  the first time in 32 years  almost over, the state government wishes to begin power transfer as enshrined in the Constitution in a phased manner from New Year.        
	It has asked all departments concerned to begin issuing notification for transfer of power to panchayats. The same has to be done keeping in view rules and laws in the state.        
	Altogether, 43,916 ward members, 4,423 mukhiyas, 4,423 panchayat samiti members and 445 zilla parishad members will be declared elected by December 31. The final round of counting will begin on December 28.         
	Under the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution, a panchayat can have jurisdiction over as many as 29 matters, including agriculture, implementation of land reforms, minor irrigation, animal husbandry, fisheries, social forestry, rural housing, poverty alleviation programmes, public distribution system and primary and secondary schools.         
	Allaying fears of opposition from MPs, MLAs and bureaucrats, chief minister Arjun Munda today told The Telegraph that the transfer of powers would be smooth. We have already asked departments to work out the modalities for decentralisation of power, he added.        
	Rural development and panchayati raj secretary S.K. Satpathy maintained work was on for decentralisation of power. But it has to be in a phased manner. We have to first undertake a capacity-building exercise for elected representatives before entrusting them with powers.        
	Satpathy said projects under MNREGA and other poverty alleviation programmes under the rural development department would be transferred immediately after training. Panchayat officials will also be given control of the public distribution system. Since the powers concerning 29 heads, as mentioned in the Constitution, are related to other departments, they have to take a call. Instructions have been issued by the chief secretary in this regard.         
	He, however, added that zilla parishad chairpersons and members would soon get charge of the district rural development agency (DRDA). The chairperson will head the DRDA. Similarly, the block establishment is there for panchayat pramukhs. So, all hands will be full.        
	Panchayati raj director Subhendra Jha said they had planned a three-tier training for elected representatives. The programme will be conducted for three to five days either in January-end or in the first week of February.         
	While training for mukhiyas and ward members will be held at the block level, those for panchayat samiti members and pramukhs will be held at the district level. Zilla parishad members, on the other hand, will be trained at state level, Jha said.        
	According to Satpathy, panchayat secretariats are ready for elected representatives to conduct business. Devolution of funds to panchayats, with recommendation from a state finance commission, will be carried out later after the rural officials are trained and capable of handling the aid.        
	The finance commission has to be constituted to make recommendations to the governor regarding principles that will govern distribution of net proceeds of taxes, duties, tolls and fees between the state and panchayats.        
	Under the Constitution, the state legislature is required to endow panchayats with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-governance. Powers include preparation of plans for economic development and social justice and also implementation of such schemes for economic development and social justice.        
	Archana Mahto, the newly elected mukhiya of Muramkala in Ramgarh district, sounded upbeat over the development. We can generate awareness among villagers about various poverty alleviation schemes before powers are transferred, she said.         
	An MBA with a degree in social work, 35-year-old Archana said the face of her village would change, come what may.         
	She is hopeful that the government will transfer powers for construction of roads and improving drainage systems soon. The Ramgarh deputy commissioner has convened a meeting tomorrow to discuss these issues, she said.

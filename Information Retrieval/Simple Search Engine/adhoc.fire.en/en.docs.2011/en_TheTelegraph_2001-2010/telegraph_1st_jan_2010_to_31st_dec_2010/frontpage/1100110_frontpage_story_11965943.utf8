  - Sanjay quits, others warm up           RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                              Sanjay Dutt: Resigns as Samajwadi Party  general secretary            Jaya Prada (left) and Jaya Bachchan:	 May resign      
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Jan. 9: The politicians white kurta-pyjama had gone, the message came in a casual blue jeans and white T-shirt.        
	Sanjay Dutt today resigned as Samajwadi Party general secretary, following in the footsteps of his elder brother Amar Singh amid signs of Bollywoods imminent exit from Mulayam Singh Yadavs outfit.        
	Sources close to actresses Jaya Bachchan and Jaya Prada, both Samajwadi MPs, said they too would announce their resignations from party posts within a week as the churning in the heartland party continued since Amars fax from Dubai earlier this week.        
	Bhojpuri singer and actor Manoj Tiwari also appeared on the way out after he told a channel he would quit soon, making it clear  like Sanjay  that his loyalty was to Amar, the partys link with Bollywood.        
	Sanjays announcement came at a hurriedly called news conference at his Mumbai home. After my elder brother Amar Singh stepped down as general secretary, I have no right to hold this post, the actor who joined the party on the eve of the 2009 Lok Sabha polls said.        
	He might, Sanjay added in response to a question, even follow Amar into the Congress. He is my elder brother and I will go where he goes. For me he is the most important person and, yes, politics to me is more about individuals than ideals, he said.        
	As the exit of the Bollywood brigade looked imminent, former Mulayam confidant Azam Khan, who had left to protest Jaya Pradas candidacy from Rampur in the Lok Sabha polls, summed up the mood. Let us see what shape the party takes. One thing is sure, the departure of the entertainers will benefit the party and not weaken it, he told a TV channel.        
	Khan, who has a big following among west Uttar Pradesh Muslims, has reportedly said the actress would have to go before he returned.        
	A source close to Sanjay said the political shift may not come immediately. Amar Singhji is still a member of Parliament and plans to continue his full tenure as an MP. So he (Sanjay) will not quit the party immediately. But he will not be with the Samajwadi Party for all practical purposes.        
	The developments came on a day Amar confronted in a blog party veterans who had banded themselves into a pressure group to ensure Mulayam didnt dissuade him from quitting as general secretary, spokesman and parliamentary board member.         
	While senior MP Janeshwar Mishra  a Mulayam confidant  was too ill to attend the Rajya Sabha even once, Amar said he was on the campaign trail for the 2007 state elections a day after he had been operated on.        
	I wrenched the saline tubes and walked out of the hospital to address a big rally I had planned in Bareilly with N. Chandrababu Naidu, Jayalalithaa and Farooq Abdullah, Amar wrote in the late-evening blog.        
	Mishra was among those behind a whisper campaign against Amar for injecting the poison of capitalism in a party of socialist vintage.         
	The ostensible provocation was a televised interview of Ram Gopal Yadav, Rajya Sabha MP and Mulayams relative, where he accused Amar of bringing the party to ruin. Had he (Amar) not managed our affairs, we would still have been ruling in Uttar Pradesh, Ram Gopal said.        
	At his news conference, Sanjay said he was disappointed with the way Ram Gopal had treated his mentor. Ram Gopalji has commented very harshly about Amar Singhji in the past. After all that he has done for the SP, Amar Singhji did not deserve this, the actor said.        
	Sanjay said Ram Gopal had also upset him when he dismissed him as a filmwalla who had contributed nothing to the party. We filmwallas are an emotional lot. So I have decided to quit from party posts, said the actor.

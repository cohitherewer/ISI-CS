          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 11: The state governments co-ordination committee headed by JMM chief Shibu Soren today resolved to formulate a common minimum programme (CMP) in consultation with alliance partners.        
	At its maiden meeting today, the committee, that was formed to give the JMM patriarch a role in the governance of the state, decided to function out of the former chief ministers Morabadi residence with the land revenue minister claiming that henceforth all major projects and schemes would inaugurated or launched by none other than Guruji.        
	Mathura Prasad, also a senior JMM leader, said on November 15, Soren would launch the distribution of 20 kg foodgrains at Re 1 per kg to BPL families who did not figure in the Centres targeted list.         
	Chief minister Arjun Munda, however, did not comment.        
	Earlier, the co-ordination committee, which will have proportionate representation of alliance partners in order to frame the CMP, directed the state government to accord top priority to issues of common interest and not take any step that would lead to price rise.        
	Among the other tasks set out for the government were to improve drinking water supply and irrigation facilities, step up revenue generation and ensure proper execution of Centrally sponsored schemes.        
	The recent attacks on tribals of Jharkhand origin in Assam, too, figured in the discussions. The state governments delegation to Assam has not yet submitted its final report. But, I have been informed that over 1,700 houses of the tribals of Jharkhand origin have been torched by forest department officials. Consequently, over 10,000 people are now doomed to live under trees. We will soon talk to the prime minister on this, Munda said.        
	The meeting, which was presided over by Soren, was attended by all ministers except deputy chief minister Suresh Mahato who came in after Munda had left. Chief secretary A.K. Singh was also present.

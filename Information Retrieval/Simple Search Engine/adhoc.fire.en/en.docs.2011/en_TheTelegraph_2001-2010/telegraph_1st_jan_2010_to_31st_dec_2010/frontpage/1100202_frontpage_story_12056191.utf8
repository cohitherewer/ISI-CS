                                Lady Gaga                            
	All eyes on the red carpet at the Grammy Awards went straight to Lady Gaga and her solar-system gown. Lady Gaga has become fashions favourite chameleon and she didnt disappoint with this shiny, silvery, three-dimensional number that was created in collaboration with Giorgio Armani. She then opened the show in a green fairy-wing bodysuit  with matching green sparkle booties, of course.        
	Heidi Klum also had a futuristic twist to her nude-and-rose Pucci micromini with splashes of silver, and Jennifer Hudson captured that spirit with the geometric, clear plastic bracelets she wore with her short, banded black dress by Victoria Beckham that had an open neck, nipped waist and peplum.        
	Hudson, Beyonce  who wore a strong-shoulder, mermaid-hem gown in gray that had just the right amount of decollete  and Taylor Swift  in a Kaufmanfranco sequin-covered, off-the-shoulder gown in midnight blue  all hit a balanced note between style and the sophistication that comes not with age but so many red-carpet appearances.        
	Rihannas high-neck white gown with cascading ruffles and emphasised hips by Elie Saab was sort of a modern take on old-world Victoriana.        
	Britney Spears wore a black lace dress with black bodysuit by Dolce amp; Gabbana. Nicole Kidman wore a movie star-worthy black Prada gown with a halter neckline.        
	Jennifer Lopez, who had one of the most famous Grammy fashion moments in a plunging-V gown back in 2000, again wore Versace, this time a silver chain-mail dress with white chiffon overlay.        
	There was also a strong showing of gray, which is sort of unexpected considering the crowd.         
	Carrie Underwood pulled off the fashion-forward cutout look in an asymmetrical white gown with silver leather stripes across the bust and shoulders by Georges Chakras.

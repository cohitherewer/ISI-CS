	Lucknow, April 30: The bullets that killed the ambushed CRPF jawans in Dantewada may have been smuggled out of the forces own bases in Uttar Pradesh by their colleagues and sold to the Maoists.        
	Uttar Pradesh police have arrested two CRPF personnel, three jawans of the states Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and a retired CRPF sub-inspector, unearthing a state-wide ring that smuggled cartridges from the two forces camps and state police academies.        
	Initial interrogation indicates their prime clients were the Maoists, said superintendent of police Navin Arora of the special task force (STF), which carried out the raids that began last night and were continuing this evening.        
	Officers said more arrests could follow, with the six suspects having revealed they had contacts  mostly PAC personnel  in the districts of Gonda, Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Basti, Jhansi, Mau, Chandauli, Mirzapur and Sonebhadra. The police in these districts have been asked to raid the homes of personnel whose names have cropped up during the interrogation, PTI reported.        
	Maoists have been known to use security forces weapons and bullets, but were believed to have snatched them all in raids and ambushes. This is the first time a racket involving jawans has been unearthed, state additional director-general of police Brij Lal said.        
	Shortly after the Maoists massacred 76 personnel in Chhattisgarhs Dantewada on April 6, Uttar Pradesh police received reports that a man from Allahabad headed a gang of jawans that supplied ammunition to the rebels.        
	The STF picked up Allahabad resident Yashodanand Singh, 59, a retired sub-inspector from the CRPFs 36 Battalion, and his five accomplices in overnight, state-wide raids. The police seized 1,658 Insas cartridges, 600 cartridges of .38-bore rifles and 3,085 bullets of 9mm rifles besides 245kg of spent cartridges, mostly from the six suspects homes. A PTI report said magazines of .25-bore and self-loading rifles (SLRs) and AK-47s too were seized.        
	The spent cartridges may have been converted into live cartridges by packing them with raw gunpowder, Arora said.        
	The finished ammunition used to go to Yashodanand, who would supply them to the buyers, STF additional superintendent Satyendra Singh said.        
	Officers said the ammunition was probably handed over in the three eastern Uttar Pradesh districts where the Maoists have made inroads: Chandauli, Sonebhadra and Mirzapur.        
	Among those arrested are Patna resident Vinod Paswan, 28, and Moradabad resident Dinesh Singh, 27, both constables at the CRPF group centre in Rampur. Paswan, posted at the armoury, was allegedly the main supplier.        
	PTI quoted CRPF director-general Vikram Srivastava as saying that both constables had been suspended and a court of inquiry ordered.        
	The three PAC jawans arrested are: Muzaffarnagar resident Nathi Ram Saini, 32, posted at the armoury at the Bhimrao Ambedkar Police Academy in Moradabad, and Kanpur and Mau residents Vansh Lal and Akhilesh Pandey, posted in Jhansi.

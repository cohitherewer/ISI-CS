          BISWAJEET BANERJEE                              
	Faizabad, Sept. 30: Bhaskar Das sat cross-legged in his cot, smiling from ear to ear. Yes, the Remington typewriter. It was the Remington typewriter that gave me trouble many a time, he said.        
	Das, the mahant of Nirmohi Akhara, had filed the first petition seeking ownership rights of the Ayodhya land where Hindus claim a mosque was built atop a Ram temple. That was in 1959. Then in his early 30s, he had filed the case on behalf of Mahant Raghunath Das, who was heading the Panth Mahanandi Nirmohi Akhara at the time.        
	I was young and Maharajji had entrusted me with the job of filing the petition. Everyday I used to travel to Faizabad court and sit with the advocate for hours and watch a kat-pat machine striking at a piece of paper and leaving behind the impression of letters, Bhaskar Das said, recalling how he had gone about the job.        
	A moment later, a crease appeared on his forehead and Das, 82, began tapping his forefinger on the side of his head. The compound of Shyam Khatu Mandir at Naka Hanumangarhi, where he lives, fell silent.        
	Then he asked: And you know who typed that petition for the first time? A Muslim. One Siddiqui Sahib, an aged clerk working with vakil sahib. He died sometime in 1961, almost a year after the first ownership petition was filed.        
	Das recalled how he had to travel four to five times a day from the civil court to the Panth office to get Maharajjis signature because the clerk had made a typographical error. Vakil sahib was very particular. One mistake and Siddiqui was asked to type a fresh page, and I had to travel almost 4km to get Maharajjis fresh signature, he said.        
	As public transport was limited and he did not have a bicycle, he would travel in a mule cart, Das said. At times, he would walk; at others, he would borrow vakil sahibs bicycle.        
	Every time I had to walk, I would curse the Remington and Siddiqui. Sometimes, I felt Siddiqui sahib made a mistake by design just to harass me, he said.        
	So why did the Nirmohi Akhara file the petition?        
	In 1949, when the government locked the gates of the temple after idols of Ram appeared, we petitioned the administration to give us ownership rights because revenue records were in the name of Nirmohi Akhara since 1940, Das explained. When we did not get any response, we decided to move the court in 1959.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 9: Chaibasa police today apprehended a senior Maoist leader, Nalla Bhikshapati, said to be an expert in handling explosives, with the IG (operation) describing the arrest as a follow-up of the recent high-intensity operations in the forests of Saranda.        
	According to the police, explosives and a camera were recovered from his possession.         
	Known variously as Madhavji, Subhashji and Raviji, Bhikshapati was a member of the Central Technical Committee of CPI (Maoist) and was well-known among cadres for his ability to handle explosives.         
	Bhikshapati also trained cadres and had been based in Jharkhand for the last two years, making the dense forests of Saranda, Latehar and Parasnath his domains.         
	Sources said the rebel joined the Maoist fold in 1991. He had been arrested earlier and spent considerable time in Hyderabad jail. According to IG (operations) and police spokesman R.K. Mallick, Bhikshapati is a resident of Tatikaila village under Dharma Sagar police station in Warrangal district of Andhra Pradesh.         
	Before shifting to Jharkhand he worked for the rebel outfit in Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, apart from Andhra Pradesh.         
	Mallick said 25 gelatin sticks, 10 detonators, two boosters and flash camera were recovered from him.        
	Nalla Bhikshpatis arrest is an outcome of our follow-up actions after the Saranda operations. He is a prize catch, the senior police officer said, refusing to reveal where and when the arrest took place.         
	The CRPF and state police had jointly carried out anti-naxalite operation in Saranda forest in late September. The forces had destroyed several Maoist camps during the operations which left several rebels dead.         
	Forces engaged in anti-naxalite operations have achieved remarkable success in their mission.        
	However, police officers said the on-going operation is a virtual war.

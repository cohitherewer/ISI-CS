	Ranchi, July 26: Birsa Munda Airport witnessed high drama this evening as agitated passengers of a grounded Mumbai-bound Kingfisher flight alleged ill-treatment by airline officials.        
	Flight IT-3571 from Patna, with 70 passengers on board, landed in the capital at 4pm, 30 minutes behind schedule, when its pilot sensed a snag, possibly caused by a bird-hit.        
	In an immediate damage control exercise, stranded passengers were promised food and accommodation for the night. However, even four hours later, no such arrangement was made.        
	Trouble started around 8.30pm when some passengers voiced their protest. A heated argument soon snowballed into a scuffle with ground staff of Kingfisher allegedly manhandling some passengers.        
	Neeraj Kumar Babloo, a JD(U) MLA from Raghopur, Bihar, who was on board the flight, claimed airline officials beat up passengers for demanding food and a place to spend the night.         
	We were first assured that the flight would take off. After two hours, crew members said the cockpit windshield had cracked and the aircraft wouldnt fly.         
	It is past 10pm now. We are hungry and thirsty. The airline had promised to put us up at hotels for the night, but forget accommodation, we havent even been offered food and water yet. You ask and they start misbehaving with you, he said.        
	Harsh Parikh, a resident of Mumbai, had more to add. The airline staff are trying to keep us confined to the security area so that they can do as they please. No information on an alternative flight to Mumbai has been provided yet, he complained.        
	Upset passengers have filed an FIR with the Hatia police, alleging ill-treatment and attempted violence by the airline staff.         
	All the passengers have signed the complaint against Kingfisher ground staff in Ranchi, Hatia DSP Rajiv Ranjan told The Telegraph.        
	Kingfisher officials refused to comment.        
	Air traffic controller Raju Raghvendra Kumar confirmed that the aircraft had developed a snag.         
	Aircraft maintenance engineers from Calcutta are expected to reach Ranchi tomorrow to repair the aircraft, which will then fly to Mumbai.         
	Sources said passengers were likely to be flown to Calcutta by a morning flight. Airline staff could not say how they would be taken to Mumbai.

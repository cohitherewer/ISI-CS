	Nagpur, Aug 17 (PTI): Reiterating its stand on construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has said it will ensure that the temple would be built either by "consensus or struggle".
    "Ram Mandir is a matter of faith for crores of Hindus. We will ensure that it is built either by consensus or through struggle," RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat said at a function here last night.
    The popular sentiments and demand for constructing Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was there since the time of Independence, he said, adding all historical and archaeological evidences pointed towards existence of a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.
    Bhagwat inaugurated a public awareness programme of Shri Hanuman Shakti Jagran Samiti with the recitation of 'Hanuman Chalisa' 11 times at 1,000 places on the occasion of Tulsi Jayanti.
    The chanting was carried out across 20 cities in Vidarbha region.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Recruitment flurry in CU
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Recruitment flurry in CU
          MITA MUKHERJEE                            Key vacant posts at Calcutta University are being filled up with an eye on the Assembly polls                                  
	Calcutta University is on an overdrive to fill up several key posts, lying vacant for years, before the Assembly polls that can turn the power equation in the state upside down.        
	We have not been able to fill up a few important posts for long because of some difficulties. The process to fill them up has started, said registrar Basab Chaudhury.        
	The authorities would not admit but sources in the university said the CPMs rout in a series of polls and the widespread belief that it would be trounced in the Assembly elections as well had prompted the party to immediately start the process of filling up the posts with its sympathisers.        
	The university has been a stronghold of the CPM for more than three decades, with all its policy-making bodies remaining under the control of the ruling party.        
	A member of the CU syndicate said Alimuddin had the final say in clearing appointments to senior posts in all state universities.        
	If the posts are not filled up now, they may go to Trinamul supporters, said an official.        
	The posts that have been lying vacant include that of pro-vice chancellor (finance), university engineer, curator of Asutosh Museum, inspector of colleges, director of the academic staff college, controller of examinations and personal assistant to the vice-chancellor.        
	Some of the posts, such as the inspector of colleges and the engineer, are vacant for as long as nine years.        
	Officials as well as teachers said administrative work and academic activities of the university had suffered as the authorities had taken no step to fill up the posts.        
	Senior teachers are now asked to double as inspector of colleges, engineer or the director of the academic staff college. Students are the worst sufferers in this arrangement as the teachers tasked with additional roles cannot give their best to teaching, said a senior teacher at CUs Rashbehari Shiksha Prangan, known as Rajabazar Science College.        
	The post of pro vice-chancellor (finance) has been lying vacant since Tapan Kumar Mukherjee retired in December 2009.         
	Governor M.K. Narayanan, also chancellor of the university, had issued an order after Mukherjees retirement, asking pro VC (academic) to look after the job of pro VC (finance) as well. The order also stated that a new pro VC (finance) should be appointed within a year.        
	A syndicate member said the authorities had started a process to identify a suitable candidate for the post.        
	The post of controller of examinations fell vacant after Onkar Sadhan Adhikari was appointed president of the state HS council last year. He has been on lien for two years.        
	Deputy controller Debashis Biswas is now officiating as controller. We cannot recruit a permanent controller till Adhikaris lien is over, said an official.

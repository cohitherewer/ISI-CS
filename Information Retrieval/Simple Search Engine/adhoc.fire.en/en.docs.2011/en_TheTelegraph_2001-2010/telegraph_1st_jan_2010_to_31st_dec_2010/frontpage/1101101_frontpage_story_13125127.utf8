  - Delhi will have hosted all P5 leaders by year-end         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                (From left) David Cameron, Barack Obama, Dmitry Medvedev, Nicolas Sarkozy and Wen Jiabao				                                       
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: David Cameron, Barack Obama, Dmitry Medvedev, Nicolas Sarkozy and Wen Jiabao heads of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council  will have visited India by the end of this year.        
	External affairs ministry officials say it is unprecedented for top leaders of what is known as the Permanent 5 or P5 to come visiting in a single calendar year.         
	British Prime Minister Cameron was in India in end-July. US President Obama will come calling in early November. Presidents Sarkozy and Medvedev, heads of state in France and Russia, visit in end-November and late December. Sarkozys schedule, however, is still to be firmed up.         
	National security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon said in Hanoi on Friday that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao  the head of government in Beijing  would be New Delhis guest this year. Sources said Wen could visit around mid-December.         
	Just three US Presidents visited India between 1947 and 2000  Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959, Richard Nixon in 1969 and Jimmy Carter in 1978. Now, Obama will be the third US President to visit India within a decade, a government official said. Bill Clinton was here in 2000, followed by George W. Bush in 2006.        
	Government sources said Indias increasing economic clout is the reason for the visits.         
	Last week, global consultancy firm KPMG forecast that India would spend $112 billion on capital defence acquisitions between now and 2016  one of the largest procurement cycles in the world. These defence deals would also create opportunities worth $30 billion for Indias domestic industry, KPMG said.         
	Russia hopes to seal a $30-billion stealth fighter joint production agreement. France expects to bag a $2.1-billion deal to upgrade Indias Mirage-2000 fighter aircraft. It will also push for European aerospace consortium EADSs bid to sell 126 fighter jets and 197 helicopters to New Delhi  a deal worth $12 billion. UK secured a $1.1-billion contract to supply the Indian Air Force with 57 Advanced Jet Trainers.         
	But sources say by far the most important visit will be that of Wen. Menon is to travel to Beijing in end-November to meet his Chinese counterpart, Dai Bingguo, to discuss the agenda for the visit. Zhou Yongkang, who ranks ninth in the hierarchy of the Communist Party of China, will arrive here on a three-day visit from tomorrow that Menon has described as very important. India and China have several outstanding issues to thrash out, including the boundary issue and Chinas issuing of stapled visas to residents of Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh.        
	Even outside the P5, New Delhi has been a favourite destination in 2010  heads of state or government from South Korea, South Africa, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan have visited India.         
	Around the end of last year, the then Prime Ministers of Japan and Australia had come visiting.         
	Possibly with the exception of 1971 and after the Pokhran blasts in 1998, in terms of the sheer number of incoming visits and travel, Indian diplomacy has seldom been this busy, an official said.

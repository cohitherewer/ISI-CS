  - Jharkhand search on for twin-engine, 7-seater craft          AMIT GUPTA                                     
	Ranchi, Oct. 2: With a chief minister in place, the state civil aviation department has set the ball rolling for a chartered plane and helicopter to fly VIPs.         
	Currently, the state does not have any aircraft for VIPs. Efforts are on to hire a plane and a chopper from a charter service provider. This will help us save costs, civil aviation secretary K.K. Khandelwal told The Telegraph.         
	Erstwhile governments in Jharkhand, including those led by Arjun Munda and Madhu Koda, had drawn considerable flak for the misuse of Dhruv  the armoured chopper born in a Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) workshop and purchased by the state home department under police modernisation funds.        
	Now, based on a PIL filed in Jharkhand High Court citing rampant misuse of the chopper by politicians, the Public Accounts Committee is conducting a probe.        
	It was only recently that the home department managed to appoint two pilots for air surveillance in Naxalite strongholds.        
	Civil aviation department sources said the government now wanted to hire a twin-engine plane with 2+5 seating capacity. Similar specifications have also been made for the helicopter.         
	Tenders, published by the department last week, suggest that the selected agency should be able to provide services within 12 hours of booking. The last date to respond is October 7. The technical and financial bids will be opened next afternoon.        
	Sources added the state government might end up paying anything between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.25 lakh per flight hour, besides waiting charges, overnight charges etc.         
	At present, the state hires a plane every time Munda and his deputies  Sudesh Mahto and Hemant Soren  go to Nagpur to meet BJP national president Nitin Gadkari.         
	After Dhruv was returned to the home department, the civil aviation fleet consists only of training aircraft, which include three Zlins and two power gliders that are gathering dust in the state hangar for a couple of years.         
	The Zlin aircraft were purchased for Rs 3 crore from Moravan Aviation based in Czech Republic in 2007. They have been lying unused ever since. The four-seater planes were basically procured for non-VIP communication and training, but the civil aviation department failed to engage agencies, recruit pilots and set up adequate infrastructure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Brinjal blow to regulators
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Brinjal blow to regulators
  - Minister shelves panel nod, buys time        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: The environment and forests ministry today imposed a moratorium on the cultivation of a genetically modified (GM) brinjal, calling for independent safety studies and declaring that there is no urgency to turn the vegetable into Indias first GM food crop.         
	The moratorium, announced by the environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh today, tantamount to the first-ever assertion of no-confidence in the countrys existing regulatory mechanism that had certified the vegetable as being ready for commercial cultivation nearly four months ago.         
	The brinjal, genetically engineered to produce a bacterial toxin and kill worms, was developed by a consortium of scientists at Mahyco, a private Indian biotechnology company and state agriculture universities in Coimbatore and Dharwad.         
	The moratorium will remain in place until independent scientific studies are able to establish a consensus among scientists that the brinjal is safe for human consumption and it poses no threat to the rich genetic diversity of brinjal in India, Ramesh said.         
	There is no need to hurry into this. There is no tearing urgency to introduce this brinjal into India, Ramesh said, after nearly six weeks of consultations with scientists, environmental groups, farmers as well as members of the public.        
	The brinjal has undergone more than two years of field trials and animal toxicity studies. The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) of the ministry of environment had examined crop performance and animal studies data submitted by the developers to certify the brinjal as ready for cultivation in October 2009.        
	But Ramesh said that a number of scientists from India, Australia, France, the UK and the US have sent emails to him, raising very serious doubts about the GM brinjal and about the way the tests have been conducted in India.        
	Over the past year, environmental groups and a small number of scientists, including senior biologist Pushpa Bhargava, have questioned the integrity of the GEAC process. Bhargava had accused the GEAC of ignoring eight essential tests, including chronic animal toxicity studies to assess the impact of the brinjal when consumed over a substantial lifespan of the animals.         
	Statisticians have also punched holes in the biosafety dossier approved by the GEAC. Ramesh said he had also held several consultations with the leading Indian agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan before arriving at his decision.        
	The ministry has said the moratorium on brinjal will have no implications on efforts to develop other GM crops. Dozens of research groups are trying to engineer cauliflower, mustard, rice, soybean, and tomato among other crops in efforts to impart new traits to these plants. Last week, a Delhi team announced a tomato that survives outside the refrigerator for 45 days.         
	Critics have often in the past questioned the reliability of safety tests which were sponsored by the developers of the brinjal, and not conducted in independent laboratories. This raises legitimate concerns about the reliability of tests which I cannot ignore, Ramesh said.         
	Environmental groups and scientists who had criticised the GEAC process have welcomed the moratorium. He (Ramesh) has shown enormous courage, Bhargava said. He has listened to science and to the voice of the people, he told The Telegraph.        
	But biotechnology industry representatives dubbed the moratorium an unfortunate decision that is going to deny farmers a beneficial technology.        
	Emotions have overtaken science, said K.K. Narayanan, chief executive officer of a plant biotechnology company.        
	Environmental scientists question the need for GM brinjal. It is claimed this brinjal will reduce insecticide use -- but some state government data reveals that brinjal plants do not require as much insecticide as claimed, said Kavitha Kuruganti, an activist campaigning for sustainable agriculture.        
	The environment ministry has now asked the GEAC to draw up a fresh protocol for safety studies to generate public confidence in consultation with senior scientists who have called for caution on the GM brinjal.        
	The moratorium will continue for as long as it is needed to generate public trust and confidence, Ramesh said. We need a regulatory system that inspires confidence, he said. He also said the A in the GEAC name will now change to Appraisal. People should not assume that theyre coming for approvals, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Modi faces criminal case
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Modi faces criminal case
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Scindia: Place on disciplinary panel                                  
	Mumbai, July 3: Lalit Kumar Modis troubles have just got worse. If three showcause notices and being suspended wasnt bad enough, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is now set to file criminal and civil cases against him.        
	Till April 25, Modi had been a vice-president of the BCCI and chairman-commissioner of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a multi-million dollar property. Today, there was no one to support him at the special general meeting.        
	Not even the Punjab Cricket Association, headed by dear friend Inderjit Singh Bindra. In fact, Bindra was conspicuous by his absence. That he wouldnt be around was reported in these columns yesterday itself.                                      
	Going by the mood over the past few weeks, its not a surprise that everything got decided unanimously, in around 90 minutes, at the Cricket Centre here.        
	The meeting (a) ratified BCCI secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasans decision to refer Modis unsatisfactory replies to the disciplinary committee; (b) reconstituted the committee and (c) empowered president Shashank Manohar to file criminal and/or civil cases against Modi.        
	A show of hands completed the ratification process. However, with a few affiliates seeming to act without too much enthusiasm, Manohar did ask if anybody held a different view.        
	Nobody from among the 29 units (present) with voting rights said anything. Incidentally, only the universities representative didnt turn up, but that could have been because of the awful weather right through the day.        
	Every single charge against Modi, from kickbacks to rigging team-auctions to arm-twisting the Kochi franchise, among others, got upheld.        
	Item No. 2 was the reconstitution of the committee, following Manohars decision to recuse himself.        
	His place has gone to Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, who heads the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association.        
	Scindias name was proposed by former BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra. This, really, will be the first major exposure on a cricket-stage for the son of the late Madhavrao Scindia, who headed the BCCI from 1990-93.        
	 Mr Scindia got chosen as hes not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the BCCI, but still has the knowledge (of what goes on)... Hes a fit person, Manohar explained.        
	Later, Manohar told The Telegraph: Scindia cant be accused of having a bias, an allegation made against me (by Modi). Indeed, a neutral person has been selected.        
	At one level, by getting a minister on board, Manohar amp; Co. have actually sent another strong message to Modi.        
	Scindias colleagues on the committee are Arun Jaitley, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, and Chirayu Amin, a BCCI vice-president and interim chairman of the IPL.        
	The three-member committee wont have a chairman and its meetings wont be called by Srinivasan. It must complete its work before October 26, which will mark the end of the six-month period from the date the first showcause notice was issued.        
	According to well-placed sources, Amin didnt say a word throughout the meeting, while Jaitley briefly spoke once. In the Amin category were the likes of Srinivasan, all ready to succeed Manohar, next year, and Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	Two members of Parliament, UPs Rajeev Shukla (Congress) and Himachals Anurag Thakur (BJP), J amp;Ks Aslam Goni and Keralas T.R. Balakrishnan were among the most vociferous in calling for firm action against Modi.        
	If anything, the BCCI has brought the Congress and the BJP together.        
	The third and last item on the agenda related to any other action which needed to be taken. The meeting left it to Manohar to escalate matters.        
	It has emerged that no contract was awarded to Ticketgenie, which printed tickets for the semi-finals, the match to determine the third-place finisher and the final in this years IPL.        
	Another scam involving Modi.        
	Nobody knows how many tickets were sold. There are also other instances of work given without contracts, Manohar pointed out.        
	Thats not all.        
	The travel agency awarded the contract by the IPL is managed by Modis mother. All in the family, then.        
	Clearly, with so much against Modi, its a matter of time before he gets expelled.

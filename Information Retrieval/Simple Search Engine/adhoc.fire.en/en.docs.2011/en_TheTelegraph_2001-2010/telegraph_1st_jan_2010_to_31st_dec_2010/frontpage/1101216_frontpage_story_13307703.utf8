The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tamper-proof number plate to roll out from January 1 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tamper-proof number plate to roll out from January 1 
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                            The high security number plate which will make the task of tracking down stolen cars easier                                  
	The state government is set to introduce the high security number plate (HSNP) in Calcutta on January 1, 2011. The scheme will be extended to the rest of the state in phases.        
	The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the introduction of the microchip-fitted number plates that would make tracking down stolen cars easier.        
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu and transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury told Metro on Wednesday that the first of the vehicles with the new number plates will roll out of the Alipore regional transport office and the Beltola public vehicles department office on New Years Day.        
	Metro decodes the HSNP riddle.              
	What is the HSNP? Will it look different from the conventional number plate?        
	Transport department sources said the HSNP would have an aluminium coat, a chromium hologram that cannot be faked and a retro-reflective film with the word India inscribed on it at a 45-degree angle.        
	An embedded microchip will contain all the information encoded in the registration SMART card now in use.        
	The registration number will be laser imprinted on the plate, which will also bear the alphanumeric identification marks of the manufacturer and the testing agency.        
	The plate will be attached to the car with a non-reusable snap lock, which will ensure that it gets damaged if anyone tries to yank it off.        
	A chromium-based number plate in the form of a sticker will be pasted on the windshield. It will also bear the numbers of the engine and the chassis and the name of the registering authority.        
	On the front and rear plates, the letters IND will be written in blue.        
	The HSNP will sport a uniform font across India. The new plates will be more durable than those currently in use.              
	How will it help car owners?        
	The HSNP will make tracking down stolen cars easier because it is tamper-proof. Security cameras installed at various intersections will be able to pick up information from the plates.        
	Police and other security agencies will eventually be equipped with devices that can read the HSNP.              
	Will all vehicles have to sport the new plate from January 1?        
	Initially, public and private vehicles that will be registered on or after January 1 will be given the new number plate. It will be made mandatory for other vehicles in phases.              
	Is there any deadline for the conversion?        
	Minister Kundu said the government was keen to set the ball rolling from January 1 and take stock of the progress a few months later before deciding on a deadline.              
	Has any other state introduced the high security number plate?        
	Transport secretary Chowdhury said the system had been introduced in some states, including Sikkim, Goa and Meghalaya.              
	How will the number plate be introduced in the rest of the state?        
	The road transport authority offices in the districts will provide HSNPs. The government is yet to decide on a date for the introduction of the HSNP in the districts.              
	What is the price range of the new plate?        
	While conventional plates come for Rs 80-250, the HSNP will cost Rs 400 in Bengal. Chowdhury said the Supreme Court had praised the state for quoting the lowest price for the high security number plate. Some states had reported quoted Rs 5,000-6,000.              
	How will an owner be sure that he is not being given a fake HSNP?        
	Only the government is authorised to provide the high security number plate. Chowdhury said the HSNP was extremely difficult to forge and impossible to tamper with because of its design and technology.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Nov. 12: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today said the incarcerated chairman of the anti-talks faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB), Ranjan Daimary, was unwilling to control the criminal actions of his faction.        
	He made this observation after attending a meeting of the Unified Commands strategy group at the BSF camp at Patgaon here today.         
	Its (anti-talks faction of the NDFB) leader Ranjan Daimary is in judicial custody but seems unwilling to control the criminal actions of his faction, the home minister said in a written statement issued after the meeting.         
	At the Unified Command meeting, Chidambaram reviewed the security situation in Assam in view of stepped up attacks by the NDFB, which killed 23 people this week. Chief minister Tarun Gogoi also attended the meeting.         
	The home minister condemned the killings and warned the NDFB that they will be dealt with firmly in accordance with the law.         
	The government has taken a serious view of the cruel and inhuman killing of innocent civilians at several places in Assam. Security forces have been instructed to apprehend the leaders of the anti-talks faction of the NDFB and perpetrators of the crimes and bring them to justice. They deserve exemplary punishment for their crimes, the statement said.         
	Chidambaram discussed ways and means to counter the renewed threat posed by the NDFB with the chief minister and senior officers of Assam police, central paramilitary forces and army.         
	He also conveyed to Gogoi his deep sense of grief on the loss of innocent lives and requested him to provide compensation to the families of the deceased.         
	Chidambaram said, Aspirations of the Bodo people have been met substantially by the creation of the Bodoland Territorial Council. It is a splendid model of self-governance. It has done good work for the development and prosperity of the people living in areas within its jurisdiction, especially the Bodo people. NDFB is a group not satisfied with the creation of BTC. It has put forward demands, some of which fall outside the pale of the Constitution.         
	The only way forward for these groups is talks. The Centre and the state government will hold talks with any group that abjures violence but will not countenance any group that indulges in wanton criminal acts, he added.         
	The NDFB yesterday issued a fresh warning to the government, threatening to carry out more attacks if operations against them were not stopped immediately. On November 1, the NDFB threatened to kill 20 or more people for every Bodo youth or NDFB cadre killed by security forces.         
	The recent killings came hours after security forces gunned down an NDFB militant in a gunbattle on Monday.        
	Chidambaram arrived at the LGBI airport here on a special aircraft at 2.45pm and headed straight for the BSF base camp at Patgaon to chair the Unified Command meeting. He left for Calcutta around 5pm.        
	Around three hours after he left, security forces arrested two suspected militants of the anti-talks NDFB from Ultapani and Taraibari in Kokrajhar district. Some arms and documents were seized from them, adds our Kokrajhar correspondent.

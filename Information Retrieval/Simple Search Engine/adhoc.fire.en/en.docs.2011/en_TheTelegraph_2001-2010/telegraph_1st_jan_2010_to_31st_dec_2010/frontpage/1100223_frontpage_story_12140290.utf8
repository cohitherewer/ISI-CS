          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 22: The state government has betrayed its uneasiness in proceeding against the masked IG, suggesting that the issue could be buried in a red-tape-bound inquiry.        
	Hours after the EFR special inspector-general, Benoy Chakraborty, had cut a sorry figure on television on Saturday by appearing in a black veil to keep his identity from Maoists, an infuriated state government had leaked word that he would be suspended. Some channels had reported that he had already been suspended, though officials had cautioned that such a step involved procedures.        
	Some of the contents of Chakrabortys outburst against the West Midnapore SP  that the camp was ill-located and his formal letter to the state government to find another place was ignored  could not be contested, but the government was left red in the face.        
	However, the governments resolve to assert its authority started dissipating a day after with the families of ERF personnel taking out a procession in support of the IG and the Gorkha Janmukthi Morcha warning against punishing him for telling the truth. The EFR is largely made of personnel from the hills.        
	The initial plan was to suspend the special IG. But later, we had apprehensions as the EFR policemen are fuming after 24 of them were killed by the Maoists, especially since they had to shift to the unsafe primary health centre under pressure from the CPM, a source in the chief ministers secretariat said.        
	 The chief minister was also told about EFR policemen screaming at the gun salute in Salua that Gorkhas were being targeted by the Maoists, and the state government was doing nothing. Any action against the IG would have helped the Morcha to further exploit the situation, the official added.        
	The officer has been issued a letter asking him to explain why he briefed the media without authorisation. Asked what action could be taken, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: Let his reply come.        
	A source said the idea was to let the inquiry drag on till the incident fades from public memory.        
	Chakraborty has sent his reply to the director-general of the armed police, Partha Bhattacharjee.        
	The IG has defended himself and referred to a November 24 letter to the police directorate about the vulnerability of the Shilda camp.

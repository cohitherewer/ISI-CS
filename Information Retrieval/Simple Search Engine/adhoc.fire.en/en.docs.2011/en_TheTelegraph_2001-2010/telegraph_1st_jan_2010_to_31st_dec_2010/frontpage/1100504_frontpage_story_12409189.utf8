  - Ministers attend cabinet meet despite Delhi diktat          OUR BUREAU                                              Chief minister Shibu Soren comes out of Project Building in Ranchi on Monday. Picture by Hardeep Singh		        
	New Delhi/Ranchi, May 3: The four BJP ministers in the Shibu Soren government attended a cabinet meeting in Ranchi today even as party seniors in Delhi insisted that they had been instructed otherwise, indicating a clear lack of communication within the party.         
	A senior leader in Delhi went to the extent of stating that if Soren did not step down as Jharkhand chief minister in the next couple of days, the partys MLAs had been told to meet the governor and withdraw support to his government.         
	However, it was unclear if the BJPs brass meant business or was issuing hollow threats to the JMM. Even as some of them, including Sushma Swaraj, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Gopinath Munde, felt that Soren should not keep them waiting interminably, Rajnath Singh persisted with his view that the government and the JMM alliance must be saved at all cost.         
	Something positive will emerge. There will be light at the end of the tunnel, an optimistic Rajnath told The Telegraph.         
	An indication that the support withdrawal group wanted to have its way came when the BJP ministers were directed to stay out of todays cabinet meeting. A source hoped the boycott would be a wake-up call for the JMM chief and his son, Hemant.         
	However, BJP ministers Neelkanth Singh Munda and Baidyanath Ram said there was no instruction about boycotting the meeting and hence all four of them were present as part of the cabinet.        
	With pressure mounting to take a call, BJP president Nitin Gadkari dashed to New Delhi this afternoon for a couple of hours and met his senior colleagues.                           
	It is a tricky proposition. If we stick to the JMM, our gut feeling is that the government wont last beyond six months. If we part ways, it will be central rule and advantage Congress, a political aide of Gadkari said.         
	The BJP got the feeling that in either scenario, it was a loser and the cardinal mistake it committed was taking Soren too lightly. The partys urban-bred, upper caste/class leaders were convinced that the chief minister was game to share power with them at any cost, even as a junior partner. They were also informed by unnamed sources that Soren  who spearheaded the struggle that preceded Jharkhands creation and never quite lost his credibility with the tribal underclass through his legal and media trials  had lost his grip over the legislature party and Hemant was the new boss.         
	The joke that circulated in the BJP was Sorens memory failed him after sundown and he woke up at dawn without a recollection of what happened the day before. Sorens unexpected appearance in Parliament on the day the cut motions were voted on and his conscious decisions to vote against the NDA shattered the BJPs assessment of the leader. Now after he refused to put in his papers and make way for a BJP-led government, a source admitted they were taken for a ride not once, but twice by the politically savvy Soren.         
	Meanwhile, Soren, the man at the centre of the continuing political crisis, attended office today, signed the transfer orders of six IPS officers and presided over the cabinet meeting.        
	While his appearances today were aimed at sending out the message that he was the one in control, the threat to his government remained.         
	For Hemant, the biggest headache was the BJP diktat to present letters of support from all 18 JMM legislators before the BJP parliamentary board met to decide on withdrawing support.         
	Sources said Hemant could fall short of three signatures  Simon Marandi, Teklal Mahto and Champai Soren. It is also an opportunity for Hemant to demonstrate his leadership and enlist the support of at least 15 MLAs and move to disqualify the defiant three under the anti-defection law. With the Speaker being from the BJP, the task should not be difficult, said a JMM MLA.        
	 The JMM MLAs may also fall in line as the Opposition, particularly JVM chief Babulal Marandi, was not keen to split the JMM. The disgruntled JMM MLAs were ready to split the party but Marandi clearly told them that he cant guarantee saving their membership under the anti-defection law. So, the dissident MLAs may not precipitate the issue too far, a source close to the former chief minister said.

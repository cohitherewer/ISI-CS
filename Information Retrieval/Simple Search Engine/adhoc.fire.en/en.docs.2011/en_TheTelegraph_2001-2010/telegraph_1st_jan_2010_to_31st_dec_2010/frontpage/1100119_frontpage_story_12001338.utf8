          RICHARD ALLEYNE                            Newton: Eureka moment                                  
	London, Jan. 18: A fragile manuscript telling the original story of how Sir Isaac Newton was inspired by a falling apple has been made public for the first time.        
	 The handwritten account of Newtons eureka moment, which led to his famous theory of gravity, was recorded for posterity by the scientists friend and colleague William Stukeley in a 1752 biography.        
	It is thought to be the first account of one of sciences most famous anecdotes and the one that brought it to the general publics attention.        
	Until now the manuscript has remained hidden away in the Royal Societys archives. But from today, anyone with Internet access will be able to look at it. It is one of a number of archive documents being published online by the society to mark its 350th anniversary.         
	Lord Rees, president of the Royal Society  and Newtons modern-day successor  said: Stukeleys biography is a precious artefact for historians of science and I am delighted that it is being made available today along with other treasures from the archives, in a format that allows anybody to view them as if they were holding the manuscript in front of them. Keith Moore, head archivist at the Royal Society, said: This is the account that put the famous anecdote on the map.        
	Stukeley, an early antiquarian famous for his studies of Stonehenge, heard how Newtons thoughts turned to gravity as the two men sat in the shade of some apple trees in the scientists garden in the 1720s.        
	The extract, from Stukeleys Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newtons Life, reads: After dinner, the weather being warm, we went into the garden and drank thea (sic), under the shade of some apple trees  he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind.        
	It was occasiond by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself          
	Stukeley also gathered material about Newtons younger days from residents of Grantham, Lincolnshire, where he went to school. One story tells of the young Newton building a working scale model of a windmill, based on his observations of a full size version.

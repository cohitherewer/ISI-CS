  - Ajsu okay with delay tactics, but BJP caught in a bind over states dithering on anti-Maoist offensive        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Under attack from the Opposition for going soft on the Naxalites, chief minister Shibu Soren began the day by showing off his skills with the bow and arrow at the 55th National Schools Archery Championship in Ranchi on Sunday.

	Ranchi, Feb. 21: Shibu Sorens studied silence on attending a meeting in Delhi on launching Operation Green Hunt is yet another ploy by the chief minister and his government to delay the offensive against Maoists, whose support the JMM leader banked on during the Assembly elections.        
	Sorens aides have said the chief minister was yet to decide on his response to the Union home ministers letter inviting him and his Bihar counterpart to New Delhi for a discussion with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on what will be a joint, interstate operation against the rebels with well-entrenched strongholds across the three states.        
	Sorens deputy Sudesh Mahto, whose Ajsu along with the BJP are partners in government, has often indicated the governments desire to go slow on launching the operation.         
	It will take some more time for the joint operation to be launched. We have to deploy adequate manpower and ensure other related infrastructure is in place before the inter-state offensive is launched, he said.        
	The BJP, too, has been left scurrying for cover. Deputy chief minister Raghubar Das refused to articulate his views on the question of the offensive. Let me first talk to the chief minister tomorrow, he told The Telegraph, clearly uncomfortable at being forced to toe Sorens soft line thats at a variance with his own party line.         
	Soren has never spoken out in favour of a joint offensive. In fact, he has often dismissed the seriousness of the Maoist problem. Yeh kuch logon ke dimag ka fitur hai (This is the delusion of some people), he said yesterday after chairing a meeting of senior police officials.         
	Sensing that the state government was under pressure from the Centre to come clean on its stand on fighting Maoists, the Opposition Congress and the JVM today met Governor M..H Farooq to complain against the Soren governments inaction on the question of security and corruption.         
	Accompanied by senior leaders, both state Congress chief Pradeep Balmuchu and JVM chief Babulal Marandi stopped short of seeking the governments dismissal, but gave enough indications that the Opposition would mount a serious campaign against the Soren government.        
	Home secretary J.B. Tubid and DGP Neyaz Ahmad have reiterated they are vigorously pursuing the states anti-Naxalite operations, but Sorens soft posturing on the issue embarrassed his government no end when it had to agree to all the demands of the Maoists to secure the release of Dalbhumgarh BDO Prashant Nayek.        
	Significantly, the state has agreed to reopen cases against 14 undertrials  two of them were released on bail yesterday  lodged in Ghatshila sub-divisional jail. Yesterday, he even criticised the police for their poor intelligence network and the propensity to arrest villagers in the name of Maoists on trumped up charges.        
	Police officers have privately admitted it was time to launch the operation. They pointed out the recent near simultaneous acts of Maoist terror in Jharkhand (abduction of BDO), Bihar (killing of villagers in Jamui district) and Bengal (attack on a police camp in Shilda) should have prompted the three state governments to come together.         
	It is the Maoists ploy to keep state governments preoccupied with such local problems, said a senior IPS officer.        
	If the Assembly elections in Bihar was holding back the Nitish government in launching the operation, it was pay back time for Soren who received tactical support from Maoists in the December Assembly polls.        
	The Congress believed that Maoists, who have gained ground in rural areas, ensured support to those who opposed Operation Green Hunt. There was good turnout in rural areas and the JMM, known for being opposed to the operation, became the obvious gainer, said Congress spokesman Radha Krishna Kishore who lost from Chhatarpur, a Naxalite den.        
	The JMM won 18 seats in all, ending as runners-up in eight constituencies  Gandey, Khunti, Gumla, Majhgaon, Manoharpur, Nala, Poraiyahat and Simaria.        
	The Congress leader maintained that Soren would not agree to launch the operation till he contested his byelection, likely from Jama in Santhal Pargana. More importantly, Jharkhand is scheduled to hold panchayat polls, in which the Maoists will play a decisive role.

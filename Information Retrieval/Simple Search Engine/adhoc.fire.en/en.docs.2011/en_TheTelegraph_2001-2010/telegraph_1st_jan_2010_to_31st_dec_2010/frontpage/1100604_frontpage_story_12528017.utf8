          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Newly elected councillors present Mamata, who also writes poems and paints, with flowers and a pen at her Kalighat home on Thursday. Picture by Amit Datta.                          
	 She doesnt want to inconvenience people during thanks-giving rallies.         
	 She doesnt want Presidents rule in Bengal.        
	 She doesnt want to demean other political parties.        
	 She doesnt want to rely only on political acumen in running civic boards.         
	Meet Mamata Banerjee, a day after the victory.        
	The Trinamul leader today told her supporters not to inconvenience people during thanks-giving rallies the party workers will bring out in each ward in Calcutta on Saturday.         
	Our councillors will bring out processions in their respective wards on Saturday for only two hours, between 5pm and 7pm. They will walk along one side of the roads and keep the other side free to ensure that commuters are not inconvenienced, Mamata said.        
	Calcuttans have often found themselves at the receiving end of Trinamuls brand of Opposition politics  patented by the Left in the 1950s and the 1960s  that choked thoroughfares or inflicted strikes without rhyme or reason.         
	Now that the seat of power in Bengal is within striking distance, yesterdays disrupter has chosen to project the face of tomorrows builder.         
	The menacing aggression of an Opposition leader was missing as Mamata patiently took questions and gave grin-laced replies during a news conference at her Harish Chatterjee Street home.         
	We would have held these rallies on Sunday. But we will be deciding on our leaders for the Calcutta and Salt Lake civic bodies on Sunday. Thats why we will be holding these rallies on Saturday. It being a half-day, people will not be inconvenienced, she reasoned.         
	Such promises of not inconveniencing people during political rallies are not new in Bengal. After a 2003 high court order banning rallies on weekdays, the state government had said that police would allow parties to hold rallies only if they kept a portion of the road free for traffic movement.         
	In the absence of any political consensus, the promise remained only on paper and traffic-stopper rallies and meetings continue to choke traffic movement. During the Singur agitation in 2008, Mamata chose the Metro Channel in the heart of the city as the venue for her hunger strike.         
	But successive electoral victories since then have prompted Mamata to change her style. The Trinamul leader had declared before the Lok Sabha polls that she would not call bandhs at the drop of a hat  a promise she has kept.         
	It makes political sense for Mamata to press ahead with an image makeover before the Assembly polls. Her role has changed from that of an Opposition leader to the chief minister-in-waiting, said a senior Trinamul leader.         
	The role change was manifest in another demand. Instead of asking for imposition of Article 356 to dismiss the government, I shall request the Election Commission and the Centre to hold early Assembly polls in Bengal, Mamata said.         
	Although she criticised the CPM-led government for inaction, the tone was much mellower.         
	Leaving behind the pre-poll acrimony with the Congress, Mamata said she was not averse to joining hands with the Congress to form municipal boards.         
	All parties fought the election with their own symbol and own identity. I have respect for every political party. But this mandate is for Trinamul, she added with a smile.         
	Her words were wrapped in humility. People are giving me the credit for this victory. But thats not true. This victory was possible because of the people.         
	She made it clear that political acumen would not be enough in delivering proper civic amenities to the people. Mamata said expert committees  drawn from different sections of the society  would be formed to run the civic boards in Calcutta and Salt Lake, replicating her railway model.         
	Wise suggestions and advice from apolitical persons are necessary to effectively run the civic boards. Political persons also need guidance. As a railway minister, I also have two expert committees on railway infrastructure and dedicated freight corridors and the members advise me, she said.        
	But those who miss the Old Trinamul need not worry. Nearly 500 Trinamul workers today blocked five gates of Kolaghat thermal power station in East Midnapore for seven hours and put locks on them demanding that a member of each land losers family be provided a job.         
	The blockade was withdrawn around 1pm following instructions from Mamata.

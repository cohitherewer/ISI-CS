          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: India today condemned as racial and unacceptable a New Zealand television anchors comments making fun of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshits name.         
	The ministry of external affairs summoned the countrys high commissioner, Rupert Holborow, in the morning and issued him a strong demarche. The envoy met foreign minister S.M. Krishna and apologised profusely.         
	Anchor Paul Henry, who hosts the Breakfast show on TVNZ, had ridiculed Dikshit in an episode telecast earlier this week. He deliberately pronounced her name wrong after being specifically told how to say it, according to reports in Australian and New Zealand newspapers.         
	The dip s woman, Henry said. God, whats her name? D S. Its so appropriate, because shes Indian, so shed be d in s wouldnt she, do you know what I mean? Its just so funny.         
	TVNZ is a New Zealand government-owned national broadcaster.         
	India today said it found Henrys remarks unacceptable. Following the telecast of racial and unacceptable remarks against the Honble chief minister of Delhi on a New Zealand news channel, the high commissioner of New Zealand was called in to the ministry of external affairs and a strong demarche was issued to him on this matter, a foreign ministry statement said.         
	It was conveyed to him that the government strongly and unequivocally denounces the racist remarks of the journalist in question. These remarks are totally unacceptable to India. It is hoped that the government of New Zealand would take immediate demonstrative action against the said individual to send out a clear signal that such behaviour is totally unacceptable.        
	The Indian high commissioner in New Zealand has also taken up the matter with the government there.        
	Later, Holborow issued a statement conveying his deep regret for the hurt these comments have caused.         
	These remarks were culturally insensitive, inappropriate and vulgar. They reflect the views of only one media commentator (who has already been censured for other racist and unacceptable comments), and certainly not the New Zealand government or people, he said.         
	I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the vital contribution the chief minister has made to the Commonwealth Games, Holborow said.         
	Dikshit initially said she was too busy to notice Henrys comments about her. Later, she told a television channel that while it doesnt make much of a difference to me, the remark was unacceptable as it insulted Indians.

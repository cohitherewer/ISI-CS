          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Calcutta, July 1: A Left Front legislators declaration that people hate police coaxed an unusual response from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today: the chief minister announced in the Assembly the removal of a superintendent of police over political clashes.        
	Bhattacharjee said Birbhum SP Rabindranath Mukherjee was being removed for his inability to firmly deal with the situation in Nanoor where former CPM MLA Ananda Das was killed on Tuesday. The CPM is blaming the Trinamul Congress for the murder.        
	Police officers had been shifted earlier, too, but rarely had such transfers been announced on the floor of the Assembly and for failure to tackle political clashes.        
	The chief ministers announcement came after RSP MLA Tapan Hore, whose constituency Bolpur covers Nanoor, said in the Assembly that people had started hating the police for inaction that led to Dass murder.         
	Police reached the spot two hours after Das was brutally killed. People are hating the police for its inaction. When we visited Dass house yesterday, we could not take them (the police) along with us because of peoples anger against them. What steps are you taking to tone up the district police administration? Hore asked the chief minister as other Left members looked on.         
	The chief minister, who had made a statement on the Nanoor violence a few minutes ago but did not make any mention of the police officer, then said: The present SP of Birbhum is unable to firmly deal with the situation. This is why I am removing him and sending someone who can effectively handle it.        
	Later in the day, Humayun Kabir, the additional superintendent of police (headquarters) of Burdwan, was assigned the task of policing Birbhum. Mukherjee, described by colleagues as a soft-spoken and polite officer who writes poetry and acts in plays, has been shifted to railway police, Howrah.        
	The action of the chief minister, who is also the police minister, in itself is not surprising. He has been under pressure to act from the CPM which has been complaining that the police, smelling the possibility of a change of guard after successive election setbacks to the party, have turned against its supporters.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose later said the Nanoor murder could have been avoided had the police intervened at the appropriate time. Trinamul men are creating anarchy. The administration has to come forward and do the needful. But there are places where the administration and the police are not doing their bit, Bose said.        
	But the platform and the manner in which the chief minister made the announcement  many thought the transfer was a spur-of-the-moment decision  surprised veterans.         
	Senior legislators said they could not recollect a chief minister making an announcement on the removal of a district police chief in the House. I have been a member of the House since 1969 but I cannot recollect an event in which the chief minister had announced such a removal, said octogenarian Congress MLA from Kharagpur Gyan Singh Sohan Pal.        
	Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said: In the recent past, I have not heard about the chief minister announcing the removal of a police chief on the floor of the House.

  - Ex-minister faces flak in medicine scam          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                         Kumar, Shahi                                        
	Ranchi, Dec. 21: The CBI is eagerly awaiting prosecution sanction to file chargesheets against seven people, including former health minister Bhanu Pratap Shahi and former health secretary Pradeep Kumar, in two cases involving Rs 170 crore.        
	The agency had lodged an FIR on July 28, 2009, over bungling of funds in the purchase of medicines worth Rs 130 crore. On October 31, 2009, the agency lodged another FIR against Kumar and two others  former state RCH officer V.S.N. Singh and senior accounts officer Pradyut Mukherjee  for misappropriation of funds meant for buying 79 mobile health vans.        
	According to sources, the CBI has now completed investigations and found the former minister and officials guilty of cheating, misuse of official position, conspiracy and causing huge losses to the state exchequer. Kumar was suspended after the agency lodged the FIR.        
	On November 4 this year, the CBI sent a request to the state government, the central department of personnel and the principal accountant general, seeking sanction to prosecute and file chargesheets against Kumar, Singh and Mukherjee.        
	It sought sanction in the medicine scam case on December 7 against former minister Shahi, Kumar, V.S.N. Singh, state drug controller M.M. Prasad and Mukherjee. Former health secretary S.P. Sinha is also an accused in the case, but no sanction is required to prosecute him as he has retired from service.        
	According to sources, the CBI found that 79 mobile health vans were purchased during the tenure of Kumar as health secretary in three phases  seven, 40 and 32  between November 2008 and August 2009. These vans were purchased from Jamshedpur-based Bebco (Bharat Engineers and Body Building).        
	The CBI found that the company was paid Rs 58 lakh for each van, though the highest price other states paid to buy similar vans under National Rural Health Mission was Rs 25 lakh. Of the Rs 58 lakh paid, Rs 10 lakh was for the body, Rs 37 lakh for medical equipment and Rs 5.44 lakh for chassis, besides 12 per cent value added tax. The chassis had been procured from Tata Motors.        
	The CBI found that there was no budgetary provision for the vans as the state had not received National Rural Health Mission funds for the purpose then and that money was diverted from several welfare projects.                                
	The CBI also found irregularities in selecting the company that supplied the vans. The cheque submitted by the supplier as earnest money was found to be ante-dated, sources added.         
	The central agency also questioned the speed at which the files were processed, as there was no need to buy the vehicles in a hurry, bypassing set procedures.        
	Sources said it was found that the then health minister procured Microgin disinfectant worth Rs 14.74 crore, apparently in a bid to help a relative.         
	Again, fogging machine worth Rs 5.15 crore was bought for Rs 1.17 lakh each, though it is available in the open market for Rs 20-25,000. Moreover, several districts were supplied excess medicines, resulting in dumping and wastage.         
	A senior CBI official requesting anonymity said the agency will pursue the matter, and request the state government to grant sanction in order to take the cases to their logical conclusion        
	An official in the state personnel department, in the meantime, said the government has sought legal opinion over the CBI request.

  - Assam seeks security to curb cheating        DAULAT RAHMAN                                          
	Guwahati, Feb. 8: The Board of Secondary Education, Assam (SEBA), has asked Dispur to provide adequate security personnel to prevent cheating in the High School Leaving Certificate (HSLC) examination.         
	Nearly four lakh students will appear for the examination starting on February 19.         
	SEBA secretary D. Mahanta said the board has already declared 100 examination centres as sensitive, considering the rampant practice of cheating adopted by the examinees.        
	The board has found that even some teachers or examiners facilitate students in cheating. There are reasons to fear that some local criminals will help select students, leading to the disruption of law and order. The SEBA has written to all the deputy commissioners to arrange adequate security in and around the examination centres, Mahanta said.        
	He said cheating in examinations like the HSLC seems to be big business and many examinees hire persons to provide the correct answers during the examination.        
	Even though SEBA has barred a few centres, including the latest one at Kukukata in Goalpara district, it is not possible in all cases. In many districts, particularly in remote areas, friends, relatives and others surround the examination centres to help the examinees cheat and hence SEBA needs police or security personnel to stop such practices. The board has also decided to send more officials to the sensitive centres to catch examinees and others involved in cheating, Mahanta said.         
	Great jubilation is seen at houses across the state in case of success in the HSLC examination. There are parents who consider themselves fortunate if their sons and daughters come out with flying colours in the matriculation examination. This tempts many examinees to resort to unfair practices to pass the examination. The SEBA has also requested the district administrations to send magistrate-level officials to the examination centres to take spot decisions in case of any untoward incident. The local police stations have also been asked to help the board in smooth conduct of the examination, he said.         
	The SEBA has also banned mobile phones at examination centres. In the admit cards, the board has strictly asked examinees not to bring cellphones. If any examinee violates the rule, the board will take strict action, including expulsion, he said.         
	The SEBA has also taken measures to reduce students stress.         
	We have decided to allow the candidates 10 minutes before the start of an examination to read the question paper thoroughly. Examiners have been instructed to address any problem of candidates related to examination stress sensitively and sensibly, Mahanta said.

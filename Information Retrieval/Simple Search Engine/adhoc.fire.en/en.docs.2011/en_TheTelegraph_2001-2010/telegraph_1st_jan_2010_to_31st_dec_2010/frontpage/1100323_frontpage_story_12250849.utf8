  State accepts fiscal regimen           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Calcutta, March 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has tied Bengal to a tight financial diet for the next five years that Mamata Banerjee would inherit if she won the Assembly polls next year.        
	In the budget presented today, finance minister Asim Dasgupta committed the state to enacting a fiscal responsibility act next year after resisting it for several years, succumbing to the pressure of cleaning up its loan-laden books.        
	If a state agrees to follow targeted financial discipline, the Centre offers in return loan relief that lowers the interest burden. In Bengals case, in the revised estimates for 2008-09, interest payments form 97 per cent of the revenue deficit  the gap between revenue expenditure, which doesnt create capital assets, and revenue receipts, or tax and non-tax revenue.        
	Bengals decision to follow fiscal discipline translates into a benefit of Rs 1,400 crore in 2010-11 alone when the phased reduction of deficits will start. This benefit will keep on increasing in the following years, the finance minister said.        
	In exchange for fiscal tightening, the state receives debt waiver, loan restructuring and interest relief. If a commitment to fiscal responsibility is not in place, state-specific interest-free grants from the Centre become interest-bearing loans.        
	Once a state enacts what is known as an FRBM (fiscal responsibility and budget management) Act, it gets interest relief in proportion to the amount by which it reduces its revenue deficit every year.        
	Dasgupta promised to cut the revenue deficit to zero in 2014-15 from 5.6 per cent in 2009-10. Simultaneously, the fiscal deficit has to be shrunk to 3 per cent by then from 6.7 per cent in the current year. The fiscal deficit is the borrowing the government does to meet the gap between income and expenditure.        
	The Left Front governments commitment to cutting the deficits sharply in five years raises a tantalising political prospect. Given that the Assembly elections are due in just over a year and the possibility that the CPM-led combine faces a serious threat of defeat, it might fall to Mamata to fulfil the commitment Bhattacharjee is making today.        
	Its not as if an agreement to achieve deficit-reduction targets is sacrosanct. The Union government itself has shown scant respect for its own similar commitments. Mamata, not known as a fiscal fundamentalist, could well cite that as an escape hatch. Better still, she could ignore it completely as a Left conspiracy.        
	The Front, on the contrary, if it returns to power, would be expected to keep its promise.        
	Bengal and Sikkim were the only states to have so far refused to commit to deficit reduction. Their argument, as expressed by Dasgupta, was that it would shrink the governments welfare-enhancing role.        
	The minister cited as reason for the change of mind the buoyancy in state revenue after the introduction of an improved VAT (value-added tax) system and another expected boost in 2011-12 when GST, or goods and services tax, is scheduled for debut.        
	He explained later that the state had resisted for the past six years also because borrowings from the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF), 75 per cent of all central loans to Bengal, were denied the benefit of loan waiver.        
	The 13th Finance Commission has recommended the inclusion of borrowings from NSSF under the debt relief scheme, he said.        
	NSSF loans will carry 8 per cent interest instead of 9.5 per cent, as recommended by the commission, now that Bengal has agreed to fiscal responsibility.

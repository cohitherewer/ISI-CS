The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | No guilt, not scared: Lalit
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                No guilt, not scared: Lalit
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Mumbai, April 25: For someone painted as the countrys No. 1 villain, Lalit Kumar Modi was astonishingly calm as he prepared to leave the Four Seasons Hotel for Navi Mumbai, around 4.45pm.        
	I have nothing to hide. If that was so, then I wouldve been hiding under the table, instead of being so visible and talking to you in this lobby. Indeed, I have no reason to be scared, Modi told The Telegraph, adjusting the knot of a designer tie.        
	Within earshot was the IPL chairmans family, ready to accompany him to the final of the tournaments third edition.         
	The TV channels and newspapers have only been running unsubstantiated stories. Let me tell you that my conscience is absolutely clear. Theres no guilt within. This isnt the first time that Im having to fight it out, Modi added, as a posse of securitymen (private and assigned by the state government) guided him and his family to a row of gleaming BMWs.        
	Asked why hed done a U-turn on calling the IPLs governing council meeting on Monday as first desired by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Shashank Manohar, Modi replied: As the chairman, I have the right to call a meeting at any time and Ive called an extraordinary meeting tomorrow. Thats it.        
	With former BCCI president and mentor of sorts Inderjit Singh Bindra joining him, Modi continued: In fact, Ive put out the agenda, something Im entitled to do as the IPL chairman and commissioner. So much is being (unfairly) said and written.        
	Reminded that the BCCI secretary, Narayanswamy Srinivasan, had already called the meeting, Modi grinned and said: The governing council meetings are called by me, not anybody else.        
	Who would be in the chair?        
	Modi appeared amused at such a question being thrown at him. Obviously, it will be the chairman. The BCCI president is an ex-officio member of the governing council. Being the chairman, Ill be in the chair.        
	By then, the securitymen indicated it was time to start moving and, in a flash, the convoy was out of the much-in-the-news property.

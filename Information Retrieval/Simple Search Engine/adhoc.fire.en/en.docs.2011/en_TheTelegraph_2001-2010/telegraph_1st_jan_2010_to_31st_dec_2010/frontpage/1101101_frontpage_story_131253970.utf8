	New Delhi, Nov 1 (PTI) Home Minister P Chidambaram today said Delhi Police not filing a case against noted writer Arundhati Roy for her alleged seditious speech recently was in accordance with the letter and spirit of law.
    "Not taking action is also an action," he shot back when a journalist asked him why the government was not acting against her for her "Azaadi" (independence) remarks made at a convention on Kashmir here recently.
    "Section 124(A) of the IPC (related to sedition) is for deterrence and punishment. The spirit of the law and true interpretation of law is that unless there is direct incitement to violence, the state must show tolerance and forbearance.
    "Delhi Police is acting in accordance with the letter and spirit of the law," he said.

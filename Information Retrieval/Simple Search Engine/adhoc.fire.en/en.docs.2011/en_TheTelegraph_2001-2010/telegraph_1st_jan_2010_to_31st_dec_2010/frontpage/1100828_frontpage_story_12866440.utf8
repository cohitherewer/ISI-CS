	Calcutta, Aug. 27: The CPM has called a 12-hour bandh on Saturday in large parts of south Calcutta covering Jadavpur, Santoshpur, Baghajatin, East Putiary, Haltu and Kasba following clashes with Trinamul supporters over elections to two CMC boroughs.         
	As the lament over another ruined day swelled, the CPM, however, tried to scale down its protest. The EM Bypass and all roads leading to it will be spared, South 24-Parganas party chief Sujan Chakraborty announced.The bandh will not be enforced on any individual, he added.        
	Around 50 people were injured as supporters of the two parties stoned each other.

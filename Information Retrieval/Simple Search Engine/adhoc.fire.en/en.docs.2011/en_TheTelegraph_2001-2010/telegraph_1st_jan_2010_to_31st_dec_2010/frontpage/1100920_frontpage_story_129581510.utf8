	New Delhi, Sept 20 (PTI): In the wake of the firing incident near Jama Masjid here and concerns expressed by some countries about safety of their nationals, Tourism Minsiter Kumari Selja today asked the visitors not to panic and said their security was the utmost concern of the government.
    India is a safe destination and safety and security of tourists is the utmost concern of the Government, Selja said appealing to the tourists not to panic by stray incidents.
    After the firing incident yesterday in which two Taiwanese nationals were injured, Australia has issued a travel advisory to its citizens and said there is now a "high risk of a terrorist attack" in New Delhi, as the Indian capital prepares for the Commonwealth Games.
    Strongly condemning the incident, Selja said, "This attack on tourists shows desperation of those elements who want to create panic in the society by attacking innocent people.

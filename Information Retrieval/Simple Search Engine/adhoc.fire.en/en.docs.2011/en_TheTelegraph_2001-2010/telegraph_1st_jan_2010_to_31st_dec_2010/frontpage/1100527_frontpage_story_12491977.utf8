	Ranchi, May 26: JMM leader Hemant Soren today summoned a chopper that was being used by the chief secretary to embark on a whirlwind tour of the state to garner signatures of his MLAs, but his desperate attempt to save his government fell through as the EC-155 developed a technical snag.        
	The 12-seater chopper, which has been hired from Delhi-based charter service provider Global Vectra by the state civil aviation department for official use, had to come back to Ranchi this morning from Garhwa, leaving behind A.K. Singh and a host of senior government officials on a tour of the Maoist-infested Palamau commissionary to monitor the implementation of various central welfare schemes.        
	According to sources in the department, the chopper was called back after the chief ministers office wanted it to be booked in the name of welfare minister Haji Hussain Ansari.         
	Accordingly, Ansari was to accompany Hemant, an MLA, to fly to Jamshedpur and Dumka, before returning to the state capital. Party sources admitted they were trying to mobilise support of JMM MLAs in favour of the Congress whose state unit seems keen on having a shot at power provided of course the JMM backed their choice of chief minister.        
	Sources based at the Birsa Munda Airport said efforts were on to rectify the snag as both Hemant and Ansari were expected to use the chopper tomorrow morning.         
	But the touring officials were aghast. The chopper was to be used by us during our return journey to Ranchi tomorrow morning, said a senior IAS officer accompanying the chief secretary.         
	But unfortunately, we will not be able to avail of its services now. This is a matter of concern since a chopper that was being used by the chief secretary was asked to return by the custodians of a minority government, which is on the verge of collapse, he added.                                                        
	Among those who were accompanying Singh and were now stuck at Garhwa were MGNREGS commissioner Sunil Kumar Burnwal, principal chief conservator of forests A.K. Singh, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan mission director Nitin Madan Kulkarni and NRHM director Aradhana Patnaik.        
	They have no option but to take the road back to Ranchi, 250km away.        
	State civil aviation secretary P.K. Jojoria couldnt comment as he was away in New Delhi to attend an international seminar. Let me come back to Ranchi tomorrow and I will try to find out whether norms have been violated or not, he told The Telegraph.        
	According to sources in the civil aviation department, the state government pays Global Vectra Rs 50,000 daily as detention charges and over Rs 40,000 as the per hour flying charge for using the chopper.

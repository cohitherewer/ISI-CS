  - Govt fields Sibal; PM and Sonia flash graft alert
          SANJAY K. JHA                       Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi at a conference organised by the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The UPA establishment today snapped out of stupor following the Supreme Courts adverse observations on the Prime Minister and an Opposition onslaught.         
	It fielded an articulate minister to ring-fence Manmohan Singh, beefed up a legal team, renewed vows to fight greed and graft and fired a mining salvo across the BJPs southern bows.        
	It was as if, knocked in the ring, the Sonia-Manmohan tandem had finally donned the gloves and decided to deliver a counter-punch.        
	The flurry of action, the delay over which lent a besieged and beleaguered air to the government, started with Kapil Sibal, temporarily handed charge of the controversy-ridden telecom brief, being deployed to execute a media offensive that saw him in a lone defence act on one television channel after another.        
	Sibal, the first and only lawyer to argue an impeachment case in Parliament, asserted that Manmohan Singh had done nothing to attract the unflattering comments heard over the past couple of days, nor would he sanction or shield any wrongdoing under his watch.        
	This is the first time that the UPA leadership has foregrounded the premium on Manmohans personal image as a man of unquestioned integrity during the current crisis. Nobody questions that the Prime Minister has the interest of the nation at heart, or that he would not allow anyone to indulge in corrupt practices, Sibal said.        
	Prior to Sibals command performance, the widespread sense in Delhis political circles was that neither the Congress nor the government was doing enough to meet the finger being pointed directly at the Prime Minister.         
	The government also geared up to respond to the apex court with greater command and conviction, replacing solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam with attorney- general Goolam Vahanvati as its chief brief-carrier before the nations top judges.        
	The government is expected to file a combative affidavit in the Supreme Court on behalf of the Prime Minister.         
	A few hours earlier, Rahul Gandhi spoke up for Manmohan in what seemed a calibrated bid to get on the front foot. The Prime Minister was in no embarrassment as a result of the Supreme Courts observations, Rahul said, and strongly allayed speculation that he was contemplating resignation.        
	Around the same time, Manmohan and Sonia were making the most of the opportunity of Indira Gandhis birth anniversary to send a message within and without that economic growth cannot be used as an excuse to indulge in corruption.        
	Pointing out that there was a tide of rising expectations accompanying high economic growth, Manmohan said: We confront the challenge of revitalising institutions of development administration and getting rid of the cancer of corruption in our public life.        
	Sonia spoke of her partys intolerance to corruption and said rising expectations among people put a greater responsibility on her party and the government. Our economy may increasingly be dynamic, but our moral universe seems to be shrinking. Prosperity has increased, but so has social conflict. Intolerance of various kinds is growing. Graft and greed are on the rise, she told a select gathering at Teen Murti House, now a memorial to Jawaharlal Nehru.        
	The UPAs political response was complemented in the evening with administrative muscle-flexing. The Centre constituted a commission of inquiry to look into illegal mining, considered the BJPs Achilles heel in Karnataka where the partys Reddy brothers  better known as the Bellary brothers  are facing a slew of allegations.        
	The Centres mind on the Subramanian Swamy case, which prompted the Supreme Court to make adverse observations on the Prime Minister and gifted the Opposition a chance to cast a shadow on Manmohans integrity, was revealed in Sibals acerbic observation: It belittles our nation that such a person who is interested in only political one-upmanship succeeds in destabilising the system.        
	Sibal said: Subramanian Swamy knew that law requires that he file a complaint of wrongdoing before a magistrate or before the police and that a probe by either substantiates his complaint before any prosecution could be ordered... he never did this. Is the Prime Minister going to have to start responding to every piece of unsubstantiated paper sent to him? That too by people who clearly have a political agenda? This is a clear move to destabilise the government.        
	Suddenly reactivated after days of being close to atrophied, the Congress is now beginning to respond frontally, both at the political and government levels. What had rattled the leadership was the government began to look beset by corruption despite having acted against ministers and a chief minister who got embroiled in controversies.         
	If Sibal today challenged any party to show a track record that was better than the Congress on the question of corruption, Sonia advocated greater probity, more transparency and consciousness of the gap between promise and delivery.        
	Sonia, who was criticised for not speaking a word on corruption at the AICC meeting a few days ago, has now sent out a clear warning to corrupt ministers.         
	Congress leaders said this was her way of telling critics that neither she nor the Prime Minister was ready to tolerate ministerial impropriety as was being suggested by political rivals or the apex court.        
	Sources said she was anguished by the nature of public discourse even as she took a political risk by forcing Raja out and sending a clean, not powerful, politician as Maharashtra chief minister.         
	The decision to draft Sibal for a forceful rebuttal of the charges was part of the crisis management now being looked after at the highest level. Sibal briefed the print media and hopped from one television channel to another in an extraordinary gesture by a cabinet minister.        
	Sibal had to be drafted as the governments point of view had not been effectively put across and the law officers had failed to confront what many ministers describe as unwarranted barbs of the Supreme Court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CBI ready to receive Kalmadi 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CBI ready to receive Kalmadi 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Kalmadi                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The CBI is waiting for Commonwealth Games chief organiser Suresh Kalmadis return to India to question him and possibly even arrest him on corruption charges, sources said.        
	Three former Kalmadi associates who are in CBI custody  T.S. Darbari, Sanjay Mohindroo and M. Jeyachandran  have told investigators he approved business dealings with AM Films and AM Car and Vans during the Queens Baton Relay in London in October 2009, the sources said.        
	The CBI has registered two FIRs on alleged corruption in the hiring of the firms by the Games organising committee. Darbari and Mohindroo have also told investigators two e-mails from the Indian High Commission in London were forged with Kalmadis knowledge, sources said.        
	They might be saying this to save themselves. But we need to interrogate Kalmadi and even carry out a joint interrogation where we make all four men confront each other, a CBI source said. Kalmadi is reported to be in Macau.         
	In court yesterday, when the trio were sent to three-day custody, Darbari asked the CBI to go after the big fish and not small people like him. His family kept asking Darbari to divulge all and not protect anybody. That the ruling Congress has refused to defend Kalmadi, a party MP, has also encouraged the CBI.        
	But even as the CBI appears to close in on Kalmadi, the BJPs attack on the government over alleged corruption in the Games has been blunted by the presence of its leader V.K. Malhotra on the organising committees executive board.        
	Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit today said Malhotras role was suspicious. She told the Assembly Malhotra was closely associated with the organising committee and was an integral part of all decisions taken by the committee.        
	Dikshit asked why he (Malhotra) remained silent when irregularities were being committed. He not only remained silent but also closed his eyes to allow irregularities to be committed in one way or other.        
	The Centre is in no mood to spare anybody whosoever he may be, the chief minister said, in what sources said was a reference to Kalmadi.

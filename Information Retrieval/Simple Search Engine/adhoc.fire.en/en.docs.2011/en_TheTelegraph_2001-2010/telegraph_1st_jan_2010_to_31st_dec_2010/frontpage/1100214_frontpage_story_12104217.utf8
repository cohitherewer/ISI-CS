	Feb. 13: What Flurys is to Calcutta, German Bakery is to Pune.         
	The iconic caf, located across the street from the Osho ashram in upscale Koregaon, was a favourite haunt of western tourists visiting the city. Nearby is Jewish prayer centre Chabad House.        
	The bakery is actually a cosy wooden shack, perched on the side of the road where Koregaon Park begins. The wooden seating gives the place an earthy look. The batik pieces adorning the walls and the cane mats provide the ethnic touch.        
	Within its wooden benches and open-aired exits, German Bakery, its loyal customers say, captured the spirit of the times, the zeitgeist.         
	Foreign tourists, especially backpackers, are familiar with a range of German Bakeries in India  they are omnipresent in Ladakh, Goa, Pushkar, Varanasi and other places on the tourism circuit and the Buddhist trail. All offer the same package of health food at reasonable prices and serve as meeting places of backpackers.         
	The Pune German Bakery was apparently the first to be set up, in 1987 by German bookseller Klaus Gutzeit, who also went by the name Woody Pumpernickel. The location, near the Osho ashram, was ideal.        
	Its customers  from college students to 50-something executives apart from the foreign crowd  swear by the delicacies the bakery serves, all in-house preparations. The favourites being Hummus sandwiches, tofu-burgers, avocado rolls, salads, fresh juices, fruit lassi and the luscious, delectable desserts. Pune residents swear the caf makes the best bread in town.         
	Also on the menu are Spanish omelettes, herbal tea and Danish pastry, which one can tuck into while spying on the endless stream of visitors  hippies, filmmakers, Oshoites or a lone traveller sipping masala chai.         
	The bakery opened as early as 5 in the morning and customers started pouring in about an hour later, the bustle continuing till about 11pm.         
	A notice on the walls requests patrons Please do not sit for a long time. But few bothered, lingering with their food and teas while discussing a range of subjects, from rock music to cricket to transcendental meditation.        
	Until the blast shattered the calm.

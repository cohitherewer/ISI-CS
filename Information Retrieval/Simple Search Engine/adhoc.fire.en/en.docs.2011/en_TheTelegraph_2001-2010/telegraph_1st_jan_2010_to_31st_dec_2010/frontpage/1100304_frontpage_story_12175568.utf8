  - Maoist leader was on way to Haripur          OUR BUREAU                      A masked Telugu Deepak at Bhabani Bhawan. (Amit Datta)                                      
	Calcutta, March 3: Telugu Deepak was on a mission to build a base in East Midnapores Haripur, where the site to set up a nuclear reactor is situated, when he was arrested last night in Behala, officials said.        
	Deepak, whose name is Venkateshwar Reddy, was handpicked by the Maoist leadership to establish a base in Haripur largely because of his experience in Nandigram, in the same district, during the agitation there against land acquisition, CID sources said.        
	Although the Trinamul Congress is also stitching together a resistance movement against the nuclear plant in Haripur, police said Deepak had told them that unlike in Nandigram, where the Maoists had worked alongside Trinamul, the rebels would work alone in the new site.        
	CID officers have been interrogating Deepak since his arrest from the Sarsuna bus stop. The guerrilla leader had been operating mainly in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore for the past 10 years.        
	Deepak told us that the Trinamul leadership, which is in complete control of Nandigram now, had betrayed them after the success of the movement there and was now trying to drive the Maoists out of the area, an official said.        
	Subrata Bakshi, the Trinamul state president, said his party had nothing to do with the Maoists. We have launched a movement in Haripur on our own, he said.        
	Officials said that en route to Haripur, Deepak had come to Calcutta to meet some key Maoist operatives.        
	From the two bags that Deepak was carrying when he hopped off the bus at Sarsuna, the police have recovered a camcorder, a tape-recorder, audio cassettes, leaflets and Rs 53,300 in cash. These are essential for building a base anywhere for the Maoists, an official said.        
	 The audio cassettes contain speeches of Maoist leaders as well as of those who have converted to their cause, the official said. The camcorder is used to show footage of how the Maoists have won the confidence of the people in Lalgarh and the adjoining areas in a bid to influence others.        
	State director-general of police Bhupinder Singh said Deepak had used the pseudonym Gouranga when he was part of the land movement in Nandigram and would possibly have used a similar or same name had he been able to make it to Haripur.        
	Officials said it was also clear from the bus and train tickets found on Deepak that he had already paid several visits to areas in and around Haripur in the recent past. They were more in the nature of reconnaissance trips to establish local contacts, an official said.         
	Officials said Deepak was not divulging information on critical areas like the Maoist network in Calcutta, their main benefactors in the city and sources of funds. The police have information that Deepak had visited the city and its periphery several times.        
	Deepak, who speaks Hindi, English and Bengali besides his native Telugu, told the officials last night that he was willing to tell the police about Maoist ideology and goals but would not part with logistical details.        
	He told us that we could kill him if we wanted to but he would not tell us such details, an official said, adding that the rebels would in any case have changed their plans after Deepaks arrest.        
	The additional director-general of the CID, Raj Kanojia, said at least 40 cases were pending against Deepak in Bengal alone. He is responsible for the death of many policemen and political workers, Kanojia said.         
	Deepak has been charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and remanded in police custody by a court till March 17. Since no lawyer was willing to represent Deepak, the court said an advocate from legal aid services should be provided.

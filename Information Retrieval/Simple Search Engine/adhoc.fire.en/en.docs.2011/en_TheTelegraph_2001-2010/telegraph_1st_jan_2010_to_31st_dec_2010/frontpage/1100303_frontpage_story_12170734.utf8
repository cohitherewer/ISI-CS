          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 2: A 9-year-old girl was allegedly molested by a drunken baggage handler a few feet from her mother at Calcutta international airport this morning in the first such incident in the facility in recent memory.        
	The accused, a baggage handler for Air India, and a colleague who tried to protect him were arrested after they slipped away and hid in a toilet.        
	The girl, her mother and six-month-old sister were on their way to Boston after visiting relatives in Salt Lake. The girls parents  her father did not accompany the family this time  are infotech professionals based in the US.        
	The alleged molestation occurred near a registered luggage X-ray counter around 1.30am in front of several visitors and passengers.        
	Reza Ahmed, 50, the baggage handler who police later said was drunk, was beaten up by passengers. His colleague Benoy Sanyasi, 45, a supervisor, was arrested for trying to shield him.        
	On Tuesday, the mother and the two children were scheduled to take a Lufthansa flight at 2.45am from Calcutta to Frankfurt and onwards to Boston.         
	We went till the visitors area and then they entered the passenger area for check-in, said a relative. Around 1.30am, while the mother was getting her registered luggage scanned at the X-ray counter, the girl was sitting on a chair and looking after her six-month-old sister who was in a perambulator.         
	Ahmed approached the girl, passed obscene comments and molested her, the relative added.        
	CISF sources said a CCTV had 30-second-long footage of the baggage handler touching the girl.        
	The girl rushed to her mother and told her about the incident. Her mother came out of the passenger area and informed us. Ahmed was still there. By that time, others also realised what had happened and had grabbed him, the relative said, alleging that the CISF personnel on duty refused to help nab the suspect.         
	Soon, Sanyasi rushed to the spot. He said we had no proof that Ahmed had molested the girl and threatened us, the relative said. An official said Sanyasi made several phone calls in a bid to save Ahmed. After a few minutes, the duo managed to escape.         
	The mother, who was in absolute shock, left with her daughters after filing a complaint, said an official, adding that 15 persons signed the complaint as eyewitnesses.        
	Ahmed and Sanyasi were arrested from a toilet in the international terminal around 4am. The police said a medical test confirmed Ahmed had consumed alcohol.        
	It is an unfortunate incident which never happened before at the airport, said R. Srinivasan, the airport director.        
	Airport sources said that unlike pilots, the ground staff were not put through alcohol tests. The incidence of staff coming to duty in an inebriated state has increased in the past one year, said a lady official. At night, we feel unsafe.        
	Ahmed and Sanyasi were produced in court and granted bail. Air India has suspended both.

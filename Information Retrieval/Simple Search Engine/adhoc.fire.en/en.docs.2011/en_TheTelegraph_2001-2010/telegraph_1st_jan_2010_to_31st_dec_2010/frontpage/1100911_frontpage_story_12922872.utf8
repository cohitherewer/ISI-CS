The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sceptical Guruji not sure of govt tenure
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sceptical Guruji not sure of govt tenure
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            Newly appointed co-operative society officials seek blessings from JMM MLA Hemant Soren at his father Shibu Sorens residence in Ranchi on Friday. Hemant is set to take the oath as deputy chief minister on Saturday. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                   
	Ranchi, Sept. 10: JMM chief Shibu Soren may have agreed to head a steering committee to ensure that alliance partners act in cohesion, but he is not willing to guarantee that the government to be headed by Arjun Munda will last a full term.        
	Its too premature to say that the Munda government will complete the remaining tenure of four years smoothly. No one in todays power politics can make such long-term predictions, said Guruji, who claimed he agreed to back the BJP this time as his partymen wanted it.        
	Sorens scepticism wasnt limited to the governments tenure. He hinted he didnt expect much by way of governance. Which good work wasnt initiated during my brief tenure? If the Munda government carries them forward, the state will benefit. But, as things change soon after assuming power, set priorities on issues of common interest usually take a back seat.         
	That Soren agreed to head the committee formed to keep partners in check, indicated he wasnt going to be as aloof as he had hinted earlier. Of late though, Guruji has been busy playing chief patron of the JMMs three-day convention scheduled for September 22 in his pocket borough of Dumka.        
	For the last few days, Soren has been meeting party men from various parts of the state, instructing them about various aspects of the party convention. But, sources close to him said he would stay put in Ranchi till Munda proved his majority in the Assembly.        
	We will prefer it if the cabinet expansion and distribution of portfolios are done on the same day of the trust vote (September 14). The new JMM ministers will then discuss priorities at our convention. Only then will we submit our wish list to the Munda government, he said, adding he had left it to Munda to decide on portfolios.        
	Soren indicated he wasnt quite willing to forget how the BJP dumped him in May. Everyone knows how I became chief minister thrice and under what circumstances I had to step down. Even after BJP withdrew support, I kept quiet. After four months, they decided to form another government with our support. As my party endorsed the idea, I gave them my blessings, he said.

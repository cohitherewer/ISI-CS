The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Name game on Basu
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Name game on Basu
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Jyoti Basu                          
	Calcutta, April 10: The Left-led Calcutta Municipal Corporation today accepted a proposal to rename EM Bypass after Jyoti Basu, less than three months after the death of the CPM patriarch on January 17 and a month before the civic polls.        
	However, under corporation rules, at least two years must pass after a persons death before a road can be named after him or her.        
	The civic bodys decision came at its last House meeting before the May corporation polls in which the odds are seen as stacked against the Left. If the Trinamul Congress comes to power, Mamata Banerjees party will have to decide on renaming the road if a panel clears the proposal.        
	 After CPM councillor Rajiv Biswas proposed that EM Bypass be renamed after Basu, fellow party leader and chairman of the civic board Nirmal Mukherjee readily accepted it.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the recommendation would be sent to the road rename committee for consideration.        
	Trinamul councillor Anup Chatterjee said the decision violated civic rules. This is a premature move, Chatterjee said. The rules state that there has to be a gap of two years between the death of a person and renaming a road after him. He said it had to be debated whether any road should be renamed after Basu. After all, he took the state backward.         
	Shibaranjan Chattopadhyay, a member of the corporations road rename committee, said: It is not proper for the civic body to make such a recommendation in this manner. If this recommendation is considered at all, it will not be done before January 2012.        
	Civic officials said the recommendation of the board was not binding on the committee. However, recommendations made by the board are generally accepted.        
	The officials also said there was no fixed period within which the committee would have to consider the recommendation.         
	Mayor Bhattacharyya said he had done nothing wrong by forwarding the recommendation. It is after all only a recommendation, he said. Now let us see what happens.

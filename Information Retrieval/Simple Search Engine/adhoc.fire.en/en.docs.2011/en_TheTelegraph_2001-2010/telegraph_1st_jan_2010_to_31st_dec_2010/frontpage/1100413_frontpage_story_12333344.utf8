          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Ranch, April 12: The police arrested two senior members of a rebel organisation active in the Maoist strongholds of Lohardaga and Latehar districts on a day the security forces came across provocative posters, 126km from the state capital, urging jawans to join the rebel ranks instead of serving an army of exploiters.        
	Taking advantage of a lull in Operation Greenhunt, Maoists had put up the audacious posters in Manika in Latehar district, the same spot where they had blown up a six-room forest department guest house on April 3 and had abducted five government officials, including an additional district magistrate, on March 20.         
	But, according to local sources, as soon as word spread about the posters, the police pulled them down. The rebels purpose, the police believe, was to provoke security forces now that there was a clear break in the offensive against them.        
	When the operation was on, Maoists did not dare come out of hiding. But after the first phase of operations came to an end on March 14 they have again started to mark their presence, a police officer said.         
	Aap shoshkon ka camp tyag kar, garibon ke camp mein shamil ho jayen aur apni sahadat dena band karen (leave the army of exploiters and stop making sacrifices, join the camp of the poor instead), said one of the posters.        
	Some pamphlets were also strewn about in the area and these, too, were addressed to the security forces.         
	In Ranchi, superintendent of police Praveen Kumar identified the two arrested as Sanjay Mahli of Sijo village and Sanjeev Bhagat of Warda village, both in Lohardaga district.        
	He said they belonged to the 14-member Swatantra Jharkhand Party (SJP), an extremist organisation, from Bisaha Khatanga village, about 35km from here.        
	Four firearms, including two double barrel guns and two single barrel guns besides six rounds of ammunition, were recovered from them.         
	The superintendent of police said Mahli was the leader while Bhagat was his second in command.         
	Both operate in Lohardaga and Latehar districts, besides few areas of Ranchi district. There are 14 members in their gang thats involved in 12 cases of abduction, Kumar said.

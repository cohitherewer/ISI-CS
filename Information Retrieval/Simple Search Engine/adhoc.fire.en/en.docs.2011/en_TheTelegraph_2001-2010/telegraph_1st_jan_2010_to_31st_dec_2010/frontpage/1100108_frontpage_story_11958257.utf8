          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA amp; AMIT GUPTA                                                       
	Ranchi, Jan. 7: The Shibu Soren government breezed through its confidence motion in the state Assembly today by securing 45 votes amid an unexpected boycott by all five RJD MLAs that depleted the Oppositions ranks to 26.        
	If the RJDs walkout was a blow for the Congress-JVM combine that had hoped to make things difficult for Soren, Geeta Koda ended up supporting the Opposition, a move many described as being aimed at placating the Congress at a time when her husband and former chief minister Madhu Koda was in jail and under the scanner of various investigating agencies for corruption charges to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore.        
	In the end, 26 MLAs, including those of the Congress and JVM, and the CPI(ML)s Vinod Singh and JBSPs Geeta Koda, voted against the confidence motion.         
	But with the RJD walking out, to prove a point to the Congress that has been distancing itself from its party chief Lalu Prasad, the numbers were five short of the 31 it was looking at.        
	For the ruling combine, apart from JMM, BJP and Ajsu MLAs, it also got the support of Bandhu Tirkey (JJM), Chamra Linda (RKP) and Videsh Singh (Independent) in the motion of confidence moved around 11am by deputy chief minister Raghubar Das as Soren is still a Lok Sabha MP and has six months to get elected to the Assembly.         
	Replying to the nearly five-hour-long debate on the confidence motion, Soren spelt out the broad parameters of his government, in line with the aam aadmi issues of jobs and subsidised foodgrain he has been stressing on ever since he was sworn in on December 30, 2009.         
	This is the third time I have become chief minister. I also became a Union minister. But, I could do little for the uplift of poor tribals, Soren said, adding that the coal ministry started yielding profits under his leadership, just as he had ended the money laundering business in Jharkhand to a considerable extent.        
	Somehow, I have been able to reach here. But, now I need your support to fight the new challenges ahead, said the chief minister, who was calm throughout the debate, refusing to be provoked by the utterances of the Opposition.        
	Soren promised to provide jobs to one lakh youth at the earliest by filling up vacancies in various departments, and said he was also considering declaring the state famine-hit.         
	He promised to revise the BPL list soon and assured those who had moved out of Jharkhand in search of a livelihood that their names, too, would be included in the updated list.        
	There was a minor ruckus in the House after Soren used a slang, but he was quick to apologise to the Speaker for the slip of tongue upon which the remark was expunged.                  JMM supporters celebrate Shibu Soren winning the confidence vote on Thursday. Picture by Manik Bose     
	But no one objected to former minister and senior JVM leader Samresh Singhs remarks against the opportunistic alliance of JMM and the BJP when he likened it to same sex marriages in fairly explicit terms that many would argue was not only unparliamentary but also uncalled for.        
	Though the Opposition had vowed to expose the alliance, it displayed little floor coordination when various parties ended up contradicting each other, especially on Naxalism.        
	While JVM legislature party leader Pradeep Yadav alleged Soren was adopting a soft stand against Naxalites, his colleague Samresh Singh voiced a different opinion.

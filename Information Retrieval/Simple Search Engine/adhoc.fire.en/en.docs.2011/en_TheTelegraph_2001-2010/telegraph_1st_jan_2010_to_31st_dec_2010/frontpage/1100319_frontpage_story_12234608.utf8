The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Another CRPF team coming
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Another CRPF team coming
          AMIT GUPTA                             Strict vigil                                  
	Ranchi, March 18: Forces engaged in an offensive against Maoist rebels are now concentrating on the Jhumra foothills along the Bokaro-Hazaribagh border while operations along the Jharkhand-Bengal border is expected to gather steam with one more CRPF battalion set to join the existing forces in the region.         
	CRPF special DG Vijay Raman, who reached Ranchi last evening, reviewed the ongoing operations with the state top police brass today. He said the operation would continue and new areas would be added, said a top police official who attended the meeting.         
	Earlier operations around Jhumra hills, considered a safe haven for rebels, were restricted to Nawadih and Uparghat areas. Now, the operations have been extended to areas in and around Konar dam and Lugu Pahar.         
	Forces comprising CRPF, COBRA, JAP and IRB have now been pressed into service in the Jhumra foothills. We expect some good results, the official said.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, CRPF DIG Alok Raj said one more CRPF battalion comprising six companies was set to arrive in the state in the next couple of days. The new battalion would join 11 battalions (66 companies) of CRPF already stationed in the state and engaged in the anti-Naxalite offensive.         
	Raj said that the next phase of joint operations with Bengal along the Ghatshila-Patamda border would start soon.         
	Earlier, operations had been going on in phases in East and West Singhbhum, Bokaro, Ranchi, Khunti, Latehar and Chatra. Now the operations have also started in Hazaribagh, Ramgarh, Garhwa, Giridih and Palamau.        
	The strategy adopted by state police and CRPF, top officials conceded, was to keep the Naxalites guessing by launching operations in different areas in a sporadic manner.         
	Out of 11 operational areas identified by the Union home ministry across Naxalite-hit states, five are in Jharkhand. Garhwa shares a border with UP, Palamau and Giridih with Bihar, Ghatshila and Patmada with Bengal and West Singhbhum with Orissa. In all these areas, operations would take place regularly. Moreover, the thrust would be on Parasnath and Jhumra hills of Giridih and Bokaro districts respectively, added a senior police official.

	Hyderabad, March 25: Having hired star cricketers for crores of rupees, Indian Premier League franchises now want the Umpire in the Sky on their side too.        
	Several team owners and officials from the cash-rich league have prayed at Tirupati and offered hefty donations for the success of their teams, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam officials said.        
	The latest was Vijay Mallya, owner of Royal Challengers Bangalore, who visited the Srivari temple at Tirumala yesterday. He donated Rs 6 crore towards the shrines project of gold-plating the sanctums outer walls, Devasthanam officials said.        
	Sources close to the industrialist said he had taken part in special rituals, praying for victories for his team.        
	Devasthanam officials said representatives from the Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Daredevils and the Mumbai Indians too had visited the Lord Venkateswara temple and offered prayers. Asked who from the Knight Riders had come, the officials declined to give names.        
	Mallyas Challengers and the Mumbai team are doing fine but not so early-birds Chennai Super Kings, whose officials had participated in an abhishekam and pujas before IPL Season Three kicked off on March 12.        
	Deccan Chargers Hyderabad team representatives too have visited Tirumala and offered prayers and handsome donations, a Devasthanam official said.        
	Ordinary fans too have been lining up at the hilltop temple with prayers for their teams. One of the notes left in the hundi by a Deccan Chargers fan prays that IPL matches be held at least in Visakhapatnam, if not Hyderabad, next year.        
	The Chargers are being forced to play their home games in Navi Mumbai and Cuttack. The official reason is security fears because of the Telangana agitation, but the buzz is that the state government had offended IPL commissioner Lalit Modi in some way.        
	Many of the hundi notes pray for sense to dawn on Andhra government officials. They should make peace with Modi, whom they have annoyed and turned into an enemy of the states cricket lovers, one note said.        
	Devasthanam officials said they would forward the fans notes to the state government and IPL authorities.        
	We had received several notes during IPL-1 and IPL-2 too, and before the Oscars for the success of Slumdog, a temple official said.

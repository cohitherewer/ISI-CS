The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bhai and Bhai with a dash of reality
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bhai and Bhai with a dash of reality
  - Nehru today, Pakistan tomorrow          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                     
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: When the Hindi-Chini Bhai-Bhai call was first made, India and China were both global basket cases ravaged by war and colonialism, their formidable civilisational esteem ringing hollow in their deficits.        
	This afternoon, when Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao pressed the refresh button on the India-China friendship chant, he did so in the name of two emerging powers whose camaraderie had become a world imperative, not merely a matter of bilateral interest.         
	Our ties have gone beyond bilateral scope and assumed global responsibility. When China and India have a heart-to-heart conversation, the whole world will listen, and we have reason to be proud of that, Wen told a gathering at the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) shortly after concluding talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Better co-operation between India and China will enhance the developing world. Our endeavours have caught the attention of the world. The world is undergoing major development and changes, we should seize the opportunity and lose no time in deepening our ties, Wen said.        
	At the high point was what was an emotional pitch for resumption of the Nehru-Mao spirit of the 1950s, Wen said, to applause especially from the Chinese rows in the auditorium: We are friends and not rivals, we shall always be friends and never be rivals. This must be the firm conviction of every Chinese and every Indian. He did refer to the bloody rupture the 1962 war brought to the Nehru-Mao solidarity but only transiently and only to emphasise that such short disruptions should not be able to shake the convictions of a 2000-year history of feeding radiance to each other.         
	Backstage, foreign office officials told The Telegraph that the choice of the rather humble ICWA auditorium over the better-outfitted Vigyan Bhavan was itself part of the symbolism Wen wanted to convey.                           
	We had offered them Vigyan Bhavan but the Chinese wanted this because they are aware of Nehrus connections with the ICWA; even Hu Jintao spoke here when he came, an official said.         
	Wens discourse could easily have invited blame for being romantic at the expense of ignoring extant reality, so repetitive it was in its underlining of amity and alliance, so incognisant it was of his next port of call, Pakistan.        
	The Chinese Premier seemed engaged in an entreaty almost innocent, if not also amnesiac, of Chinas role in the region, especially with respect to its political and military bolstering of Pakistan.         
	For a while, as he thimbled a new theme, stitch after stitch, now invoking the Upanishads, now returning to Rabindranath Tagore, now taking the Silk Route, now recalling Buddha, Wen almost seemed to suggest that all a return to bonhomie now required was a clasp and a photo-op to seal it.        
	I and Prime Minister Singh are close friends we have reached a consensus on strengthening our strategic relationship, the pressing task now is to turn that consensus into reality. I am confident we will do it for the glory of the oriental civilisation.         
	But he was to nudge his audience to reality before it could doze to dreaming. It is unavoidable, he argued, suddenly real, that we will have differences and disagreements, but we should narrow our differences and widen confidence.         
	In this context, he spoke of the prickly and long-standing boundary dispute  it is not easy to completely resolve it  but said again that a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution could be found through patience, trust and perseverance.         
	Given that two-and-a-half billion people are involved in achieving that, it might take a while.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, March 24: With militancy at a low ebb in Assam, the army and paramilitary forces have now turned their attention to prevent smuggling of forest produce and poaching, profits from which go to the coffers of rebels.         
	The forces are more focused on protecting forest land and the denizens of these forests. The forests have become a funding source for the militants, a senior army officer told The Telegraph today.         
	In fact, the army and paramilitary forces have already been deputed in two national parks and several reserve forests in the state since a fortnight now.         
	Timber smugglers are paying a heavy tax to the militants and there is also information of a militant outfits involvement in poaching of rhinos and tigers, the officer said.         
	Army personnel have launched a massive operation in Orang National Park since this morning after footprints of at least four poachers entering the park through the Brahmaputra was detected.         
	We are sure the group of poachers is still inside the national park. Our men have already started an operation to locate them, he said.         
	Like the army at Orang, BSF personnel, too, are helping forest personnel in the drive against poaching, which has become rampant of late.         
	Recently, a youth was arrested from a village in a fringe area of Kaziranga.         
	The arrmy claims that Md Muslim Ali, who was apprehended from Hamoti village under Jakhalabandha police station in Nagaon district, has links with militant outfits. Ali is involved in rhino poaching in the park.         
	A country-made pistol and a grenade were recovered from Ali, who was arrested last year in connection with a poaching case in Kaziranga.         
	The army personnel are also keeping a close watch on the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park in Tinsukia district, the army officer said.         
	Apart from the states national parks, which are under forces vigil, the timber-rich reserve forests are also under a scanner.         
	The officer said the reserve forests in Sonitpur and Karbi Anglong districts have become a major source of income for militant outfits that collect heavy tax from timber smugglers.         
	Army personnel have also managed to apprehend a large quantity timber from smugglers who have almost turned the Chariduar reserve forest in Sonitpur district, barren.         
	Felling of trees in the reserve forests has come down after our troops started regular patrolling since a fortnight now, he said, adding that militants are directly involved in timber smuggling in Karbi Anglong district.

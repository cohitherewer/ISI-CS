          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, March 3: Nine years after the states creation, the cabinet today decided to set up a human rights commission in Jharkhand.        
	The modalities to make the body functional is expected to be worked out soon.        
	Principal secretary, cabinet co-ordination, Aditya Swaroop said according to the Human Rights Protection Act of 1993, all states ought to have a human rights commission.         
	Such commissions are already in existence in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Bengal and Bihar.         
	A writ petition demanding the setting up of a human rights commission in Jharkhand is also pending before the high court.        
	In fact, the Jharkhand High Court created a human rights committee in 2004 to deal with rights violation cases in the absence of a state human rights commission. The high court action followed a Supreme Court order.         
	Besides, a human rights cell is also functional at the police headquarters, which is headed by an officer of the rank of inspector general. However, it does not even have an SP to examine complaints.        
	In other decisions taken, the cabinet approved Rs 72.37 crore for the purchase of equipment for government-run hospitals, including primary health centres and district hospitals.         
	The energy department was granted two acres of land in Namkum circle of Ranchi district for setting up of a state load dispatch centre that will maintain accounts of electricity transactions. So long, only the JSEB had a load dispatch centre, but Jharkhand procures electricity from several other sources as well, including DVC, NTPC and Tata Power.        
	The cabinet decided to exempt the products of Yogoda Satsanga Society of India from VAT. The spiritual body, which has its headquarters in Ranchi, produces several items like audio and video CDs, pendants and the like.        
	Over 630 posts have been sanctioned for smooth running of 35 newly-created revenue circles in the state.        
	The states chief electoral officer Debashish Guptas Sri Lanka tour in January this year was approved with retrospective effect.

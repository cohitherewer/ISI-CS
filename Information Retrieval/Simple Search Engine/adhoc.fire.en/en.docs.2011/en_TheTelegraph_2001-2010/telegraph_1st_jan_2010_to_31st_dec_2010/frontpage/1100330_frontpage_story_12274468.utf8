The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Stephen Court, a part of our cultural heritage
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Stephen Court, a part of our cultural heritage

	My association with Stephen Court is primarily through Flurys and Peter Cat. I didnt know much about the world on the upper floors though I have had friends who used to live there.        
	I have been inside the building and I remember doing theatre with my friends there. I have shot from the roof of Stephen Court for my film Bada Din you get a great view of Park Street from the roof. And theres a lovely staircase inside.        
	But this old house, which was partly gutted on Tuesday in a blaze killing so many people, is important to me because its a part of my cultural heritage. Stephen Court and Queens Mansion remind me of Paris where you have grand houses with people living on the upper floors and restaurants downstairs.        
	You know a city by its architecture and buildings like Stephen Court define the character of Calcutta. Buildings like Jorasanko Thakurbari, Mullickbari, the Coffee House, Metro cinema, Writers Buildings, the GPO and Queens Mansion hold the character of Calcutta.        
	This is a city where you can take a tram ride and pass by a church or a mosque and wind around old colonial houses. This city is a little laid-back and it thrives on the finer things of life, like art and music. Calcutta can never be business-like like some other metros. It can never be a city of great shopping malls.        
	Its rather sad that no one cares for the citys old buildings. So many old buildings have been gutted over the years like the Firpos market and still theres no effort to save them. I live in an old house (near Ripon Street) and I know what kind of a meter box you have in an old house and I take care of it.        
	The authorities are doing precious little about the old houses. No one came forward to negotiate with Mantosh to stop Lighthouse cinema from becoming a cheap garment store and I cried the night it was shut down.        
	The government has replaced the statues of Lord Curzon and others from the Maidan, which were priceless pieces of art, from a terribly lopsided sense of patriotism. We dont need to destroy our colonial heritage to show our patriotism just because the British had ruled and oppressed us.        
	Calcuttas colonial heritage is a part of its spirit and the entire Dalhousie square is a priceless part of my city. I dont know if the CMC respects its colonial past or not, but it would make a big difference to me if the Corporations red building is not there anymore tomorrow.        
	My grandfather used to take me to Flurys when I was just six or seven for chicken sandwiches. I grew up with Flurys. But there was so much more to Park Street than just music and food. There was stand-up comedy, magic, drag shows and even strip dance! No other city in my country had such a fantastic tradition. The sad thing is that there is no record of it.        
	The Anglo-Indians, Armenians and Jews were the main force behind this Park Street culture. They loved good food and good music, and they owned most of the hotels and restaurants on Park Street. This group of Anglo-Indians, Armenians and Jews were moneyed and they loved Calcutta. But the moneyed class that has taken over these buildings do not seem to have that love for Calcutta.        
	Its one of the reasons why I have cut down on my trips to Someplace Else. Its a new breed of people who come there to just guzzle alcohol, yap loudly and have no interest in the music thats being played. They have no breeding as to what a night club is all about. This is not the Calcutta I grew up in.        
	I have always loved to sit at Flurys with a cup of tea where I know no one will drive me out, then drop by Oxford Bookstore to browse and maybe buy a book. I would then walk down to New Market, shop for grocery and go further down to Free School Street where I would chat up some foreign tourists and then come back to Park Street and have a beer at Olympia.        
	I have done this because I loved going around these beautiful houses. I love my city because I can live with history all the time.

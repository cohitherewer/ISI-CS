	New York, Jan. 1 (PTI): Actress and singer Jennifer Lopez seems to be losing the one asset that has catapulted her to instant fame, her curvaceous derriere.         
	As the 41-year-old star took to the stage in a skin-tight catsuit for a New Years Eve performance in Times Square, her once ample bottom looked like it had shrunk, reports the Daily Mail.        
	The Waiting For Tonight singer looked toned in the shimmering catsuit, which became transparent under the stage lights. The mother of two was performing at Times Square to celebrate the start of 2010. Despite miserable weather, more than 750,000 revellers braved the cold and rain to watch her sing.        
	You didnt think I could do that in the rain did you? she said after her energetic routine. Lopezs audience cheered as she writhed on the stage before high-kicking along to Frank Sinatras classic song New York, New York.         
	Lopez, who is married to Latin singer Marc Anthony grew up in the Bronx area of New York but admitted that he had never been to Times Square to celebrate New Years Eve.

	Kabul, Aug. 7: The aid workers last meal was a picnic in the forest in the Sharrun Valley, high in the Hindu Kush mountains of northern Afghanistan, as they were on their long way home.        
	The group  a medical team of six Americans, a Briton, a German and four Afghans  had just finished eating when they were accosted by gunmen with long red beards, the local police said.        
	The gunmen marched the aid workers into the forest, stood 10 of them in a straight line, 7 men and 3 women, and shot them. The police found their bodies yesterday, the Badakhshan province police chief, Gen. Aqa Noor Kentoz, said today.        
	The killings, the largest massacre of aid workers in Afghanistan in recent years, vividly demonstrated the growing insecurity in the northern part of the country, well outside the Talibans base.        
	Pressured in their traditional areas in the south and east by Natos growing concentration of forces there, the insurgents have become more active in areas once relatively quiet, such as Badakhshan province.         
	The police said the aid workers  eye doctors, nurses and technicians  worked for the International Assistance Mission in Kabul, an aid group that has operated in Afghanistan since 1966, and were hiking into one of the toughest areas of the country to provide services.        
	The Taliban, who defiantly claimed responsibility, accused them of being spies and Christian missionaries.        
	All indications are this is probably our team, said Dirk Frans, executive director of the International Assistance Mission. Both Frans and police emphasised, however, that no positive identification of the victims had yet been made.        
	Their bodies were being brought out by road, a days journey to the district seat. Frans confirmed, however, that Saifullah, who later told his story to the police, was their driver. And the local police identified the missions team leader, Dr Tom Little of Delmar, New York, as one of the dead.        
	The Taliban version is that the aid workers ignored orders from an insurgent patrol to stop and were shot as they tried to flee, according to a spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, reached by mobile phone.         
	He said they discovered among their effects a Bible in the Dari language widely spoken in Afghanistan, and maps showing the location of the Taliban in northern Afghanistan.

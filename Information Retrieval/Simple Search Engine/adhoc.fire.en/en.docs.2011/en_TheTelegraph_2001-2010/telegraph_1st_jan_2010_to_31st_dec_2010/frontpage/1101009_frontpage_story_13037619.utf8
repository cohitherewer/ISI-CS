          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 8: Mamata Banerjee today indicated she might cancel her trip to Cambridge where she was to deliver a speech later this month, three days after a lecture at the university by Prakash Karat.        
	Mamata blamed Karats party for the possible cancellation. I am grateful to them (Cambridge authorities) for inviting me, but you can see what is happening. They (the CPM) can shed blood before and after the Pujas. How can I leave a blood-soaked Bengal? the Trinamul Congress chief said after a rally in Canning, South 24-Parganas.        
	However, a Trinamul source told The Telegraph that Karat himself could be one reason why Mamata was thinking of pulling out of the Cambridge programme after confirming participation.        
	The university authorities had not informed her they had also invited Karat. She wants to avoid any comparisons with Karat, a Trinamul vice-president said.        
	CPM and Trinamul supporters today clashed repeatedly in Canning, a Left stronghold. Mamata alleged party leader Partha Chatterjee was attacked and 200 Trinamul supporters were injured.        
	She is very upset over the attack on Trinamul leaders and workers. But nothing is official yet (about the cancellation of the UK trip), said Ratan Mukherjee, special officer to the railway minister.        
	Mamata had twice put off her Cambridge trip because of political compulsions in Bengal, sources said. She was expected to inaugurate a new wing of the universitys political science department on October 25 in her capacity as Indias railway minister, and speak on Indias rise as an economic power and her own climb towards power in Bengal.        
	Karat is scheduled to speak on Victor Kiernan and the Left in India on October 22 at the university. The late Kiernan, a British Marxist historian, was Karats teacher at Edinburgh University.        
	CPM and Trinamul sources confirmed that the two leaders itineraries ruled out any possibility of their paths crossing in Britain.        
	Although Mamatas statement made it clear she was unwilling to visit Britain, a senior railway ministry official said: We cannot officially confirm she has cancelled her trip as no regret letter has left Rail Bhavan till this evening.        
	Trinamul leaders, however, felt that now that the word had spread that her trip could be called off, she might do so lest the CPM get fresh ammunition to target her.        
	 At a time she is saying the people of Bengal are not safe, a visit to Britain will not go down well with her core constituency. Besides, foreign trips do not gel with her simple lifestyle, a Trinamul leader said.        
	She has informed the Centre about her decision to skip the Cambridge programme, said a junior Union minister close to Mamata.

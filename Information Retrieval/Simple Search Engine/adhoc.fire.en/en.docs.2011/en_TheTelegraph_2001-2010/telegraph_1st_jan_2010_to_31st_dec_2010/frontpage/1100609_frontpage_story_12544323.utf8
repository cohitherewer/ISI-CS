	A speeding truck that lost control while trying to negotiate a sharp turn in Barasat overturned on an autorickshaw, killing a youth and injuring three members of a family.        
	Police said 34-year-old Bapi Saha, who was driving the auto, was crushed to death as the drivers cabin of the truck fell directly on him.        
	We were heading for a relatives house around 2.45pm in the auto when a truck trying to tackle a sharp bend at the Dakshinpara crossing at a high speed overturned and fell on us, recalled Subrata Roy, 52, who was travelling in the three-wheeler with his wife and aged mother-in-law.        
	All three of us were injured while the driver, whom we knew for several years, died on the spot, said the resident of Private Road in Dum Dum.        
	Subrata, who was sitting on the left, was flung off the auto and suffered cracks in the skull. His wife Sathi, 42, and mother-in-law Sadhana Bhowmik, 70, lay trapped under the mangled remains of the auto for around 40 minutes, their heads jutting out.        
	Local residents arranged for an ambulance and put the duo on oxygen as they complained of respiratory distress.        
	The police said a metal iron rod in the hood of the auto bent under the impact of the crash and hit Sathi in the chest. Sathi and her mother also suffered multiple cuts.        
	Sathi has been admitted to Kalpataru Hospital in Barasat while Sadhana is in the intensive care unit of Peerless Hospital, on the Bypass. Subrata was released after being administered stitches on the head.        
	Had the cabin of the truck come forward by a foot, all three passengers would have died, said Rana Upadhay, a eyewitness.        
	A team from the Barasat fire station arrived around 3.15pm. We tried to bring out the two women but could not as they got trapped under the metal rods of the auto. They could be rescued only after a police breakdown van lifted the truck, said a fireman.        
	Local residents, who joined the rescue efforts, launched a protest on the spot, alleging that the breakdown van had come late.        
	The driver and the helper of the truck melted in the crowd and fled. We have seized the truck and are looking for the driver and his help. We will take strong action if the driver is found to have violated goods carriage norms, said S.M.H. Meerza, the additional superintendent of police, Barasat.         
	Officers said overloading might be one of the reasons for the mishap.

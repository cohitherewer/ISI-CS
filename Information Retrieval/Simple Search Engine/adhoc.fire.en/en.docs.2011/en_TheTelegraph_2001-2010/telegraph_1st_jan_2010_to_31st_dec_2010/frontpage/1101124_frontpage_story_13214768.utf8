The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Moment of truth for New Bihar
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Moment of truth for New Bihar
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                      Lalu Prasad with his granddaughter Gauri. (PTI)                          
	Patna, Nov. 23: This could be Bihars moment of reckoning more than it is chief minister Nitish Kumars or challenger Lalu Prasads.         
	Will the new Assembly, set to be unveiled on Wednesday after a grinding six-week campaign, reveal a people still mired in coils of caste and creed or have Biharis begun to embrace larger issues in pursuit of a new future?        
	Bihar is on test and currently rippling with expectation on what its people will give unto themselves for the next five years. The odds are governance will win a vote in the state for the first time in close to half a century.        
	Since the mid-1960s, elections here have consistently been a volleyball of identity politics, individual or social: the first reverse to the Congress in 1967, its return on Indira Gandhis garibi hatao ticket, her overthrow following the Emergency and again her return on the rebound to the disarray of the Janata raj.        
	Then, soon after, the arrival of Mandal politics and the establishment of the once-infallible Lalu Prasad cult.        
	Says Saibal Gupta of the Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI), Patnas only think-tank worth the name: This is the first occasion in the states memory that a chief minister has sought votes on the basis of work done. I would say that has never happened in post-Independence Bihar and that in itself makes the moment historic. Nitish has put out a record of his years in power and asked people for a report card, nobody has done that in Bihar yet, it has all been about personalities and vote banks.        
	That isnt to say, though, that Bihars engrossing political stage has suddenly been swept clean of personas that have so dominated it.         
	But if the compelling Lalu Prasad held solo sway for 15 years, its now fair to say he has been edged aside by the relatively unexciting, though no less engaging, Nitish.        
	In five years since he won power in the winter of 2005, Nitish has nosed ahead as the axis of Bihar politics, firmly snatching away Lalu Prasads centrality.         
	This election has been about Nitish Kumar, I have to say, admits a former member of the Lalu Prasad cabinet who still stands by his bereft side. Earlier, you were either for Lalu Prasad or against him, now you are either for Nitish or against him, he has become the main man, win or lose.        
	But as I.C. Kumar, a retired civil servant, says, Nitish has arrived afore not by force of personality but dint of performance.                    
	Lalu Prasad was a stunning politician, Kumar says. There was no match to him in his heyday. Nitish does not have that charisma but he has something Lalu Prasad never had. He has the will to put his head down and work. More than any visible achievement, he has generated hope in Bihari society and he has made this election about what he has been able to do and what he wants to in the future.        
	The tenor of the long campaign bears out Kumars argument. For all the complex arithmetic of caste and creed thats de rigueur in election-time Bihar, Nitish was able to alter, if not altogether change, the discourse, hammering day after day on development and what he calls naya Bihar, a new sub-nationalism that is able to reach above tribal concerns to feed its urgent socio-economic aspirations.        
	A new Bihari identity will emerge from these elections, the chief minister had told The Telegraph in an interview just weeks ahead of the election. There is a yearning for change and development that will stop taking cognisance of narrow social barriers of caste, that is the naya Bihar I speak of.        
	Not that Nitish has been innocent of identity politics himself. Suicidal, one of his aides said this afternoon.         
	It would be suicidal to ignore caste alignments or pretend they no longer exist. We have done our own social engineering with the extremely backward castes, the mahadalits and in pockets of poorer Muslims. That will pay, watch out. Nitish, dont forget, is also a product of the Mandal school of politics. What he has done on top is to put in some work that people see and feel.        
	What stood out during the weeks of electioneering was not merely that Nitish, with all his dour demeanour on stage, was getting the kind of crowds and reception that Lalu Prasad once used to get, but the number of women who turned out both at his rallies and at the polling booths.        
	According to a hurried post-poll estimate, the number of women voters this time has swelled by a whopping 32 lakh, and they have actually polled 2 per cent more votes than Bihars men have.        
	The only reason I can see for this bloated polling rate, says a top Bihar official with his ears close to the ground, is that there is something new pulling the voter. That something new is not Lalu Prasad, I can assure you, the new phenomenon of Bihar is clearly Nitish.        
	Tomorrow will provide some measure of how keen, or correct, Nitish has been to bank on a new voter sentiment.        
	For today, though, he wasnt risking any guesses or making any claims. I am waiting for the results just like all of you, he said, emerging from a cabinet meeting that recommended the dissolution of the Assembly and announced the lapse of his current term. If people want me to continue in the job, I shall, if they direct me otherwise, what option do I have but to respect that?         
	But the smile on his face barely matched his deliberate circumspection.        
	And the loud claims Lalu Prasad was making to a paltry audience barely a mile away, barely disguised his agitation. I am winning, I am, he roared, barely even able to inject conviction to his tone. The polls are all wrong, you media people are all wrong. Dont believe the polls.        
	True, the exit polls have given Lalu Prasad nothing but extended wilderness. His dire hope is the real poll does not do an encore.

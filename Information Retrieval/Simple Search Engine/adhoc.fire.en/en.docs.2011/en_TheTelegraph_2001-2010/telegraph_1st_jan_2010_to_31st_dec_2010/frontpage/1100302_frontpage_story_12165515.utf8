	Pokhran, March 1: Fighter jets of the Indian Air Force participating in war game Vayu Shakti pounded mock enemy bunkers in Pokhran, close to the Pakistan border, yesterday.        
	The event, being organised a few days after foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan, is being held at the Chandan range in Pokhran, just 70km from the Pakistan border.        
	The whole range was lined with 18 targets  enemy bunkers, unfriendly radars, mock terror camps and under-siege buildings to create the ambience of a 26/11-style attack.         
	At night, the targets had been lit up as paratroopers and commando forces jumped from helicopters and stealthily commandeered mock search and rescue operations.         
	As the aircraft zoomed past, dropping bombs and rockets on the targets, the deafening sound of the explosions drew applause from nearly 1,000 officers who were watching the war game.         
	The Vayu Shakti was not only a show of strength by the IAF, but was also an indication that the countrys elite strike force had come of age.         
	As defence minister A.K. Antony, who was present at the event, claimed that the armed forces were capable of dealing with any jihadi threat, IAF fighters showed their skills in taking out terror camps in precision strikes  even at night.         
	Even though 28 friendly countries had been invited to watch the war games, Antony said the demonstration was neither an attempt to send any message across the border nor was it intended to be a hidden signal to anybody.         
	China and Pakistan had not been invited to the air show  sources said the two countries did not get political clearance from the external affairs ministry, although the presence of the two countries would have increased interest in the event.         
	As many as 107 IAF aircraft participated in the exercise, which had last been held in 2004.         
	The war game was flagged off by a supersonic MiG-29, flying low at 1,250kmph. It made a deafening sound after flying over its target.         
	It was followed by photo-reconnaissance missions, flypast and air strikes by the Jaguar, MiG-21 Bison, MiG-27, MiG-29, Mirage-2000 and the multi-role Sukhoi-30 MKI aircraft.         
	They were supported by transporters like the AN 32, IL-76 and the IL-78.         
	Despite Saturdays crash-landing at Jaisalmer, the IAFs aerobatics team, Sarang, performed with its ALH Dhruv helicopters.         
	A chopper of the aerobatics team had crash-landed while rehearsing for the show because of loss of power during flight.         
	The Sukhoi-30s also performed aerial stunts along with the Surya Kiran and the Sarang aerobatics-display teams.         
	One by one, targets were hit with bombs and rockets, raising balls of fire and dust in the deserts of Pokhran, the site of Indias nuclear test facility.         
	As the sun waned and darkness set in, IAF fighter pilots continued to pound targets under a full-moon desert sky, creating the atmosphere of a war.

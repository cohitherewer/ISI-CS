          G.C. SHEKHAR                      Srinivasan                          
	Chennai, April 21: IPL chief Lalit Modi has questioned the authority of Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasan to convene a meeting of the governing council but there is no legal bar on the Tamil Nadu industrialist from discharging his functions as of now.        
	Modi, in an email to BCCI president Shashank Manohar, has accused Srinivasan of being a conflicted party.         
	The BCCI secretary is the managing director of India Cements, which owns the Chennai Super Kings IPL team. His son-in-law Gururaj Meiyappan is the chief executive of the CSK.        
	Srinivasan is also president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.        
	In his email, Modi has questioned Srinivasans authority to convene an IPL governing council meeting because of the conflict of interest.        
	All he (Srinivasan) is actually is an ex-officio member of the council as an office bearer of BCCI and as (sic) he is a conflicted party who owns an IPL team. He has never and can never call a GC meeting, Modi said in the email.        
	Srinivasan, however, won a legal reprieve last month when Madras High Court dismissed an application for an interim stay on his continuation as BCCI secretary. The application, filed by former BCCI president A.C. Muthiah, asked for a stay on Srinivasan from discharging his functions as BCCI secretary since there was a conflict of interest.        
	In September 2008, eight months after the first IPL team auction, the BCCI had amended its rules with retrospective effect that allowed Srinivasans company to bid for the Chennai franchise.         
	Under the original rule, no BCCI administrator could have, directly or indirectly, any commercial interest in matches or events conducted by the board.        
	In December that year, Muthiah, considered Srinivasans opponent in the cricket arena, filed a civil suit in Madras High Court asking it to strike down the BCCI amendment through clause 6.2.4, under which IPL and T20 tournaments were kept out of the purview of the boards regulation.        
	The civil suit is pending before the high court.        
	Muthiah had also filed an application seeking an interim stay on Srinivasan functioning as BCCI secretary till the original suit was heard by the court.         
	However, the high court, in March this year, refused to grant an interim stay against Srinivasans continuance as secretary. It accepted the argument of the BCCIs lawyer that Muthiah was not a member of the board and the clause, being a code of conduct and not a rule, was not amenable to challenge by an individual.        
	Muthiah had argued that the amendment excluding IPL and T20 tournaments from the purview of the BCCIs amended regulation was illegal and opposed to public policy. Muthiahs counsel, Nalini Chidambaram, the wife of Union home minister P. Chidambaram, had argued that the amendment was made only to favour Srinivasan.        
	The high court bench ruled that the question whether the clause could include or exclude certain events could be decided only during the time of the trial of the suit.         
	The bench held that no prima facie case had been made out by Muthiah at this stage to stay the amendment and dismissed the petition.         
	However, it added that the merits and demerits of the clauses could be examined during the hearing on the civil suit.

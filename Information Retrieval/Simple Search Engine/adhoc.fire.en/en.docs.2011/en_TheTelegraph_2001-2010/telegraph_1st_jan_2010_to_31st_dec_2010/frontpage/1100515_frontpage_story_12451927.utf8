          ARCHIS MOHAN                       A near-empty Siliguri street during Friday rsquo;s bandh called by an outfit opposed to Gorkhaland. (Kundan Yolmo )                          
	New Delhi, May 14: The P. Chidambaram-led home ministry has suffered a series of reverses in the past fortnight.        
	The Gorkhaland talks have floundered and the stand-off between Nagaland and Manipur over Naga leader Thuingaleng Muivahs proposed visit to his ancestral village in Manipur continues. The list of failures would become longer if one includes last Saturdays Naxalite attack in Chhattisgarh that left eight jawans dead.        
	But more than the ministrys inadequacies on the Naxalite front, its inability to resolve political crises has come into focus.         
	The most glaring is the situation on the Nagaland-Manipur border  something of the ministrys own making.         
	Law and order and maintenance of public order are state subjects. The Centre cannot steamroller state governments into accepting its diktats, said a senior ministry official. But it is a weak defence. The Centres interlocutor for the Naga talks, R.S. Pandey, and senior ministry officials had acceded to Muivahs wish to visit his village and promised to facilitate the travel.        
	But they got a rude shock when Manipur chief minister Ibobi Singh refused to play ball, even as Muivah camped on the border. Ibobi did not relent despite intervention from Chidambaram. It was surprising the ministry failed to anticipate the opposition.        
	In the ensuing violence between Manipur police and Muivahs supporters, two persons died and many were injured. Even now, Muivahs supporters continue an economic blockade of Manipur, creating a scarcity of essential commodities in the state.         
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillais visit to the two states on Tuesday and Wednesday failed to resolve the impasse.         
	At a meeting of the Congress core committee today, the majority of members felt that the home ministry had mishandled the crisis, sources said. Some leaders said the ministry had miscalculated in giving its assent to Muivahs plan to visit his ancestral village without consulting the Manipur government.                   Muivah in Nagaland rsquo;s Viswema village where he has been camping for the past few days. File picture      
	Others said the ministry should have calculated the risks instead of sending Pillai to the two states for damage control.         
	The BJP, which had supported Chidambaram when he had offered to resign after the Dantewada massacre, said the ministers unilateralism was evident during the Nagaland-Manipur crisis.        
	The episode has negated the gains of the peace talks between the Centre and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), which Muivah leads, and painted Delhi as double-crossers in the Nagas eyes.         
	Even the Gorkhas have started criticising the Centre after the collapse of the May 11 official-level talks in New Delhi. Earlier, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders had met Chidambaram on April 9 and his junior minister Ajay Maken a day later. They had implored the ministers to speak to the Bengal government and negotiate their territorial claims for the interim authority  inclusion of the Dooars, Terai and Siliguri areas under it.         
	But the ministry advised them to strive for a political consensus with the Trinamul Congress and the CPM on their demand. The Bengal government and the states parties want to discuss the issue of territory only after next years Assembly polls.         
	The Morcha said it would pull out of talks for the interim set-up and revive the demand for a Gorkhaland.

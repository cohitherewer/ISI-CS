          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Nov. 26: Chief minister Arjun Munda today ordered the director-general of police (vigilance) to lodge FIRs against co-operative societies registrar Gauri Shankar Prasad, following charges of corruption and defalcation of state funds against the latter.         
	The Central Vigilance Commission had asked the state government for a probe against Prasad with a request to initiate suitable proceedings. Prasad is accused of regularising services of daily wage earners and contract workers at all central co-operative banks without proper procedure and a Rs 10-crore defalcation of farm loans at Central Co-operative Bank, Daltonganj, though these loans were waived by the state government.        
	Other alleged instances of Prasads financial misappropriation include defalcation of seed money granted by the state to borrowers.        
	Munda, while giving the probe order, also asked all state employees to discharge their duties honestly, assuring that while efficiency would be rewarded, those indulging in corruption would be severely punished.        
	In a separate development, the chief minister, as a policy directive, today declared state jobs for an unmarried sister or dependent brother of any policeman killed on duty in anti-Naxalite operations.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 15: A cautious Centre today stepped back to avoid fresh trouble in Parliament by deciding not to introduce a bill that sets a cap on nuclear liability despite mentioning it in the list of business.        
	The primary reason for the embarrassing withdrawal in the Lok Sabha appears to be stiff opposition to the bill from the NDA and the Left in addition to doubts in the minds of principal ally Trinamul Congress.        
	The Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Bill aims to lay down mechanisms and rules for liability claims and payments that might arise because of a nuclear incident and to pave the way for India to join an international liability regime.        
	Although the government claimed the bill had not been introduced because some members questioned the competence of Parliament to enact such a legislation, the numerical uncertainty in the House did influence the decision.        
	The government suspected that the Opposition might insist on a division as parleys to ensure introduction of the bill had drawn a muted response. This is not the first time that a bill has not been introduced after being listed.         
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal and science and technology minister Prithviraj Chavan said the bill was not introduced as some members had misgivings about its provisions and questioned Parliaments legislative competence. The rules say a bill can be stopped at the introductory stage only on ground of legislative competence.        
	Parliaments legislative competence is being questioned on the ground that no cap on compensation can be fixed for an accident when the extent of damage is not known.         
	The Speaker had received around 14 notices in the morning objecting to the bill and some of them referred to legislative competence.        
	Bansal said the bill was anyway supposed to be referred to the standing committee, which could not have taken it up because of its preoccupation with demands for grants during the recess.        
	He asserted that the bill would be introduced after the break and sent to the standing committee, adding that the government did not press for it as there was no urgency. He denied Mamata Banerjee was opposed to the bill.        
	Speculation was rife that the government might opt for an ordinance so that the Prime Minister could show movement on the issue before he embarked on a trip to the US in April. But government sources discounted such a possibility, insisting there was no link between the Prime Ministers US visit and the bill.         
	When Speaker Meira Kumar announced the governments decision not to introduce the bill, L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Yashwant Sinha protested.        
	The parliamentary affairs minister said it was solely the governments prerogative to choose the timing of introducing a bill.

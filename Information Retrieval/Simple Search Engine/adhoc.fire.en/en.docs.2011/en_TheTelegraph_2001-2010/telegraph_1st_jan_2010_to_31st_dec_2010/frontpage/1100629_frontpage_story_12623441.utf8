  - Singh, Obama and shadow of a buddy         MANINI CHATTERJEE                            Manmohan Singh with Barack Obama in Toronto                                         
	Toronto, June 28: For all his charm, grace and intelligence, Barack Obama did not quite make his predecessors grade when he and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met in an atmosphere of great warmth and cordiality here on Sunday evening.        
	Manmohan, who famously told George W. Bush that the people of India deeply love you, assured the US President that a very warm welcome awaited him and his family in India this November.        
	But unlike in the case of buddy Bush, Manmohan refrained from gratuitously offering a billion hearts to Obama on a platter.        
	Of course, given the fact that Obama still evokes more wonderment across the world than Bush ever did, the Prime Minister did describe him as a role model to millions and millions of people and said it had been his personal privilege to enjoy your friendship which I will cherish forever in my life.         
	Obama, known for his oratorical flourish, was far more evocative in his praise for Manmohan. In his opening remarks before the 35-minute bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, Obama said: I said before and I continue to believe that the extraordinary leadership that Prime Minister Singh has provided not just to India, but to the world, has helped us navigate through some very difficult times.         
	Sounding as though he had replaced the Prime Ministers not-so-effective spin doctor, Obama went on to say: And I can tell you that here at the G20, when the Prime Minister speaks, people listen, particularly because of his deep knowledge of economic issues, as well as the fact that he understands that as India rises as a world power, not just a regional power, that it also has enormous responsibilities to work with the rest of the world community around issues of peace and prosperity.         
	Both Afghanistan and Pakistan figured in the talks which primarily focused on the need to give the Indo-US strategic partnership a new thrust, a new meaning, a new content.        
	Briefing the media later, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said both leaders reiterated their common dedication to fight terrorism and co-operate in counter-terrorism. In this context, the two leaders discussed the situation in Afghanistan and the need for stability in the region.         
	As for Pakistan, Obama was very positive on the steps taken by India since the Prime Ministers decision at Thimphu to re-engage Pakistan and see dialogue as the best way forward. The Prime Minister apparently told Obama that he believed dialogue was essential with ones neighbour but it was very important that Pakistan abide by its commitment not to let its territory be used by elements inimical to India. If Pakistan fulfilled this commitment, the relations between the two neighbours were bound to improve.        
	The two leaders also touched upon the ongoing investigations into the activities of David Coleman Headley and both felt that Pakistan must take seriously the revelations made in the course of the investigations.        
	The Obama-Singh meeting was meant to lay the ground for the substantive summit-level talks when the US President comes on the official visit to New Delhi.        
	But the Prime Minister appears to have used the opportunity to underline readiness to shed hostility towards Pakistan, provided Islamabad kept its promise of reining in anti-India terrorism.

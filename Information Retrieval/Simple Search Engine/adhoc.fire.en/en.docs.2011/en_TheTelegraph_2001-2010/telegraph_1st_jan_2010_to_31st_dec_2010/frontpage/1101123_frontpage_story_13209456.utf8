          AMIT GUPTA AMP; PRADUMAN CHOUBEY                                     
	Dhanbad, Nov. 22: Dhanbad deputy commissioner Sunil Kumar Burnwal has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the custody death of Dhirendra Singh after local police failed to come out with a credible explanation ever since his controversial arrest last week for possessing Maoist literature.        
	Burnwal, who has deputed executive magistrate Dinesh Prasad Singh for the job, said he would look into all aspects of the case, right from his detention and then arrest on November 16 by Dhanbad sadar police to his transfer to Barwaddah police station from where he had to be moved to two hospitals before being declared dead next morning.        
	A case of unnatural death has been registered at Barwaddah police station. Dhirendras father, Sunder Singh, has also lodged a complaint case in which he has named four police officers  SP Suman Gupta, Barwaddah OC Sahdev Prasad, Nirsa DSP Shailendra Burnwal and Bhuli officer in-charge Harish Pathak  alleging they had tortured his son to death during questioning.        
	There are several discrepancies in the police case. According to an FIR registered at Barwaddah police station, Dhirendra was arrested under Section 414 of IPC and Section 17 Criminal Law Amendment Act for carrying Maoist posters and possessing a stolen motorcycle.         
	The FIR claimed he was picked up from Memco More during a routine vehicle inspection drive and arrested at Barwaddah, while the police have been claiming he was first detained at sadar police station. The FIR also claimed Dhirendra had confessed he was travelling to Tundi to distribute the Maoist posters calling for a poll boycott.        
	It will take about a week to complete the inquiry. The sequence of events between his arrest and his alleged custodial death will be verified in detail, Burnwal promised, no doubt under pressure from all quarters including Dhirendras family, local MLAs and rights activists who have condemned the police for its silence on the mysterious death of the 30-year-old.        
	A post-mortem was conducted on Dhirendras body by a three-member medical board of Patlipurta Medical College amp; Hospital constituted on the directives of the deputy commissioner. Unconfirmed reports said the post-mortems findings noted that the body bore injury marks, but the police denied such claims, saying they would hand over the report to the magistrate soon.        
	A local unit of Peoples Union for Civil Liberties sent an SOS to National Human Right Commission, asking it to intervene in the case.

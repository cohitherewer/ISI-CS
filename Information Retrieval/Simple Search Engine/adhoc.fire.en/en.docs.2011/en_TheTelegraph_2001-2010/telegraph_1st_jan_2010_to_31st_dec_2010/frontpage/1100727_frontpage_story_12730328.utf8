	Ranchi, July 26: As many as six government inspection bungalows located at major industrial towns and mining hubs of Jharkhand are being transformed into swanky hotels or rest houses in a private-public partnership, which if successful, could become the benchmark of similar projects to woo the high-end tourist or business traveller.        
	Owned by the state road construction department, the bungalows that are going to be spruced up into high-end business hotels or moderately-priced budget hotels or transit apartments are in Jamshedpur (two), Dhanbad, Bokaro, Chas and Hazaribagh.        
	The development agency for the project is Jharkhand Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (JINFRA), a 50:50 joint venture company set up by the state and Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services (IL amp;FS).         
	State road construction secretary N.N. Sinha said the bungalows, most of them occupying large areas in important industrial zones, were being grossly under-utilised.        
	This project will give a major facelift to them and also ensure revenue for the state, he told The Telegraph. Prospective developers would be expected to prepare detailed designs for rebuilding the bungalows and provide a list of financial and construction requirements.         
	According to sources, the road construction department plans to lease/transfer the inspection bungalows, along with necessary rights, to selected developers through an appropriate lease agreement.                                       
	Thereafter, the developer will be expected to operate, maintain and market the properties during the authorisation period of around 30 years.         
	A pre-bid meeting of interested parties has been scheduled for August 2 at the office of the secretary of the road construction department.         
	The department has fixed certain criteria for developers. Interested companies should have a minimum of three years experience in operating/ running at least two hotels or resorts.        
	Alternatively, they could have a tie-up with a reputed entity operating in the hospitality sector.         
	Companies that have experience in running hotels and resorts recognised by Indian Tourism Development Corporation, state tourism department or any other competent government authority would also be eligible to bid.        
	Preferences would be given to those with experience in handling properties rated three-star or above.        
	A senior IL amp;FS official said under the project, the state would not have to spend anything.               
	Moreover, government officials who have been using these at nominal costs would be given preferential accommodation at discounted rates, he added.        
	The road construction department is confident that developers, who needed to spend crores to renovate these bungalows that were lying in a state of neglect, would recover their costs as all the bungalows were strategically located in busy industrial areas.        
	If the first batch of six bungalows shapes up well as hospitality hubs, the state would not be averse to developing others on similar lines.

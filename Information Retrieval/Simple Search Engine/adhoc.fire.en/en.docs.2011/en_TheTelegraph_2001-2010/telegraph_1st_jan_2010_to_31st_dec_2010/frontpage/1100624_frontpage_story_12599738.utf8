The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nikki wins Republican vote for governor race

	Washington, June 23: Nikki Haley won the Republican nomination for governor of South Carolina yesterday, a commanding victory that elevates her to become one of the leading faces of the national Republican Party.        
	Representative Bob Inglis, a six-term Republican from South Carolina, was defeated in a runoff election. He became the fifth incumbent congressman or senator to be turned out of office in the latest round of primaries that have upended the mid-term election year.        
	Republicans also nominated Tim Scott in his bid to become South Carolinas first black Republican member of Congress in more than a century. He handily defeated Paul Thurmond, son of the late Senator Strom Thurmond.         
	For all the unexpected turns of this mid-term election cycle, few campaigns have produced as much drama as the Republican governors race in South Carolina. With nearly all precincts reporting, Haley led Representative Gresham Barrett, a four-term congressman, 65 per cent to 35 per cent.        
	Haley, a first-generation American of Indian descent, would also become the first member of a racial minority to be governor of South Carolina. She overcame allegations about infidelity in her marriage, ethnic slurs and questions about her religious background.        
	This is a really great night because South Carolina just showed the rest of the country what were made of, Haley said, delivering a victory speech to supporters in Columbia, South Carolina.        
	Haley, 38, rose in the polls by promising to break an entrenched network that has dominated state politics for decades. She portrayed the unsubstantiated charges of sexual affairs as retaliation for taking on special interests.        
	In the general election, Haley faces the Democratic nominee, Vincent Sheheen, who won his primary on June 8. Republican candidates in South Carolina hold a considerable advantage in the general election, and even Democratic leaders in the state concede that something unforeseen would have to unfold for Haley not to win in November.        
	The two are competing to succeed Governor Mark Sanford, a Republican, who confessed to having an extramarital affair with an Argentine woman last year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kharsawan on Munda lips, final call likely today
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Kharsawan on Munda lips, final call likely today
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamshedpur, Nov. 6: Chief minister Arjun Munda is playing his cards close to his chest on the question of choosing a seat that will enable him to become a member of the state Assembly.        
	Two choices are doing the rounds: Hatia and Kharsawan. The former being pushed for by the BJP for reasons of beefing up MLA numbers, the latter is a turf not unfamiliar to the chief minister, having represented it thrice as MLA.        
	The Jamshedpur MP, who treated guests to Kali puja bhog at his residence here today, is visiting Kharsawan tomorrow, fuelling speculation he might announce his candidature from that seat.        
	Asked, he preferred to keep things vague, saying he had left it to the people of Kharsawan to decide if they wanted him as their representative or not.        
	Public chahegi to Kharsawan se chunav ladenge. Hum to wahan ke sevak hain. Dekhte jaiye kya hota hain (If people want I will contest from Kharsawan. I have worked for them before), Munda said.        
	Kharsawan legislator Mangal Singh Soy has announced that he would vacate his seat for Munda, who represented the seat first as a JMM MLA in 1995 and then as a BJP legislator in 2000 and 2005.        
	The Hatia seat fell vacant after the death of Congress legislator Gopal Sharan Nath Shadeo. BJP wants Munda to contest from Hatia, so that it can add one more seat to its tally of 18.        
	However, Munda protg Soy feels Kharsawan, the chief ministers home turf, will be a safer option.        
	It may be a good idea to wrest one more seat for the party, but I have my reservations. Contesting from Hatia may prove to be risky. Why take a risk when the people of Kharsawan are prepared to welcome him with open arms? Soy asked.        
	Elections in Jharkhand can be risky as JMM patriarch Shibu Soren learnt the hard way when he was defeated by relative unknown Raj Peter in Tamar in January 2009, losing his chief ministership and leading to the imposition of Presidents Rule in the state.        
	Munda, who took over as chief minister on September 11, has to become a member of the Assembly within six months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | If you hit the bottle, state can drown its fiscal sorrows

	Calcutta, Nov. 15: Jyoti Basu jealously guarded Bengal from the lure of liquor for over 27 years, but his hand-picked finance minister, Asim Dasgupta, is banking on binge drinking to bail the government out of near-bankruptcy.        
	In a desperate attempt to shore up revenue collections, the state finance department today issued a circular giving over 1,900 country liquor shops in Bengal a supplementary licence to sell rum. The government also raised the excise rates from 40 to 45 per cent on all sizes of liquor bottles priced up to Rs 266.        
	Increasing excise on liquor and allowing sale of rum from country liquor shops were probably the only two options left for the finance minister to improve this years overall tax collections, said an economist.        
	Insiders in the state finance department are aware that Dasgupta often rues how Bengal  with a paltry excise earning of Rs 1,077.64 crore  lags behind states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh in excise collections.        
	Data available with the state finance department show that Bengal has fewer foreign liquor outlets and lower density. (See chart)        
	The anaemic spread of booze shops need not be seen as a laudable sign of abstention or lack of demand. Rather, it can be traced to Basus tenure as the chief minister of the state for 27 years.        
	The government had introduced several stringent conditions  other than the standard prohibition on liquor shops within 500 metres of religious places and academic institutions  and the excise authorities used to sit on applications for liquor licences for years.         
	It was made clear in those days that the government was not interested in issuing liquor licences, said a senior government official.        
	Some officials attributed the attitude to the discomfiture of the Left to be seen as promoting the use of alcohol and an aversion to such beverages among the Bengali middle class. However, in communist cousin Kerala, Left governments have done little to move away from overdependence on excise revenue from liquor.        
	The policy followed in the Basu era, however, has come back to haunt the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, which has a cumulative debt burden of around Rs 1.69 lakh crore (as on March 31, 2010).         
	Excise, an indirect tax on manufactured goods that producers generally pass on to consumers, is a significant source of revenue for state governments and collections from liquor form a sizeable chunk.        
	These are difficult times and there is no point in sticking to the earlier practice of following stringent conditions for issuing liquor licences. During the tenure of Basu, the government wanted to control the number of liquor shops, a government official said.         
	The official took note of the destructive powers of alcohol but pointed out that in the absence of licensed shops, those who want to drink opt for the far more hazardous spurious varieties.        
	Bottles priced up to Rs 266 generate around 60 per cent of the revenues from liquor and so we can expect a handsome increase in the collections. The sale of rum from country liquor shops will also boost the revenues, an excise official said.        
	Retailers and distributors estimated that the price per bottle would go up between Rs 6 and Rs 20. ( )

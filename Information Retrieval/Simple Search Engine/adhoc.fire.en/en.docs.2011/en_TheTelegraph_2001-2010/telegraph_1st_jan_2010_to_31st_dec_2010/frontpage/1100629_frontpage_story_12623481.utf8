                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Stolen: Rahuls cell, others sleep 
  - Airport theft gives anxious moments to status-seekers of the capital           NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND RASHEED KIDWAI                             Rahul Gandhi                                        
	New Delhi, June 28: Rahul Gandhi has fallen prey to cellphone theft at an airport, a travel hazard that has raised the usual security questions and thrown some Congress supporters into an unusual tizzy.        
	The Congress general secretarys phone was filched allegedly by a baggage handler at Indira Gandhi International Airport on June 24 after the young MP returned from Dubai, sources said.        
	The phone was part of the check-in baggage and was suspected to have been taken away by the handler. A suspect was picked up by the Special Protection Group (SPG) after a search at his home which yielded the phone, the sources said. No case has been registered yet.        
	This is not the first time that baggage handlers at airports have been accused of opening bags and helping themselves to gadgets. But the latest incident has brought under the glare the usual whipping boy when things go wrong: outsourcing. Airlines normally outsource baggage-handling to other companies.        
	A security angle has also been added as regulations demand that at least one SPG officer should be around to supervise when such bags are taken from the aircraft to the terminal. The theft is thought to have taken place during this leg.        
	If someone can open the bag and steal something, then something can be put into the bag also, said a source in a security agency.        
	The security lapse has caused concern in the Congress circle but so has another factor. Some Congress leaders are now worried that Rahul may change his number and they may not be among the lucky few to be given the new key to his ear.        
	Many cabinet ministers, Congress Working Committee members and politicians of various hues do not consider themselves on the A-list unless they can discreetly spice conversations with the little detail that they have Rahuls number. There have been instances when a formal acknowledgement or customary greeting from the leader was circulated by the proud recipient among friends as recognition of an exalted status.         
	Bollywood, too, has envisaged interest in Rahuls chota phone. An actress who counts some cricketers among her friends had tried hard to reach out but the Rahul camp deftly spurned these overtures.

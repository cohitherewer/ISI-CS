										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta, March 25: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacherjee today held aloft as an eye-opener one of the worst-kept secrets in the state: A vicious circle involving a section of the administration and realtors does exist.        
	The revelation came after a barrage of questions on the fire at Stephen Court on Park Street from a hostile Congress in the Assembly.        
	The chief minister sought to reassure the Opposition by asserting that the vicious circle now has to be dealt with firmly  more or less echoing the sentiments he had expressed two years ago when the Nandram highrise caught fire.        
	January 2008: NANDRAM FIRE  
	I am feeling angry. You know how these buildings have come up  
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Jan. 13  
	March 2010: STEPHEN COURT FIRE  
	A vicious circle involving a section of the administration and realtors has to be dealt with firmly  
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on March 25     
	Between Nandram and Stephen Court, little has changed. In fact, Nandram still stands tall as a symbol of defiance of the building laws and a testimony to the blessings it had received from all parties.          
	Today, Calcuttans ranging from politicians to officials expressed doubts whether the government would summon the courage to take the political risk of ordering steps needed to break the vicious circle.         
	The only difference is the smouldering anger the Park Street tragedy has fuelled among large sections of the people.        
	Many felt that the chief minister was making the right noises only because of the coming civic polls. They think electoral reverses have made the government far too vulnerable to take any bold step.         
	If Bhattacharjee was keeping an eye on the polls, he rose to the occasion today. Who is the owner of the building? the chief minister thundered in the Assembly. How were the two new floors added to the building? They were totally illegal. Who broke the law? The devastating fire in the heart of the city is an eye-opener for us.         
	The answers will take the questioner back to 1984, when the CMC was run by the Jyoti Basu government.  
	But the chief minister did admit that he was not completely in the dark about the murky developments. I am well aware of such things because I had shouldered the responsibility of the department for some time, said Bhattacharjee, who was the urban development minister from 1987 to 1993.        
	Then, he wondered aloud: Who was at the helm at the municipal corporation then (in 1984, when two floors of Stephen Court were regularised by the civic authorities).        
	In 1984, a government-appointed administrator was running the CMC  the CPM formed the board the following year.        
	Officials said the fact that the Marxists had been in power at the CMC for most of the period since then had prevented the government from taking the firm action Bhattacharjee promised today.         
	These illegal activities are mostly the handiwork of his own partymen and officials, who are in league with the CPM, an official said. The government did not, or could not, do anything when it was powerful. How can it do anything now?        
	They cited the example of Nandram Market, where the civic authorities have been unable to demolish illegal floors for the past two years.        
	Calcutta mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: I should not comment on what the chief minister has said. But it is for the administration to conduct an inquiry to find out whether such a nexus exists. If the chief minister has said so, let the facts come to the surface through a probe.        
	Former mayor and Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee said Bhattacharjees utterances were simply pre-poll rhetoric.       
	But urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya hit the nail on its head. All parties have a stake in this nexus, Bhattacharya said. So unless there is a consensus, nothing can be done.

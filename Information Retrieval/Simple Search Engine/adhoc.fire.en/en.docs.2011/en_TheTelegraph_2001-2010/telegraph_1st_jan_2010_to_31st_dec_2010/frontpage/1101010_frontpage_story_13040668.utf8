  - Archbishop of Canterbury fulfils desire to see Calcutta, begins visit with stop at Mother House          MOHUA DAS                                                    
	Calcutta, Oct. 9: The Archbishop of Canterbury, the principal leader of the Church of England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion, made Mother House his first stop today before dwelling on the Ayodhya dispute and the caning of schoolchildren during an interaction at St Johns Diocesan Girls High School later in the evening.        
	I have followed with great interest the discussion on Ayodhya and the recent court decision. Im glad to see that the way it was received was very peaceful. Its a very complicated story but I am relieved that there has been resolution without violence, said Rowan Williams, the highest-ranking non-royal in the United Kingdom and a member of the House of Lords.        
	The Calcutta visit marks the beginning of his two-week mission of goodwill trip to India for the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Church of North India (CNI). The CNI is part of the Anglican Communion that Rowan Williams heads.        
	Calcutta was a particularly important place in my mind to visit, said Williams, offering his blessings for the Puja season to the people of the city. This is an important year since it marks the 150th year of Tagores birth and Mother Teresas birth centenary.         
	I wished to spend time in Calcutta, Delhi and Ranchi, so in a way I could have started out in any of the places, but I have long wished to visit Calcutta having known of its history for a long time. I remember as a student, I learnt of the work that was done among poor people here by the clergy at St Pauls Cathedral and was much inspired by that.        
	On the attacks on the Christian community in some parts of the country, the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury said: Im concerned, as Id be concerned about any act of violence. This is not what India is about, as a culture, civilisation or as a modern state.         
	Asked to comment on a recent controversy about caning of children in schools run by the Church, Williams chose not to say anything about issues being discussed in the law but did emphasise that he was very glad that India, like England, does not legally permit the caning of children.                    
	Earlier in the day, he spent half an hour at Mother House and an hour at Shishu Bhavan. I must say that I am deeply grateful to God for giving me the opportunity to meet you and pay my respects to Mother, said the Archbishop in his address to the Sisters in white and blue. At Shishu Bhavan, he gifted the home for abandoned children a wooden wall-hanging with a picture of The Last Supper and a photograph of himself. Its been deeply moving to be here, he said, allowing the kids to tug at his beard, pinch his nose and play with his Cross.        
	The joy that was evident there, I believe, is a response to something very deep in the whole life of this city, not only today but through the ages. Calcutta is known as the City of Joy so its very moving to see that joy and love at work, Williams later said.        
	He told us he was very happy with our work, with what we are doing for the children. It was a great honour and privilege to have him here, said Sister Prema of the Missionaries of Charity. Williams also had a closed-door meeting with some victims of trafficking. Its a major priority for our Church worldwide to raise the profile of the issue of women who are trafficked and abused, he said at the cultural reception at St Johns Diocesan Girls High School that was attended by city priests and school principals.

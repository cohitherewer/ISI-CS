                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                SAIL mining lease renewal 
          AMIT GUPTA                                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 22: The state mines department has finally decided to renew three iron ore mining leases of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) in West Singhbhum district, a proposal which is pending since the time of unified Bihar.        
	The move will boost the public sector undertakings expansion drive. SAIL is planning to increase steel production across its units in Jharkhand besides going for tie-ups with Posco and Kobe.         
	However, the decision has to be cleared by the state cabinet.        
	This will be renewal-cum-amalgamation. Lease I, II and III of Kiriburu-Meghataburu will be merged together as the mining areas continue in a stretch, state mines director B.B. Singh told The Telegraph.         
	He added that the proposal, originally moved by the office of West Singhbhum district mining officer, had been sent to the cabinet co-ordination department for approval of the council of ministers.        
	State mines secretary N.N. Sinha confirmed the development, adding that renewal of these leases had been pending since early 90s.         
	SAIL and its merged subsidiary IISCO (Burnpur) together hold 11 iron ore mining leases in Jharkhand. Out of these, two mines in Chiria (Ajitaburu and Sukrilatur) and one in Gua (Jhilingburu-I) are locked in litigation.         
	The other leases, which are under deemed extension and are awaiting renewal, are leases I, II and III of Kiriburu-Meghataburu, Budaburu and Dhobil of Chiria and Jhilingburu and Topailor of Gua.         
	SAIL is already working to enhance its steel production in Jharkhand from 5.2 million tonne per annum (MTPA) to 29 MTPA. It has started increase the capacity of the Bokaro steel plant to 7.5 MTPA.        
	Besides, the PSU is also in final stages of negotiations with Korea-based steel giant Posco and Japans Kobe for joint ventures, which will ensure quality steel production by using low-grade iron ores. According to reports, Posco will be allotted space in Bokaro Steel while Kobe will use SAILs facilities in Durgapur, Bengal.        
	On September 15, the new managing director of Bokaro Steel Limited, Shashi Shekhar Mohanty, met chief minister Arjun Munda.         
	Sources said Mohanty appraised Munda about SAILs future plan in Jharkhand, including expansion of Bokaro Steel and other units.         
	Sources at West Singhbhum district mining office in Chaibasa said SAIL was undertaking mining activities in Durgaiburu and lease III of Kiriburu-Meghataburu area while the rest of the mines are lying abandoned.         
	This apart, several other mines, which were earlier held by IISCO, are locked in litigation in the Supreme Court.         
	The bone of contention is the Jharkhand government wants to allot a part (to be precise depending on the exact requirement) of the mining area to SAIL and the remaining portion to prospective mega-sector private investors, who have lined up to start mining and steel production in the state.

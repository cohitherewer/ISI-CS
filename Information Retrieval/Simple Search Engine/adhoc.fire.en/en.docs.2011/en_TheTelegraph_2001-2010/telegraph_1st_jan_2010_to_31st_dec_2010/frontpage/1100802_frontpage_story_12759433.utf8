                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Months of rail wagon vacuum
          SAMBIT SAHA AND SANJAY MANDAL                            Mamata Banerjee                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: Mamata Banerjee may be courting the workers of the wagon-building industry, based largely in Bengal, but their factories have been waiting in vain for orders from the railways for the past two years.        
	In this period, Mamata has presented two railway budgets, each of which proposed to procure 18,000 wagons.        
	At the heart of the problem, industry sources said, is a letter four wagon-makers wrote to the railways, saying no orders should be placed with the Rajasthan-based Cimmco Birla Ltd, revived recently under a Board for Industrial amp; Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) scheme.        
	With the letter raising certain legal issues relating to the tender criteria, ministry officials apparently went into a flap. The railways have since refrained from placing orders for wagons despite  according to sources  a law ministry go-ahead to do so.        
	Some of the blame may lie with the railway bureaucrats for betraying a tendency to play safe and let things drift rather than take a decision that could later become a legal issue or a controversy. But the situation also raises the question how much of leadership Mamata is providing her ministry at a time she is being mocked by critics as an absentee minister, pre-occupied with Bengal politics.        
	For instance, Mamata had been crowing in June after the Centre cleared a railway takeover of two Bengal wagon-makers that together have 1,500 workers: the sick Burn Standard and the reviving Braithwaite.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief immediately cleared ad hoc  orders for a handful of wagons (about 500 to 750 each) for these in-house companies. She told Braithwaite employees at their Calcutta factory: You will get so many orders you wont be able to finish.        
	Apart from this, railway sources said, the ministry had not placed a single order for wagons after August 2008 when Lalu Prasad headed the utility. Mamata took over in May 2009.        
	The 36,000 orders for the two financial years would be worth about Rs 4,500 crore to the industry.        
	Most wagon-makers such as Texmaco, Titagarh Wagon and Besco are, therefore, operating at less than half their capacities, working to meet the few orders for private wagons from big companies or manufacturing other railway equipment. A company listed on the stock exchange has told shareholders that its performance has been affected by the lack of railway orders.        
	Its not too late to place the orders for the 18,000 wagons meant to be procured this financial year, but the orders for the last fiscal are long overdue. The orders are usually placed within three months of a budget presentation. So, the orders for Mamatas July 2009 budget should have come by October or November, and that for her February budget this year by May-June.        
	The price bid for the 2009 orders had been called in end-January this year, thereby opening the tender process, but no order has been placed.        
	Railway officials admitted the delay in procurement, which can potentially hobble freight movement  the railways main revenue earner. They blamed it on problems related to the tendering process.        
	The finalisation of tenders has been delayed and the ministry is extremely concerned with the situation, said Sanjiv Handa, member (mechanical), the Railway Board.        
	There has been some unforeseen and unprecedented complications. We didnt want to cancel the tenders, which would have delayed things further.        
	He expressed hope that the orders under the 2009 budget would be placed soon.        
	Industry sources said the tender process was delayed after the objection to orders being placed with Cimmco, earlier owned by the Birlas and now jointly owned by S.K. Birla and the Calcutta-based Titagarh Wagons. Cimmco, once a market leader, was locked out in late 2000 before being revived last year.        
	The objectors cited the tender criterion that the previous five years performance should be taken into account  a period during which Cimmco had been closed  and said they had taken legal opinion.        
	Cimmco contended that the BIFR had stated that the performance of the past five working years should be the yardstick, an argument the law ministry apparently found acceptable when the railway ministry consulted it.        
	Cimmco has alleged that the companies that had written to the railways are non-performers and do not care about the delay they are causing since they are already saddled with old and undelivered orders.        
	The railway ministry has missed its wagon procurement target every year since 2005. Only two, Texmaco and Titagarh Wagons  the latter now the joint promoter of Cimmco  have come close to meeting their delivery commitments.

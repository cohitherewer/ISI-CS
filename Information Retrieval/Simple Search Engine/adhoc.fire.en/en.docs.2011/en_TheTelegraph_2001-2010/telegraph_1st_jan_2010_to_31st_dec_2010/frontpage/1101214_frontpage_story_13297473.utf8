The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Munda for lokayukta with more teeth

          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 13: Chief minister Arjun Munda is planning to bring his own office within the ambit of the lokayukta, having already finalised a new man for the post that has been lying vacant in Jharkhand for over a year now.        
	According to high-level sources, a collegium comprising leader of Opposition Rajendra Prasad Singh and the chief minister had cleared Justice (retired) Amareshwar Sahay for the job a couple of days ago.         
	Indicating his commitment to fight corruption, Munda said his government would now move to amend the Jharkhand Lokayukta Act, 2001, to include the office of the chief minister within the ambit.        
	The law will be amended later on. (But) We should first fill the post of lokayukta, lying vacant for a year, he told The Telegraph.        
	Under the act, the lokayukta is appointed by the government in consultation with the leader of Opposition and the chief justice of Jharkhand High Court.        
	The Jharkhand Lokayukta Act empowers the lokayukta to order investigations against ministers, secretaries and other public servants, but he only has powers to recommend action against guilty officers.        
	But, in comparison to, say, the lokayukta of Karnataka, the states anti-corruption watchdog has had no impact in Jharkhand known for its scams, the most significant of them being the disproportionate assets cases being pursued against former chief minister Madhu Koda and a few of his former cabinet colleagues.         
	In Jharkhand, the office of the lokayukta has been crippled with lack of adequate manpower since its inception. The post of secretary, to be held by a judicial officer of the rank of additional district judge, has also been lying vacant since January 2009.         
	But the lokayukta in Karnataka is a highly efficient and effective institution that is empowered to investigate cases against a chief minister, besides ministers, MLAs, state government officials, chairman, vice-chairman of local authorities, statutory bodies or corporations, including co-operative societies.         
	Born on October 10, 1948, Sahay retired as Jharkhand High Court judge on October 10.         
	He is now tipped to take up the Jharkhand lokayuktas post that has been lying vacant for over a year since Lakshman Uraon retired on December 4 last year.        
	The lokayuktas office has been one of the most neglected ones in the state. Against 34 sanctioned posts, only 13 are occupied.

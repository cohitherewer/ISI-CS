  - Left focuses attack on committee, not Chinese laureate          J.P. YADAV                       Liu Xiaobo with his wife Liu Xia. File picture                                
	Oct. 10: Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo broke down in jail today when his wife finally managed to visit him but dont expect the comrades of China to betray such bourgeois emotions.        
	The CPM has chosen to remain largely inscrutable on the Nobel Peace Prize choice that has infuriated Beijing, not yet parroting the withering language China has used to refer to the democracy campaigner.        
	To be sure, some Left leaders have criticised the Nobel committee for politicising the award, although the CPM and the CPI have so far refrained from issuing official statements.         
	But the Lefts reluctance to call Liu names like criminal  the official word handpicked by Beijing  reflected its nervousness at being tagged anti-democratic, a label that doesnt sit pretty when elections have to be fought.        
	The tiptoe points to the sticky predicament the prize poses for the Indian communist leadership: how to echo China without stirring uncomfortable questions among fellow travellers and champions of countless causes about the fetters on basic freedoms behind the Great Wall.                    
	Indian Left leaders are largely focusing on whipping the Nobel committee, skirting tricky questions like the 11-year sentence on the literary critic for subversion and the inability of his wife to meet him till today.        
	Allowed to meet his wife Liu Xia on Sunday, Liu told her in tears that he was dedicating the award to victims of a 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. Tianenmen has always been a sore point for Indian communists who could never convincingly explain to the generation of the 1990s why tanks had to be sent in to crush demonstrators seeking political reforms.        
	The uneasiness showed today, too. The anti-China lobby is at work and it has been done at the instance of the US that is out to disrupt China. The peace prize is to encourage anti-China activities, the leader of CPM in the Lok Sabha, Basudeb Acharia, told The Telegraph. Acharia, however, refused to field any other question on the issue.         
	CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta questioned the decision of the Nobel committee but refused to react to the imprisonment of Liu.        
	Dasgupta picked on a technical point. It is more a political decision. A person who works for reduction of international tension and end of conflict should be given such award. But this person is a human rights activist. How can he be given this award? he asked.        
	Another leader cited politicisation  a catch-all word that could be a virtue as well as a vice in the shifting sands of public life. CPM central committee member Nilotpal Basu said his party was not reacting as it believed the Nobel Peace Prize had become too politicised.        
	Not that the CPM does not officially react to matters Chinese. The CPM had spoken about China in the political resolution the party adopted at the extended central committee meeting at Vijayawada in August. The resolution said the economic power of the US was declining while that of China was growing.         
	Why the communists were reluctant to swivel the arc lights to the persecution of Liu was evident from the misgivings among the Left intelligentsia. The Left-leaning China expert, Prof. C.P. Bhambhri, criticised the Nobel committees decision but termed Beijings reaction foolish. The way China has reacted is foolish, They should ignore the US, he said.         
	Marxist economist Prabhat Patnaik declined to react on the ground that the prize had nothing to with economics.         
	Where the CPM was reluctant to tread, the Trinamul Congress waded in with gusto. It is very sad that a person who was awarded this years Nobel Peace Prize remains imprisoned in China. All freedom-loving people should condemn the Chinese governments inhuman treatment to Liu, said Saugata Roy, Trinamul junior minister for urban development. Asked if this was his partys stand, he replied in the affirmative.         
	If the CPM was uncharacteristically restrained, the Congress could not hide its glee, though the ruling party took care not to say anything that could affect bilateral relations.        
	 The Nobel Peace Prize is a very prestigious award. The selection committee comprises of distinguished people. They must have applied their mind in the selection, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said.         
	The UPA government is also said to be sharing this opinion but it is unlikely to articulate such a position and nettle China.        
	Other than the Left, most parties in the Northeast applauded the peace prize choice  their reaction suggesting few are shedding tears over Chinas discomfiture.        
	Asom Gana Parishad vice-president Apurba Bhattacharjee said: Being citizens of a great democracy like India, we see it (the choice for the peace prize) a very positive development.         
	The prize has also injected a sense of optimism among the Tibetan community in the hills and in Sikkim.         
	The prize has been announced at a time a perception has been growing that the international community was putting economic pragmatism above moral values while dealing with China.        
	Students for a Free Tibet (SFT), a community of Tibetan students, echoed this sentiment. At a time when world leaders are softening their approach to human rights and Tibet with the Chinese government, the Norwegian Nobel Committees decision is highly commendable, an email from the SFT said.

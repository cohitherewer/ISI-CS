  - NIGHT OF SCREAMS DAY OF SHOCK                            The derailed Jnaneswari Express at Rajabandh in West Midnapore; a womans hand sticks out from under a crushed bogie. Pictures by Amit Datta				                                       
	An express train was thrown off tracks and rammed by an oncoming goods train in Maoist-active West Midnapore at 1.25am on Friday, triggering Bengals worst train tragedy blamed on an act of subversion.        
	Eighty-one people died  at least one family has lost all its members  as the red goods carrier crashed into the blue express and reduced four bogies into mangled coffins. Survivors recounted a night of screams and chaos.         
	Many were trapped alive, some crying out but dying before rescuers could cut through the steel.        
	Opinion differed on the cause  an explosion or track-tampering  but it is more or less certain that the tragedy was the result of deliberate human intervention.

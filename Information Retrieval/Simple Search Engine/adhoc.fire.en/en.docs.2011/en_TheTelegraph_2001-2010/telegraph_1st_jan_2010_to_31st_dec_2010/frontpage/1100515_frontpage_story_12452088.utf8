                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sonia nuances approach
          SANJAY K. JHA                             Sonia and Chidambaram                          
	New Delhi, May 14: Sonia Gandhi has said the root causes of Naxalism should be addressed along with decisive and forceful responses to acts of terror, articulating the need for a holistic approach at a time the Congress is debating the sagacity of the action-first line associated with home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	Our country is facing an enormous challenge from the Naxalites. While we must address acts of terror decisively and forcefully, we have to address the root causes of Naxalism. The rise of Naxalism is a reflection of the need for our development initiatives to reach the grassroots, especially in our most backward tribal districts, the Congress president said in a letter to party workers in the latest issue of its organ, the Sandesh.        
	The critics of the line tied to Chidambaram lapped up her letter, claiming they were asking for such an articulation in place of the wipe-them-out rhetoric. The reference to the root causes does reflect an opinion within the Congress that favours a nuanced approach.        
	However, by using phrases such as acts of terror and words like decisively and forcefully, Sonia has sought to ensure that her opinion is not construed as a show of no-confidence in Chidambarams approach which has the full backing of influential voices in the government.        
	The wipe-them-out line was taken by the party itself; the official spokesperson made that demand in the wake of the Dantewada massacre in which 75 CRPF jawans were killed.         
	Although the tough posturing was hailed by the BJP and the CPM, dissenting voices emerged from within the Congress.        
	The debate mirrors the differences between what came to be known as the wets and dries when Margaret Thatcher was in power in Britain. If the Iron Lady had to contend with wets  those in her Tory government who opposed her line and supported policies like increased public spending  the Congress has its own share of liberals.        
	Leaders like Digvijay Singh, Ajit Jogi, K. Keshava Rao and Mani Shankar Aiyar have openly expressed their concerns on the stress on police action.        
	While Digvijay talked of Chidambarams rigidity and intellectual arrogance, Keshava Rao said the problem was of perception as the battle could not be fought without winning over the tribal population.        
	Two schools of thought exist on what prompted these lieutenants to speak out. One believes that they would not have spoken out without the tacit approval of the party leadership that may have wanted to test the waters. The other feels that these leaders were trying to curry favour with the leadership, hoping to appeal to Sonias well-known inclination for inclusiveness.        
	Sonia has now somewhat revealed her mind; she has supported tough action but sought to alter the discourse to send out a message that the government is responsive, not hostile.         
	This is the fine distinction, some Congress leaders said, the home ministry could not project even as the security establishment agreed on the need for development.        
	Sonia had wholeheartedly supported Chidambaram when he was giving his reply in the Lok Sabha, indicating that she did not intend to weaken the governments resolve.         
	The slightly different tenor and content of her communication with the party workers cannot be taken as a condemnation of the governments administrative actions.        
	Sources admitted there were misgivings about the home ministrys packaging of the approach but said there was no fundamental difference or contradiction between the party and the government.         
	Chidambaram, too, had said that the government had not lost sight of the socio-economic aspect but asserted that development was not possible without clearing the areas held by the Naxalites.        
	Replying to the debate in Parliament, he had said: Dont think the adversary will let you do development. They target infrastructure, they target schools and communication towers.

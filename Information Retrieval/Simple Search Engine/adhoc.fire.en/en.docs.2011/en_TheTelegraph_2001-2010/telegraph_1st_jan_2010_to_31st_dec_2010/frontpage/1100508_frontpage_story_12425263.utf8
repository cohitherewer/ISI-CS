The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP trashes JMM wishlist   Party not willing to share power
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                BJP trashes JMM wishlist     Party not willing to share power
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, LK Advani, Gopinath Munde and Rajnath Singh in New Delhi on Friday                                        
	New Delhi, May 7: The BJP today rejected the JMM demand of sharing the Jharkhand chief ministers post on a rotational 50:50 formula.        
	The move would have entailed a government to be headed by a BJP chief minister for half of the remaining term and by one from the JMM for the other half.        
	A senior BJP leader speaking on condition of anonymity said his party was not enthusiastic about forming the government in Jharkhand. He said stability was of prime importance and it was nowhere in sight in the present scenario.        
	In the past, the BJP had experimented with the arrangement the JMM was proposing, in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, where it was in a coalition with the BSP and the Janata Dal (Secular) respectively. Both times, it bit the dust. In Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati, who was the chief minister for the first half of the government tenure, pulled out of the coalition when it was time to hand over power to the BJP. The Dal (Secular), led by the father-son pair of H.D. Deve Gowda and H.D. Kumaraswamy, similarly refused to redeem their promise to the BJP.        
	The political implications of this power-sharing structure played out differently for the BJP: It paid a price in Uttar Pradesh for being outsmarted by a Dalit woman and lost its pre-eminence in legislative politics. In Karnataka, B.S. Yeddyurappa projected himself as a martyr of the Gowda-Kumaraswamy machinations and got a thundering mandate in the last elections from an emotionally charged electorate.        
	Bitten so many times, we are not ready to burn our fingers again, a senior leader said.                          
	It is learnt that the JMM also insisted the BJP should have one of its tribal MLAs as the chief minister and not an MP  a pre-condition that irritated its leaders who were palpably impatient with the JMMs tendency to play big brother to a mainstream party.        
	The JMM-Ajsu delegation had two rounds of meetings with the BJP, both at the residence of Rajnath Singh who is Nitin Gadkaris pointperson. Gadkari, the BJP president, flew down from Goa for three hours or so for the meeting that was also attended by his partys representatives from Jharkhand.        
	The demands were reportedly not placed in the first session. The JMM leaders appeared so reasonable that we concluded that things had fallen in place and an announcement could be made on Friday or Saturday, a general secretary said.        
	This morning, the JMM-Ajsu opened their cards and upset the BJPs applecart. Things dont look that positive now, admitted a Rajnath aide.        
	However, he was not prepared to call it quits because Rajnath and to an extent, Gadkari  for whom Jharkhand is the first big test of political acumen and skills  stand to lose a lot if the coalition ended abruptly with the BJP returning empty-handed.        
	Sources claimed in this exercise of intense bargaining with a tough customer (the JMM), adopting a slightly tough posture might help the BJP. Their reading was the Congress was unlikely to play ball with the Sorens. If the Congress jumped into the game, the JMM might be vulnerable to a split in which case the Sorens might find themselves high and dry if the party managed to cobble up the numbers minus them.        
	Politics is also about wearing out each others nerves. Let us see who blinks first. But the chances are we will not, a BJP leader stressed.

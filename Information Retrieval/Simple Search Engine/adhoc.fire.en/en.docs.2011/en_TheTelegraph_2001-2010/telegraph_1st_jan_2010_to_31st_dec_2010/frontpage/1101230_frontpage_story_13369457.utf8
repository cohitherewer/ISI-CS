The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | D-team pulls off dream win
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                D-team pulls off dream win
  - Sights on cape town as India proves it can play pace           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni after India rsquo;s victory in the second Test in Durban on Wednesday. (AFP)                                 
	Durban, Dec. 29: Johannesburg in 2006, Perth in 2008 and Kingsmead here, this afternoon...        
	No more can Indias batsmen be accused of being unfit for seamer-friendly wickets with bounce not seen anywhere in the subcontinent.        
	Thrashed by an innings in the first Test, Mahendra Singh Dhonis team rallied dream-like to script an emotional 87-run win over South Africa.        
	Awesome both in terms of the margin and what it means for our cricket.         
	With the series 1-1, the decider in Cape Town, from January 2, is expected to be a cracker of a contest with India already strongly favoured to create history.        
	But, hey, Dhoni isnt getting carried away.         
	We dont believe in saying too much, but want our cricket to do the talking. This is a proud moment. Its a process which started two years ago, said Dhoni, obviously delighted, but staying composed.        
	Counterpart Graeme Smith was, not surprisingly, subdued. Candid as well. We played terribly, just didnt play to our ability. We lost the Test on the second day itself. It wasnt a 131-pitch.        
	South Africa didnt exactly have to climb Everest on Day IV today, but the loss of three wickets last evening had set them back quite a bit.        
	Given his strong credentials, an exceptional ball was needed to evict Jacques Kallis, who may have turned things around for South Africa.        
	The temperamental Sreesanth responded to this challenge, unleashing a brute of a delivery and sending Kallis to hospital for a precautionary X-ray of his left wrist.        
	Kallis suffered a soft tissue bruise, but South Africa took a body blow. A recovery was as likely as snow back in Calcutta.         
	It was, in effect, all over at 123 for four.        
	South Africa did get a couple of poor decisions, though, one each from Asad Rauf and Steve Davis, prompting Smith to again call for uniformity in using the referrals system.        
	The ICC needs to take responsibility and not leave it to the boards to negotiate. If the technology is available, then it must be used, Smith pointed out.        
	While South Africa wanted the referrals, India opposed it. Not for the first time, mind you.         
	The lower order did resist somewhat, allowing the Test to go beyond lunch, taken at 182 for seven. Last man Lonwabo Tsotsobe was run out, a dismissal which accurately summed up the disjointed approach over three-and-a-half days.        
	Appropriately, V.V.S. Laxman (38, 96) was adjudged the MoM. In a brief interaction with The Telegraph, Smith readily conceded that he made the difference.                     
	I dont need to say much.... Laxman was the difference between the teams and played a great innings, is how Smith saluted the stalwart, who flourishes in adversity.        
	But, then, Laxman is one of a kind.        
	A team which scores 131 in its first innings doesnt deserve to win. Equally, an attack which triggers that collapse needs to be applauded.        
	Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanth (We need to have him under control for the good of all of us, Dhoni quipped) were outstanding.         
	On the eve of the series, in a one-on-one, former captain Sourav Ganguly made the point that unless fitness became an issue, our attack had the ability to take 20 wickets. He was right.        
	The Test proved that Zaheer is indispensable. Hes cut down on his pace, but is smart in the head. Clearly, he reads batsmen very well and can often anticipate what they intend doing.        
	Dhoni, too, needs credit. With a win-percentage of 60.87 (14 from 23), hes now No. 4 on the list of most successful captains, cut-off being a minimum of 20 Tests.        
	So, should I retire? Dhoni asked laughing, going on to add: What I want is for my team to respect me. Its the 16 guys in the squad who have to perform well as a unit. We back each other.        
	On the No. 1 ranking, Dhoni observed: Its not just about one win. Then what have we been doing in the last few years? All wins have an impact.        
	Most definitely and this afternoons is bound to be a defining one as we prepare for the challenges ahead.

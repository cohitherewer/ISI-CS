	Jamshedpur/Ranchi, Sept. 29: Operation Black Thunder, the five-day offensive to flush out Maoists from Saranda, was called off for now today after security forces were satisfied that the jungles of West Singhbhum had been cleared of rebels to a large extent, prompting the state to schedule a high-level meeting on Friday to review its success and plan for the future.        
	While paramilitary forces from other districts have begun to retreat, local forces will remain in Saranda to follow up on the operation that was planned meticulously by DIG (Kolhan) Naveen Kumar Singh.        
	He said the operation would resume to ensure that Saranda remained totally free from rebel influence. Intelligence received by the security forces, he added, suggested that most of the Maoists, including veterans like Anmoljee, alias Samarjee, had fled to Rourkela in neighbouring Orissa.         
	Singh said four Naxalites had been arrested while six to 10 rebels were suspected to have been killed.         
	However, only one body had been recovered so far.         
	Besides, the police have detonated over 20 landmines and destroyed several camps in an area which had literally been converted into a liberated zone, he added.        
	The Naxalites, he revealed, had started co-operative farming at Saranda like in China and were running schools for their children.         
	Singh admitted their work was far from over. There must be several other hideouts untouched by us. We are gathering more information, he said.

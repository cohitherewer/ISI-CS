The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | OMG! A mail from Jobs!
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                OMG! A mail from Jobs!
          BRAD STONE                            Awe and ecstasy                                  
	San Francisco, March 25: Jezper Sderlund, a music producer in Gothenburg, Sweden, was thrilled to receive a one-word email message earlier this month.        
	The word was no.        
	The sender of the email message was perhaps the most famous businessman in the world, Steven P. Jobs, chief executive of Apple.        
	Sderlund had written to Jobs asking if he would be able to link his iPhones data service to the forthcoming iPad. Jobs wrote back within 30 minutes, and though the reply was perfunctory, it still made Sderlunds day  and then echoed around the world, after he forwarded the exchange to a blog devoted to Apple news.        
	When I woke up the next day, it was all over the Web, Sderlund said. Almost every Mac website had picked it up, and the biggest newspaper in town wrote about it. We had more visits to my website in 12 hours than we had all year.        
	Apple is a notoriously secretive company. Its few public statements are dissected by its knowledgeable fans with the vigour of forensic experts. But Jobs sometimes takes a more intimate approach to information-sharing  and when his email messages pop up on the computer screens of random fans and critics, they can inspire ecstasy and awe.        
	OMG (Oh my God), I am never cleaning my in-box again, Devir Kahan says in a YouTube video he made last month after hearing from Jobs. Kahan, who is 14 and lives in New York city, had complained about a problem with an Apple keyboard. Software fix coming soon, Jobss reply said. Sorry for the bug.        
	While Jobs was known to occasionally answer email messages sent to his widely published address before he went on medical leave last year, he now appears to have resumed the practice.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

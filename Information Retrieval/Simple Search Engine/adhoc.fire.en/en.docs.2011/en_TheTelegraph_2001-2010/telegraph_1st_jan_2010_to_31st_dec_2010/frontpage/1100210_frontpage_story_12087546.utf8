	Ranchi, Feb. 9: Chief Minister Shibu Soren sprang a surprise this morning by not turning up in Calcutta for P. Chidambarams meeting of chief ministers, reviving speculation about Jharkhands reluctance to participate in a coordinated offensive against Maoists who offered tacit support to the JMM in last years Assembly elections.         
	Although two deputy chief ministers, Raghubar Das of the BJP and Sudhesh Mahto of Ajsu, were present at the meeting convened by the Union home minister to fine tune strategy and ensure inter-state coordination of forces as Operation Green Hunt is stepped up, Sorens absence  he checked into a hospital complaining of high blood pressure  reinforced doubts about his governments stand on the question of fighting Maoists.        
	Soren, who made no bones about accepting support of Maoists while campaigning during the Assembly elections, also gave JMM tickets to a number of former rebels who contested in Palamau, Khunti and Torpa, all rebel strongholds.         
	This morning, the chief minister was wheeled into Apollo Hospital in Ranchi where doctors admitted him after he complained of chest discomfort, high blood pressure and lack of sleep.         
	Medical superintendent of the hospital P.D. Sinha said Soren would be kept under observation for the night and probably released tomorrow. In fact, Soren has scheduled a cabinet meeting at 9am.        
	Senior JMM leaders described his health concern as real, adding that nothing more should be read into it.         
	Sorens rivals, however, took no time to suggest that despite his public statements to the contrary, the JMM chief was distancing himself from Operation Green Hunt, bowing to CPI(Maoist) spokesman Kishanji, who in a recent statement, threatened to shut all doors for dialogue if the chief minister attended the Calcutta meeting.         
	Sources close to Soren said his decision to skip the meeting was in tune with his politics, which was not to antagonise the Maoists who supported him in the elections.        
	The proposed operation will hit tribal pockets, the support base of the JMM. And Soren doesnt want to run the risk of losing their support in a politically uncertain state, said a senior JMM leader.        
	In fact, Sorens insistence on tackling the Maoists socially and politically rather than by the use of force led to his being left out by Chidambaram for a similar meeting of chief ministers he convened in Raipur on January 22.         
	On January 28, Soren and his team met Chidambaram in New Delhi to make amends and even announced wholehearted support to Operation Green Hunt.        
	In fact, doubts about Sorens intentions surfaced after he did not go to Calcutta as planned and came back to Ranchi yesterday after attending meetings in New Delhi on rising prices and internal security.         
	Soon after, his deputies, Das and Mahto, met him in Ranchi to confirm later that they had managed to persuade him to attend the meeting. But, they were in for a surprise when Soren did not turn up at the airport.        
	Though Das wouldnt admit it, Sorens action has embarrassed his partner in government, the BJP, no end as it cannot afford to appear soft on the rebels. This has shown there is no governance in the state when the chief minister is not able to keep his promise made to the Centre, said a senior BJP leader.

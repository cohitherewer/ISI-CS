          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 5: A trailer loaded with logs ploughed through taxis and private cars at the Vidyasagar Setu toll plaza tonight, killing at least two persons and critically injuring eight.        
	The trailer was on its way out of the city around 9.45pm when the driver lost control and rammed into the lines of vehicles waiting at the toll gate before toppling sideways over two taxis full of passengers.        
	The cabs were reduced to mangled heaps of metal, while the head of the trailer was wrenched off and broke through the bridges side wall to crash onto the road below.        
	I was standing with my friends below the bridge when we heard a thunderous roar and looked up. I saw the head of the trailer fall about 50 metres from where we stood, said trader Manzoor Khan, 28.        
	The driver of the trailer is missing and feared dead.        
	Rescuers took nearly an hour to pull out the 10 other victims, all trapped in the two taxis, as two cranes failed to get the trailers body back on the wheels. Several other vehicles that came in the way of the trailer were partially damaged, and some passengers were given first aid.        
	It was 10.40pm by the time the critically injured taxi passengers and drivers were taken to SSKM Hospital, where two of them were declared dead on arrival.        
	The apparent delay in rescue operations triggered mob fury. Over 100 policemen and nearly as many RAF personnel were deployed on the bridge to control a 300-strong crowd that picked up sticks to indiscriminately attack anybody within range.        
	A police officer said the fatalities were lower than initially feared. We hadnt expected to find any survivors in the cars trapped under the massive trailer, he said.        
	Looking at the debris, you would think the casualties would be at least 20, another policeman said.        
	Traffic flow on the bridge was badly affected tonight, with gate numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9 closed along with the toll booths.        
	Accidents are common on Vidyasagar Setu with one occurring barely 48 hours before the trailer tragedy. A 78-year-old woman died on Wednesday after being flung off her sons motorcycle. The last pile-up took place in 2006, when a state bus rammed into two private cars before hitting two taxis, critically injuring five people.        
	This bridge has witnessed all kinds of accidents, from car crashes to actor Viveik Oberoi breaking his leg while shooting a motorcycle scene. But todays was the worst I have seen, a policeman said.

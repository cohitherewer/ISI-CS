          SUMIR KARMAKAR                              
	Guwahati, Dec. 27: The four-year-old HIV-positive girl who was abandoned by her family after her parents died will be shifted to Snehneer, a care home for HIV-positive children in Calcutta, next month.         
	The NGO that runs Snehneer, Bhoruka Public Welfare Trust, is now taking care of the girl at its community care centre at Beharbari here.         
	The Assam State AIDS Control Society had agreed to send the girl to the care centre so that she could receive proper care and treatment according to the guidelines of the National AIDS Control Organisation.        
	The girls health has improved a lot and she will be shifted to our 25-bed home in Calcutta by the end of January, as we do not have space there at present. We had sought permission from the Assam State AIDS Control Society and they have agreed, said Ratul Kalita, the project coordinator of the NGO here.        
	The girl was brought to the centre on December 11 by a local NGO, which had found her in Nalbari. HIV-positive since birth, the girl had lost her mother to AIDS in October and her father to the same virus two years ago. She had no one to look after her except her paternal aunts, who abandoned her because they considered the HIV-positive child an untouchable.        
	Abandoned by her larger family, she is currently being taken care of at the community care centre by a woman who doesnt have such prejudices. I am taking care of her since she was first brought here. I took her to hospital today. I am treating her like my own child and will take care of her as long as she needs. It is a wrong belief that touching and taking care of an HIV-positive child is dangerous, said Meena Dey, working with the NGO for the past year.        
	Impressed by the care provided to the child by the woman, the joint director (care, support and treatment) of the Assam State AIDS Control Society, Hem Chandra Barman, has decided to confer an award on Dey in recognition of her service.         
	The stigma about HIV-positive people is still prevalent in our society but the way Meena is taking care of the child is really praiseworthy. She is an example of how we should care for people living with HIV/AIDS, Barman said.        
	The Bhoruka Public Welfare Trusts care centre here, which was started in 1991 and has 37 HIV-positive children at present, provides care to the kids and counselling to their parents.

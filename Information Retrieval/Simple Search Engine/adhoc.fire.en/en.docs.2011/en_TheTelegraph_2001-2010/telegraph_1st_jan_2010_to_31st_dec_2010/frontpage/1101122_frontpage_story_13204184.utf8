The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CM for plan panel avatar in state

	Ranchi, Nov. 21: Chief minister Arjun Munda is all set to revive the Jharkhand State Planning Board  first formed during his second innings as head of state  to assist his government in drawing up development plans based on scientific assessment of available resources.         
	The move comes close on the heels of the government setting up a three-member panel, headed by noted economist Bibek Debroy, to prepare the states development report.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from New Delhi, Munda said that the board would be modelled on the Planning Commission at the Centre. We cannot have development inputs with political vision if there is no planning board, he maintained.         
	The file for revival of the planning board is said to be lying with the chief ministers office.        
	Munda said he had received the feedback on bottlenecks in the states development and measures to overcome them at a series of interactive sessions with MPs, Jharkhand cadre bureaucrats as well as several secretaries in Delhi yesterday.         
	I also interacted with retired bureaucrats since I have to nominate some of them as members of the planning board, which will have various divisions such as plan co-ordination, agriculture, micro-planning, social service, perspective planning etc., he added.        
	After he became chief minister for the second time in 2005, Munda had constituted the planning board with Sarayu Roy as its vice-chairman in anticipation of cabinet approval. However, the proposal was not placed before the cabinet in view of infighting within the BJP, and Roy quit after six months of assuming charge. Later, the board was approved by the Madhu Koda-led cabinet, but never reconstituted.        
	In fact, the state planning board has remained jinxed ever since the creation of Jharkhand. In 2001, the then Babulal Marandi government had passed an act through the Assembly for constitution of the Planning and Infrastructure Development Board. It did not take off, as the draft act was sent for the Centres approval on the grounds that planning happened to be on the concurrent list of the Constitution.         
	Neither the Centre gave its nod to the draft act nor did the state pursue it in right earnest, Sarayu Roy told The Telegraph.        
	A few days ago, the chief minister shot off personal letters to all IAS officers in the state, seeking their views on how to reform governance in the state. He said several officers had responded online and the others would do so soon. Their opinion had been solicited on the grounds of their administrative experience. It will help us to work out a blueprint for administrative reforms.        
	The Munda government has also moved to appoint two advisers on issues of governance and security. Sources close to the chief minister said that the finance department was processing the file. Munda confirmed the move, but refused to name anyone as yet.        
	Sources said Munda wanted good people at the helm of affairs to guide the politically turbulent state.         
	Over the last three days, the chief minister has interacted with a host of MPs, IAS/IPS/IFS on central deputation from Jharkhand, representatives of various industrial houses to send across the message that his government meant business. Development is the only agenda of his government, he is said to have stressed.        
	The state government is making efforts to achieve a growth rate of 10 per cent and making the manpower skilled and productive, he said.

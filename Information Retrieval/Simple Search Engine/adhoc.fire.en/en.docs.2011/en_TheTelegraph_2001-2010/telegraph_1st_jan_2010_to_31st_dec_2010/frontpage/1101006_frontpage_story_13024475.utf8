The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kashmir calling but no ones willing
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Kashmir calling but no ones willing
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                             Omar Abdullah (top), Manmohan Singh                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: Rank: cabinet minister. Perks: dedicated staff and offices. But no one seems interested.        
	Kashmir, after all, is a tough job.        
	Searching for a politician to lead a group of interlocutors to Kashmir is proving difficult for the government as many have declined the offer.        
	At least some of the politicians who were approached are understood to have flatly refused, while others have sought time. Many feel their rivals may be suggesting their names to sink them politically, for Kashmir is a tough job, said a government source.        
	The governments hunt for a politician to head the group comes after the cabinet committee on security (CCS) last month decided on an eight-point agenda for the embattled Valley. Setting up a team of interlocutors to carry forward the dialogue on resolving the tangle was one of the decisions.        
	It was also decided that a politician would head the group to the state, where four months of street violence has left over 100 people dead, many of them teenagers.        
	Several names have been doing the rounds, including those of Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Prithviraj Chavan and the CPMs Sitaram Yechury. The sources said the person had to be an individual with the stature of a cabinet minister as the post would be of that rank, with dedicated staff and an office in Delhi.        
	The political face of the group of interlocutors also needs to be someone who neither has a negative image in Kashmir nor is unacceptable to the PMO or to 10 Janpath.         
	Too much to ask?        
	If things get too hot, then the government may choose a Supreme Court judge or a vice-chancellor, said a source.        
	So a back-up plan has been kept ready  a shortlist of names of Supreme Court judges and university vice-chancellors.        
	Essentially though, the choice will be of a person of eminence and who enjoys the confidence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	But yesterdays meetings between Singh and Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and later between the Prime Minister and Union home minister P. Chidambaram failed to finalise the names of either the head of the team or any of the interlocutors.         
	Since the government recognises the need for sustained engagement in the state, several factors need to be considered, said a senior official. Engagement has to be for two, five, 10 years, said a source.         
	Top sources, however, said the government expects to finalise the names of the interlocutors by the end of this week. Immediately afterwards, the core committee of the Congress will meet to discuss the names. That would be followed by a final meeting of the CCS.         
	Interlocutors earlier have included current governor N.N. Vohra. But with the stress on a political solution, Vohra is being sought to be replaced by a more political face as governor.         
	The last political face was Jagmohan, a former bureaucrat who later plunged into politics and became a BJP MP.

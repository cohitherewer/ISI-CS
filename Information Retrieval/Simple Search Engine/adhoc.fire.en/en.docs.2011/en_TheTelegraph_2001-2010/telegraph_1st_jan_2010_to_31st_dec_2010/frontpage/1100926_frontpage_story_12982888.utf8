          PRADUMAN CHOUBEY                            Drivers on strike in Dhanbad on Saturday. (Gautam Dey)                                  
	Dhanbad, Sept. 25: Two days after 11 of Dhanbads 24 city buses went off the roads for want of regular maintenance, the remaining 13 were grounded today as 48 drivers and conductors struck work demanding better pay.        
	Till yesterday, the Jharkhand State Tourism Department (JTDC) was forced to run truncated services of the JNNURM flagship project that has run into rough weather in the coal capital over viability issues, forcing its original operator to opt out citing financial losses.        
	The Telegraph had reported yesterday that the city bus service, introduced in Ranchi and Jamshedpur too, was facing problems in Dhanbad with JTDC struggling to keep it alive by rationing fuel and curtailing the number of trips of each bus.        
	JTDC feels todays strike by the support staff had the tacit backing of the Bhutpurva Sainik Kalyan Sangh, an NGO of ex-servicemen that quit as the outsourced operator since it was losing money.        
	The drivers and conductors, who demonstrated before JTDC officials and wrote to the JTDC headquarters in Ranchi, want Rs 6,000 as monthly salary instead of Rs 4,200 they are getting.        
	Other demands, specified in their letter  copies have been forwarded to Dhanbad deputy commissioner Sunil Kumar Burnwal and SP Suman Gupta  include identity cards and uniforms and a weekly off.        
	We were assured a salary of Rs 6,500 per month but have been getting only Rs 4,200 ever since we joined work. After JTDC took over operations from the Bhutpurva Sainik Kalyan Sangh, we were told that we would get Rs 3,200 per month, alleged Akhilesh Prasad, one of the drivers.        
	He added they would be compelled to intensify their struggle if the authorities failed to meet their demands.        
	Prasad claimed that Rs 1,700 was taken from them in lieu of uniforms and boots, which they were still to get. He further alleged that JTDC authorities had been sacking staff hired when the city bus service was launched in August and was now replacing them with new people.        
	JTDCs city bus service in-charge Tej Narayan Singh, however, blamed the NGO of ex-servicemen for the mess. He said since the drivers and conductors were hired by the sangh, it should have provided them with the promised uniforms.        
	We have recommended strong action against the sangh and asked it to compensate the loss JTDC has suffered due to it, said Singh.        
	Another senior JTDC official accused the sangh of engineering the strike and said the NGO wanted to jointly run the bus service with JTDC in Dhanbad and enjoy government subsidies in the process.        
	The sangh, however, refuted the charges. Its representative, R.S. Chaudhary, said his NGO was ready to mediate between JTDC and the striking employees to ensure smooth running of the services.        
	Explaining why the drivers and conductors were being paid less than promised, he said: As we were the outsourcing agent, we were taking our commission. ESI and PF were also deducted.

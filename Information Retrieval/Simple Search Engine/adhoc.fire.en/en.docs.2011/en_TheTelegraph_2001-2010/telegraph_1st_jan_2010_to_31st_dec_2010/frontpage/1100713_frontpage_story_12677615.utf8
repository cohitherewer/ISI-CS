The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Centre forbids paramilitary camps on campus
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Centre forbids paramilitary camps on campus
  - National elementary education workshop dishes out new guidelines for Maoist-hit districts across country          AMIT GUPTA                                                     
	 Levy demand ignored, Maoists raze two under-construction school buildings in Gumla, Jharkhand        
	 Fifty schools in Kanker, Chhattisgarh, blown up by rebels because they once hosted paramilitary camps         
	 One-third of total academic days lost due to rebel bandhs in West Midnapore, Bengal              
	Ranchi, July 12: Such unabated Maoist aggression against elementary education in the rural hinterland today prompted the Union HRD ministry to issue a strict directive against the use of village schools as camps for forces.        
	In a fresh set of guidelines to Maoist-hit states, the director of school education and literacy in the Union ministry, P.K. Tiwary, told chief secretaries that Centre was also planning to extend the ambit of Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) so that it covered expenses of reconstructing school buildings damaged in rebel attacks. The Centres fiat against the use of school buildings as camps, temporary or permanent, for security forces came days after Governor M..H. Farook issued a similar directive in the state.         
	On the first day of the maiden national-level workshop on left-wing extremism affected districts under SSA in the capital today, the gamut of problems facing elementary education and possible solutions came to the fore. The Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) is hosting the two-day meet to zero in on ways to extend unhindered elementary education to students under the Right to Education Act.        
	The workshop is a part of the multi-point approach to weed out Naxalism from the districts of Khammam (Andhra Pradesh), Arwal, Aurangabad, Gaya, Jamui, Jehanabad and Rohtas (Bihar), Bastar, Dantewada, Kanker, Rajnandgaon, Sarguja, Narayanpur and Bijapur (Chhattisgarh), Bokaro, Chatra, Garhwa, Gumla, Hazaribagh, Latehar, Lohardaga, West Singhbhum, Palamau, East Singhbhum and Ramgarh (Jharkhand), Balaghat (Madhya Pradesh), Deogarha, Gajapati, Malkangiri, Raigada and Sambalpur (Orissa), Gadchirolli and Gondia (Maharashtra), Sonbhadra (Uttar Pradesh) and West Midnapore (Bengal).        
	We will jot down district-wise problem areas and incorporate region specific schemes to be implemented under SSA in the next fiscal. We cannot afford to be insensitive towards such grave issues based on first-hand information, Tiwary told The Telegraph.         
	During deliberations, it came to the fore that rebels damage only those schools that are or were occupied by paramilitary forces. The attacks happen not because government employees (read teachers and education officers) visit so-called liberated zones, pointed out an education officer from Gadchirolli. In response, Tiwary underscored that chief secretaries of states concerned would ensure that no government school was occupied by force.        
	In Jharkhand, children of 11 rebel-hit districts have access to schools, but large-scale Maoist violence is routine in Palamau, Gumla, Latehar, Chatra and Garhwa, district programme officers pointed out. It was, however, found out that most education officers were unaware of the presence of ashram schools, set up by tribal welfare department. Tiwary observed that proper co-ordination between government schools and ashram vidyalayas was necessary to extend education in the rural hinterland.

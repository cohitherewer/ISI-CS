	New Delhi, Nov. 30: The boom-boom days of growth are back.         
	Indias $1.3 trillion economy grew by 8.9 per cent through the first six months of fiscal 2011  faster than the economic pundits or the mandarins of North Block had anticipated.        
	The scorching pace of growth pace  amid persistent question marks on the recovery of the global economy  came on the back of strong farm sector growth, robust demand for consumer products from a burgeoning middle class, and quicksilver growth in the services sector.        
	But there was no mood of triumphalism that accompanied the unanticipated announcement  just a wan smile of relief that briefly smoothened the furrowed foreheads of top ministers in the Manmohan Singh government who have been battling taunts over corruption in high places, rising food prices and a dismal showing in the Bihar elections.        
	Said finance minister Pranab Mukherjee: Amidst all depressing news, one good news is there we may be confident that the GDP growth at the end of the year will not be less than 8.75 per cent it may be more.        
	India had averaged an annual economic expansion of 9.5 per cent between 2006 and 2008 before a global economic meltdown slowed growth to 6.7 per cent in 2008-09. The economy picked up steam last year and expanded 7.4 per cent. This year was expected to be better but not so good.         
	India grew by 8.9 per cent in both the April-June and the July-September quarters, according to data published by the government today.        
	The manufacturing sector, which remains a big employer even though the services sector now accounts for more than 55 per cent of the GDP, grew at almost 10 per cent.         
	The construction sector, which covers roads, infrastructure and realty projects, was growing at a pacy 9 per cent. Services like trade, hotels and transport grew 12.1 per cent.        
	Most polls of economists had forecast an overall growth ranging between 8 and 8.4 per cent during this period.        
	A strong monsoon this year and a resultant increase in crop acreage revived the fortunes of the farm sector which registered a 4.4 per cent growth. In the past few years, the farm sectors fortunes have swung wildly from a negative figure to a maximum of 2.5 per cent.        
	Automobile sales topped 38 per cent in the festival month of October after a near 25 per cent growth in the first half of the year. Telecom firms reported a 90 million increase in subscribers, taking the total subscriber base to 650 million over the six-month period.        
	Every society has an economic life cycle, said Gaurav Marya, president of Franchise India, a grouping of large Indian and transnational firms which sell through franchises. Indians have experienced a decade of fast paced growth and have now graduated from increased spending on basics to lifestyle spending -multiple cars, snazzier mobiles, better homes. All this is driving sales now.        
	A North Block official said: We never dreamt we would manage to get close to the IMF forecast of 9.7 per cent growth for this calendar year. But now a 9 per cent GDP growth this fiscal (which ends in March 2011) suddenly looks achievable.        
	Said Mukherjee: Normally, I dont agree with IMF. Perhaps, this time I may have to agree with its assessment.        
	The sharp economic growth makes India all the more attractive as an investment destination for global funds and transnationals hoping to offset piffling sales in Europe and the US.        
	In contrast, the 16-nation Eurozone drawn down by the financial doldrums in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, grew by a mere 1.9 per cent. The US, which is still struggling to resuscitate its economy after the financial crisis of 2008, has managed to grow 2.5 per cent in the third quarter ended September 30.        
	China is the only other major economy that is growing at a faster rate - at 9.6 per cent.         
	Finance ministry mandarins hope the India growth story will allow diplomats to wrangle more by dangling the Indian market as a carrot before P-5 leaders like Frances Nicolas Sarkozy, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who are expected over the next few weeks.         
	Already foreign funds have joined the party, pumping in a record $28.5 billion into Indian bourses.         
	The GDP numbers seem exciting and highly endorse the Indias growth story, agreed Assocham president Swati Piramal.        
	But there a few clouds on the horizon: inflation still remains a worry at 8.58 per cent - far higher than the 4 to 5 per cent band that the Reserve Bank of India sees as ideal.        
	North Block hopes inflation will dip further when the crops planted during the monsoon months come into the granary.        
	Economists and business leaders are also concerned over a possible rise in auto fuel prices and the continued uncertainty in the western economies, which make up for nearly 70 per cent of Indias export market.         
	Oil economists expect crude oil prices to rise to an average of over $93 a barrel, up from an average of $70 for 2010. If that happens, it will only stoke prices and interest rates in India.

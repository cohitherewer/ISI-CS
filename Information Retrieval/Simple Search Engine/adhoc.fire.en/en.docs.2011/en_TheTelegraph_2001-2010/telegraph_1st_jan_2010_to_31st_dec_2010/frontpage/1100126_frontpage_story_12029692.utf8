          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: The Congress and Sharad Pawar today rushed to douse controversy after the agriculture minister had appeared to shift the blame for the spiralling food prices on the Prime Minister.        
	Pawar had yesterday said policy decisions were taken collectively by the cabinet including the Prime Minister, giving an impression that the ruling allies were fighting in the middle of a price spurt.        
	I am not the only person involved in this process. The Prime Minister and all of us together decide the price policy, he had said in Pune.        
	The Congress today avoided criticising the remark, and Pawar too clarified that he had mentioned the Prime Minister just to underline the principle of collective responsibility.        
	As the BJP accused him of passing the buck, the agriculture minister said there was no question of attacking Manmohan Singh.        
	Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed ducked the questions fired at him on the controversy, while Manish Tiwari said there was nothing wrong in talking about collective responsibility.        
	The Congress has repeatedly expressed concern at the price rise but has avoided publicly criticising Pawar.        
	We are sure even the NCP is equally concerned at the rising prices, a Congress leader said. He added: The talk of Pawar being stripped of the food and civil supplies ministry has no political basis; it is there because the Administrative Reforms Commission has suggested bifurcation of certain ministries.        
	Congress leaders, however, doubt that the Prime Minister would risk annoying Pawar, who is a key figure in Maharashtra where the Shiv Sena is keen to fish in troubled waters. Besides, blaming Pawar would suggest the savage prices are a result of government bungling and not of natural or global factors.        
	The BJP is mounting pressure on Pawar to try and drive a wedge between the allies. Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad today claimed Pawar was making a mess of the food economy. The Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi should respond to Pawars remarks, he said.

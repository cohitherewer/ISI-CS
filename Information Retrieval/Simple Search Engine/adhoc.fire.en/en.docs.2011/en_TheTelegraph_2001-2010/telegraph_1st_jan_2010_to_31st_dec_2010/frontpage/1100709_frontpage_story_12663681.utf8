          OUR BUREAU                            Durlav Sethia                                  
	July 8: Six-year-old Durlav Sethia suffocated to death this morning, the only one of 600 passengers to die when militants bombed a train bound for Calcutta from Guwahati this morning.        
	The Class I student was on his way to visit his grandparents in Ekbalpore in Calcutta when Bodo extremists, straining at the leash after the arrest of their leader, triggered a blast that caught the Garib Rath Express in Kokrajhar, around 20km from the Bengal border.        
	The explosion at 2am flung the locomotive and two coaches off the tracks.        
	Durlav, his sister Bhaveshi, younger brother Spandan and mother Archana were in a coupe in the power van immediately behind the engine.        
	Over 20 of the nearly 600 passengers were injured but only the boy died in the explosion, the first instance of civilian casualty in a train attack after the Jnaneswari Express sabotage in which 150 people, including children, died.        
	The National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) has claimed responsibility. Ever since the arrest in May of Ranjan Daimari, the leader of the outfit which wants a Bodoland state to be carved out of Assam, an anti-talks faction has been trying to make its presence felt.        
	My son was suffocated to death having been pressed against the earth after the coach came to rest on its side, said Durlavs father Sanjay who saw the family off in Guwahati.        
	Initially, Archana could not locate Durlav in the darkness. She stuck her arm out, felt his trousers and pulled him over. It is not clear whether Durlav was alive when he was pulled out of the train or he died later. A relative said Durlav suffered from asthma.        
	Sanjay said he had pleaded with the ticket examiner to change their seats from the power van but the official was unable to do so.        
	A few seats are usually kept aside in the power vans  the train is fully air-conditioned  for the disabled. Such seats are given to other passengers if they are unoccupied.        
	Usually, the children go to Gangtok during the summer vacation from where my wife hails, but they wanted to meet their grandparents in Calcutta this time, said Sanjay, who runs a travel agency and owns a garment-and-gift shop.        
	The grandparents left for Guwahati this morning after hearing of the tragedy. On Wednesday, I had purchased eatables and gifts for them. I think God proposed something else, said Dhan Raj Sethia, the grandfather.        
	The last rites of Durlav were performed in Guwahati this evening.

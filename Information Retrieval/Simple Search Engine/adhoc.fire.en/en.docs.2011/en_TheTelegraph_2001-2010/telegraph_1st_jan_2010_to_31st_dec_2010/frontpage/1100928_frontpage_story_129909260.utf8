	New Delhi, Sep 28 (PTI): Congress today welcomed the Supreme Court order paving the way for the Allahabad High Court to deliver its judgement in the 60-year-old Ramjanambhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit.
    "We welcome the order. The party has always held that the issue should either be resolved through mutual talks or the court order should be obeyed," party General Secretary Janaradhan Dwivedi told reporters when asked about the the apex court dismissing the plea for deferment of the verdict by the High Court.
    When asked about the statement of BJP leader Vinay Katiyar that the High Court judgement could be challenged in the Supreme Court or the matter could go to Parliament, Dwivedi said, "they (the BJP leaders) know what they are saying, but there is a consensus in the country that the court verdict should be respected. It is natural that anyone can go to the Supreme Court".

          OUR BUREAU                            Congress leader Radha Krishna Kishore in Ranchi on Tuesday. (Manik Bose)                                  
	New Delhi/Ranchi, May 25: The Congress, it is learnt, is getting interested in forming a government in Jharkhand but an alternative alliance would be possible only if Shibu Soren decides to extend support to a chief minister chosen by it.        
	The imposition of Presidents rule may be avoided if the hectic developments within the party bear fruit. While AICC in-charge K. Keshav Rao was called from Hyderabad, Jharkhand PCC president Pradep Balmuchu is already in the national capital with CLP leader Rajinder Singh scheduled to reach by tomorrow morning.         
	The leaders are expected to hold a meeting with Sonia Gandhi around 6pm tomorrow.         
	Sources said the state Congress leadership was very keen to form a government, arguing the party organisation could be drastically improved with a dose of power after a long time.        
	The party has also argued that the people of the state would be disappointed to see central rule once again.        
	So far, the Congress has no concrete formula or proposal with it but enough hints have come from the JMM of a possible understanding although there has been no talk on how to factor in the opinion of its key ally, Babulal Marandis JVM.        
	All permutations and combinations are expected to be discussed at tomorrows meeting.        
	Marandi, who has vowed not to indulge in horse-trading to grab power, has called a meeting of JVM MLAs and functionaries tomorrow in Ranchi to gauge their mood amid the fluid political situation.        
	There has been no change in our stand. Satta ke liye na daurenge na satta se bhagenge (We will not run after power nor escape from our responsibility to form a government). But, we will not indulge in horse-trading, nor will we allow our alliance partner to indulge in it, he said.         
	Having burnt its fingers with the Sorens, the BJP made it clear that there was no question of reopening negotiations with the JMM to form a government. We have withdrawn support not to realign with the JMM, the partys national general secretary Ravi Shankar Prasad maintained.        
	BJP ministers quit        
	In a late night development, four BJP ministers  Raghubar Das, Neelkanth Singh Munda, Baidyanath Ram, Barkunwar Gagrai  sent their resignation letters to the governor.

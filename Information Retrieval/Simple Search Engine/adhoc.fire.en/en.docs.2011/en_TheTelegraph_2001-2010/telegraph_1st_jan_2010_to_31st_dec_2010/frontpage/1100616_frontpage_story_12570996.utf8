  - Lions hunting in South Africa are yet to let out that deafening roar          
	Star quality is a strange entity. The opening exchanges of the 2010 World Cup illustrate the points. For months, weeks, days, hours and then minutes leading up to the finals, pundits pontificate about the comparative talents on show.        
	Then, come the day, come not the man.        
	South Africas World Cup kicked off only last Friday so it may be a little cruel to judge so soon. Perhaps it would be wiser to adopt the catch-all answer proffered by Fifa spokespersons to any awkward query: Its too early to judge we need to look at the bigger picture this will only become clear by the end of the tournament.        
	This World Cup, it seems, every manager and player has been more than ever aware of the significance of the first match. Hence managers such as Englands Fabio Capello and Italys Marcello Lippi professed themselves content with opening draws against opponents such as the US and Paraguay who should have ended up on the wrong end of clear defeats.

	Fear stalks South Africa and this has nothing to do with the likelihood  or rather, unlikelihood  of coming across a hungry lion or crocodile. Rather, it is fear of failure which has affected teams and, thus, their players.        
	Successful World Cup teams  whether winners or, minimally, semi-finalists  traditionally begin in a low-key fashion and develop their form from game to game.                           
	But the fans in South Africa who have waited with increasing excitement and impatience have a right to feel somewhat let down.        
	Leo Messi looked wonderful for Argentina but he wasted four or five good chances and ended up without a goal to his name; Englands Wayne Rooney only spluttered to life in the closing stages against the US as the Americans grew tired; then Cristiano Ronaldo contributed one magnificent effort against Ivory Coast  denied by the post  before hiding away somewhere in front of midfield, surrounded by a stifling army of opponents.        
	Even Kaka, for all Brazils command over North Korea, never appeared to relax into anything even resembling normal service until after the senors of samba soccer had finally taken the lead  and even then they needed a right back to show them the way to goal.        
	Do we expect too much of our heroes? Perhaps  and nowhere is the weight of expectations heavier than at the World Cup finals with the eyes of the world watching every kick and miskick.        
	That said, the game as a whole has a right to expect something rather better than the organisers  both Fifa and the local organising committee (Saloc)  are producing in response to a pay dispute involving security stewards at several of the stadia.        
	Trouble erupted in Durban on Sunday, followed by further disputes in Cape Town on Monday  where police trainees were rushed into the breach  and before Brazils game against North Korea in Ellis Park, Johannesburg.        
	Fifa and Saloc spokespersons have both deflected responsibility to various subcontractors but that has been demeaning at a World Cup where all the usual stadium street vendors are complaining they have been effectively put out of business by the sponsor-special rules and regulations.        
	Last week the world federation and its president, Sepp Blatter, declared themselves so pleased with last years accounts  turnover topped $1 billion for the first time  that they awarded each of the 208 national associations a one-off bonus of $250,000 and each of the six regional confederations $2.5 million each.        
	That money might have been more usefully directed at the poverty-line men and women responsible for helping deliver this tournament.        
	Its not only the big names on the pitch who need to step up their game.

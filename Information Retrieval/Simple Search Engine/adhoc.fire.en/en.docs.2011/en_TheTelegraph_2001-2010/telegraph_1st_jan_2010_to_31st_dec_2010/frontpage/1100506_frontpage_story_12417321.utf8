	Ranchi, May 5: Jailed JMM MLA Paulus Surin today made a move to quit his Assembly seat, thus trying to pave the way for chief minister Shibu Soren to contest the byelections from Torpa, even as a weary BJP central leadership extended the two-day deadline it had set for the chief ministers resignation by another four or five days.        
	Paulus moved the Simdega district judge to allow him to appear before the Speaker for some urgent reasons. The court granted him seven days for the same and directed the deputy commissioner as well as the superintendent of police to ensure his appearance before the Speaker.        
	The implication of the move was that Soren and his son Hemant were not on the same page as far as the latters commitment to hand over the leadership to BJP was concerned. The perception was that Soren was making a last ditch effort to continue as chief minister.        
	Paulus had sent his resignation earlier too, but the Speaker rejected it after the jailed MLA, a former Maoist, decided to withdraw under pressure from persons considered close to the chief minister.        
	Sources said Sorens emissaries met Paulus in jail today and persuaded him to offer the resignation again.        
	Speaker C.P. Singh, however, told The Telegraph that nobody had approached him in this regard.         
	However, the Election Commission will have to take the call after the seat falls vacant and notify byelections by May 15. It all depends on the EC, which cant be forced to notify the bypoll by May 15, said senior lawyer Anil Sinha.         
	Yesterday, Hemant had persuaded 14 JMM MLAs to back the BJP-led government.         
	Today, deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto held a closed door meeting with Soren. JMM ministers Hemlal Murmu, Mathura Mahto and Haji Hussain Ansari and JD (U) minister Sudha Chaudhary were also present at the meet.        
	Sudesh later told The Telegraph that he had asked both BJP and JMM to sort out the leadership issue soon and pull the state out of the political crisis. I believe they will hold meetings soon, he said, adding he had not set any deadline for the warring partners to resolve the issue.        
	In another development, BJP national general secretary Arjun Munda arrived in Ranchi today, though he categorically denied that he was in the state capital as the prospective chief minister.        
	I have come here as mahamantri (BJP national general secretary) and not as mukhyamantri, he clarified.        
	Munda said the BJP leadership issue would be discussed only after the BJP parliamentary board resolved all issues with the JMM.         
	BJP and JMM leaders are likely to sit together tomorrow to resolve the ongoing crisis in the state.                    
	Sources in both camps confirmed that a six-member JMM committee along with BJP state president and deputy chief minister Raghubar Das would leave for Delhi tomorrow by a chartered flight.        
	Das, who remained busy throughout the day with his MLAs, trying to garner support for his chief ministerial bid, could not be contacted for comment.        
	JMM had constituted a six-member team yesterday comprising Hemant, Hemlal Murmu, Haji Hussain Ansari, Mathura Mahto, Shashank Shekhar Bhokta and Nalin Soren to hold talks with the BJP.         
	In Delhi, the BJP hoped to get a clearer picture from the Jharkhand leaders who would brief Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and the others tomorrow.         
	We are waiting and watching, said Sushma, but refused to crystal-gaze. Ananth Kumar, a general secretary who was tasked to monitor the developments along with Rajnath, sounded more optimistic.         
	We have run several coalition governments in the past. The durability and longevity of the Jharkhand coalition hinges on two factors: on whether there is a transfer of power (from the JMM to BJP) and on whether we are in a position to win the confidence vote, he said.        
	 Asked if the BJP would at all venture for the power transfer if it was not convinced it had the requisite number of MLAs, Kumar said: This is a wrong perception. We have held talks with our state party and our allies. The problem is not of numbers. We are discussing the future structures of power, the talks are on and once those structures are in place, then we will come back to our parliamentary board that will take a final call.         
	Sources admitted that the BJP was unsure of its support. Its state leaders have conveyed that they were not convinced if Hemant Soren could carry the JMM legislature party along because as long as Shibu is around, he will remain the undisputed public face of the party for the people, its main vote-catcher.        
	Hemant is seen as a usurper, a source claimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Modi business thrust on Congress turf
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Modi business thrust on Congress turf
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                             Modi in Hyderabad. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, Dec. 5: Narendra Modi is fishing in Andhra Pradeshs troubled waters, holding the Nano as bait.         
	 Come with your problems and projects, stay back with solutions and satisfaction, the chief minister told industry leaders in Hyderabad today, inviting them to invest in Gujarat.         
	One-day governance in Gujarat has become popular like one-day cricket, Modi told a gathering of around 600 CII members who included IT and manufacturing sector entrepreneurs. We have 225 centres in the state where one comes in the morning with their problems and projects and by evening, goes away with solutions and necessary permissions.         
	Andhra, which has just seen a change of chief minister and is reeling under a series of agitations, has had to postpone the last meeting of district collectors slated for November 25-26, the Assembly session that was to begin on November 29 as well as recruitments in government departments.         
	New chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy conceded that 12-13 agitations are still under way. Government employees unions have, however, withdrawn their strike giving him some time to settle down.         
	So, Modis road show could not have come at a better time. He is in the state with a 15-member team of IAS officers to sell Gujarat as the global destination to live and do business in.         
	If you take tea in Singapore, you will taste Gujarats milk and if you ask for vegetables anywhere in Europe, you will get bhindi from my state, he told the meeting organised by the Andhra chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry.         
	The presence of Nano and Bombardier are examples of our growth potential and environment, Modi bragged, claiming there was zero loss of man days in his state.         
	The Nano project went to Sanand in Gujarat after political protests did not allow it to take off in Singur in Bengal.         
	The Gujarat chief minister showcased opportunities for investment in his state, discussed trade partnerships and extended an invitation to the Vibrant Gujarat summit scheduled on January 12 and 13 in Gandhinagar.         
	He promised IT and manufacturing companies personal attention if needed and highlighted that Gujarat had achieved a 30.8 per cent hike in per capita income in five years.         
	Similar meetings have been held in Chennai, Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi.         
	I am proud to say Gujarat has more or less realised the dream of Rajiv Gandhi of delivering the benefits of government welfare schemes to the people. Rajiv Gandhi had once said that for every rupee sent from Delhi, hardly 10 paise reached the poor in villages. But today I can say that for every Re 1 spent by the government, the poor have received over Rs 1,000 in income, Modi said.

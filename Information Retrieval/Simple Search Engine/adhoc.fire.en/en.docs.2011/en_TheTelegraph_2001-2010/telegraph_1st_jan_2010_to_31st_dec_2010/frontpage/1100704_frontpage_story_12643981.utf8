The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Don to dusk at Dalma
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Don to dusk at Dalma
  - Life-changing moments with a rogue tusker          JAYESH THAKER                                          
	Jamshedpur, July 3: Two families from Jamshedpur were lucky to come out of a potentially life-threatening situation while driving atop Dalma Hills today when a rogue tusker took an unlikely liking for their car and played with it for an agonising 30 minutes, before leaving it slumped near a drain.        
	Steel city resident and former Navy commander Debasish Mukherjee and his daughter Debashree, here on holiday from the US where she is studying, were accompanied by hotelier Ronnie DCosta and his wife Marian in their weekend outing.         
	All were forced to leave their Maruti Swift and run for cover when the tusker, known as the Don for its foul temper, appeared from nowhere and tried to lift it from the front.        
	Initially, we remained anchored in our seats even when the tusker was lifting the car. We had to take a quick decision, recalled Ronnie. When we realised that the target of the elephant was the car and not us, we abandoned it and ran helter-skelter.         
	It was only five hours later, that forest officials found out and came to their rescue.         
	The Mukherjees and DCostas left Jamshedpur around 5.30 am. We reached the forest guest house at Pinderbara (in Dalma) an hour later and had breakfast there before leaving for the hill top, he said.         
	It was around 7 am and they had barely travelled 3 km when they spotted the elephant, staring menacingly at the car. After waiting for a few minutes, the tusker came towards the car and again went back only to come down again.         
	The jumbo then lifted the car from the front before shifting it into a nearby drain.        
	After jumping out of the car, Debashree saw a railway tower. While the others waited, she ran towards it in search of help. We waited there for over half-an-hour, expecting help to come our way. But the staff at the tower were of no help even though she (Debashree) pleaded, Ronnie said.                          
	Somehow, news of the incident reached the mobile police who alerted the forest department. My wife also informed our hotel staff and asked them to send a car to Dalma, he added.        
	Dalma range officer Sushil Oraon, armed with fire crackers and loudpspeakers to drive away the tusker, arrived with his team around 1 pm. The team then tied the car to the officers jeep and pulled out the wheels from the drain.         
	It took about 15 minutes actually, the car was tilting towards the drain, he said.        
	Ultimately, the car was saved, but with some damage to the front grills. And it was in that the group drove back to Jamshedpur by 6.30pm.        
	 It was the experience of a lifetime. It is fate which brought us back, said Ronnie, the owner of a hotel in Bistupur.        
	The Mukherjees were all praise for the forest officers, including wildlife conservator S.E.H. Kazmi, who came all the way from Ranchi. Debasish said he had been to Dalma for trekking earlier but had never had encountered a tusker.        
	 But for daughter Debashree, who is pursuing her PhD in cinema from New York University, it was the first time to the hills that boasts a breathtaking view.        
	Ronnie said the forest officials were a godsend. They were thoroughly professional and knew how to tackle the situation. We were also told about certain dos and donts while facing a crisis of such magnitude, he added.

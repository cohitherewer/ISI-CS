                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                PCPA alleges CPIM in train derailment
 															                                              Rescue operations continue on the fatal Jnaneswari Express      Midnapore, May 30 (PTI) : The Maoist-backed organisation, People's Committee against Police Atrocities today denied any involvement in Jnaneswari Express derailment. They charged the CPI-M with ldquo;hatching the plot rdquo; against them. 
    rdquo;We have no intention to target trains and we condemn and mourn such a colossal loss of civilian lives, rdquo; PCPA convener, Asit Mahato told. A day after the state police claimed to have identified two persons of the PCPA recently released on bail having a hand in the derailment of the train's 13 coaches, Mahato said, rdquo;Politically motivated statements are being issued to separate us from the masses. rdquo;
    rdquo;We will take out a procession in the Jangalmahal to mourn the dead in the train disaster. We strongly condemn such acts which take lives of common, innocent men and we express deep shock, rdquo; Mahato expressed.
    Countering police's claim, the PCPA leader named four CPI-M district and local leaders and alleged ldquo;Under their leadership, the CPI(M) has opened camps in the last 15 days at Burjoli, Kolla, Patri and Dahimara villages close to Sardiha where the express train derailed. rdquo;
    Mahato further alleged the four CPI(M) leaders ldquo;conspired to create panic by triggering a train mishap and the objective is to malign us and take us away from the people in Jangalmahal by creating a bad name for us. rdquo;
    The PCPA leader said ldquo;CPI(M) had plans to politically isolate Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee so that she is forced to resign under directive of the UPA government after the train mishap rdquo;.
  rdquo;We strongly protest against such a conspiracy by the CPI(M) which led to such a heinous crime, rdquo; Mahato said.
    The Railway Minister said the previous day that there was ldquo;a political conspiracy rdquo; in the derailment of the Jnaneswari Express two days ahead of the civic polls in the state.
    The mishap that occurred in the wee hours on Friday has claimed 148 lives so far.

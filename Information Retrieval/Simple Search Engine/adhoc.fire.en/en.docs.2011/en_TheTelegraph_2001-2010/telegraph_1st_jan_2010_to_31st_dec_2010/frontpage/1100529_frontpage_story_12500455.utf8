          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 28: The Jnaneswari Express tragedy has prompted the railways to suspend the movement of passenger trains in the Kharagpur-Rourkela and Kharagpur-Adra sections of South Eastern Railway from 10pm to 5am till June 1.        
	Several trains in these sections have been cancelled or rescheduled.        
	The Saturday trains that have been cancelled are the 2021/2022 Howrah-Barbil Janashatabdi Express, 2871/2872 Howrah-Titlagarh Ispat Express, 2813/2814 Howrah-Tatanagar Steel Express, 355/316 Howrah-Adra-Chakradharpur Passenger, 8003/8004 Jhargram-Purulia Biweekly Express and the 8617/8618 Howrah-Ranchi Express (via Tatanagar).        
	The departure of some of the trains has been deferred from Friday evening to Saturday morning. They are the Howrah-Mumbai Mail via Nagpur (5am), Howrah-Lokmanya Tilak (via Adra) Samarsata Express (5.15am), Howrah-Pune Azad Hind Express (5.30am), Howrah-Porbandar Express (6am) and the Howrah-Ahmedabad Express (6.55am). The Puri-bound Sri Jagannath Express, which was scheduled to leave Howrah on Friday evening, has been rescheduled to 2pm on Saturday.        
	The next few days schedule for these trains will be announced later, an official said.        
	A few other trains such as the Howrah-Koraput Express and the Howrah-Hatia Express have been rescheduled but their departure time is yet to be decided, the official added.        
	The arrival of several Howrah-bound trains could be delayed in the next 24 hours and some might be cancelled on the way.         
	The trains that were cancelled on Friday included the 2021/2022 Howrah-Barbil Janashatabdi Express, 2871/2872 Howrah-Titlagarh Ispat Express, 2813/2814 Howrah-Tatanagar Steel Express and the 8645 Howarh-Hyderabad East Coast Express.        
	Panic was the order of the day in Jharkhand. Twenty relatives of a Calcutta girl, who is tying the knot tomorrow, cancelled their plans to travel from Jamshedpur and Ghatshila.        
	I am disheartened. What is a marriage without your maternal relatives? bride-to-be Shraddha Bajaj said.        
	Most people take the Steel or Ispat Express to Howrah. Theres the Janashatabdi, too.         
	Jamshedpurs lifelines have been snapped. First, air services were withdrawn. Now, Maoists have turned train travel into a nightmare, said Suresh Sonthalia, the general secretary of the Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	Track crack: The Howrah-bound Amritsar Mail was detained for 23 minutes in Burdwan after a crack was spotted in the tracks. Once the crack, blamed on temperature variations, was repaired, the train proceeded.

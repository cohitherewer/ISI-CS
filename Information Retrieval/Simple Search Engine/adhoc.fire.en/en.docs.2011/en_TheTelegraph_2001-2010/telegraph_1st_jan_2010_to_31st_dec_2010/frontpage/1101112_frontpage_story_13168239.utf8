          OUR BUREAU                                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: J. Jayalalithaa today dramatically offered support to the UPA government in return for sacking telecom minister and DMK soft-spot A. Raja, evoking a lukewarm public response from the Congress but gifting it a chance to widen a clean-up operation.        
	The ADMK chief told Times Now television channel that she would replace the DMKs 18 Lok Sabha MPs with her nine MPs and those from several other parties.         
	If the Congress is able to summon up the political will to act against Raja, I can show to the Congress that the political coalition doesnt have to collapse and the nation doesnt have to face another mid-term poll, she told the channel.        
	Jayalalithaa specifically said she and friendly parties could find 18 MPs  with one or two to spare  to make up the loss if the DMK pulled out. (Excerpts of interview on Page 8)        
	In public, the Congress played by the avowed principles of coalition dharma, saying there is no vacancy in Tamil Nadu and that at the moment, it is clear that the DMK is our important ally.        
	However, sources said that such a public overture by Jayalalithaa, who cherishes deportment, was unlikely to have come without some sort of contact with the Congress.        
	DMK leader M. Karunanidhis daughter and MP Kanimozhi met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in Parliament today. A DMK spokesperson dismissed demands for Raja to step down but sources said Jayalalithaas offer to the Congress had rattled the ruling party in Tamil Nadu.        
	A leaked Comptroller and Auditor General of India report has held Raja responsible for selling the 2G spectrum at lower-than-market rates in 2008, costing the exchequer over Rs 1.76 lakh crore.        
	Both Houses were adjourned today following a furore over Raja. Tomorrow being a holiday for Chhath, Parliament will next meet on Monday.        
	Many Congress leaders feel that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who will return from the G20 summit tomorrow, will be compelled to take the matter up with Karunanidhi if Parliament remains paralysed even in the next week.        
	Sources said there would be greater clarity after November 18. While the CAG report will be available by then, the wedding of Karunanidhis grandson too will be over.        
	The offer by Jayalalithaa, whose decision to withdraw support led to the collapse of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1999, may not quite be a lifeline to the Congress. But it has come as a shot in the arm for UPA II at a time both Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan are making efforts to counter the image of a government wracked by indecision.        
	The Congress is not about to jettison the DMK and rush into Jayalalithaas open arms. But her offer makes it a lot easier for Manmohan to do what he has wanted for a long time get rid of the scam-tainted Raja, the centrepiece of a long-awaited and repeatedly postponed cabinet shuffle.        
	Jayalalithaas timing has been perfect. After more than a year of drift when many were wondering why UPA II  despite a stronger Congress and untramelled by the Left was looking like a lame-duck government, the Centre had begun to get its act together.        
	Instead of brushing under the carpet the corruption charges in the afterglow of the spectacular Commonwealth Games, Manmohan and Sonia ensured that a thorough probe was ordered a day after the closing ceremony. That was what the Prime Minister had promised Parliament: let us do everything to make the Games a success and then we will deal with the dirt.        
	Manmohan and Sonia stuck to the same script when the Adarsh scandal broke. Neither spoke out in public but it was clear that Ashok Chavans offer to quit had been made on their orders.        
	Within minutes of Air Force One taking off from Delhi after Barack Obamas visit, Chavan was publicly issued marching orders. Suresh Kalmadi was also removed from his party post.        
	Along with the ouster of Shashi Tharoor, these steps have sent out a signal to the media-amplified vocal middle class: the Sonia-Manmohan combo is attuned to the pulse of not just the mythical aam aadmi but also to people like us.        
	Yet, there is the matter of Raja. Other allies, notably Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjee, are cause for headache but it is the DMKs brazen defiance of gentle calls for Rajas exit that has caused the government the greatest discomfiture.        
	To take action against the Congress flock  Tharoor, Kalmadi, Chavan  was easy. It even served a purpose: it showed the Congress had higher standards of probity than most allies or even opponents.        
	But beyond a point, the Congresss holier-than-thou attitude can be counter-productive  especially for Manmohan because a Prime Minister heads a government, not a party.        
	To not be able to choose ministers may be a reality of coalition governments, but not to be free to drop tainted ministers can deeply erode prime ministerial authority.        
	Thats a message that is likely to be conveyed to the DMK headquarters in the coming days. Jayalalithaa has made it a lot easier to convey it.

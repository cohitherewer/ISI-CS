The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Paternity test for Tiwari
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Paternity test for Tiwari
  - Court cites evidence, upholds childs right to know father          RASHEED KIDWAI                            A photograph of a young Rohit with his mother Ujjwala and ND Tiwari that was produced as evidence in court                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Veteran Congress leader Narain Dutt Tiwari will have to undergo a paternity test after all.        
	Delhi High Court today ruled that the 85-year-old must take a DNA test to determine whether he was the biological father of Rohit Shekhar, a lawyer in his early 30s who filed the paternity suit.        
	There is imminent need for him (Tiwari) to give blood samples to conduct the scientific test, Justice S. Ravindra Bhat said, ruling in the first paternity suit involving a political figure in India.        
	Tiwari and Rohit  who has all along demanded that Tiwari undergo the test  will have to submit their blood samples on February 8 to the high courts joint registrar. The samples will be sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, which functions under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. The next hearing is on May 6.        
	The judge rejected Tiwaris plea that he could not be forced into the test, explaining in his 24-page order that there was strong circumstantial evidence to warrant such an examination.        
	Citing international laws that say it is a childs right to know its paternity, Justice Bhat said the court could order such a test in the interest of an individual.        
	He said that even though a paternity test could show a person to be an illegitimate child, the vital interests of a child to not be branded illegitimate could not take away his right to know who his real father was.        
	Tiwari said he would abide by the judgment. The courts decisions are supreme. Tiwariji will abide by the high courts decision, Sanjay Joshi, his spokesperson, told PTI in Dehra Dun.                    
	A delighted Rohit said: Justice has been delivered. This was the only route to justice. The court has differentiated between legitimacy, illegitimacy and paternity.        
	His mother Ujjwala Sharma, who came in contact with Tiwari in the late 1960s when she was married to another man and was general secretary of the All India Young Women Congress, shared her sons joy. Words cannot express my feelings, she said.        
	Rohit had filed the suit in April 2008 when Tiwari was the Andhra Pradesh governor. Tiwari had sought immunity under Article 361 of the Constitution, which protects the President and governors from being answerable to any court of law.         
	Tiwaris lawyers had argued that when Rohit was born, his mother was married to B.P. Sharma. They had cited Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act, which provides for the legal presumption that a child born to a married woman is the legitimate child of the husband.        
	In response, Sharma and Rohit voluntarily underwent a DNA test to establish that they were not father and son, and submitted the report to the court. The high court said: Legitimacy and paternity are both valid interests of the child that may be accorded recognition under Indian law without prejudice to each other.        
	Legal experts said Tiwari  a freedom fighter, four-time chief minister and former Union minister  can move the Supreme Court but the chances of him earning a reprieve are small.        
	For Tiwari, the paternity suit is not the lone cause for embarrassment. About a year ago, he had to resign as Andhra governor after TV channels showed purported images of him in what looked like a sex romp in the Raj Bhavan.

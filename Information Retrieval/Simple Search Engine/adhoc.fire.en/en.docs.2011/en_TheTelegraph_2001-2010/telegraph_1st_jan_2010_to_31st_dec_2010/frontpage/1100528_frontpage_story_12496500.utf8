The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ke nako for Cup visa

	New Delhi, May 27: Footfall frenzy for footballs greatest event.        
	This June, more Indians will travel to South Africa for the World Cup than ever before, except the time when the British shipped thousands to work as indentured labourers over a hundred years back.        
	Ke nako (it is time), the South African high commission in Delhi is reminding Indians. The phrase, in South Africas Sotho language, is also the official slogan for the 19th Fifa World Cup.        
	The message is that it is time for Indians who wish to travel to the tournament to book their tickets and apply for visas.         
	Nearly 90,000 additional tickets, the last big lot to be made available for the public, will be up for sale tomorrow for the month-long event starting June 11.        
	Commission officials have two requests for visiting Indians. The first is to file visa applications 10 days before departure. This will help the mission deliver (visas) efficiently and on time, said high commissioner Rev Harris Majeke.        
	The second appeal is a little uncanny. Our (South African) team will win, but not without some Indian help. Indians are famous magicians. So take that magic with you. Whenever Bafana Bafana (the South African team) play, our opponents, with help from some Indian magic, should just fall asleep. After all, we (India and South Africa) are partners, a senior high commission official today said to peals of laughter at a news conference.        
	The hint apparently was that the South African team had only a slim chance of lifting the Cup in Johannesburg on July 11. But he was also underlining the close ties, so much so that South African President Jacob Zuma will be on a state visit to India on June 4 and 5, barely a week before the Cup kicks off.        
	Such is the rush from India that the high commissions immigration and consular section has had to request for an extra official from South Africa to cope with the pile of visa applications.        
	On average, 10,000 Indian tourists visit South Africa in May-June each year. In 2009, the figure was nearly 20,000, much of it because of the IPL. Commission officials expect the number to go up this year.         
	South Africans are proud of having accomplished the preparations in time when many around the world doubted their ability. There was an impression you would be shot at as soon as you land in South Africa. A German made money out of selling bullet-proof vests to fans, another in the US sold bullet-proof helmets, said high commissioner Majeke.

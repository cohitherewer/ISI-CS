          DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY                              
	Kakdwip, Sept.15: Six persons were killed and 12 were missing when a mechanised boat packed with pilgrims on a nationwide tour organised by a railway unit capsized today just before reaching a jetty in South 24-Parganas.        
	The boat, carrying pilgrims from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab, sank in Muriganga river, near the jetty at Kakdwip, around 85km from Calcutta.        
	District officials said the victims were part of a 300-strong group criss-crossing the country in a chartered train called Bharat Darshan. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) describes the tour as one of the most affordable, all-inclusive tour packages.        
	Travelling from Delhi, the pilgrims reached Santragachhi this morning, from where they proceeded to Sagar Islands. The pilgrims were returning to Kakdwip in three mechanised boats, two of which reached the jetty.        
	The third, which police said was carrying 72 passengers instead of the prescribed 40 to 50, was nearing the jetty when it capsized.        
	A boatman had hurled a rope and it was tied to a wooden post. The passengers had crowded on one side, preparing to step onto the jetty. But the rope came loose and the boat capsized after hitting the shallows, said a police officer.         
	One of the rescued passengers, Kailash Bhat, said the tour operators had promised a proper passenger vessel but could only provide common mechanised boats.        
	An Eastern Railway official said a Chennai-based travel agency had chartered the train from IRCTC.        
	However, Amlan Biswas, the group general manager (east zone) of IRCTC, said the tour was conducted by the corporations north zone. These trips are conducted by IRCTC. But help from travel agents is sought. The boats were hired by IRCTC personnel who were accompanying the tourists.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee was not available for comment.         
	A police officer said the boat had capsized in chest-deep water. But as the tide was low, there was a current and those missing could have been dragged deep into the river, the officer said.        
	Four of the dead have been identified as B.B. Bhat, 70 (Delhi); Kamalesh Tiwari, 46 (Delhi); Margosri Devi, 60 (Uttar Pradesh) and Kamalavati Ojha, 63 (Varanasi).

	Kolkata, Sept 6 (PTI): Launching an attack on the ruling CPI(M) in West Bengal, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today accused the party of ldquo;grabbing rdquo; crores of rupees from central funds meant for the uplift of the poor and downtrodden.   
	 rdquo;UPA government is sending crores of rupees to the state under different schemes, including NREGA, but the fund is being siphoned off and going to the CPI(M) coffers. This has been going on for 33 years, rdquo; he told a Youth Congress rally at the Shahid Mindar maidan here.   
	 In a hard-hitting speech, he said, ldquo;Under the CPI(M) rule, there are two Bengals. One is for CPI(M) which is shining and the second is for you -- the Bengal of the poor (Aapka Hamara aur Garibo ka Bengal). rdquo;   
	Referring to his last visit to China, Gandhi said, ldquo;The Communists in China are also questioning the functioning of the CPI(M) in West Bengal. rdquo;The 70 or 80-year old ideology of the Communists, which has become obsolete in the rest of the world, still exists here (West Bengal) and this exists for the CPI(M) too. This is not for you. rdquo;   
	Recalling the end of Communism in the erstwhile USSR, he said, ldquo;CPI(M) too is realising that those days are coming here in West Bengal. rdquo; The Communists' days were ldquo;numbered rdquo; in West Bengal, he felt.   
	The Congress leader said when he wanted to revive his party in UP, people had asked him not to go to that state as Congress cannot be revived there. rdquo;Now Congress is rejuvenated in UP, rdquo; he observed.

	SPG personnel had a difficult time as Rahul Gandhi crossed the barricades and shook hands with the crowd who raised slogans 'Rahul Gandhi Zindabad'.  
	Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukhkerjee expressed the hope that Rahul Gandhi's leadership would give a boost to the Congress party in the state. rdquo;We will have to stand beside Rahul, the new generation Congress leader, in his endeavour to strengthen the party in four states -- UP, Bihar, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu which account for 40 per cent of Lok Sabha seats, rdquo; he said.   
	Gandhi's brief speech, mostly confined to CPI(M) bashing, was applauded by the crowd frequently. In his first ever public rally in the city, the AICC General Secretary said 45 per cent of the people in the state have no ration cards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ball-size bomb found in plane cargo hold
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ball-size bomb found in plane cargo hold
          OUR BUREAU                      Police at the airport after 
  the alert on Sunday. (PTI)                          
	March 21: A crude bomb the size of a cricket ball was found in the cargo hold of a Kingfisher flight from Bangalore shortly after it landed in Thiruvananthapuram this morning, exposing a hole in the countrys flight security system.        
	Cleaning staff detected the low-intensity bomb after the 27 passengers and four-member crew of flight IT 4731 had got off the ATR aircraft.        
	The bomb was made of potassium chlorate, gunpowder (30gm) and aluminium and was wrapped in pages from the January 13 edition of a Malayalam daily and a question paper of the Kerala school board examination.        
	No timers or detonators were found, but sources claimed chlorate can explode under the impact of variations in the atmospheric pressure. The pressure inside an aircraft is carefully maintained.        
	Kerala police said the particular copy of the newspaper had been published from Thiruvananthapuram, although an earlier PTI report claimed it was from the Bangalore edition of the Malayalam daily. The police are also trying to identify the school that had distributed the particular question paper.        
	The bomb squad defused the bomb and handed the materials over to the local police station. The aircraft was searched at the remote bay area before it was allowed to fly back to Bangalore around 2pm.        
	The incident comes at a time a National Investigation Agency team is in Kerala, unearthing terror plots and netting suspects. The police think the bomb scare was a trial run by, and a warning from, terror groups.        
	Its not clear whether the bomb was planted in Bangalore before take-off or in Thiruvananthapuram after landing. Airport and airline authorities in Bangalore denied any security lapse.        
	The two screenings of the registered (checked-in) baggage by the airport security and hand baggage check by the CISF were performed and cleared, a Bangalore International Airport statement said.        
	A Kingfisher spokesperson said the airlines checks had cleared the aircraft before it left Bangalore at 6.30am.        
	In an ATR plane, baggage is placed in two sections  at the front behind the cockpit and at the galley at the back from where snacks are served - unlike bigger planes, which normally have a cargo hold in their bellies.        
	The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security has started an inquiry.

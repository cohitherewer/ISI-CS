  - Succession signal from communist regime          OUR BUREAU AND NYTNS                            Kim Jong-il (top) and a photograph of a person believed to be his son Kim Jong-un                                      
	Sept. 21: In the season of ifs and buts buffeting a three-decade-plus communist regime, another far removed is preparing to repeat a 30-year-old ritual but without the tormenting uncertainties at play in Bengal.        
	North Korea announced today that the ruling Workers Party would hold a significant gathering next week, the first such congress in 30 years that could signal the formal designation of Kim Jong-ils youngest son as his heir apparent.        
	North Korea said the conference to elect the communist states supreme leadership body would be held in the capital, Pyongyang, on September 28.        
	To be sure, the North Korean meeting will be replete with ifs  made fashionable in Bengal this week by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee who has since clarified that he was not doubting the longevity of the Left Front government  but it will not be about the identity of the frontrunner.        
	The doubts surrounding the Pyongyang congress are mostly about how the event will play itself out  outside observers will need the acumen of a Sherlock Holmes, a water diviner, a tea-leaf reader  all rolled into one  to crack the clues and hazard a guess on what is happening inside North Korea.        
	Another must-have for political sleuths: acquaintance with a quaint vocabulary, peppered with words such as glorious, guiding star and Dear Leader, that will make many comrades in India misty-eyed about the, well, glorious days of slogan-building.        
	Some comrades may also recall how red  and reassuringly predictable  was their valley, considering North Korea is preparing to pass the baton to a third-generation heir. From Kim Il-sung to his son Kim Jong-il and now probably to grandson Kim Jong-un, untrammelled by that annoying factor called popular elections which the Bengal communists will have to face next year.        
	The CPM considers the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (never North Korea) a socialist country but refrains from stressing the point the way it does while dealing with issues involving China or Cuba.         
	In recent years, North Korea rarely figured in statements released by the party. But an old-timer recalled that the library of AKG Bhavan, the CPM headquarters in Delhi, had shelves and shelves filled with the collected works of the Great Kim Il-sung.        
	Its not 100 per cent certain... but I would say its 99 per cent sure that Kim Jong-un will be confirmed as the successor, said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. He will be presented to the party and the people on the 28th as the new genius of leadership, the guiding star of the 21st century, something like that.                     
	Lankov and other analysts said the younger Kim was expected to be given a politburo post and perhaps a senior position in the government, although they did not expect he would be named chairman of the all-powerful National Defence Commission.        
	In the absence of any official announcement, here are some clues to look out for.        
	A parade and public gatherings are not expected to celebrate Kim Jong-uns emergence, analysts said, although his official portrait would perhaps soon be appearing in North Koreas shops, offices, homes and public places. Poems and songs also will start to be heard, Lankov said, along with stories about his greatness.         
	But some analysts were more cautious about Kim Jong-uns prospects at the party meeting next week, suggesting the gathering would more likely introduce a party leadership that will help him solidify and expand his power base before he eventually inherits power. Even if he does receive significant appointments, these analysts said, the regime might refrain from announcing them right away. Like occasional sightings of UFOs, some analysts also speak of signs of a power struggle in the North.        
	Kim Jong-il, now 68, was introduced to North Korea  and to most of the outside world  at the last Workers Party conference, held in 1980. He took over from his father, Kim Il-sung, the founder of the modern North Korean state, upon his fathers death in 1994. That passage of power came gradually and peacefully, with the son undergoing years of grooming, study and tutelage.        
	Kim Jong-un has had no such training  political or military  and he remains something of a cipher. He doesnt know much about anything, Lankov said.         
	Very few pictures of him are known to exist in public and even his age is uncertain  27 or 28. He attended a private school in Switzerland for a time, and its believed that he speaks English.        
	Kim Jong-ils former sushi chef, who wrote a memoir in 2003, said in an interview last year that as a teenager, Kim Jong-un was already his fathers favourite among his three sons and looked just like him.        
	Intelligence officials in Seoul and Washington have tried in the past year  with mixed results  to compile a dossier on Kim Jong-un to better understand the potential future leader of a nuclear-armed state. He is described as a man of medium height, and a bit overweight, with high blood pressure and perhaps diabetes.         
	He is, the reports suggest, very much like his father, the so-called Dear Leader.        
	We picture a charismatic young man, authoritarian, politically astute and precocious and ambitious, Cheong Seong-chang, a researcher at the Sejong Institute, near Seoul, said at the time. We picture Little Kim Jong-il.        
	Since the grandfather was called the Great Leader and the father Dear Leader, another question remains to be settled: what will be title of the communist princeling?        
	Baby Leader, perhaps, inspired by Haitis Papa Doc and Baby Doc.                    WITH A REPORT FROM NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

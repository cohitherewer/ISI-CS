          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Muivah                                  
	Kohima, June 4: NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah arrived at Pfutsero in Phek district this morning on a goodwill mission after camping at Viswema for nearly a month.        
	Thousands of people, waving flags of the outfit, accorded a warm welcome to the Naga leaders entourage led by the Chakhesang Public Organisation.         
	NSCN (I-M) sources said Muivah would camp at Pfutsero for about two weeks before chalking out his tour schedule.         
	The sources said he would visit districts like Mokokchung, Zunheboto, Tuensang and Mon to strengthen the peace process.         
	Earlier, Muivah left Viswema, a village 20 km from here, around 9 this morning and reached Pfutsero, 70km from here, at 11.30am.         
	Phek district, with a strong population of the Chakhesang indigenous community, is a stronghold of the Naga National Council (NNC) led by Adinno Phizo. Muivah was elected general secretary of NNC in 1964 from Viswema, which, according to him, was a turning point in his life.         
	Addressing a packed town hall at Pfutsero, Muivah said his visit to Phek district was basically on a goodwill mission and to acknowledge the Chakhesang people for their contribution to Naga nationalism.         
	He lauded the Chakhesang community for being steadfast to the Naga issue despite all odds. Muivah, however, cautioned that there were pseudo-Naga nationalists who were hand-in-glove with adversaries to undermine the Naga political issue.         
	The NSCN (I-M) leader appreciated the contributions of the founders of Naga nationalism like Phizo, Kughato Sukhai, Imkongmeren, Khadao Yanthan and Sakhrie. However, he was also critical of the NNC leaders who did not condemn or utter a word against 1975 Shillong Accord which accepted the Constitution of India unconditionally.         
	Muivah said discord and division among the Naga people started from the Shillong Accord.         
	On reconciliation, the NSCN (I-M) general secretary said that it was initiated by his group and was later handed over to the Forum for Naga Reconciliation which is now headed by a Baptist clergyman Rev. Wati Aier. Muivah said his group would not drift away from such a process.         
	He, however, regretted the fact that some people, ignoring the aspirations and desires of the Naga people, were vigorously working to derail the peace and reconciliation process.         
	Muivah particularly pulled up NSCN (Khaplang) leaders like Kitovi Zhimomi and Kughalu Mulatonu, whom he accused of resorting to divisive politics.         
	He was critical of the assertion by the two Khaplang faction leaders that Nagas of Nagaland alone should resolve the long-pending political problem with the Centre. Naga political issue is not confined to only Nagaland state, the NSCN (I-M) leader said.         
	Muivah said the Naga political problem was there before Nagaland became a state. He said Nagaland (as a state) was the offshoot of the 16-point agreement signed between the Centre and the overground Naga politicians.         
	He also reiterated that any settlement of the Naga problem would be within the uniqueness of Naga history and that the government of India has acknowledged this.         
	During his stay at Pfutsero, Muivah will meet leaders of Chakhesang community and brief them about the current political situation.

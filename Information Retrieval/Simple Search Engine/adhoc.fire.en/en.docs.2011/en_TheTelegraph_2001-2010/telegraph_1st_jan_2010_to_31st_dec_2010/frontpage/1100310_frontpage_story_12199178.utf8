                                In happier times                            
	London, March 9: Rumours that French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy are both having affairs are gaining momentum in France.        
	The suggestion that the couple were both committing adultery first emerged on Twitter, the microblogging website. It was followed by a report in the Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche.        
	The first tweet claimed that Carla Bruni-Sarkozy had become romantically involved with Benjamin Biolay, a musician and a winner at Frances recent Victoires de la Musique awards.        
	It then claimed that the jilted Sarkozy had swiftly found solace in the arms of his 40-year-old ecology minister Chantal Jouanno.        
	French Web magazine suchablog.com alleged that Carla Bruni-Sarkozy had been a close friend of Biolay for many years and was now unofficially living with him at his flat in Paris.        
	The rumours were given extra weight after being reported in an blog on the website of the Journal. The paper wrote: Its the gossip of the moment that could become the story of the year. A romance is said to have started a few weeks ago between the First Lady of France and music award winner Benjamin Biolay. The rumour started on Twitter and is now on blogs and websites.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

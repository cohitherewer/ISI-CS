	New Delhi, July 27 (PTI): Truckers today threatened to go on an indefinite strike from August 6 to protest the present toll policy and demanded lower toll tax.
    Nearly 62 lakh trucks would remain off the roads from August 6, bringing movement of goods throughout the country to a halt, as a "faulty" toll policy is causing them a loss of Rs 5,000 crore a day, the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) said.
    "The managing committee of AIMTC had decided to resort to the extreme step following government's failure to take any step to rationalise toll collections despite repeated demands," AIMTC President G R Shanmugappa told reporters here.
    AIMTC demanding rationalisation of toll charges and diesel prices and removal of anti-dumping duty on tyres.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Anand ready for probe into deals
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Anand ready for probe into deals
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 13: National Games Organising Committee (NGOC) working chairman R.K. Anand has said he is ready for a probe into financial irregularities alleged in the Principal Accountant Generals (PAG) audit report prepared between April 2008 and December 2009.        
	We have nothing to shield. In fact, I asked Governor M..H. Farook to order a probe when I met him last week during the Queens Baton relay, Anand said, reacting to The Telegraph report published today highlighting the findings of the PAG audit report that cited financial impropriety in the purchase of sports equipment and finalisation of tenders for various services, including catering, transport and event management.        
	With the state under Presidents rule, the governor is ex-officio chairman of NGOC, a post that would have otherwise been held by the chief minister. The NGOC working chairman said he wanted to review all tenders awarded to various agencies, but added that any probe should not interfere with the Games schedule.        
	Anand claimed it was because of his complaint that sports director P.C. Mishra was suspended and a vigilance probe ordered against him in November 2009.        
	Significantly, the NGOC working chairman also said that on August 4, he wrote a letter to IOA chief Suresh Kalmadi seeking a clarification on his role in finalising tenders for buying video screens and electronic scoreboards for the Games athletics events.        
	The PAG report had raised serious objections against the manner in which a contract was awarded to a private firm, Gem International, for OMEGA brand of video screens and electronic scoreboards when its price was way too high.         
	Gem International was given the order for Rs 880.77 lakh, while another vendor, Shiv Naresh Sports, was offering the same equipment for Rs 155.86 lakh, resulting in extra expenditure of Rs 724.91 lakh.        
	The NGOC, in its reply to the PAG audit, had said the purchase of OMEGA score board had been made on the recommendation of NGOC secretary-general and tender committee member S.M. Hashmi.        
	After the PAG report was out, I asked Hashmi to clarify whether he made a noting on the file concerned that these equipment were purchased on the instruction of the IOA chief, Anand said.         
	And Hashmis stand was very clear  he said the list had been provided by Suresh Kalmadi and that he had been directed to purchase the particular kind of equipment.         
	Anand claimed he had also objected to awarding a contract to Wizcraft International for organising the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games.         
	I had also made it clear that the company should not be given any money in advance unless it was able to establish its credibility. Yet, the then sports director issued it an advance of Rs 259.54 lakh on December 23, 2008, he pointed out.         
	Wizcraft was awarded the contract at Rs 865.15 lakh ignoring claims of the lowest bidder, Brilliant Entertainment Network, which quoted Rs 681.68 lakh. The PAG audit referred to the deal and said that awarding a work order to Wizcraft resulted in a loss of Rs 183.47 lakh.

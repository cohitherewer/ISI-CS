	Feb. 23: The Dalai Lama is now on Twitter.        
	The exiled Tibetan leader has joined the microblogging site and a legion of celebrities and spiritual heads who have embraced technology to communicate with the faithful.         
	And with 55,000 followers in two days, DalaiLama could give the stars a run for their money.         
	The creation of the real Dalai Lamas account comes a year after Twitter suspended a fake account that attracted tens of thousands of followers. The Dalai Lama account created on Monday is a verified account.        
	It has sent seven messages so far, though they are not words of wisdom from His Holiness but links to articles and photos on his ongoing US visit.        
	In Los Angeles, the Dalai Lama had on Sunday met one of Twitters founders, Evan Williams. Pitched him on using Twitter. He laughed, Williams had tweeted later.        
	The Church of England has a fully interactive website, Twitter account, weekly podcasts and a Facebook group.         
	The Pope issues statements via video-sharing site YouTube, which complements the Vatican Television and Vatican Radio. He is also on Facebook. China, however, has blocked Twitter. President Hu Jintao is said to have launched his own microblog, powered by a service run by the Peoples Daily.

  - Samajwadi boss in bind on how to react to verdict         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      RAF personnel patrol a street in Ayodhya on Saturday. (PTI)                                
	Lucknow, Sept. 18: Less than a week before the Ayodhya title suit verdict is due, Mulayam Singh Yadav is unusually silent while Mayavati is cracking the whip.        
	The Samajwadi Party leader, who had been very vocal in his opposition to the Babri Masjid demolition, has not even issued an appeal for peace like other parties have. Sources said Mulayam cannot decide what stand he should take if the verdict goes in favour of the Sunni Waqf Board.        
	Mayavati, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Mulayams arch rival in state politics, has on the other hand made tight security arrangements to ensure there is peace.        
	Police today staged a flag march in Ayodhya, in which two companies of the Provincial Armed Constabulary participated. Senior superintendent of police R.K.S. Rathore said the flag march was meant to send a signal to antisocial elements in the city on the eve of the verdict.        
	Mayavatis security arrangements have won approval from the Congress and also the Muslim community, leaving the Samajwadi Party with no scope to point a finger.        
	Several Muslim leaders have said they are unhappy with Mulayams ambivalence. His party, they alleged, is keeping off pro-peace moves.        
	Muslims form an important vote bank for the Samajwadi Party.        
	We have always been saying that we would go by a court order or a settlement arrived through consensus, Mulayam said recently, in his only comment in the run-up to the verdict.        
	His party, which is trying to expand its vote base by wooing OBCs and Thakurs, had gone into the last election in alliance with Kalyan Singh, a temple movement leader and an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition, then parted ways with him and apologised to the minority community for the poll pact.        
	Mulayam is worried that if the verdict goes in favour of the Sunni board and his party supports it, it will hurt the Samajwadis efforts to court Thakurs and OBCs. The party would be in a better position to gain politically if the verdict goes against the Muslims, in which case the party can scream and shout against the BJP and Sangh parivar in a bid to recover its lost ground among Muslim supporters, a Samajwadi leader said.         
	Residents of Ayodhya have begun to revitalise citizens groups for peace.

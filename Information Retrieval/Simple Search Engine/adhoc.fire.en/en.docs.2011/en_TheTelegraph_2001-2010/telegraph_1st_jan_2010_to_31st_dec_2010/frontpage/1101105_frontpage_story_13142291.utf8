          OUR BUREAU                            A queue spills out of a jewellery showroom in Bhowanipore at 8.15pm on Wednesday. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	Nov. 4: Piety has met precious metals in the run-up to Diwali for gains that can be classified as divine.        
	The tradition of buying silver on Dhanteras  the auspicious occasion two days before Diwali  has expanded its material as well as geographical domain to include gold in the shopping list and more parts of India in its sweep.        
	The noticeably higher turnout yesterday at jewellery stores on the citys northern and southern fringes  primarily Bengali-dominated areas  seemed to back suggestions that Dhanteras was no longer confined to any particular group.        
	Buying silver on Dhanteras was more a north and west Indian tradition till 20-25 years ago. Now, it is observed across India. This shows people believe that performing puja to Mother Laxmi will result in addition to wealth, said Narendra Pandit, a Calcutta-based spiritual adviser.                   
	Whether the buyers who hotfooted it to the stores yesterday are believers or not, those who did so at the same time last year seem to be a blessed lot.        
	Gold-buyers on the last Dhanteras would have gained 23 per cent by now. Those who preferred silver would have made even higher gains: 36 per cent, 4 percentage points higher than the surge clocked by the sensex over the same period. Shares may have given better returns than gold this year but the stock markets are volatile. Besides, playing the market is not as simple as walking into a store and buying gold.         
	The price of gold per 10gm settled at Rs 19,960 at the close of the market in Calcutta today, marginally up from yesterdays Rs 19,945, while silver stood at Rs 37,750 a kg, up by Rs 250 since yesterdays close. Ten grams of gold cost Rs 16,200 in the corresponding period last year.        
	A diverse basket of buyers  those who stepped out of vehicles ranging from buses to sedans and people in their sixties to teens  bought the precious metals in many parts of the country. Officials of the Bombay Bullion Association put the value of gold and silver sold yesterday at Rs 1,200 crore.         
	Although the associations president, Suresh Hundia, rued a dip in the total value of gold sold  Rs 800 crore in comparison with Rs 891 crore during last years Dhanteras  the footfalls at jewellery stores came as a surprise to many.         
	I didnt know that people wait in queues to buy jewellery, said a policeman, requisitioned from the local police station for the specific assignment of maintaining order outside a jewellery store in Bhowanipore.        
	Inside the store, the sales team at the counters struggled to cope with the rush of customers buying gold coins, gold biscuits and a variety of jewellery.        
	According to Shankar Pandit, another city-based spiritual adviser, Dhanteras was traditionally an occasion to offer prayers to Dhanwantari, the physician of the gods, but expanded in scope and became a celebration of wealth and prosperity. The ritual was to buy silver on Dhanteras as Dhanwantari used to prepare medicines with silver dust, he said.        
	Pankaj Parekh, chairman (eastern region), the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said: During the Dhanteras-Diwali period, we would remove the gold items and only sell silver. But for the past 10-15 years, gold has been in the limelight in Calcutta.        
	Darshan Zaveri, director, Manubhai Zaveri Ornaments Pvt Ltd, Ahmedabad, spoke of an interesting trend. People are buying gold coins. Earlier, sales of these coins were around 12 per cent of the total. This year, it has risen to nearly 30 per cent, he said.        
	The higher demand for coins and gold bars  which retain value over years and are easy to sell  matched the conclusion of a young north Calcutta jeweller: the appetite for returns in a volatile financial market is driving the demand for the precious metals.        
	The queues outside the jewellery stores did not capture the entire demand for gold. Manabendra Roy, a doctor, was not in the queue, but he had ordered gold sitting in his chamber.         
	Roy, an active trader in the equities market, bought 10 units of gold ETF (exchange traded funds that give the option to invest in gold in dematerialised form) on Dhanteras from a bank.         
	Gold is possibly the best hedging instrument against stock market fluctuations. I dont have to worry about securing physical gold or deductions in value of jewellery while trying to sell it and so I buy ETF, which can be traded as shares, Roy said.

          OUR BUREAU                                     
	Guwahati/Itanagar, Feb. 22: Twelve days after 10 students of Don Bosco School were killed in a hostel fire at Palin in Arunachal Pradesh, the school authorities today said the institution would not reopen unless the guardians removed the childrens graves and memorials from the premises.         
	Angry parents had buried six of the 10 children  charred to death in their sleep at their private hostel  on the school campus where the memorials of three other students were also erected.         
	Initially, seven students were buried inside the school but the body of one was exhumed by the parents later and buried elsewhere.         
	Father Jose Karippai, the principal of the school, said over phone in Itanagar  where he is camping at present  that unless the graves and memorials are removed from the school premises, we cannot think of reopening the institution.         
	The graves and memorials are on the basketball court which is also used for morning assembly, he added.         
	The father and 13 others, including teaching and non-teaching staff, were evacuated to Itanagar in two batches after grieving guardians vandalised the school in the small town in Kurung Kumey district.         
	An official in the district administration said the guardians have been informed about the school authorities insistence on shifting the bodies from the school premises.         
	The government has also assured the parents of a memorial at the exact location where the private hostel once stood, he added.         
	We have been told that some parents have agreed. The sooner the better for the students, as the annual exams are slated for March 22 to 31, the principal said.         
	We understand the students suffering, but we cant reopen the school till these graves and memorials are removed, he added.         
	The two committees probing the February 10 hostel inferno are expected to submit their reports by the end of this week.         
	While one panel is headed by education minister Bosiram Siram, the magisterial inquiry committee is headed by deputy commissioner Bidol Tayeng.         
	The two committees are investigating the matter and are expected to submit their reports by end of this week, the commissioner of education department, Hage Khoda, today said.         
	Arunachal West MP Takam Sanjoy, Palin MLA Takam Tagar, Nyapin legislator Bamang Felix, along with assistant deputy commissioner Chukhu Takar  all members of the panel led by Siram  gathered details about the fire during their visit to the town last week.         
	The other committee is waiting to question the owner of the hostel and the warden before finalising the report.         
	Biri Nyari, the hostels owner, who was also injured in the blaze, is still in hospital.         
	The assistant deputy commissioner of Palin, Chukhu Takar, today said: Though the situation is under control, section 144 CrPC is still in force.

	Nov. 25: Sonia Gandhi today walked through two mansions inextricably tied to the history of the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhis and spoke of how Allahabad had shown the way during moments of doubt and crisis.        
	The Congress presidents reference was to events that unfolded more than a century ago but her mind appeared to be occupied by a concern playing out in the present and rooted in the 23-year-old Bofors spectre: corruption charges.        
	Soon after leaving Anand Bhavan and Swaraj Bhavan built by Motilal Nehru  Jawaharlal Nehru lived there and Indira Gandhi was born in one  Sonia spoke her mind.        
	The Manmohan Singh government has been taking prompt, tough, difficult actions whenever any issue relating to corruption was raised, she told an Allahabad rally, held as part of the Congresss 125-year celebrations.        
	The thrust of the message Sonia sought to get across today was the same as yesterday when the Bihar election result had plunged her party into despair.         
	But by choosing words such as tough and difficult, Sonia today appeared to be addressing a perception that the government and the party had allowed matters to drag on for too long because of an inherent aversion to taking unpleasant decisions.        
	Fighting a tough battle against corruption is often lonely and fraught with risks when you run a government, but we are sure we will be able to follow this tough path till the end, she said.        
	For the second day running, Sonia insisted that the Congress had zero tolerance for corruption and suggested it was the Opposition that should look inwards and cure itself of its double standards on the matter.        
	Hours after his landslide victory, Nitish Kumar had also spoken of zero tolerance to graft.        
	The stress from the two sides suggests the plank of corruption is touching a raw nerve. Corruption and its synonym, the culture of avarice, are again the determinants of political fortune. No political party can afford the taint of dirty lucre, says The Telegraph editorial today.        
	In almost a repeat of her comments in Delhi yesterday, Sonia stressed Manmohan Singhs integrity, cited how the government and party had acted against tainted leaders, and pointed at the BJPs failure to punish its scandal-scarred Karnataka chief minister.        
	Sonias persistent thrust on corruption comes at a time the Opposition has paralysed Parliament and targeted the Prime Minister.        
	Sonia is now seeking to drive home the message that it was the Congress that took the initiative to wield the broom. Corruption is the biggest hurdle to development. We have zero tolerance for corruption. We have shown the way.        
	The issue is crucial for Sonia also because her long-term political strategy hinges on Manmohan Singhs clean image and good governance. By 2014, the Congress, perhaps under a younger leadership, would need to hold up Singhs tenure as an exemplar.                          
	A tainted UPA II, on the other hand, may force the party back to its 1996-2004 days, when it had to pay for the many scandals and failures of the P.V. Narasimha Rao government (1991-96).        
	Congress insiders say Sonias sensitiveness to corruption has been heightened by the familys difficulty in shaking off the ghost of Bofors that so heavily damaged the Rajiv Gandhi governments credibility in the late 1980s.        
	Few party leaders have forgotten how the scandal had given a demoralised and fragmented Opposition hope that if it stuck together, it could humble the Congress, which then had a 75 per cent majority in the Lok Sabha.        
	The politician in Sonia acutely conscious that public perception matters more than evidence on the touchy issue of corruption in high places.        
	So far, she reckons, the publics confidence in the integrity of the Prime Minister and the Congress leadership is virtually intact, but another scandal involving a party leader or minister may cause serious harm, sources close to her said.        
	The tenure of UPA I (2004-2009) had been relatively calmer with Congress ministers trying to live up to Sonias expectations. But things have taken a downturn since the May 2009 victory, and even some Congress ministers have been whispering about wrongdoings by their colleagues.        
	For Sonia, the frequency with which the Supreme Court has been directing strong remarks at the government  as happened during the spectrum case hearing  are another area of concern. Unlike the time Indira Gandhi battled the judiciary over bank nationalisation, the Congress is not politically in a position to strike back.        
	When there were moments of doubt and crisis, Allahabad showed the way to move forward and it will do so now too, Sonia said, referring to the partys fourth and eighth sessions, held in the city in 1888 and 1892 on the grounds of the Darbhanga Castle.        
	This is a great occasion to go back to history and recall the contribution that towering Congress personalities had made.        
	Before the rally, Sonia made a quiet trip to former Nehru family homes Anand Bhavan and Swaraj Bhavan, about 1km from the meeting venue.        
	She walked around Anand Bhavan, which has been turned into a museum, for about 10 minutes. Then she spent about 25 minutes inside, visiting the Indira Room, Jawaharlal Nehru Room, Relic Room and Gandhi Room (where the Mahatma used to stay during his visits).        
	Motilal had built Swaraj Bhavan, a large bungalow, in the 1920s. The family shifted there after Anand Bhavan became the Congresss local headquarters.        
	Sonia Gandhi seemed happy with the way the rooms have been preserved but wanted a computerised catalogue of the books in Anand Bhavans library, said Promode Pandey, administrator of Anand Bhavan.        
	As Sonia travelled to the rally ground from Anand Bhavan, Samajwadi Party youth activists slipped through the security cordon to appear before her motorcade. They waved black flags and released black balloons, demanding resumption of student elections in Allahabad University.        
	Earlier, BJP youth activists had torn off and burnt Congress posters that showed Sonia as Mother India and son Rahul Gandhi as Lord Krishna.

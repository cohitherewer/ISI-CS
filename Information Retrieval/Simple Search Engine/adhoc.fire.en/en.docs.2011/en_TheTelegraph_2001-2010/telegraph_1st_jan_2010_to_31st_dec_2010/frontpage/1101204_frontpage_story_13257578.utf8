  - Meena stumps Mamata          J.P. YADAV                             Meena Singh (top) and Mamata Banerjee	                                      
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Rail minister Mamata Banerjee is about to sanction an all-new train beyond the purview of her budget proposals and well beyond the limits of her own awareness  a Patna-to-Gonda Shaadi Express.        
	Mamata did not know it was in her power to green-flag a private service until she was asked this afternoon.         
	Madam, yeh MP Meena Singh hain. Inke bete ki shaadi hai. Ek special train book karna chahti hain. Paisa jama ho gaya hai. Aap thoda help kar dijiye (Madam, this is member of Parliament Meena Singh. Her son is getting married. We want to book a special train. The money has been deposited. Please help us).        
	Aghast and unbelieving of what she was hearing from Dinesh Yadav, a Janata Dal (United) MP, Mamata paused a minute and then sought to correct him: Poora train? Aapko special coach chahiye naa (An entire train? You want special coach, isnt it)?         
	Nahi poora train chahiye special train humne paisa Patna mein deposit karwa diya hai (No, we want a whole train, a special train. The money has been deposited in Patna for it), Yadav declared confidently as Meena Singh, party colleague and MP from Arrah, stood by, waiting for Didi to accede.         
	For Mamata, who makes a daily statement of simplicity and austerity, this was as unbelievable a proposal as it was extravagant. How could someone be demanding a whole train?         
	She made customary assurances of looking into the matter and bade her guests a hurried goodbye.                                      
	Mamata was later told by her bureaucracy it was indeed possible to book a whole train, should someone be ready to pay the price and meet essential criteria  a minimum journey of 500km and Rs 5,000 per coach.         
	Its been done before, Didi was told.        
	In fact, it was done when Meena Singh was married back in 1984. Husband Ajit Singh, a former MP who died in a road crash and whom Meena succeeded, had travelled from Patna to Mughalsarai in a specially booked train.        
	Meena is apparently keen her son, Vishal Singh, repeats his fathers feat. He is engaged to the daughter of the Samajwadi Partys bahubali (strongman) MP from Kaiserganj in Uttar Pradesh, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh; the wedding is scheduled for January 30.        
	Her application is for a special train from Patna to Gonda to carry the baraat.        
	She is an MP with a big mass base. Therefore, it is normal that she will have too many guests and so an entire train is needed to ferry them comfortably, an aide said helpfully, explaining why she was making such an extraordinary request of the Indian Railways.        
	MP Brij bhushan Sharan Singh confirmed the initiative and said everything was being done according to the rules.        
	Yes, my daughter is getting married to Meena Singhs son. I know that a train is being booked and there is nothing illegal about it, Singh told The Telegraph.        
	The railway minister acknowledged later that this was the first time she had been confronted with such a request.        
	Her curiosity led her to call up her officials and inquire. Can someone book a full train for a wedding? she asked over the phone.        
	After a pause, she said: But ensure that normal passenger trains dont get hampered because of the special train.        
	But when has an Indian wedding not hampered normal life? If you happen to be on the Patna-Gonda route on January 30, be prepared to bless the groom even if Shaadi Express derails your plans.

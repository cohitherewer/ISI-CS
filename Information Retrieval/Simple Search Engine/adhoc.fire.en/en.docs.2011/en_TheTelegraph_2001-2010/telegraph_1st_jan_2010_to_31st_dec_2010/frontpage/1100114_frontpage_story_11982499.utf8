The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Krishna project for passport in 3 days
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Krishna project for passport in 3 days
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 13: External affairs minister S.M. Krishna is doing to the Indian passports establishment what he did to Bangalore as Karnataka chief minister. Come February 1 and those seeking the coveted travel document will get his passport within three days after receiving police verification.        
	If you apply for a tatkal or expedited passport, the applicant can ask for one in the morning and walk away with the document at the end of the same day.        
	Not everywhere in the country though. Only in Bangalore, which is Krishnas political hometown and in Chandigarh, which has adopted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as its citizen  although no one is sure what place Singh considers as his hometown.        
	Passport offices Bangalore and Chandigarh will first showcase the revolutionary changes that Krishna is working on for changing beyond recognition one of the most reviled branches of the ministry of external affairs (MEA), the huge network of offices that issue passports and offer related services to the public.        
	Once the teething troubles in passport offices in Bangalore and Chandigarh are rectified during this pilot phase of the new system, the wholly modern network and systems will be introduced in passport offices all over the country.        
	Krishna envisages the dreaded police verification for passport applicants to be completed in a matter of days under the reforms he is introducing.        
	According to a recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, police verification reports were not received in the ideal 30-day time for this work by passport offices in 75 per cent of passport applications across India, leading to enormous inconvenience for those seeking the travel document.        
	Krishna hopes to rectify this by linking passport offices digitally with nodal points in the police system in every district in India.        
	At present, requests for police verification are sent by ordinary snail mail from passport offices to police stations under whose jurisdiction applicants reside.         
	Many of these requests get lost in the system leaving applicants in the lurch for as long as six months after they have applied for a travel document.        
	But even after the verification is completed, it takes 30 to 45 days for passports to be actually issued by the MEA system. The reforms to be implemented from next month will cut this waiting time to a mere three days.        
	Similarly, it now takes two to three hours for an applicant simply to submit an application in many of the overcrowded passport offices in much of India.        
	With Krishnas reforms, this cumbersome waiting time will be reduced to a mere 45 minutes: that too in conditions which MEA officials hope will be decent and comfortable.        
	These sweeping reforms envisage data entry, scanning of documents, capturing photographs and signatures digitally, instead of the present practice of doing everything on paper.        
	In fact, passport offices in Bangalore and Chandigarh -- and eventually everywhere else in India -- will be paper-free.        
	An applicant will, of course, fill in a passport form, but at the first counter in Krishna-style passport offices, that passport form will be scanned and put into the MEA system after verification of documents.        
	At the next counter, the applicants picture and signature will be digitally captured and added to his electronic application. Fee collection and other procedures will be similarly speeded up.        
	Once the process of submitting an application is completed, ideally in 45 minutes, the passport office will inform the police with the press of a button about the applicant and seek a verification report expeditiously.        
	Krishna summed up his motto for the revamped passport offices thus: To deliver passport-related services to citizens in a timely, transparent, more accessible, reliable manner and in a comfortable environment through streamlined processes and committed, trained and motivated workforce.        
	The changes are reminiscent of what Krishna did to Bangalore as Karnataka chief minister, leading his enemies to criticise him as chief minister for Bangalore. But Krishna is unfazed and says passport reform are urgently needed.        
	With the changes, the Calcutta Regional Passport Office will be expanded with the addition of a new office in Behrampore. The minister hopes the addition will considerably relieve pressure on the existing set-up in Calcutta.

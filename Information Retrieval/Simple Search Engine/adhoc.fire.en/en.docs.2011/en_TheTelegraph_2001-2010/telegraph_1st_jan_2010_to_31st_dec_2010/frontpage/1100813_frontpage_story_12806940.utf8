The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IAF sparks fly over chopper use in Red belt
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                IAF sparks fly over chopper use in Red belt
          SUJAN DUTTA                      The Telegraph  report on Thursday                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Security force commanders in anti-Maoist operations in Chhattisgarh misuse helicopters and are inept in tasking pilots and aircrew, a senior official in the Indian Air Force (IAF) headquarters said today.        
	The claim came on the day The Telegraph reported that the CRPF has complained that some of its troopers may have bled to death in an encounter in June for want of air support.        
	The IAF has also been given permission to open fire in self-defence and has mounted sideward guns on the helicopters being used for counter-Naxalite operations, the air headquarters officer said. Thank God, we have not had to use them so far, he added.        
	The IAF has a detachment of four helicopters  two Mi-17s and two Dhruvs  based in Raipur for counter-Maoist operations in Chhattisgarh.        
	The senior officer said the detachment had flown many hours more than its stipulated time limit of 80 hours per month.        
	In the past four months, the detachment had flown a total of 169 hours in April, 91 hours in May, 118 hours in June and 89 hours in July.        
	 On April 6, Maoists killed 76 policemen in Mukram and the abnormally high flying hours that month was because of the number of sorties the choppers had to fly between Chintalnaar, near Mukram, and Jagdalpur, where the nearest district hospital is located, to evacuate casualties and bring home the dead.        
	IAF helicopters had also exceeded their stipulated 80 hours of flying to fly VIPs, to fly reinforcements and simply because they were often instructed to fly when it was not required, the officer said.        
	On June 29, when 27 CRPF troopers were killed by Maoists at Dhaurai in Narainpur district, an IAF group captain was in constant touch with police.        
	The fact is, we were never tasked to fly. There was simply no tasking, the air headquarters officer said.        
	We have no problems in flying if the minimum parameters required are met. Look at the number of sorties we are flying for relief and rescue in Leh (since last weeks cloudburst). In an emergency, we are always there. In Chhattisgarh, our helicopters have sometimes been used to fly just two people, he said. (An Mi-17 can carry 24 fully equipped troopers.)        
	The official said the IAF was short of helicopters and its role in the counter-Naxalite operations was supplementary.         
	The flying hours for its aircraft are also stipulated for a whole year because the IAF draws up and manages its inventory of spares and supporting equipment on that basis.        
	The government wants more (helicopters for counter-Maoist operations) but the availability depends on how many we can spare. The helicopters are basically meant to augment our military effort and infrastructure in the border areas and they have had to be diverted (for counter-Maoist operations). This is a secondary role for us, he said.        
	The IAF is currently in the process of acquiring 80 more Mi-17 multi-utility helicopters. It has also recalled its helicopters with UN missions in Africa.        
	Between April and July, IAF helicopters had flown 685 sorties in support of central paramilitary forces that are battling Naxalites, carrying 63 tonnes of equipment and ferrying 4,500 troopers.         
	The IAF is also concerned over the security for helipads. It has repeatedly asked the state and central police forces to sanitise each helipad up to a radius of 800 metres (beyond the range of small arms).        
	 But this is often not possible because of the rough terrain.

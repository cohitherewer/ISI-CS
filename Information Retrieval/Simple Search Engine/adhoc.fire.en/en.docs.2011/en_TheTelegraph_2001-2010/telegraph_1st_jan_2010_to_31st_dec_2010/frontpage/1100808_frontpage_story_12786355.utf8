	Srinagar, Aug. 7: Daughter Asiya was back a month after her marriage, so a joyous Ghulam Mohiuddin had invited guests over for dinner.        
	He was feeling doubly lucky: one of the guests was his cousin Rayeesuddin from Srinagar, who was to have ended his Ladakh trip days ago but had been persuaded by his brothers in Leh to stay on a while longer.        
	The mood was happy, the chatter lively, and the party at Mohiuddins home in Sabu village, some 20km from Leh, dragged on past 1.30am with no one looking at the clock or bothering about the rain outside.        
	Then came the crack of doom. Within seconds the house was rubble. Asiya was dead, so was Rayees. So was Asiyas mother, Mohiuddins wife.        
	The three are among the 132 known to have died in yesterdays cloudburst-triggered flash flood, although many people fear the toll could cross 500. Some 600 are still missing, including 30-odd soldiers and at least 150 outstation labourers.        
	Only five survived at my home: myself, my son and three relatives from Leh, Mohiuddin sobbed. I had been so happy to see my daughter back.        
	Rayees, 32, who lived with father Naziruddin in Srinagar, was to marry next month and was visiting his two elder brothers in Leh. We asked him to delay his return as curfews and shutdowns were continuing in Srinagar, said brother Shamsuddin.        
	I too thought he would be safer here; little did I know he was staying back to die, Naziruddin said.        
	But tourists from elsewhere in India or abroad appear to have been largely luckier: no deaths among them have been reported so far though thousands are stranded.        
	The Centre has requested its civil aviation ministry to operate four to five additional flights from Delhi to Leh to bring back the tourists. A defence spokesperson said the air force might fly some of the tourists to Delhi if no civilian flights were available in Leh.        
	The army has deployed numerous detachments along the Leh-Manali axis to assist the stranded tourists. All of them have been provided food, shelter and medical aid, including life-saving drugs, the defence official said.         
	With the runway freed of slush, six air force aircraft landed this afternoon carrying doctors and 29 tonnes of relief material, including blankets, dry food, medicine, generators, tents, portable X-ray machines and emergency rescue kits.        
	Shamsuddin said that when the cloudburst struck Sabu, the water gushing from the mountains washed away hundreds of homes there, and then in downhill Choglamsar and other villages. My brothers body was found 3km away near the Indo Tibetan Border Police camp.        
	Thousands of Leh residents spent Friday night on the mountains hemming the town, fearful of more cloudbursts.         
	As darkness set, there was a mad rush towards the mountains. People fled on foot or in cars, said T. Angmo, Leh resident and former director of Radio Kashmir, Srinagar.        
	I spent the night with 400 people at the mountaintop Kartse Gyamo monastery. Other monasteries such as the Shanti Stupa too were packed. Some people put up tents. There were no less than 200 cars, and many people slept in their vehicles.

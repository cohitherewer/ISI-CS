  - BJP squirms as JMM eyes Munda seat        AMIT GUPTA                             Munda, Mahto                                        
	Ranchi, Nov. 30: Kharsawans BJP MLA resigned from the Assembly today to pave the way for Arjun Munda to contest, opening up a political challenge for the ruling BJP-Ajsu-JMM alliance that must ensure there is no heartburn over who gets the prized Jamshedpur Lok Sabha seat to be vacated by the chief minister.        
	I am tendering my resignation to pave the way for Arjun Munda who will fight a by-election from Kharsawan, his home territory, the BJPs Mangal Singh Soy told newsmen present outside the office of Assembly Speaker C.P. Singh here today.         
	Munda, BJP MP from Jamshedpur and the partys national general secretary, took oath as the eighth chief minister of politically turbulent Jharkhand on September 11. He must get elected to the Assembly to continue in his new office beyond March 11, 2011.        
	Munda, who visited the state party office in the afternoon and held a meeting with state party chief Dineshanand Goswami, is likely to formally announce his candidature from Kharsawan tomorrow. But, he is in no hurry to give up his Lok Sabha seat, and can wait till he gets elected to the Assembly from Kharsawan.        
	In the days to come, the two districts of the Kolhan region, Jamshedpur East and Seraikela-Kharsawan, are likely to see hectic political activity.         
	Already, senior JMM leader and former deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto has staked claim to the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha seat, a move that hasnt gone down well with ally BJP.        
	The by-elections are to be the alliances first litmus since coming to power in September. The BJP would not like to see a JMM nominee in Kharsawan. At the same time, it would not like to give up its claim on Jamshedpur too.        
	Two-time MLA Sudhir Mahto, who earlier represented Ichagarh Assembly seat in Seraikela-Kharsawan district, lost the 2009 elections to JVMs Arvind Kumar Singh, alias Malkhan Singh.         
	Now, he senses a chance. There are no ifs and buts. I am committed to fighting elections from Jamshedpur. I have already started preparations, he told The Telegraph over telephone from Chandil.        
	JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya, however, chose to play safe. Let the poll notification come. Our central executive will sit and decide. BJP is also yet to approach us.         
	Goswami, too, refused to comment on Mahtos claim on Jamshedpur, but offered enough indications on the party line. At present, its the BJPs seat as the MP belongs to our party. I am not in a position to comment whether JMM will field anyone from Jamshedpur as it is their internal matter, he said.         
	Soy, Goswami said, resigned for the good of the party. As Munda is a leader of national repute, he can ensure his own victory from anywhere. But he has decided to contest from Kharsawan since its his own turf, he said.        
	Leader of the Opposition Rajendra Prasad Singh said Congress would try and make it difficult for the chief minister by fielding a strong candidate against him. We are in the Opposition. So, naturally we will like to see him defeated, he said, alluding to Shibu Sorens Tamar debacle that forced him to step down as chief minister.

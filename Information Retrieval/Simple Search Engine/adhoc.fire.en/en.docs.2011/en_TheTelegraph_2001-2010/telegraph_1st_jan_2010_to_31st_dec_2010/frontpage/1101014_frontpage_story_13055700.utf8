                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Baruas bail plea to be heard after Puja
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Oct. 13: Ulfa deputy commander-in-chief Raju Barua will have to wait for his release till the Puja vacations are over as the designated TADA court here deferred his bail plea today.         
	The court will remain closed for Puja holidays from tomorrow, Baruas counsel Pranab Das told this correspondent.         
	Barua, who had moved bail pleas in TADA and CBI courts earlier this month, was yesterday granted bail by the CBI court, which, however, imposed several restrictions on him.         
	Now, there are three cases pending against him in the TADA court here, Das said, adding that the court was likely to give a verdict on the bail pleas only after the Puja holidays.         
	On securing the release of the outfits ideologue, Bhimkanta Buragohain alias Mama, who had been granted bail by the district and sessions court of Tezpur on October 8, his counsel, Dulumoni Sinha, said they would submit two bail bonds before the judge on October 26.         
	Two relatives of Buragohain will submit individual bail bonds of Rs 25,000 each on October 26, Sinha said, adding that the delay had been caused because of the Puja holidays.         
	On their release, both Buragohain and Barua are likely to join Ulfa vice-chairman Pradip Gogoi and central publicity secretary Mithinga Daimary, who had been granted bail earlier this year and are now drumming up public support for the talks.

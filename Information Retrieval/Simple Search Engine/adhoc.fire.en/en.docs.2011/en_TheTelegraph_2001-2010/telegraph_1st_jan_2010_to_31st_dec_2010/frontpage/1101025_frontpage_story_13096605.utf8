	Ranchi, Oct. 24: Troubles dont seem to end for Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC).        
	The recruitment body, already facing vigilance heat for 18 examinations conducted by it since 2002, is now trying to figure out what to do with the more than two lakh bank drafts amounting to Rs 1.23 crore, which it collected from applicants as examination fee between 2005 and 2008, but never bothered to encash.         
	The drafts, normally valid for six months, were of small denominations between Rs 20 and Rs 100, and were drawn in favour of 36 banks.         
	Last month, acting JPSC chairman A.K. Sengupta contacted the Reserve Bank of India, which instructed the banks to look for a way to ensure the commission could get the funds. Thereafter, JPSC contacted zonal heads of the banks. Correspondence is on with the banks and we hope for some logical conclusion, he told The Telegraph.        
	The bank drafts case has surfaced in the midst of a massive manhunt for former JPSC members, who have been evading arrest since June. The members are accused of grave irregularities while conducting the second civil services examinations of 2007-08.        
	The commission, which has been faced with an acute staff crunch since inception, had been offloading the job of pre-examination processing of applications at the rate of Rs 40 lakh for every one lakh applications to National Co-operative Consumer Federation of India (NCCF).        
	Now, the same job has been given to Kendriya Bhandar, Ranchi, for Rs 7 lakh for one lakh applications. We floated the tenders, inviting various firms to undertake the job and awarded the job to the lowest bidder, thus saving Rs 33 lakh for every one lakh applications, Sengupta said. The pre-examination processing involves screening of applications, creating a database and preparing admit cards.        
	The JPSC received around 70,000, 1 lakh and 71,000 applications for the first, second and third civil services examinations respectively. We have received 1.10 lakh applications for the fourth examinations and 80,000 applications for post of teachers in upgraded middle schools, Sengupta said.        
	The acting chairman said that so far, the commission did not seek utilisation certificates from various deputy commissioners and principals of schools/colleges selected as centres for funds given to conduct the examinations. Rs 1.89 crore is outstanding. The DCs of Jamshedpur, Hazaribagh and Bokaro have responded after we wrote to them about the certificates and the funds lying unused, he said.                    
	Sengupta hoped things would improve as the present government, particularly the chief minister and chief secretary, were keen on creating infrastructure for the commission. They have recently posted deputy collector rank officers to man the commission.

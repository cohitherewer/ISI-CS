The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Panel announces panchayat poll dates 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Panel announces panchayat poll dates 
  - Model code comes into effect, state seeks 200 companies of central forces          AMIT GUPTA                                                 
	Ranchi, Oct. 14: The State Election Commission today declared the dates for five-phase panchayat elections in the state, which would be held over three months starting October.        
	The polls, to take place in the state after a gap of over three decades, will facilitate election of as many as 53,207 representatives for a three-tier panchayat system that would empower the rural masses to make decisions concerning their development.         
	Announcing the dates, state election commissioner S.D. Sharma said, We have been preparing for the polls for the last three months and it gives me immense pleasure to officially announce the dates after a gazette notification was published by the state government a few days ago following the governors nod.        
	With the official announcement of rural poll dates, the model code of conduct has come into effect across the state. This implies that there would now be restrictions on transfer/posting of government officials, and announcement of any new panchayat schemes is a strict no no.         
	However, ongoing schemes which were sanctioned earlier will not be disrupted. We have no intention of preventing development work in far-flung areas of the state. Moreover, the elections are being fought on non-political lines so I expect less interference from the political parties during the forthcoming exercise, Sharma said.        
	For the Herculean task ahead, the poll panel will deploy around 300 companies of central paramilitary forces in the state where 18 out of 24 districts are officially Naxalite affected. A few more districts in Santhal Pargana are set to be added to the list.         
	The central government has already agreed to provide us 100 companies of central paramilitary forces. The state director general of police has requested another 100 companies for the peaceful and smooth conduct of rural polls in the state, Sharma added.                            
	The state already has 72 companies of CRPF and few more companies of Cobra to combat Naxalites.         
	We have been assured that central forces deployed in Bihar for the Assembly elections would come to Jharkhand, he said.         
	Besides, majority of the state police machinery would be utilised during the rural polls.         
	The number of rural voters, who will exercise their third voting rights for the first time in the state, is over 1.43 crore as of July 2010. More names of eligible voters could be added in the list in the days to follow. A single voter would have to cast four votes to directly elect ward members, mukhiya, panchayat samiti members and Zila Parishad member. Election to other posts of the three-tier panchayat system would be indirect.         
	The biggest elections in its own definition would see election of as many as 43,916 ward members, 4,423 mukhiyas, 4,423 members of panchayat samitis and 445 members of Zila Parishads.         
	Election to other important posts like panchayat samiti pramukh, panchayat samiti uppramukh, upmukhiya, adhyaksha of Zila Parishad and upadhayksha of Zila Parishad would be indirect.         
	Sharma added that there would be requirement of as many as 1.45 lakh ballot boxes. The poll panel is in contact with its counterparts in neighbouring Bengal and Orissa for the boxes. The state has at its disposal only about 82,000 ballot boxes.

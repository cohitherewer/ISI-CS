The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Boycott kick to beaten France
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Boycott kick to beaten France
                            
	Knysna (South Africa), June 20 (Agencies): Frances World Cup campaign descended into chaos today as players refused to train in protest against Nicolas Anelkas expulsion from the squad and a senior team official quit while another stormed off the pitch.        
	Coach Raymond Domenech read from a statement prepared by the players: to show our opposition to the decision (to kick out Anelka) taken by officials of the federation, all the players decided not to take part in todays training session.        
	The incidents took place a day after striker Anelka was sent home by the French Football Federation (FFF) for insulting Domenech at halftime during a 2-0 defeat by Mexico that left France on the verge of a group stage exit. Anelkas comments were leaked to the media.        
	Todays public session, ironically on a pitch called Field of Dreams, was about to start when a furious row erupted between captain Patrice Evra and fitness coach Robert Duverne.        
	Domenech had to move in to separate them. Duverne, who had apparently insisted training should take place, angrily threw his stopwatch on the pitch and left.        
	They dont want to train, its a scandal, team director and FFF managing director Jean-Louis Valentin said as he too left the pitch.        
	Its a scandal for French people. Im resigning, Im leaving the federation. I have nothing more to do here.         
	Yesterday, Evra had told reporters a traitor in the team had leaked Anelkas insults. French sports daily LEquipe put them on the front page and a few hours later, Anelka was kicked out of the squad.        
	Asked by a reporter if he was the traitor, Valentin replied no, no, no and appeared close to tears.        
	The players then walked towards their bus, carrying their slogan reading: All together towards a new blue dream.        
	Evra handed over a piece of paper to the team spokesman. It was a statement from the players that Domenech, looking exhausted and discouraged, read out.        
	We deplore the incident that happened at halftime against Mexico but we regret even more the fact that an event that belongs to our group and is inherent to the life of a competitive team was made public, it read.        
	The players are unanimously against the French Football Federations decision to expel Nicolas Anelka.        
	Domenech had earlier said he could understand Anelkas attitude but not the players refusal to apologise.        
	The players statement, however, said Anelka was denied a chance to explain himself.        
	 Henri Guaino, adviser to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, described the situation as distressing.        
	Its no longer football, its no longer sport, its no longer a team.

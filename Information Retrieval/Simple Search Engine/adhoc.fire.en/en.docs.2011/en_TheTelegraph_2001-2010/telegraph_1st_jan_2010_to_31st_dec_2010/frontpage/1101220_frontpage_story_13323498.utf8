  - Sachin speaks on what the 50th ton means
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Sachin Tendulkar reacts after scoring the hundred on Sunday. (AFP)                                  
	Dec. 19: At the end of the day, 50 is actually just a number for most. But 50 Test hundreds? Thats some number.        
	Dont be taken in by Sachin Tendulkars utterly modest its just another number. It isnt.         
	For over two months, a bug had been troubling Sachin. At 7.41 (IST) this evening, in Centurion, home to one of the most lively wickets anywhere, it got neutralised.        
	No more will Sachin have to take questions on the hundred all of India was waiting for. Call it a monkey or whatever, but thats definitely off the 37-year-old champions back.        
	A shade over a month ago, in an exclusive chat, Sachin had said: How can it be otherwise (being conscious of being one short) when everybody is only talking about the 50th hundred? Wherever I go, thats the sole topic. I dont like it, but what to do?         
	As I see it, theres more to cricket than 50 Test hundreds. I believe in destiny. Whatever is to happen, will.        
	That was in the middle of the home series against New Zealand, which saw Sachin register a best of 61. The pressure had taken its toll.        
	Sachin left that weighty baggage behind when he checked in for the flight to South Africa. A 34-ball 36 in the first innings showed that he intended being positive in the manner befitting the most prolific run-getter in international cricket.         
	Despite the awesome team-driven pressure this afternoon, Sachin batted on his terms. The Test, as a result, isnt over.        
	Around 15 minutes after returning to the team hotel, in Johannesburg, Sachin took a call from The Telegraph and spoke for 15 minutes or so.        
	The following are excerpts:              
	Q: Well, has it sunk in?        
	A: (Laughs) To be frank, not yet. Dont know when it will.         
	Q: You seemed much more emotional today...        
	A: Yes, I probably was. Im dedicating this hundred to my late father (Ramesh Tendulkar). Yesterday was his (77th) birth anniversary and I wanted to get this one for him. This Test will remain an emotional one.         
	Q: On an emotional level, is this hundred going to be on a par with the 140 not out against Kenya in the 1999 World Cup, hours after you rejoined the team following your fathers demise?         
	A: No, no. That was different.        
	Q: Did you cut a cake in the dressing room?        
	A: The boys and the support staff congratulated me, thats it. As Im still batting (107), I may not go out for dinner, but stay in the hotel. Havent decided.         
	Q: Have you spoken to the family back home?        
	A: I have. Theyre very happy. (Wife) Anjali and the children (Sara, Arjun) will be joining me for the New Year.        
	Q: Is it like a monkey off your back and that you can now look beyond the 50th Test hundred?        
	A: Yeah. Its not that I consciously kept thinking about the hundred, but so much was being said and written about my being one short. Today, yes, I can move on.        
	Q: You dont compare hundreds, but this must still rank as among the more special, isnt it?        
	A: One of the good ones, definitely.        
	Q: Did all the talk about the 50th hundred distract you in the last series against New Zealand?        
	A: I dont want to blame anybody, but it seemed people didnt have anything else to talk about. Even I kept getting asked about when I would get it. I understand the fans sentiments, but...        
	Q: This afternoon, you never quite gave the impression that the team was under so much pressure. With the Dale Steyns turning on the heat, was it actually that easy?        
	A: Test cricket is never easy, but you assess the situation and do the things which need to be done and avoid the things which shouldnt be done. The approach I took was dictated by the situation. Its about making the right choice at the right time.        
	Q: What next?        
	A: You know me. Im not setting myself a target, just want to keep enjoying my cricket. Come tomorrow and I wont take fresh guard having X or Y runs or hundreds as a goal. Sure, theres a next level and, yes, one must constantly raise the bar.         
	Q: The year 2010 has, for you, been quite phenomenal (seven Test hundreds and a 200 not out in an ODI). What has made the difference?        
	A: Dont know, really. Ive worked and trained as hard as I have in the previous years. Dont think Ive done anything different. Actually, I havent given a thought to what may have made the difference.        
	Q: Coach Gary Kirsten has called you the professor of batting. Your take on him?        
	A: Is it? Its nice of him to have said that. Garys contribution in making us the No.1 Test team is immense. Hes worked hard with me and the rest of the boys. Hes helped us improve, individually and collectively.         
	Q: Is there hope of saving the Test?        
	A: (After a pause) We can only give it our best shot tomorrow and leave the rest to Almighty. Weve got to hope for the best.

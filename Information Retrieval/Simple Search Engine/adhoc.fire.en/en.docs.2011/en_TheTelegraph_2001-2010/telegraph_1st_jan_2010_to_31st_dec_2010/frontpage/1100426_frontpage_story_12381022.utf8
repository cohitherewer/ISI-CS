          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Modi at the final. (PTI)                                      
	Mumbai, April 25: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has suspended the controversial Lalit Kumar Modi.         
	The suspension was slapped minutes after the Indian Premier League (IPL) III final, won by the Chennai Super Kings. An option had been to communicate the bad news before tomorrows governing council meeting, to be held here, from 10am.         
	For a while, a minority view among those calling the shots in the BCCI was to allow Modi to attend the meeting and, then, move a motion of no-confidence before serving a showcause notice.        
	But, then, that was deemed as much too soft and was struck down.        
	Modi spoke at the prize distribution, in Navi Mumbai, for the last time as the IPLs chairman and commissioner, and made what has to be described as a political speech.        
	That he could be suspended was written in these columns this morning.         
	A confirmation was awaited, but hes no more a BCCI vice-president and Champions League chairman, too.         
	The BCCIs game plan was given final touches during the day today, with president Shashank Manohar, secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasan, vice-president Arun Jaitley and IPL vice-chairman Niranjan Shah having a series of discussions.        
	None of them watched the final in person.         
	Rule 32 (VII) has been invoked by the president. Theres a limit to what may be tolerated. Modi crossed that limit, a senior official told The Telegraph.         
	The BCCI acted eight hours after Modi himself called an extraordinary governing council meeting at the same time and place  Cricket Centre at the Wankhede, where the BCCI is headquartered.        
	It was a cheeky move.        
	On Wednesday, of course, Modi had refused to heed Manohars directive and, when Srinivasan called the meeting, he termed it unauthorised and unofficial.        
	Apparently, the change in strategy had everything to do with legal opinion. It could also be that Modi actually read the writing on the wall and decided to portray himself as a victim, condemned without a trial.         
	Modi stands accused of wrongdoings financially, breaching the confidentiality clause of a contract with an IPL franchise (Kochi) and challenging the BCCI to throw him out. Not to forget threatening to expose certain people. Enough reasons for the president to act under Rule 32 (VII), the senior official added.        
	That Modi had been projecting himself as bigger than the game made it worse for him.         
	Manohar, one learns, took a conscious decision not to take action till the IPLs latest edition ended. He didnt want the tournament to be upstaged by off-the-field shenanigans.        
	Modi, sadly, didnt seem too bothered.         
	Manohar will (as of now) take over as the IPLs acting chairman. In any case, hes scheduled to address a media conference at noon tomorrow.        
	According to another senior official of the BCCI, its not mandatory that the person being suspended has to be given a chargesheet. That may follow after an inquiry.        
	In Modis case, a showcause notice has been given and he must, within 15 days, reply why disciplinary action shouldnt be taken against him.        
	The three-member disciplinary committee  Manohar, Jaitley and another vice-president, Chirayu Amin  will then get into the act. Any action recommended will have to be approved by a three-fourths majority at a special general meeting.        
	Incidentally, while laying down the agenda for the meeting called by him, Modi had asked fellow-members of the governing council to list their allegations/complaints against him in writing, with supporting documents!        
	That just wont be necessary, but the BCCI vs Modi battle is bound to get more messy.

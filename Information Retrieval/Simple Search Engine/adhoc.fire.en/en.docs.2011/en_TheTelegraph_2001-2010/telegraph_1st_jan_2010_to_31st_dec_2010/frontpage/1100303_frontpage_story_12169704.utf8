	Patamda, March 2: Delay in launching Operation Greenhunt has upset the villagers of Patamda and Bodam no end.

	Armed with bows, arrows, spears and swords, the bikers rode from village to village, raising slogans against the Maoist rebels. The rally finally converged at Beltand More in Patamda where a meeting was held, which was addressed by a number of villagers.         
	The speakers urged the government to commence Operation Greenhunt at the earliest. Dasrath Singh Sardar of Chamta village in Bodam said they were watching the developments closely.         
	Sardar said once the operations begin, the villagers could help by pointing out all the rebel hideouts.        
	Director-general of police Neyaz Ahmed said: The DGPs of Bengal and Orissa were surveying the situation in the rebel-hit districts in their respective states bordering Jharkhand. Once this nitty-gritty are take care of, we will launch the operation.         
	Meanwhile, CPI(Maoist) rebels operating in Patamda-Dalma region threatened to blow up the homes of those who took part in todays rally.

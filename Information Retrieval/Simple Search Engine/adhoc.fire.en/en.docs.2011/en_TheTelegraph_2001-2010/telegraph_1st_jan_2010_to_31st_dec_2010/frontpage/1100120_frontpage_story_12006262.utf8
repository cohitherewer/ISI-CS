                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                The second farewell
 																											      Secretariat employees had given Jyoti Basu a warm send-off when he stepped down as chief minister over nine years ago. On Tuesday, they broke down as they gave him their last salute       IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                      Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee places a wreath on Jyoti Basu rsquo;s body in front of Writers rsquo; Buildings on Tuesday.

	Swapan Guha had witnessed Jyoti Basu stepping into Writers Buildings for the first time as chief minister of Bengal in 1977. He was also there when Basu entered Writers for the last time as chief minister on November 3, 2000.        
	These two scenes 23 years apart flashed through Guhas mind on Tuesday as his tear-filled eyes scanned the flower-bedecked cortege for a glimpse of Basu on the final journey past his red citadel.         
	Jyotibabu was as much a father figure as he was a leader. His death is an irreparable loss, and we will always miss him, said Guha, who had joined the backward classes welfare department the same year Basu made his debut as chief minister.         
	Guha and hundreds of other secretariat employees who saw Basu from close in the prime of his political career had arrived at Writers Buildings well before 9am to pay homage.         
	Sucheta Saha, an upper division assistant who had sung the biday gaan (farewell song) on Basus last day in office and also presented him with a bouquet, started sobbing the moment she caught sight of his body wrapped in the CPM flag from a balcony.        
	An era has come to an end. Jyotibabu earned respect not only in Bengal but across the country because he was a man of principles and worked for the welfare of the common man, she said.        
	Guha recalled how Basu had declared that communists are soldiers before stepping out of Writers without the mantle of chief minister for the first time in 23 years. The farewell, he said, was a moment of joy rather than sadness.                    People follow Jyoti Basu rsquo;s cortege on the way to the Assembly. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha      
	I remember how upbeat the mood at Writers was on that day. People felicitated him and wished him good health. He had stepped down on health grounds, and we felt a sense of pride in being led by a man who was not hungry for power. We knew that Jyotibabu would always be there for us as a guardian, Guha added.        
	But even as chants of Jyoti Basu amar rahe rent the air, the realisation that the guardian wouldnt be around always sunk in.        
	At 10.03am, the cortege started moving from Writers towards the Assembly House with six sergeants of Calcutta police and three pilot cars at the vanguard. CPM leaders Mohammad Salim and Amitava Nandi and Basus shadow for 32 years, confidential assistant Joykrishna Ghosh, stood silently beside the body.         
	Shovananda Dey, 79, who had arrived from Behala at 8.35am  nearly an hour and a half before the cortege reached Writers at 9.56 am and stopped in front of the VIP gate  raised her fist for one last salute before breaking down.        
	He was a simple man and a leader of the masses. There will never be another like him, Dey sobbed.

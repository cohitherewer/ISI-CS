	Mangalore, May 23: The buzz around Deccan Park, Mangalores most popular amusement hub, appears to have gone out suddenly.         
	The crash site, less than a kilometre away, has been drawing bigger crowds.        
	It (the crash site) has become the latest tourist attraction. Yesterday, more than 2,000 people came, hampering rescue work. So, today we have placed barricades on either side of the road to restrict access, said a traffic constable, apparently hassled by the seemingly unending stream of unwanted visitors.        
	He pointed to the beeline of cars, autorickshaws and two-wheelers at the site, located in Kenajur village near the airport. The constable and his colleagues in the police had so far been used to such traffic snarls near Deccan Park, which boasts of roller-coaster rides, fountains and other recreational facilities.        
	But the barricades have not held back the onlookers. They park their vehicles, then hotfoot it to a vantage point in the wooded area from where they can see the mangled remains of the Air India Express Boeing 737-800.        
	As the authorities have blocked the main approach from the airport road, people are now making an 8km detour to reach the spot. Otherwise you dont see this kind of traffic on this road, said Karunakaran, a Kenajur resident. Some autorickshaw drivers are charging extra to bring sightseers through the route, he added.        
	The aircrafts tall tail fin and what remains of the two wings and the engines  all spread over a radius of 100 metres and resting in a valley of thick overgrowth  present an incongruous sight.         
	The relief team has cut a new path on the steep slope so the bulldozers can rumble down the gorge to lift the heavier parts.        
	Pointing to where the nose of the aircraft had come to a rest, villagers said that if the plane had traversed another 100 metres, it would have hit the Konkan Railway tracks, which run alongside the airport.         
	Fortunately, the tall trees blocked its course. Otherwise, it could have been a double disaster, said a police officer.

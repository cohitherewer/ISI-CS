The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rebel leader in Delhi for talks
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rebel leader in Delhi for talks
  - Muivah push for Pandey power boost        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                             Muivah                                        
	New Delhi, July 16: NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah wants more powers for Centres interlocutor R.S. Pandey to accelerate the 13-year-old Naga peace talks.         
	The Naga rebel leader, who arrived here last night with at least eight deputies for the next round of peace talks, would like to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram to convey this request, among others, before the official dialogue begins.         
	Their wish to meet the Prime Minister and the home minister has been conveyed, a home ministry source said.         
	Sources said the peace talks between the Centres representative R.S. Pandey, home ministry officials and a nine-member delegation of the outfit could be held next week.         
	The last round of talks was held in Kohima on June 1 after the crisis triggered by the Manipur governments stand on not allowing Muivah to enter the state to visit his native village, Somdal.         
	Muivah had then expressed disappointment, even anger, at the Centre for not pressing Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh to allow him to visit Ukhrul. Sources said Muivah had shed his anger and cordial talks were expected with the government.         
	NSCN (Isak-Muivah) sources told The Telegraph that the groups primary task would be to get more powers for Pandey as he could not go beyond a point every time a dialogue was held with his inadequate mandate.         
	The outfit had accepted Pandey, a former chief secretary of Nagaland, as the Centres interlocutor after former Union home secretary K. Padmanabhaiah took up another government assignment. Pandey had visited Nagaland as the Centres interlocutor, along with home secretary G.K. Pillai, during the recent crisis.         
	This will be the first time the outfits leaders will hold a dialogue with the Centre on the Naga peace process after the economic blockade in Manipur ended with the Centres intervention.         
	During this round of talks, the Centre is certain to convey to the rebel group that its activities during the ceasefire should not affect inter-state relations.         
	There is a growing belief that the NSCN (I-M), with corresponding politicking from Manipur, has fomented communal feelings in the region.         
	Sections in the Union home ministry believe that the root cause of militancy in Manipur has been the Centres engagement with the Naga rebels.         
	Militancy in the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley gained momentum only in the late nineties after the NSCN (I-M) entered into a ceasefire and began talks with New Delhi.         
	Muivah has repeatedly refused to involve any Meitei group in the dialogue where his principal demand has been integration of Naga-inhabited areas in Manipur, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland under a single administrative unit.         
	The most violent of protests against this demand has been staged in Manipur, a fact that the Centre is wary of and one which affects both politics and security in the frontier state.

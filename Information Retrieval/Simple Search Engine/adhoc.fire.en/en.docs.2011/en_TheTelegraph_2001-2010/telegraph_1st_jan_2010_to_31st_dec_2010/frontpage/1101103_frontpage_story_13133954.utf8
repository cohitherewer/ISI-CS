  - Youth survey finds more takers for sleeping than reading          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                                                     
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: Young India doesnt mind losing sleep as long as a television, not a book, is at hand to keep the eyeballs occupied, according to a government-sponsored national survey described as the first such exercise.        
	Sorry friends, this newspaper didnt mean to be ungrateful: we have taken note that 14 per cent of you  the second largest chunk  want to read newspapers and similar publications during your leisure hours.        
	The findings of the National Youth Readership Survey have confirmed televisions spell over the young (this is a delicate issue, the age of the surveyed youths ranges from 13 to 35) with the single largest bloc of 28 per cent saying they would prefer to watch the small screen if they had time for leisure (see chart). The survey was carried out by the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) on behalf of the National Book Trust (NBT).         
	However, televisions grip does not appear to be an all-embracing stranglehold  or even if it is so, the majority of the 38,575 respondents chose not to make such a claim for some reason.        
	Although not too surprising, the worrying factor for the book trust and education policymakers lies at the bottom of the heap: only 7.5 per cent of those surveyed said they would prefer to read a book in their free time.        
	The attitude takes on an even more alarming hue when viewed against another piece of statistic: more youths (10 per cent) thought it more worthwhile to sleep  the universal symbol of sloth, though many feel the young are not catching enough sleep these days  than spend time with books.        
	The survey was carried out in the past year by interviewing 38,575 literate youths in 199 towns and 432 villages in 207 districts covering all states and Union territories. The study was conducted as part of the book trusts effort to frame a national action plan for readership development among youths.        
	The statistics so far dealt with what the young would prefer to do during their leisure hours.        
	But when it comes to actual reading, a far higher percentage (25 per cent) said that they do read books when they had free time. While six per cent of the respondents said they read a book everyday, 12 per cent fell into the category of reading once or twice a week. Seven per cent said they picked up a book once or twice a month.        
	This apparent dichotomy between preference and practice has led an academic to suggest that the respondents could be reading books during office hours or before going to sleep. Many of the 25 per cent could be reading because they have little else to do and not as their preferred choice.        
	The survey suggests that a literate youth spends an average 98 minutes everyday viewing television. The attraction for TV is obvious as it is a visual medium. TV is instantly attractive. But after sometime, they (viewers) may go back to reading. People fall in love with TV and fall out also quickly, Dinesh Misra, president of the Indian Society of Authors, said.         
	Based on the sample data, the NCAER said nearly 65 per cent of youth households in the country would be having a television set while 54 per cent would have mobile phones.        
	Homes with computers have been put at 5 per cent and radio at 27 per cent. About 1 per cent of the youths surveyed have access to the Internet  more than half said they use it for emailing and chatting. Nearly half of the respondents said the advent of the Internet and electronic media was the most important factor affecting reading.         
	As a region, the Northeast tops the reading charts with 43 per cent respondents saying they have the habit. Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand fall in the 30 per cent bracket.         
	While 8 per cent of the youths said they want to read books in Hindi, 3 per cent favoured Marathi books. Two per cent preferred books in Bengali. Less than 2 per cent picked English.         
	The study throws light on the reading habits and patterns of literate youths. Although many people have preferred TV watching and Net surfing, reading books has its own followers, Rajesh Shukla, the author of the report, said.         
	Asked about factors influencing their book-buying choices, 7 per cent of the readers said the price of books was the decisive criteria while nearly the same per cent said they went by the subject. Six per cent said the authors made a difference.         
	Although price scores marginally higher than subject, it is revealing that the subject and the authors profile constitute the most important markers in deciding whether a reader would purchase a book or not.         
	The survey shows youths are unaware of the new books coming to market. Their main source of information is relatives and friends. It shows a lot has to be done to spread awareness about new publications, Shukla said.

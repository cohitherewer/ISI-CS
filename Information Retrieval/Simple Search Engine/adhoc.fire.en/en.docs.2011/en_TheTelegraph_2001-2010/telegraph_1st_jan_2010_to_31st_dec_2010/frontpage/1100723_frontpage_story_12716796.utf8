The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gauri on ad wagon, Shah Rukh by side 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Gauri on ad wagon, Shah Rukh by side

	Mumbai, July 22: They are in it for love  and the money.        
	Shah Rukh Khan will feature in an ad with wife Gauri for the first time in many years, joining other star pairs endorsing products and highlighting the Bollywood trend of being in love and flaunting it to ride the brand-wagon.        
	Sources say the Khans have been paid close to Rs 10 crore to appear in the home furnishing ad, beating Abhishek-Aishwaryas Rs 7.5-crore Lux deal, deemed to be the highest grossed by a star couple for endorsements.        
	SRK and Gauri will shoot the ad film in Mumbai in a few days with Snip director Sunhil Sippy.        
	The plan seems to be a take on Abhi-Ash, said an ad industry source close to the actor.        
	The Bachchans might not do as many ads as the other Bollywood pairs such as Saif-Kareena and John-Bipasha or Ajay-Kajol but they command a premium. Being a suave market reader, Shah Rukhs plan is to counter Abhi-Ash by getting Gauri into the scene.        
	Individually, Shah Rukh has had a neck-and-neck race with the senior Bachchan to be Bollywoods biggest endorser.        
	Gauri has so far stayed away from the arc lights except for on-off interview appearances on the small screen with her husband. But of late, she has carefully cultivated the public image of a glamorous fashionista living a high life and yet in full charge of a loving family, the source said.        
	This will, though, not be Gauris first ad. She has been a cover girl for Vogues Indian edition in January 2008 and the face of a jewellery brand owned and designed by friend Maheep Kapoor before that.        
	Saif and Kareena, who endorse the largest number of brands as a couple, charge Rs 6 crore for an ad. By contrast, Ajay-Kajol command a fee of Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 3 crore, while one has to stump up Rs 1 crore for John-Bipasha.        
	Shah Rukh alone commands a price of Rs 5-6 crore for each endorsement. With Gauri, they got double the sum. Ditto for Saif and Kareena who get between Rs 2.5 crore and Rs 3.5 crore individually, and Rs 6 crore together.        
	Despite the high price, advertisers are queuing up for Bollywood couples. The reason, according to ad industry watchers, is that they bring in a novelty and mystique that appeals immensely to potential consumers.        
	Everyone wants an insight into the personal lives of these stars. Its almost a voyeuristic kind of advertising that people can believe is real. There is a real-life story which makes the communication more acceptable and engaging, drawing attention to the product they endorse, the source said.        
	With so much to gain from a relationship, small-screen couples have also joined the ad rush. Sachin and Supriya Pilgaonkar endorse construction companies, and cosmetics and home appliance brands in Maharashtra.        
	Their younger colleagues like Apoorva Agnihotri-Shilpa Saklani and Tanaaz Currim-Bakhtiyar Irani endorse everything from night-after pills to condoms and ghee.         
	The ad jackpot complements the multi-crore-rupee contracts for TV appearances and stage shows for showbiz couples.        
	Beautiful, gooey-eyed and in love for ever  picture-perfect togetherness sells.

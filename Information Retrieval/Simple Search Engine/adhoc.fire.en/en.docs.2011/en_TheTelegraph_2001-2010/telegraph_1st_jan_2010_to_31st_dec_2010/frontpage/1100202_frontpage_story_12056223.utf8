                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                If it is Rahman, it must be twins
  - After oscars, composer does it again at Grammys          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            Actress and singer Tia Carrere presents a Grammy to AR Rahman in Los Angeles. (AFP)                                         
	Feb. 1: Lyricist Gulzars message to A.R. Rahman said it all: You are getting used to twins.        
	The twins were the two Grammys the composer had just won at Los Angeless Staples Center last night, less than a year after bagging a pair of Oscars at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.        
	This time too it was the 2008 Slumdog Millionaire score that netted the hallowed gramophone-shaped trophies.        
	Rahmans Na Na song from Hollywood rom com Couples Retreat has been listed along with 62 other tracks for tomorrows Oscar nominations, when five will be short-listed.        
	If last years Oscars came for Best Song and Best Music, the Grammy categories where he has triumphed are Best Song Written For Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media, and Best Compilation Soundtrack Album.         
	The composer stepped on the stage to say: This is insane. God is great again.        
	That was a reference to his Oscar speech, where he had said Ella pugazhum iraivanukkey in Tamil, meaning All glory to God.        
	Awards are better not expected, Rahman added. Its a good surprise, actually a great surprise. I just want to carry on doing my work.        
	For the Best Song Grammy, Jai Ho edged past Bruce Springsteens The Wrestler from the eponymous movie starring Mickey Rourke. In the other category, Slumdog beat rivals such as Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds and Twilight.        
	Rahman shared the Best Song award with Jai Ho singers Sukhwinder Singh, Tanvi Shah, Mahalaxmi Iyer and Vijay Prakash and Gulzar, who wrote the lyrics. Prakash and Shah were at the Grammy event, too.        
	Congratulatory tweets have been pouring in from Bollywood. And to AR Rahman...Congratulations! Love the track from Couples Retreat, wrote Deepika Padukone. Congrats A.R.!!! Congrats India!!! Jai hoooooooooooo!!!! Ssso proud, was Mallika Sherawats take.        
	Since he won the Oscars, Rahman has largely stayed in Los Angeles. His Bollywood scores for 2009, Delhi-6 and Blue, were done before the Oscar triumph. His first post-Oscar work was for Couples Retreat.        
	Rahman has since returned to his usual music mix, doing a score for a Tamil film (Gautham Menons Vinnaithandi Varuvaya), and is awaiting a couple of Bollywood releases, including Mani Ratnams Raavan.        
	For Chennai, where Rahman lives, the Oscar moment was much bigger than the Grammys. Oscar was the real crown, while Grammy could be another jewel in that crown. Anyway, the new year has started really well with Rahman getting the Padma Bhushan and now this, his younger sister Fathima said.        
	The other Indian nominees  sarod maestro Amjad Ali Khan and tabla ace Zakir Hussain  at the 52nd Grammys lost out.        
	Rahman is the fourth Indian to win a Grammy. The first, sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar, won the award thrice.        
	Zakir Hussain won in the Best World Music category in 1992 and again last year in the World Music Album category. Vishwa Mohan Bhatt won the Grammy in the World Music Album category in 1994.                    WITH INPUTS FROM G.C. SHEKHAR IN CHENNAI

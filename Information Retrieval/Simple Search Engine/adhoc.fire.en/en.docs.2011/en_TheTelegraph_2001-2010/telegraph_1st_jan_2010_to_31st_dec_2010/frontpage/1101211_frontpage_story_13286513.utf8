  - Patils mantra: discipline, concentration, time management          AMIT GUPTA                             Ranchi University V-C AA Khan presents a memento to President Pratibha Patil on Friday as Governor MOH Farook looks on. (Prashant Mitra)                                         
	Ranchi, Dec. 10: President Pratibha Devisingh Patil today advised the youth of Jharkhand to shun drugs and ragging on campuses, and in a message directed to the present guardians of the tribal state, called for a balanced approach to ensure sustainable development.         
	Drugs debilitate life. Precious lives lose their significance and are ruined. So please put a stop to it, she said while addressing the 25th convocation of Ranchi University (RU), the states oldest, here at Morabadi.         
	Ragging is the most injurious, criminal and disgraceful practice, which should be immediately stopped by the students with their junior colleagues, she told over 2,000 students of the university and a host of dignitaries, including Governor and RU chancellor M..H Farook and chief minister Arjun Munda.         
	Patil spoke of three qualities and asked students to imbibe them, as goals were easier to achieve if they did so. Successful life is largely a matter of discipline, but this discipline, in order to be of value, must be largely self-discipline.         
	Second, concentration helps in focusing the mind on the tasks before you. Third, time management helps you manage your tasks effectively by prioritising tasks and completing them as per schedule.        
	On Jharkhand, the President called for tribal students to be trained and taught constructive leadership qualities. With a large tribal population, mineral reserves and forests, development to be sustainable should be done in a manner that a balance is retained between economic, social, cultural and environment aspects, said Patil, flanked by Farook and Munda.                                                  
	She also expressed happiness that RU had a department of tribal and regional languages offering post-graduate level courses in nine local languages, namely, Mundari, Kurukh, Kurmali, Nagpuri, Santhali, Kharia, Panch Parganiya, Khorta and Ho.        
	During the hour and 15 minutes she spent at the convocation of RU, which is celebrating its golden jubilee, she conferred gold medals on as many as 36 varsity toppers in various postgraduate and undergraduate courses of 2009.         
	She specially congratulated girls for winning more gold medals than boys. Out of the 36 toppers, 25 are girls. I must extend special congratulations to girls. But I do not want to say boys have lagged behind, she said amid applause.        
	Patil acknowledged the contribution of the states sportspersons for bringing laurels to the nation and noted that Jharkhand would be hosting the 34th National Games, the mention of which brought a smile on the face of chief minister Munda.        
	On the challenges that lay ahead for RU, she spoke of the need to develop quality faculty to maintain high standards and produce world class graduates, post-graduates and doctoral students.         
	There is need for the faculty to equip themselves with new knowledge and technical skills to cater to the demand of the global market. There is also a need to upgrade the curricula, and to equip classrooms, laboratories and libraries, she said, referring to the Institute of Basic Sciences as an effort in that direction.        
	In his brief speech, Farook appealed to students to dedicate themselves to unravel the paradox of poverty amidst plenty in the context of working towards a just, fair and equitable society.         
	Munda said his government was committed to developing higher as well as school education in Jharkhand. IIM, Central University, a law university, two new state varsities (Kolhan and Neelambar Pitambar) have come up in the state in the last one year. It shows our commitment, he said.        
	Among the others who attended todays function were Union food processing minister and Ranchi MP Subodh Kant Sahay, Padmashree and former RU VC Ram Dayal Munda, vice chancellors A.A. Khan (RU), D.T. Khathing (Central University of Jharkhand), S.K. Roy (Neelambar-Pitambar University) and N.N. Singh (Birsa Agriculture University), state ministers Baidyanath Ram (HRD), Haji Hussain Ansari (welfare), Bimla Pradhan (tourism), Satyanand Jha Batul (agriculture), RU pro-VC V.P. Sharan and a host of officials, including deans and heads of department.

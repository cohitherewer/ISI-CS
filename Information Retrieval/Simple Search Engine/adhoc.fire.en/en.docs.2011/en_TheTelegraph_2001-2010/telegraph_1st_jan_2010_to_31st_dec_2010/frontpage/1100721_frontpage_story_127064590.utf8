	Patna, July 21 (PTI): Bihar Assembly Speaker Udai Narain Choudhry today suspended 16 Opposition MLAs for the rest of the session for their unruly behaviour in the House.
    Amid chaotic scenes in the House, a slipper was also thrown at the podium of the Speaker.
    State RJD President Abdul Bari Siddiqui and RJD deputy leader in the Assembly Shakeel Ahmed Khan were among those suspended.
    The action against the MLAs, who were sitting on a dharna since yesterday demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after a CAG report alleged financial irregularities in the state, was taken after they disobeyed the directive of the Speaker to let the House function.
    The proposal to seek the suspension of the MLAs was brought in the House by state parliamentary affairs in-charge Brijendra Prasad Yadav, which was passed by voice vote amid protests by opposition members.

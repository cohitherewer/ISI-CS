  - Twitter bars too obvious codes                                                  
	London, Jan. 2: Twitter has banned 370 words that it considers too obvious to be used as passwords for the service.         
	The micro-blogging service rejects certain passwords when new users sign up if it thinks they are too easy to guess. However, bloggers recently discovered that the list of banned passwords is embedded in the source code of the page itself.         
	Banned terms include commonly chosen generic passwords, such as 123456, password and password1, as well as car names (porsche, ferrari) and football teams (chelsea, arsenal).         
	Perhaps predictably for a website popular with technology fans, science fiction terms figure in the list too. THX1138, the title of the first feature film directed by George Lucas of Star Wars fame, is banned, as is NCC1701  the registry number of Star Treks starship Enterprise  and trustno1, which was Fox Mulders password in The X-Files.         
	Research has shown that people are often all too predictable when it comes to choosing passwords. In research published earlier this year, insurer CPP found that nearly half of Britons use the same password to login to their banking, shopping and social networking sites.         
	The research also found that one in five people use their pets names for their passwords, while one in eight use memorable dates, such as birthdays, and one in ten use their childrens names.         
	Security experts advise that a strong password should consist of letters and numbers.        
	 They should be changed regularly and an individual should not use the same password for all online services.         
	No sensible person would use the same key for their house, car and garage. In the same way, we shouldnt use the one password for everything, said Sarah Blaney, an identity theft expert at life assistance company CPP.         
	If possible people should use multiple passwords with a combination of letters and numbers, which should be difficult to crack.        
	Former computer hacker Robert Schifreen said: An online fraudster who manages to find your single password will have the keys to your entire online life. They can then do everything to your accounts that you can. Varying one word by putting a digit on the end is too easy for a hacker. Also, if they see your password is January, they will try February, March etc. for other websites.         
	Schifreen added: It can be very difficult remembering so many passwords these days but it is vital. I keep one word processing document that lists all my usernames and passwords and protect this with a very strong password. I then only have to remember one. Make sure your anti-virus software is up to date, trust nobody online and only type your confidential information into a website if you know it is secure. quot;

A PTI file picture      New Delhi, April 27 (PTI): According to government sources, Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) is making concerted efforts to carry out attacks in the country and to develop links in Maldives and other neighbours.   The Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Maken in a written reply told ldquo;available inputs indicate that Pakistan-based militant groups primarily the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) are making concerted efforts to organise terrorist attacks in various parts of the country. rdquo;   Most iconic institutions, prominent industrial installations and tourist locations are in their target list, says the minister.   India and Maldives share a close network in strengthening bilateral security, hence the present LeT links wit Maldives, has raised new security queries in the country. But the Minister says relevant authorities are made aware of this security concern through bilateral channels.     Apart from the LeT, the minister adds Indian Mujahideen to the list of the most prominent militant groups. But the government is well protective presently adds Maken ldquo;The government continues to be alert to these threats and re-calibrates its measures to combat terrorism by way of reviewing threat perception and a number of important decisions and measures have been taken, rdquo; he said.  To prevent serious attacks from the enemies, the government has constituted the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Maken confirms ldquo;the Multi-Agency centre has been strengthened and reorganised to enable it to function on 24x7 basis for real time collection and sharing of intelligence with other intelligence and security agencies.  Government also denied any proposal to create the post of National Intelligence Coordinator to strengthen intelligence system.

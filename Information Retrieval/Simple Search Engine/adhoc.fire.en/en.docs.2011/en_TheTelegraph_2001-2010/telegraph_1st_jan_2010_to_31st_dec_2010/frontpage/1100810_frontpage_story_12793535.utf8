  - Coming here and talking about peace is an achievement: Mamata        DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                                    
	Lalgarh, Aug. 9: There she stood on the frying pan of a platform, a slip of a figure in the sun filling a void inexplicably left unmanned by a 33-year-old monolith.        
	Peace and development fought for space on Mamata Banerjees lips in Lalgarh today but her overriding accomplishment was she did manage to step into a void  an uncharted vacuum for the symbols of power in Bengal for around one and a half years.        
	A restrained Mamata did not want to put too fine a point on it but she did acknowledge the import of keeping her date with Lalgarh that has fallen off the map of governance for months.        
	Coming here and talking about peace and democracy is an achievement, Mamata told The Telegraph after addressing an apolitical rally organised under the aegis of her party.        
	Thousands of PCPA supporters from villages like Punnapani, Bamal, Gohomidanga, Lakshmanpur and Jharnadange and Trinamul foot soldiers from nearby towns like Haldia, Dispur, Garbeta, Ghatal, Midnapore and Tamluk attended the rally, the plan for which was announced during Mamatas July 21 meeting at Esplanade in Calcutta.        
	In the backdrop of continued violence in Jungle Mahal, todays rally was one of the biggest political events in the area, on the boil since an attack on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy on November 2, 2008.        
	By turning it into a success in what is considered a Maoist stronghold, Mamata has dealt another blow to the beleaguered Bhattacharjee government.        
	Mamata rolled out a two-pronged formula  the Maoists shunning violence and coming to the talks table and the Centre withdrawing the joint forces after the talks start  for the peace process, although she did not elaborate how she planned to attain the twin objectives.        
	Echoing Mamata, other speakers at the rally  Swami Agnivesh and Medha Patkar  laid stress on the same points as necessary conditions for peace. But none came up with a specific roadmap to restore normality in one of the most underdeveloped regions in the state, covering parts of Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore.        
	The main thing is the peace process has to start, said Mamata, as she sat next to Swami Agnivesh after her 30-minute speech under a merciless August sun.        
	When the process will start, who will steer it or who will take Mamatas missive to the Maoists  all these questions remained unanswered even as Trinamul leaders congratulated each other for the success of the rally.        
	Over 10,000 people could make it to the venue  Lalgarh Ramkrishna Higher Secondary School  while 40,000 were stuck on the approach roads.        
	They tried to scare me to prevent me from coming here. But I have still come and I want to bring an end to the politics of violence and killings, said Mamata, with a white uttariya wrapped around her head, as she started her speech a few minutes after 2pm.        
	With the administration unable to deliver development in the area, she chose the occasion to grab what the Left Front government has conceded to her with years of inaction in the deprived belt.        
	The Left committed another blunder: once rebellion erupted in Lalgarh, war-horse politicians who could once connect with the masses turned their back on the terrain. Even after Union home minister P. Chidambaram landed in Lalgarh, neither chief minister Bhattacharjee nor any other CPM leader of similar stature chose to make a trip. An irony of todays meeting was the state government had little option but to foot Mamatas security bill and allow her to reap the political dividends.        
	Tell me, what do you want? I will try to ensure whatever is possible for me. But the democratic process in a peaceful environment has to start, she said.        
	In an attempt to prove that she did not come empty handed, Mamata announced a grant of Rs 20 lakh from Mukul Roys MP funds for the school premises that hosted the meeting. As a majority of those who attended the rally were from the tribal communities, she also promised that she would fight for their right to forests and continue her opposition to the Centres proposed land acquisition bill and special economic zones.        
	The government has done nothing for us.... Nobody cares about this area. We are happy that Mamata at least came here. We dont know whether she will deliver, but we all know that she is a brave woman, said Nantu Mahato, an unemployed youth in his early twenties, who came from Goaltore to attend the rally.        
	Mamata refused to use a bullet-proof car but that was not the only risk she took today. She rolled a political dice by urging the Maoists to shun violence and come to the talks table to restore peace in Jungle Mahal and assuring withdrawal of the joint forces if the talks start.        
	I urge my Maoist friends to take part in the dialogue. Once the talks start, you must stop violence and come for democratic negotiations. If necessary, the joint forces will be withdrawn, Mamata told the rally.        
	In a statement last week, Maoist leader Kishan had extended his support for the rally and lauded Mamatas peace attempts. The reaction to Mamatas call for an end to violence, however, was not available till late in the evening.        
	Her peace formula will also have to face another test  the response of the UPA government, which does not have any immediate plans to abandon its offensive against the Maoists.

          JOHN MARY AND CITHARA PAUL                                                    
	May 22: A hurtling jet, a terrible ball of fire and 38 gone.        
	Todays crash exacted its heaviest toll on a single district  Kasargod, Keralas northernmost.        
	The state itself lost 60, though the tragedy was tinged with some relief. Among the eight survivors were five Malayalis: G.K. Pradeep, Krishnan Koolikunnu, K.P. Mayankutty, Ummer Farook Mohammed and Mohammed Usman.        
	But as disconsolate relatives searched for their dead at hospital morgues, the wail of loss drowned the tears of relief. And Kasargod grieved the most.        
	Every panchayat in this Muslim-dominated district will be bringing home at least one charred body, said Abdul Kareem, a Kasargod native.        
	Among the victims was Siddique Sulaiman who, till evening yesterday, didnt know if he could make it to his fathers funeral in Kasargod this morning. Sulaiman, a salesman with a construction company in Dubai, got the confirmation late last night, little realising it would be his ticket to death.        
	His ticket wasnt confirmed till late in the night. Then we got a call from him. He told us he would be landing here by an early morning flight, so we fixed the funeral at 9, Sulaimans uncle Usman Ali Hassan told The Telegraph from Mangalore.        
	We were at the airport since yesterday morning trying to find a flight for Siddique so he could attend the funeral. Finally he got a seat on this flight, Sulaimans brother-in-law Abdul Nasir told PTI from Dubai.        
	We were at the airport to see him off last night. It is a heart-breaking tragedy for the entire family.         
	Among the shock-numbed was a wife and two children, who had taken a taxi from Kannur, which adjoins Kasargod, to Bajpe airport this morning.        
	Abdul Samad had sweated it out in the Gulf for 18 years. Yesterday, he called his daughter, a plus-2 student, and told her he was bringing her a surprise gift.         
	At the airport today, his wife and children saw the Air India Express flight scream down the runway and disappear out of sight. Moments later, flames leapt into the air and a cloud of smoke billowed.        
	In Kannur and Kasargod, nearly every family has someone in the Gulf. Today, a common grief bound them all  the bitter story of a better life built on Gulf remittances gone wrong in one horrible twist.        
	For non-resident Malayalis from Kasargod, which borders Karnataka, the nearest airport is Bajpe, renovated and opened a week back. The airport is about 72km from Kasargod, making it comparatively more accessible to overseas travellers than Karipur airport, near Kozhikode, about 225km away.        
	But Bajpe airport would forever remain scalded into Sameer A. Shaikhs mind. The Saudi Arabia-based businessman, going to attend the last rites of his grandmother, lost 16 relatives in the crash.        
	I flew into Mumbai from Saudi Arabia yesterday and was scheduled to catch a Jet Airways flight to Mangalore this morning as I couldnt get a connecting flight from there, he told PTI at Mumbai airport.        
	The 24-year-old said his maternal uncle, his wife and two children, and 12 distant relatives were among those killed in the crash.                     WITH INPUTS FROM PTI

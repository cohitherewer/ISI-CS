          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 23: CPI(Maoist) politburo member Amitabh Bagchi was granted bail by Jharkhand High Court today.         
	Bagchi, 53, had moved the high court against an order of a fast-track court, which had awarded him life sentence. However, he will not be released from jail because he has been remanded in a criminal case pending in Andhra Pradesh.         
	A native of Bengal, the Maoist leader was arrested from Ranchi station on August 24, 2009, on the basis of a tip-off. Several documents and Maoist literature were found on him. During interrogation, Bagchi, a member of the CPI(Maoist)s think tank, admitted to his involvement with the banned outfit.        
	At the end of his trial at a fast-track court, judge Alok Kumar Dubey found him guilty under Section 121 of the IPC (waging war against the government) and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for life.        
	During the trial in the high court, Bagchis advocate Jitendra Singh argued that police had recovered Naxalite texts from him, but it did not mean that he was advertising or propagating rebel ideologies to incite people.         
	Singh also pointed out that the lower court had said that the recovered books  Jail Break Jehanabad and Dandkaranya Nai Jansatta  were highly provocative and sensitive.         
	If the books were indeed so provocative, then the judge ought to have been transformed into the Naxalite way of thinking, the advocate said.        
	After hearing the case, a division bench, comprising Justice R.K. Merathia and Justice Jaya Roy, observed that merely possessing Naxalite literature did not amount to criminal offence. The court further said that every citizen had the right to profess his ideologies and it was not a crime under the penal code.

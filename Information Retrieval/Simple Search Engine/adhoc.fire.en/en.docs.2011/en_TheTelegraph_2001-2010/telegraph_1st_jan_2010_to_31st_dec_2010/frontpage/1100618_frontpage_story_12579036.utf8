          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 17: The Union Cabinet today approved amendments to a law to exempt select institutions from student quotas for Other Backward Classes and give others three years to implement OBC reservations.         
	Amendments to the Central Educational Institutions (reservations in admissions) Act, exempt institutions from OBC reservations altogether, if Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe quotas add up to 50 per cent or more.         
	However, the SC/ST quota will have to be cut down to 50 per cent unless the institution is in the northeast  including Sikkim, excluding non-tribal areas of Assam.         
	The institutions where Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe quotas add up to less than 50 per cent will need to implement OBC quotas to fill 50 per cent seats in all.        
	While most central institutions implement 7.5 per cent quotas for Scheduled Tribe and 15 per cent for Scheduled Caste students, select institutions which were converted from state institutions to central universities follow regional quota policies.         
	The OBC quota law had mandated that all central institutions would have to implement 27 per cent quota for OBC within three years of the laws enactment.                     
	The human resource development ministry had agreed to allow institutions six years  three additional years  based on a demand from Jamia Millia Islamia.         
	Jamia has not implemented OBC quotas.

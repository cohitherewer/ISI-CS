The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nitish dilemma: to break or not 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nitish dilemma: to break or not 
          J.P. YADAV                             Nitish Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, June 15: The face-off between the BJP and its Bihar ally Nitish Kumar over Narendra Modi has planted the seeds of a debate within the Janata Dal (United)  whether to remain partners or break off.        
	Although most JD(U) workers are egging on Nitish to snap ties, saying the party would then get the wholehearted support of Muslims in the Assembly elections later this year, the chief minister is learnt to be treading cautiously.        
	The call to break the alliance grew louder after BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudys statement yesterday that the Gujarat chief minister, publicly rebuffed by Nitish, would campaign for the polls.        
	He will if the state unit wants him to, Rudy had said.        
	JD(U) spokesperson Shivanand Tiwari reacted sharply to Rudys statement. Nitish Kumar would lead the NDAs campaign in Bihar.         
	If the BJP does not accept it and presses that someone else will be their face, then it will be construed that they deliberately want to endanger the alliance, Tiwari told The Telegraph, making it clear that his party did not want Modi to campaign in Bihar.        
	Sources close to Nitish, however, said the veteran politician wouldnt act in a hurry and was weighing the pros and cons, including the possibility of the BJP using Modi to whip up a communal frenzy if the JD(U) parted ways now.        
	If we part ways now, then Narendra Modi could be used to create a communal divide in Bihar, said a minority JD(U) leader, adding that it could upset all calculations.        
	Sources said Nitish would, ideally, want the BJP to give it an opportunity on the eve of the elections so that he could then pass the parting blame on the ally.        
	If the BJP disregards us and uses Narendra Modi to campaign in Bihar, then the alliance would be over for all practical purposes and it will compel us to part ways, a senior JD(U) leader said.

CRPF drawn into mine-laid trap           SHEENA K. IN RAIPUR AND ARCHIS MOHAN IN NEW DELHI                                              
	April 6: Maoists apparently used a red herring to draw a CRPF foot patrol into a booby-trapped Chhattisgarh forest this morning and massacred 76 personnel in the rebels bloodiest attack ever on security forces.        
	Not one from the team of 81 CRPF personnel and a police constable was left standing after over four hours of carnage that exposed an intelligence disaster in the middle of an undeclared cross-country anti-Maoist offensive, Operation Green Hunt.        
	Seventy-four CRPF jawans and the police guide died and the remaining seven were fighting for life in hospital, hours after being tricked into the ambush with a false lead about a rebel camp being held 25km from their base, Chintalnaar.        
	The toll later rose to 76 when reinforcements approached the ambush site in Maoist stronghold Dantewada district  a mine-preventive vehicle got blown up by a mine, killing its CRPF driver.        
	Something has gone very wrong. They seem to have walked into a camp or a trap, admitted Union home minister P. Chidambaram, the chief advocate of Green Hunt who had visited Maoist hub Lalgarh in Bengal just two days ago and announced a significant improvement in the situation in Chhattisgarh.        
	Home secretary G.K. Pillai said the CRPF company  well trained in jungle warfare - had set out for the Maoist camp on Sunday morning, venturing into a part of Dantewada that no personnel had entered in several years.                  
	After two days of futile search, they began the return trek but made a cardinal mistake. They took the same dirt track by which they had come despite alternative routes being available, and reached a spot hemmed in by hills on three sides around 6am.        
	On the hilltops, some 1,000 guerrillas were waiting for them in makeshift bunkers  having already fitted the trees and boulders below with pressure mines that explode on contact.        
	As bullets and grenades rained from above, the jawans would have found retaliation almost impossible but officials insisted they did fire back.        
	When the jawans tried to take cover behind the trees and boulders, the mines went off. Pillai said at least 50 of the men died after stepping on the improvised mines, made with readily available chemicals such as urea, diesel, potassium and ammonium nitrate, with a piece of bamboo or even a medical syringe used as touch trigger.        
	So far, 45 per cent of all security force casualties against Maoists have come in landmine blasts, compared with 63 per cent for the US military in Iraq and 53 per cent in Afghanistan.         
	The ambush was planned not hours or days but weeks in advance, a home ministry official said.        
	Reinforcements arrived around 10.30am, bringing with them an armoured mine-protection vehicle (MPV), built to withstand blasts from up to 20kg of explosives.        
	The Maoists must have planted more than 20kg to blow it up  sometime ago we had seized Maoist documents on how to blow up an MPV, a home ministry official said.        
	Among the dead were deputy commandant Saryawan Singh and assistant commandant B.L. Meena, both from Rajasthan. The rebels carried away 75 weapons that included AK-47s and light machine guns.        
	Air force and BSF helicopters evacuated the seven injured, but not before the guerrillas managed to shoot at one of the BSF choppers. The Maoists fired at the reinforcements too but without causing casualties. Sources said the rebels by now probably wanted only to provide covering fire for their leaders to escape.        
	The heavy casualties  exactly double the previous worst  meant that nearly an entire CRPF company had been wiped out. A company has 100 men or a little more, and some would have stayed behind to guard the base and keep it running.        
	So far, the forces highest toll at Maoist hands was 38, when the rebels fired rockets at a boat of Andhra Pradesh polices anti-Naxalite Greyhound commandos on an Orissa lake last June.        
	(Todays) casualty is very high and I am deeply shocked, Chidambaram said. This shows the savage nature of the CPI (Maoist) and their brutality and the savagery they are capable of.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who had described the Maoists as the biggest threat to Indias internal security, expressed shock and grief and phoned Chidambaram for details. Singh later chaired a National Security Council meeting, attended by the three service chiefs, that discussed the attack.        
	Pillai denied the possibility of the army being deployed or the air force being asked to provide air cover.        
	The attack has triggered absolute panic among mining officials in Dantewada, home to Indias largest iron-ore miner NMDC, said the state-owned companys deputy general manager, S.P. Himanshu Kumar.

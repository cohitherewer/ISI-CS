  - Buddha bends party to his will but only over Presidency           ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                             Bhattacharjee (top), Dasgupta                                
	Calcutta, March 20: From PDG days to the Presidency University Bill is a great leap for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	In pushing the bill with rare grit, he has finally walked out of the shadow of his original mentor, Promode Dasgupta, the man who is credited with making the Bengal CPM what it is and who still remains the chief ministers model in most party affairs.         
	It was Dasgupta who set the agenda for the CPMs education politics that applied as much to primary schools as to Presidency College. The same agenda informed the CPMs original policy on the teaching of English.        
	At the centre of it was the party doctrine that education must be rid of the control of elitists and made democratic. Presidency was, to PDG and his party, the ultimate symbol of elitism in education in Bengal. The anti-English campaign was part of the same political agenda.         
	But dismantling elitism and democratising education was merely the ideological mask for a political design. It was, in reality, the partys way of infiltrating the middle classes. In villages and small towns, teachers were the most effective tools of social control. It was not enough to make the CPM a party of workers and peasants; it had to be a teachers party as well.         
	Like most of todays leaders in the Bengal CPM, Bhattacharjee rose in the CPM as a PDG protg. He may have taken some lessons in governance from Jyoti Basu, but as a party animal he remained completely sworn to PDGs ways.        
	That is why the Presidency bill is a political turnaround for him personally, if not for his party which is still largely wedded to the former CPM strongmans legacy, which was later carried forward by Anil Biswas.         
	There are several political angles to the chief ministers insistence on seeing the bill through in the Assembly as soon as possible. The most obvious of them is the perception that this could be his last chance to do so as his party faces the prospect of losing power in the next years polls.         
	The Presidency bill was different from his industrialisation drive which has hit a wall in Mamata Banerjees fierce opposition. That apart, the electoral cost the party has paid for pushing industrialisation makes it clear that it is a closed chapter for him and his party. He may still believe he was right in his industrialisation campaign, but he knows how it got awfully wrong and will not venture into it anytime soon.         
	Over Presidency, he didnt have to worry about Mamata. There was no land acquisition involved. More important, this was one issue on which Bhattacharjee and Mamata agreed, though she cannot be seen to be supporting anything the CPM does. The question was whether Bhattacharjee could do it while he had the power and not leave it to her to do it when she takes power away from him.         
	He has now not only done it but also made the protests by the Trinamul Congress and the Congress look quite irrelevant.         
	By their own admission, the two Opposition parties support the move to upgrade Presidency College to a university. The real thing about the Oppositions complaint is a feeling that the chief minister has stolen a march over them. Trinamuls advisers on education are now trying to claim that it was the fear of Mamata doing it when she became chief minister that forced Bhattacharjees hands.         
	It is difficult to see how the Presidency bill will help the CPM in any way in recovering some of its lost ground. Even if he has to go down in next years polls, Bhattacharjee, himself an alumnus of Presidency, will have the satisfaction of having scored one major triumph.         
	Ironically, he could do this only when his party had become weaker. It is not unknown that Bhattacharjee has been personally in favour of granting Presidency and several other colleges autonomy for many years. He pitched for it far more strongly than Jyoti Basu, who also disagreed with the partys education politics, ever did. But the party and its formidable college and university teachers association would have none of that because they were uneasy about losing their grip on education.         
	Even now, most party leaders do not quite support Bhattacharjees zeal for the Presidency bill. But there is a big change  the party is now on a sticky wicket. If he cannot defeat Mamata, Bhattacharjee can now at least bend his weakened party to his will.         
	But it may be nave to see in the Presidency bill a real change in the CPMs education politics. The chief minister may have forced the party to let him have his way with Presidency. Elsewhere  in schools and colleges across the state  it may continue to be party business as usual.

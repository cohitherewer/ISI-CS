  - Bid to cut down case clearing time         SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             Arjun Munda                                        
	Ranchi, Dec. 23: The Jharkhand government has formulated a state policy to reduce the average time it takes to clear court cases, identify bottlenecks and discourage unnecessary government litigations.         
	The policy, which has already got chief minister Arjun Mundas nod, is likely to be placed before the cabinet for approval tomorrow. Munda also happens to be the states law minister.        
	According to sources, the state government will appoint a new set of lawyers to fight cases in the Supreme Court, where over 400 suits related to Jharkhand are pending.         
	The state litigation policy is in line with the national litigation policy formulated by the Centre in June this year as a part of the National Legal Mission. The purpose of this policy is to reduce government litigation in courts so that valuable court time is devoted to pending cases.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, state law secretary G.K. Verma said the state policy would make an effort to reduce the average pendency time of cases from the present 15 years to three years.         
	At present, as many as 2.75 lakh cases are pending in subordinate courts, while the judicial arrears in Jharkhand High Court are pegged at around 60,000. Several cases, particularly those involving corruption, have been even dragging for over 28 years in the special courts set up to try cases lodged by the CBI and the state vigilance bureau.        
	The draft policy also stipulates that incompetent and inefficient lawyers will not be on the panel of the government. It envisages screening committees at every level to assess the skills and capabilities of aspirant lawyers who want to be on the government panel.         
	Also, the performance of government lawyers will be monitored regularly. Their fee structure will be revised and delay in payment of legal fees reduced.         
	Notably, the 13th Finance Commission had allocated special funds for training government lawyers.         
	At present, there is no mechanism in place for appointment of government lawyers, most of whom are hired for their political patronage. Neither is there any system to monitor performance, which often results in embarrassment for the government in court.         
	The law secretary said the tools of alternative dispute redressal would be invoked first to settle the cases related to service matters. Also, inter-departmental disputes will be resolved at the department level, instead of knocking on the doors of the court.        
	We have prepared the draft policy keeping in view the state and district level conditions. We have defined the procedures for speedy disposal of cases at the government level, he added.        
	Under the policy, the litigations will be prioritised with particular emphasis on welfare legislation, social reform, weaker sections and senior citizens.

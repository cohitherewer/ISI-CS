                                Haig: Acerbic                            
	Washington, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Alexander Haig, a former army general who became White House chief of staff during the Watergate scandal and was secretary of state during the Reagan administration, died today at the age of 85.        
	Haig sought the US presidency, but his bid for the Republican nomination ended in failure in 1988, a campaign noted for his acerbic taunting of other candidates including Vice-President George Bush, the eventual nominee. A spokesman for Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore said Haig died early today. He had no further details.        
	Symbolically, the closest Haig came to being President was when he proclaimed to the news media that Im in control here after an assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan in 1981. Critics called that statement, which seemed to incorrectly state the line of presidential succession, pompous and militaristic.        
	Haig secured a place in American history by holding the presidency together in 1974 during the months leading up to Richard Nixons resignation in the Watergate scandal. Telling friends that when your President asks, you do it, he had reluctantly resigned as army vice chief of staff in May 1973 to take over the top White House staff job.

          G.C. SHEKHAR                                              
	Chennai, Aug. 2: Perhaps only one thing can unite the Congress: the call of sycophancy.        
	P. Chidambaram was billed the Living Mahatma and Political Octopus and Union shipping minister G.K. Vasan portrayed as a king as the various party factions came together for a day, ostensibly to remember a long-dead Dalit leader known for his integrity and simplicity.        
	Usually, the divided Tamil Nadu Congress puts up a show of unity only when top brass like Sonia Gandhi or Manmohan Singh come visiting. But the memory of P. Kakkan, home minister in K. Kamarajs Congress government in the 50s, had all of them joining hands to stage a rally on Saturday night.        
	Kakkan, the polar opposite of most present-day Congress leaders, died a pauper in Madurai General Hospital in December 1981. He would have been tossing in his grave at the way the party went about the belated centenary celebration.        
	Madurai was replete with vinyl banners of Congress leaders, one showing Vasan in a kings attire and another honouring the Union home minister as a political clairvoyant, comparing him to the soccer soothsayer, Paul the Octopus.        
	One banner was fit to lift the World Cup of sycophancy: it depicted Chidambaram as Gandhi on a currency note, dubbing him the Living Mahatma.        
	The decision to celebrate Kakkans centenary two years belatedly appeared to have been prompted by the partys keenness to demonstrate how crucial it was to any electoral calculations in the state.        
	All major faction leaders were present: Chidambaram and Vasan, who rarely see eye to eye; former Union minister E.V.K.S. Elangovan, who is a die-hard critic of ally DMK; state Congress president K.V. Thangkabalu, who needs to please both the Congress and the DMK high commands to protect his post.        
	Thousands of cadres came from the southern districts, where the Congress still has a decent following, hoping to be handed a battle cry for next years Assembly polls. But barring Elangovan, the leaders chose to play it safe.        
	Let not the rulers here forget they need us more than we need them. Without Congress support, no party has ever won in Tamil Nadu, Elangovan thundered, drawing the loudest cheers.        
	Chidambaram urged all Dalit leaders to merge their outfits with the Congress. Kakkan was able to accomplish so much for Dalits only because he was part of the Congress, he said.        
	He, however, disappointed the cadres by not even hinting if the party would demand a share in power after the state polls. This was all the more surprising because his son Karti Chidambaram had recently declared the Congress must get at least two seats in each Lok Sabha constituency, which works out to 78 Assembly seats.        
	Vasan, the state Congress leader with the largest support base, merely said the Congress should graduate from a catalyst that determines electoral wins to the states main political party.        
	Our leaders fail to realise how impatient our cadres have become after the Congress lost its best opportunity at power-sharing four years ago, a senior MLA said.        
	Unless the seat shares for the May elections guarantee that the party would be part of the next government, all the energy and fresh blood injected by Rahul Gandhi will go waste.

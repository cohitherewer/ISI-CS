  - Nationalist bureaucrat to decide on fate of Arundhati bungalow         RASHEED KIDWAI                                Arundhati Roy (top);   The house   of Pradeep Kishan,   Roys   husband; Manoj   Srivastava, who will hear the appeal (bottom)                                
	Bhopal, Dec. 12: She is a writer-activist who has spoken for the Narmada dam oustees and for Kashmirs pro-azaadi protesters.        
	He is a Ramayan translator and the brain behind the BJP governments move to make the singing of Vande Mataram compulsory at its offices in Madhya Pradesh.        
	Now Manoj Srivastava, known as much for his hatred of illegal construction as for his nationalist leanings, will be deciding the fate of Arundhati Roys forest bungalow in Panchmarhi that is said to encroach on tribal land.        
	Srivastava, the divisional commissioner of Bhopal and Hoshangabad, will hear an appeal against a subdivisional magistrates verdict that the bungalow, built inside a tiger reserve, is unauthorised.        
	The IAS officer had shot to fame in 1997 when, under the rule of Congress chief minister Digvijay Singh, he supervised the destruction of an illegal building in Indore with dynamite. The building belonged to a local Congress leader close to then party president Sitaram Kesri.        
	Srivastava was then Indore collector and was considered Digvijays favourite. But under BJP rule, he became a key advisor to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who recently suggested that prison was the ideal place for Roy for her seditious pronouncements.        
	Srivastava is known also for his unusual preferences  he took the IAS examination in Hindi and loves to travel by train.        
	The civil servant had grown close to Chauhan during his stints as commissioner (public relations) and head of the states culture department. Digvijay and other state Congress leaders have often protested publicly against his style of functioning, particularly during the November 2008 Assembly polls.        
	Srivastava kept a low profile during the May 2009 Lok Sabha elections, choosing to translate the lengthy Sundar Kanda, the fifth section of the Ramayan where Hanuman burns down Ravans Lanka, into several volumes in Hindi.         
	Apart from the Vande Mataram diktat, Srivastava is also believed to have been behind the government direction to children to perform the Surya Namaskar at school. Both moves earned Chauhan flak from many Christian and Muslim organisations.        
	In his current job, Srivastava has launched a drive against encroachment and the land mafia. His status as arbitrator on the dispute over Roys bungalow has set off a buzz of anticipation.        
	Roys husband Pradeep Kishan, a filmmaker and author, had bought the Panchmarhi land from a tribal 18 years ago. A complaint from his neighbour Vijay Singh, now deceased, had prompted the revenue department to slap Kishan with a show-cause notice in 2003.        
	Kishan and four others, including writer Vikram Seths sister Aradhana Seth, then approached Madhya Pradesh High Court, which recently referred the matter back to the department.        
	On November 30, subdivisional magistrate V. Kirangopal upheld the revenue departments stand that the bungalow was illegal. He said a house built on forestland could be inherited but not sold. Roy claims the bungalow is located in a revenue area and not in a forest area.        
	After the decision by Srivastava, an appeal can be made to the state revenue board and then the Supreme Court.

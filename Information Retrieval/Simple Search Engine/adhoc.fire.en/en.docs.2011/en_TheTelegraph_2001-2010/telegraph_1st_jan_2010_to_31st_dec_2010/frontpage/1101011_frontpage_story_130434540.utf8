                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ayodhya title suit: Hindu Mahasabha files caveat in SC
				                               
	New Delhi, Oct 11 (PTI): Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha has filed a caveat in the Supreme Court to pre-empt any ex-parte order on the Ayodhya title dispute.
    In the caveat, the Hindu Mahasabha has asked the court not to pass order on any appeal against the September 30 Allahabad High Court verdict without hearing it.
    The organisation has filed the caveat through its national president Swami Chakrapani.
    General Secretary of Hindu Mahasabha Indira Tiwari said a petition is also likely to be filed making it clear that it was not in favour of any compromise on the issue and wants a legal solution to the whole dispute.
    "We want only legal solution. We are against any type of compromise as we are in favour of constructing a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya," she said.

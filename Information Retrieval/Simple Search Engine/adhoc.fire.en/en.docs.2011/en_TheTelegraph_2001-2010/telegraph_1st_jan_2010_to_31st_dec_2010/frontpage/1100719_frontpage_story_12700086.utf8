The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nandigram full circle: threat to MPs life
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nandigram full circle: threat to MPs life
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Subhendu Adhikari                                  
	Tamluk, July 18: Suspected Maoists have distributed leaflets in Nandigram and adjoining Khejuri saying they would kill Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari, the first time the rebels have threatened such a senior leader of the party.        
	The handbills, circulating for the past five days, accused Adhikari of betraying the rebels after taking their help during the Nandigram land movement three years ago and warned he would meet the same fate as Nishikanta Mondal.        
	The Trinamul panchayat chief of Sonachura was killed last September, and the Maoists had claimed responsibility for the murder few days later. If Subhendu Adhikari does not restrain himself, he will meet the same fate as that of Nishikanta Mondal, say the leaflets, signed by one Salim for the rebels Nandigram zonal committee.        
	Police claim that Salim is an alias for Madhusudan Mandal, the CPI (Maoist) state committee member arrested from Calcuttas fringes since last month. Adhikari, wary of any revelations of rebel links, alleged the distribution of leaflets is a handiwork of the CPM which has often accused him and his party of having Maoist links.        
	Salim is no one but Madhusudan Mandal, who was arrested from Amtala in South 24-Parganas on June 29. So, the posters must have been printed before his arrest, said an officer. Madhusudan was picked up along with four others during a swoop on the rebels and their suspected sympathisers in and around Calcutta.        
	The leaflets accuse the Tamluk MP of trying to oust the revolutionary organisations from various areas (of Nandigram and Khejuri) by using the administration and the police. A Maoist source alleged Adhikari got Madhusudan arrested. Madhusudan played a key role in Nandigram movement and he was active in spreading our (Maoists) organisation in Nandigram. So, Subhendu Adhikari will not be spared, the source added.        
	Trinamul leaders in Nandigram have become betrayers after their victory in the 2008 panchayat polls, the rebel source said. They (Trinamul) started hatching conspiracies to help the police arrest our activists. We have already punished Nishikanta Mondal.        
	Police officers in East Midnapore, of which Nandigram is a part, said they had tightened Adhikaris security since last month  before the fresh threat.         
	We have proof of the Maoists presence and have seen the handbills. Subhendu Adikaris security has been stepped up. The MP now has an escort jeep with six policemen, led by a sub-inspector, East Midnapore SP Ashok Biswas said. The leader earlier had only two constables for protection.        
	Adhikari, though, pointed a finger at the CPM. It (the leaflets) is the handiwork of the CPM. I dont care what the leaflets say as the people are with me, he said.         
	CPM district secretariat member Ashok Guria denied the allegation. The CPM no longer has any organisation in Nandigram or Khejuri. The leaflets only establish the link between the Maoists and Trinamul, said Guria.        
	The Maoists fell out with Trinamul leaders after the party began to distance itself from the rebels before the panchayat polls in 2008 to take the entire credit for the Nandigram movement, a state intelligence branch official said.        
	Jaitley warning        
	BJP leader Arun Jaitley today described Maoists and the influx from Bangladesh as Bengals major problems. We consider Maoists and infiltration as the major problems, he said in Calcutta.

  - Riding a marketing wave, homecoming edition of Indian Premier League gets off the ground today          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                       Actress Priyanka Chopra at the IPL-related event in Mumbai on Wednesday. (Fotocorp)                                
	Mumbai, March 11: Theres news beyond their frustrating losses for the Indian hockey fans: Priyanka Chopra, their fervent telly muse, has been sighted.        
	After a whole month of clenched-fist vowing shell be there to spur the charge of Rajpal Singhs men and never making good her promise, she bobbed up on crickets stage yesterday to administer her own shots to an event already staggering on celebrity overdose  a scarlet body-hugging mini, matching peep-toes in white lace sandals, crimson nails scattering kisses, delectable thunder.        
	Good enough to inspire a few more raids on rival goalposts? Alas, IHF, if only youd called yourselves IPL.         
	Theres barely a more striking metaphor today to define the difference  and the cruel disparity  between the national sport and the national obsession than Priyanka Chopra. Its the choice she made between a public pledge to motivate hockey and a private deal to push IPL ticket sales.        
	But there may yet be a point being missed somewhere here. This may not be about the foregone bout between national sport and national obsession  hockey and cricket. And this is even less about Priyanka Chopra, who, to be fair, has lent her salience to more urgent concerns than cricket, and in a way few of her breed do. This is probably about an entity that has installed itself at a fair, and profitable, remove from our happy obsessions: commerce.        
	IPL Twenty20, whose third edition tosses off tomorrow, is actually a fifty-fifty game, and thats being charitable to the cricketing component of it. This extravaganza wont be worth serving to fans if there wasnt a financial bonanza feeding its promoters.        
	While youre glued to the games over the next six weeks  or struggling to regain control of the TV remote refusing to let slip the bedrooms favoured soaps  a lot of money will get stuck into a few pockets.        
	Enough, laughed one of the events custodians condescendingly as frenzied work over tomorrows inaugural razzmatazz proceeded at the DY Patil arena in Navi Mumbai. Enough for you to believe it is only an unreal abstraction.        
	Officially, he let on, very consciously poker-faced, the enterprise is worth $4 billion, up twice over from when the first tourney was held in 2008.        
	You might wonder if that may be a gross underestimation. Not everybodys admittedly making money out of the IPL  some franchisees, for instance, are still awaiting the first tinkle on their return tills  but a lot of them evidently are. Look around Mumbai. Or just switch on your television set. Few things other than those that remain unmentionable in family newspaper columns are not riding the endorsement piggy.        
	Fashion accessories and luxury hotels, aphrodisiacs and more innocent energy boosters, aerated drinks and filmstars a little lost on fizz, a whole movie industry thats imposed an early summer drought because it fears for takers while the IPL is on. Seven hundred and fifty multiplexes are pledged to exclusively cricket evenings, more than a hundred of them in the home of Bollywood.        
	Dont forget the franchisees themselves  for most of them, the IPL is the mother of surrogate publicity.        
	For a start, Shah Rukh Khan has given up driving the ghost of My Name is Khan and spun full-circle to rev up another pet to life: the Kolkata Knight Riders, great boast of our city that has not done better yet than bust. But they are in the throes of a more exhaustive makeover than just the disbanding of the second Aussie after Greg Chappell to have taken blame for delivering wreckage on and off the field  John Buchanan.        
	The Knights have discarded their wretched noir and turned to purple outfits in pursuit of a patch that has eluded them. And they wear XXX endorsements on their chests. Tough to get more hardcore on intent. For content, watch on.        
	For you, theres just the cricket in it, the commerce is anothers gift. Priyanka Chopra showed us just why.

  - Panel bars two for approving plan to endorse products          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: An ethics panel has recommended banning two doctors from practising for six months because they had approved a plan for a body of doctors, the Indian Medical Association, to endorse consumer products.        
	The unprecedented recommendation by the ethics panel of the Medical Council of India (MCI) awaits approval by the regulators board of governors, but it has reopened the debate whether doctors or their associations should be allowed to endorse health-related products.        
	Goparaju Sammaram, president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), an organisation of over 190,000 doctors across the country, said he did not see why doctors could not endorse consumer products if film stars could.        
	But George Thomas, a surgeon in Chennai and editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, said the code of medical ethics prohibits doctors from endorsing products.        
	People trust doctors; their knowledge and actions are perceived as backed by science and long years of training, Thomas said. Its wrong for doctors to endorse any product.        
	The IMA had in October 2007 struck deals with the manufacturers of Quaker oats, Tropicana juice and the anti- mosquito cream Odomos that allowed the products to claim the associations endorsement in return for Rs 2.07 crore.        
	Documents extracted from the IMA by a Kerala-based doctor, K.V. Babu, show that the decision was taken by the associations then national president Ajay Kumar, secretary S.N. Misra and national president-elect M. Abbas.                    
	The documents suggest that PepsiCo, manufacturer of Quaker oats and Tropicana, was to pay Rs 46 lakh a year to the IMA for three years. Dabur, which makes Odomos, had agreed to pay Rs 23 lakh a year for three years.        
	Although the deal happened three years ago, the action comes only now after the MCI itself saw changes at its helm. In response to a complaint from Babu, the MCIs ethics panel has decided to remove the names of the IMA president and secretary from the Indian medical register for six months.        
	Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who gave this information to Parliament today, did not specify the names of the two doctors who would be debarred. But an MCI source said the punishment was likely to apply to the IMA office-bearers who took the endorsement decision.        
	Azad said the MCI ethics panel had also decided to issue a censure letter to all the IMAs executive committee members, warning them not to repeat such practices in the future.        
	It (the debarment) is unprecedented. The heads of the IMA have never been punished before, a member of the MCI board said. Were hoping this sends out a message to the rest of the community.        
	The current IMA secretary, Dharam Prakash, told The Telegraph the endorsement decision had been taken by the office-bearers on behalf of the IMA and not as individual doctors. In any case, we have not received any official communication on this, Prakash said.        
	Sammaram, the associations current president, said: Dont movie actors endorse things and get paid? What is wrong if doctors also do something similar for health-related products? In any case, the payment went to the IMA and not to individual doctors.        
	Thomas said this argument was unacceptable. When a film star endorses a car, the public is aware that he or she is not an expert in that product, he said. But when a doctor or an association of doctors endorses a product, it can mislead people.        
	The Indian Dental Association (IDA) has in the past conducted joint oral health awareness programmes with the manufacturers of Colgate toothpaste. The Colgate Total tube carries the logo of the IDA and the words: IDA accepted.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Munda list ready, cabinet today
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, Oct. 7: Arjun Munda kept the first part of his promise on Mahalaya and sent a list of his council of minister to the governor, indicating he is likely to stand by the second and expand his cabinet tomorrow, 28 days after he was sworn in chief minister.        
	Speculation is rife on who have been included in the final list that was sent late in the evening to Raj Bhavan which is ready to administer the oath of office to the new ministers at Birsa Mandap tomorrow at 11.25am.         
	According to sources, Munda, who returned to Ranchi from Delhi today after discussing the composition of his cabinet with BJP president Nitin Gadkari, is not likely to induct Raghubar Das, the former state party chief who was asked to step down to pave the way for him to become chief minister.        
	Those from the BJP who are likely to become ministers include Arun Mandal, Satyanand Jha, Baidyanath Ram and Neelkanth Singh Munda. Chaibasa MLA Laxman Gilua has also staked claim to a cabinet berth. Under the agreed formula, the JMM is to get five ministerial berths, BJP four, Ajsu two and the JD(U) one.        
	All formalities have been completed, said Munda who will have to induct nine more ministers  he already has two deputy chief ministers  to make up his cabinet as per Article 164 (1-A) of the Constitution which mandates that the strength of the cabinet has to be 15 per cent of the Assembly strength but not less than 12.         
	The JMM, said a source close to deputy chief minister Hemant Soren, is likely to have Haji Hussain Ansari, Champai Soren, Hemlal Murmu and Mathura Mahto as ministers. We have retained the old faces who were ministers in the Shibu Soren cabinet, he said.        
	Ajsu president Sudesh Mahto has recommended two names  Chandra Prakash Chaudhary and K.K. Bhagat. It depends on the chief minister to include one or both from the Ajsu quota, said a source close to the deputy chief minister.         
	JD(U) general secretary K.C. Tyagi arrived from Delhi to announce that his party would get one berth, but did not articulate his choice. Both party MLAs, Raja Peter and Sudha Chaudhary, have staked claim. Peter is supposed to be close to Munda. But if he is inducted, the chief minister will have to find a woman legislator from the BJP. In that case, he is likely to induct Simdega MLA Vimla Pradhan, the source added.

  - Burial service for Britains Two Tone, the trophy catch for anglers           AMIT ROY                            Two Tone, the giant carp                                        
	London, Aug. 19: With deep regret, the death has been announced in England of Two Tone who will be buried with full honours on Sunday.        
	Held in great affection by the millions who admired his guile, cunning and playfulness, Two Tone was a gentle giant who became something of a legend in his own lifetime.        
	His precise date of birth was not recorded. But when he passed away peacefully earlier this week, he was aged somewhere between 40 and 45.        
	Two Tones burial service will be attended by his followers, with a suitable plaque to mark that there has been no one quite like him.        
	Other nations may laugh that so much fuss is being made by Britains anglers about a fish.        
	But they will merely point out that Two Tone was no ordinary fish.        
	A mirror carp, he stretched the scales at 67lb 14oz (30.85 kg) and was generally reckoned to be the biggest and the best in his class.        
	Although the rui also belongs to the carp family, to have turned Two Tone  so called because of his colouring  into machher jhol or fish and chips would have been considered little short of sacrilege by anglers.        
	The challenge was to catch him, weigh him quickly doing as little damage as possible and slip him back into the waters of Conningbrook Lake in Ashford, Kent, where he lived.                          
	By and by, Two Tone developed a relationship with the anglers who tested their skills by trying to catch him. He was caught perhaps once or twice a year and certainly no more than 50 times in his entire life.        
	Paying tribute to the fish, Chris Logsdon, 62, manager of Mid Kent Fisheries, which runs Conningbrook Lake, said Two Tone was the pinnacle of the angling world.        
	Last Thursday, it was seen looking distressed, he reported. We searched the lake for it, then on Saturday, it was found floating on the surface. I think the hard winter and the cold spring may have taken their toll. Any carp angler worth his salt wanted to catch him and a lot tried and failed. Its part of fishing history.        
	To many, Two Tone was a nicer version of Moby Dick.        
	He was a wily, very big, clever fish that specimen anglers dreamt about catching and many waited and plotted for many hours trying to do so, said Naidre Werner of the Angling Trades Association.        
	Angling and not football is Britains most popular sport. People love to fish, for which they need a licence, because of the peace and quiet by the countrys idyllic rivers. Lasting friendships are made when anglers sit next to each other for hours and hours without speaking.        
	But the sport has unwritten rules  although fish fry is not ruled out, the aim is usually the thrill of the chase.        
	With a big carp you could do a lot of damage if you hauled it on to a gravel bank and let it flap around, explained Dave Nelson, 53, a professional coach from Suffolk. Carp fishermen tend to be very careful so they do the minimum of damage. Theyll weigh the fish and photograph them and then put them back in the river to be caught another day when they might have grown even bigger.        
	By the waters of Conningbrook Lake, Logsdon today summed up on behalf of anglers who have been left reeling by Two Tones passing. Some of these guys have spent every minute of their time at this lake trying to catch this beast, a lot of friendships have been made by people on the banks  its been an extraordinary, exceptional beast.         
	There will be a large gathering for Two Tones funeral, he said.

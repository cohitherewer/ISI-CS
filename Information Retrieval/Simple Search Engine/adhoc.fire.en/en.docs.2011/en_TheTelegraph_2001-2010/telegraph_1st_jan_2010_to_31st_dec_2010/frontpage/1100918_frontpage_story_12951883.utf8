The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In glow of emergency lamp,   chorus for Ayodhya verdict
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                In glow of emergency lamp,   chorus for Ayodhya verdict
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                            RAF personnel stand guard near the Lucknow court. (PTI)                                        
	Lucknow, Sept. 17: Last-ditch efforts to stall the impending court verdict on Ayodhya failed today after most lawyers in the case chorused a loud no to petitions requesting a last chance to try for a mediated solution.        
	Can the mediation process be endless? Can this go on for ever? The question is, for how long? Justice S.U. Khan asked as the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court reaffirmed it would pass a judgment on September 24.        
	A power cut forced the judges to announce the decision by the light of an emergency lamp, heightening the eerie mood in a courtroom filled with dark forebodings.        
	Three petitions had asked that the verdict be put off, arguing it could harm communal peace, but the court rejected them saying they were not backed by any concrete proposal for settling the Ayodhya dispute.        
	It is (the) absence of judgment on the issue rather than judgment that seems to be causing fear, said Justice Sudhir Agarwal, who sat on the three-judge bench with Justice D.V. Sharma and Justice Khan.        
	Todays judgment marks the end, at least for now, of the failed and intermittent efforts for an out-of-court settlement over the past two decades, led by Prime Ministers, religious leaders and the court itself.        
	Technically, the court left a door open. It said that if the majority of the lawyers came up with a concrete proposal to settle the issue out of court even at the eleventh hour, the bench would be open to it.        
	Advocate Ajai Pandey, however, said: This seems to be a legal formality and nothing (no mediation) will happen after this.        
	A short while earlier, the court had wondered how many of the lawyers involved in the case would agree with the petitioners.        
	No, chorused most of the advocates representing the respondents (those who filed or support the original suit) and defendants (those opposing the original suit). We dont want any mediation at this stage, one of them said.        
	The court then traced the history of mediations it had initiated since 1989. Justice Agarwal said Justice N. Alam, who had heard the case in the late 1990s, had kept the possibility of mediation hanging for 75 days.        
	One advocate had at that time argued for 11 days for a chance to explore the possibility of a consensus but nothing came out of it.        
	The court had fixed a date from July 27 this year for mediation but there has been no response. It then proceeded to fix September 24 for passing the judgment. And now you are talking about a process for reconciliation as if we did nothing for it in the past? Justice Agarwal asked rather angrily.        
	For a while, the court even considered imposing a fine of Rs 5 lakh on the petitioners for their frivolous petition but later changed its mind.        
	One of the petitions had been filed on Tuesday by defendant No. 17 in the Ayodhya title suit, Ramesh Chandra Tripathi, who claimed his move would prevent another communal holocaust. Sunderlal Jain and Sudesh Gupta had filed the other two petitions.        
	As hearing began at 2.30pm, the judges asked Tripathis lawyers Shashank Singh and R.N. Verma: What kind of compromise formula do you have in mind?        
	The lawyers said they wanted the dispute referred to a court of mediators.        
	Justice Khan asked: Will you agree to surrender your claim as defendant No. 17 in the case if the mediation starts?        
	Verma kept quiet.        
	The Nirmohi Akhara, petitioner No. 2 in the land dispute, too sprang an impromptu request for 10 days time to reach an amicable solution but the court dismissed the appeal.        
	Babri Masjid Action Committee convener and senior advocate Zafaryab Jilani, as well as most of the Hindu groups, opposed the akharas move.        
	The Hindu groups want us to forgo the land, which we cannot do. So there was no success in negotiations, Jilani told The Telegraph.        
	H.S. Jain, lawyer for the Hindu Mahasabha, said: We dont want any out-of-court settlement. There should be no compromise in the name of Ram.         
	Even during the hearing, a group of people on the court premises kept shouting: Jai Shri Ram.        
	During the 40 minutes of argument, one petitioner urged the court to impose restrictions to prevent the media from creating a climate of fear, but was turned down.

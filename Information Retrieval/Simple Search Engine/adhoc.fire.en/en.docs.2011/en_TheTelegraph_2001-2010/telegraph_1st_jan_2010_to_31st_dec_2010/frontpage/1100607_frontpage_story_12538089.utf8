	Jamshedpur, June 6: Monsoon magic wont regale Jharkhand before another week.        
	If weather analysis is any indication, the southwest monsoon will reach the state only around June 15, courtesy Phet, the cyclonic storm that is playing speed-breaker.        
	Monsoon was supposed to arrive in the state between June 10 and 12. But severe cyclonic storm Phet over west-central Arabian Sea has slowed it down, said P.K. Hazra at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, Calcutta.         
	The Patna Meteorological Office is also keeping fingers crossed for a June 15 date. Though conditions are favourable, monsoon will be late. The state is yet to experience pre-monsoon showers, said Animesh Chanda, the director of the Patna Met office.         
	According to Chanda, the northern limit of monsoon has crossed Agartala and Dhubri before reaching Gangtok. The monsoon flow, which was stuck due to a cyclonic storm, was revived in the West Central Bay last evening. It will hit Jharkhand by June 15, unless there is a sudden change in weather.        
	He pointed out that rising humidity levels were also an indication of approaching monsoon. The morning humidity hovered around 70 per cent in the steel city and its adjoining areas today. The level in Ranchi, Deoghar, Latehar and Dumka remained below 40 per cent while it touched 50 per cent in Hazaribagh.         
	A heat wave-like condition (maximum temperature five notches above normal) added to discomfort with Jamshedpur recording a day temperature of 42.9C. Daltonganj, the heat chamber of Jharkhand, saw 41.8C while the capital was a tad cooler at 39. 3C.         
	A Norwester, meanwhile, brought relief to Calcutta.        
	According to weathermen, the humidity spell was also a result of a low-pressure trough over Jharkhand. The low-pressure trough is resulting in formation of clouds in the lower and middle levels of the atmosphere. But the clouds are unable to bring showers due to adverse wind pattern, explained a senior weather analyst at Patna Met office.         
	He said that even if monsoon hit the state before June 15, it wouldnt set in completely. Last year, the southwest monsoon was delayed by about a fortnight, with cyclonic storm Aila playing spoilsport. The state was deprived of showers in initial days due to a weak monsoon trough.         
	This time, however, weathermen have predicted a normal monsoon. The state is expected to receive over 200mm rainfall this month alone.

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND AGENCIES                            A student holds a gun during a police-organised demonstration of weapons at Secunderabad on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, Oct. 20: Little did the boys know what lay in store when they excitedly marched to school this morning to see a police demo of weapons used to fight Maoists.        
	Venkatkrishna and Sathyasai Babu, students of a school in Velerpadu town of Andhras Khammam district, were killed today after the sten gun of a constable showing them how to use the weapon accidentally went off.        
	Police sources said the boys, students of Class X and Class IX respectively, had crowded around constable Srinivas along with other classmates and begun pestering him to demonstrate how bullets were loaded into the gun. The occasion was an open house being held in schools across the state as part of Andhra Pradesh police commemoration week.        
	Srinivas, who was standing guard outside the tent where pistols, rifles, SLRs, explosives, firearms, anti-mine vehicles, bullet-proof jackets and communication equipment were on display, apparently gave in after the boys kept hounding him. As he was explaining the procedure, a flurry of gunshots were heard and a boy seen falling to the ground, a bullet having pierced his heart.        
	Venkatkrishna, 14, collapsed and died on the spot. Sathyasai Babu, 13, was grievously wounded and died at the local government hospital. One of their friends, Harish, was hit in the leg. Two others were wounded in the shoulder and legs, and one who was running away in fright was caught in the buttocks.        
	The freak weapon was a 9mm carbine that can fire 400 rounds per minute. Andhra DGP K. Aravinda Rao said five rounds had been released by a single press of the trigger.        
	It is unfortunate that one constable out of over-enthusiasm or maybe stupidity brought one weapon and tried to show it to the students and may have pressed the trigger. In that process, the weapon went off in a burst-fire mode, Rao said.        
	Five rounds went out, resulting in the death of two boys. One died instantly and another died in hospital.        
	Police sources said bullets were generally kept aside on the demonstration tables so they were not lost or stolen by mischief-makers. In most instances, only dummy bullets were used in programmes in schools, an officer said.        
	Maybe the casual manner or the haste with which Srinivas was displaying the weapon led to the mishap, a source said.        
	Rao said it had not been the polices intention to show the students loaded weapons. Weapons, if at all we are not supposed to show loaded weapons, he said.        
	But it is mandatory for Andhra Pradesh Special Police constables to keep their weapons loaded as they are working in a Maoist-infested district.        
	Khammam district abuts the Maoist dens of Bastar and Dantewada in Chhattisgarh. This region has been the focal point of anti-Maoist operations of the CRPF and other security personnel over the past year.        
	Rao said Srinivas had already been suspended. He was not supposed to do that. It is not a constables job to open that weapon. Probably somebody might have asked him, we do not know. It is his bad luck also.        
	A criminal case under IPC Section 304 (a) has been registered against him for causing death by negligence.        
	The basic idea of an open house is to explain to the people that we are friends of the public and we are also part of society. They are also made aware of the weaponry and technology we use, Rao said.        
	Venkatkrishnas father said his son had been very excited at the thought of seeing so many weapons all at a shot. Venkat had told us he would even try sitting in the anti-mine vehicle, he said, weeping outside Khammam hospital where the body was taken for post-mortem.

                                A woman and her daughter lay flowers in front of Gurshan Singhs home in Melbourne on Friday. (AFP)                            
	Melbourne, March 5 (PTI): Australians expressed their grief at the death of three- year-old Gurshan Singh, who was found dead here yesterday, by leaving flowers, cards and toys outside the family home in the citys northern suburbs.        
	Many came to pay condolences and still others offered help in any form to the family, mother Harpreet and father Harjit, who were about to leave the country to return to India when Gurshan died.        
	Our hearts go out to you and our thoughts are with you and your family, said a card propped up against a teddy bear, The Age newspaper reported.        
	Harpreet and Harjit were called to the local St Kilda Rd police station to give their statement to the detectives. Members of Gurshans extended family said nobody had been allowed to see or identify the body.        
	Steve Clark of Victoria Police, however, said the family would be able to see the body and make an identification today. An autopsy was carried out by the coroner under special powers without formal identification of the body by the relatives. It was apparently done to expedite the case and arrive at the cause of the death.        
	Clark said no suspects had been identified. He revealed that the toddler and his mother were not alone in the house at the time of the disappearance. There were a couple of people at home at the time.        
	There has been an autopsy conducted and a range of forensic testing needs to be carried out, he added. The police had spoken to a range of witnesses overnight.         
	Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd dubbed the death a horrible incident and pledged to get to the bottom of it.         
	The death of any little child causes everyone in this country to stop, pause, think, reflect. If this is a case of murder, there is nothing worse than the brutal murder of a little child, he said.        
	The family had left for Australia on January 9 after Harpreet received a student visa but had decided to return because Harjit, who used to run a gym at Lajpat Nagar in Kotkapura of Faridkot, could not find work.        
	Councillor Tim Singh Laurence from the City of Darebin told The Age the family was yet to decide on their sons funeral or make arrangements to have the body flown to India.        
	In Delhi, minister of state for external affairs Preneet Kaur said: Assurance has been given to Gurshans family that all help would be provided to bring back the body.        
	The Government of India feels it is a very very sad and tragic event and it has been echoed by the Australian Prime Minister himself...They have assured us and Mr (S.M.) Krishna (the external affairs minister), who raised the issue, that the perpetrators would be brought to book.        
	A number of attacks on Indians have taken place in Australia in recent months, with some of them being attributed to racism.         
	At Guru Harsahai in Ferozepur where Harpreets parents live, the phone call to inform them of the boys death was picked by his grandmother Gurmeet Kaur. (She) has not stopped crying since. He was the favourite of everyone, said Darshan Singh, the boys uncle as he wept on the phone.

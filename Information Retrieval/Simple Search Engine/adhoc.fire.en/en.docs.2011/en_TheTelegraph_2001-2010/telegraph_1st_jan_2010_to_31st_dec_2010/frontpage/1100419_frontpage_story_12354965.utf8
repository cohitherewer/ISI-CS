The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Days best catch: Dalai in stadium
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Days best catch: Dalai in stadium
          ARCHIS MOHAN                            Kings XI Punjab co-owners Ness Wadia and Preity Zinta with the Dalai Lama at Sundays IPL match with the Chennai Super Kings in Dharamshala. (PTI)                                   
	Dharamshala, April 18: The gentler pace of Test cricket would perhaps suit the rhythms of life better in the hometown of the worlds most famous Buddhist monk.        
	But mad, bad IPL it was that today drew the Dalai Lama to Dharamshalas picturesque new cricket stadium, along with several hundred Tibetans including monks, old and young.        
	Crickets latest colony at 5,000 feet was awash with red from afternoon. Red-robed monks mingled with Kings XI Punjab supporters in their red T-shirts on McLeodganjs meandering main road. Their immediate quest: any mode of transport to the Dharamshala cricket stadium, 15km downhill.        
	Outside the stadium, queues of monks and ordinary Tibetans stood with their heads bowed as the Dalai Lamas cavalcade passed by. It was as if the mere presence of their Guruji had sanctified the sport.        
	The spiritual leader, who had watched a Ranji Trophy game a few months ago in the stadium, sat through the T20 match, watching with rapt attention.        
	Nearly all the Tibetans to whom The Telegraph spoke said they were M.S. Dhoni fans  so they would have gone home very excited after the Chennai Super Kings skippers match-winning heroics. If a local cricket official is to be believed, even the Dalai Lama is a Dhoni fan.        
	The monk had told Yuvraj Singh yesterday that the only sport he had played was table tennis, once even with a Chinese Prime Minister.        
	Fridays IPL match had appeared to confirm the received opinion that McLeodganjs Tibetan community in exile cared more for football and basketball than for cricket. But todays turnout gave a different picture.        
	The ticket prices, kept as low as Rs 125, would have helped because the Tibetan refugees are largely poor.        
	Tashi Phuntsok, who watched Fridays game at the stadium but sacrificed todays ticket for a monk friend, put things in perspective. Friday was a working day. Today is a holiday for all of us, including the monks.        
	Phuntsok claimed to be a cricket fanatic and said middle-class Tibetans faithfully followed the game on TV.        
	At the stadium, the Tibetans  men, women, teenagers and children  were hard to miss. Most wore T-shirts that carried slogans such as I love Tibet, see you in Tibet or Stop Genocide in Tibet.        
	It was a rainbow audience, unlike those at most Indian stadiums. Foreigners, many of whom live in McLeodganj for long periods and study Buddhism, too found time to be part of the IPL circus.        
	I love cricket and Dhoni is my favourite, said Gadul, a Tibetan worker who had come all the way from Mandi, 130km away.        
	The monks, enjoying a break from their strict study regimen, either went to the stadium or watched the match on television.        
	It is the most beautiful ground in India, said Sonam, who confessed himself a Dhoni fan as did his friend and fellow monk, Tenzing.        
	Phuntsok said cricket was becoming popular with Tibetans. It is played at the school level. We also play at the Kachahari grounds in Dharamshala. But we cannot represent the state team as we are not Indian citizens, he said. We watch the same stupid serials and films (as you do) so why not cricket?        
	Tibet Hope Centre, an NGO, is raising funds for a decent playground for its students. Cricket, however, is not an immediate part of the plan.        
	Unlike football or basketball, cricket is an expensive game if played professionally. It is popular only with middle-class Tibetans who have lived in India for decades. Most of the recent refugees from China know only football. Also, they live in abject poverty. We need classrooms for them, said an activist.        
	The new stadium, however, is a boon for the local Indians. It will definitely benefit tourism, said businessman Bharat Bhushan Rastogi.        
	He said most foreigners used Dharamshala as a stopover to reach McLeodganj, but might now stay in the town if cricket matches became frequent here. Dharamshalas traders have cashed in on the surge in tourist footfall this past week.        
	Any doubts about crickets popularity in McLeodganj vanished during a visit to an Internet caf. Two Tibetan girls who had just finished watching Dhonis batting asked when TV would beam the highlights.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Rangasamy, (left) Mariselvi                                  
	Chennai, Aug. 26: A father angry with his daughter who was apparently switching boyfriends one too many and bringing disrepute to the family got her killed by injecting poison.        
	K. Rangasamy lost his cool when his sisters son refused to marry 18-year-old Mariselvi after coming to know that three boys had come to seek her hand in marriage.        
	On Tuesday, when Rangasamys wife was out, three men entered the tractor shop owners house, pinned Mariselvi down and injected some lethal substance in her thigh. To make it look like a suicide, they splashed some insecticide on Mariselvis face when she fell unconscious. The three took her for dead and left.        
	But Mariselvi came to briefly before her death and shouted out for help. By then her mother had returned to their Madurai home. Before losing consciousness again, Mariselvi told her mother that Rangasamys assistant Murthy and two other men had given her some injection.        
	She was rushed to Madurai Government Hospital but the girl, who had just finished her Class XII earlier this year, failed to respond to treatment and died that night.         
	Her mother told Madurai police that Mariselvi had mentioned Murthy.         
	On sustained interrogation, the tractor shop assistant confessed his involvement. Murthy told us that Rangasamy took this drastic step as he was unhappy with Mariselvis behaviour of frequently changing boyfriends, which he felt was spoiling the familys honour, assistant police commissioner A. Ganesan said.         
	Murthy told the police he had got his friend, a paramedic at Rajaji Government Hospital, to administer the lethal injection.         
	The two along with another man, who has not been identified yet, visited Rangasamys home posing as AC mechanics. When Mariselvi fainted, Murthy said, they thought she was dead and left. He also told the police that they splashed pesticide on her, traces of which were found around the girls mouth and ears.        
	When Mariselvi was rushed to the hospital on Tuesday night, Rangasamy accompanied her, looking agitated.         
	When the police arrested him, the father corroborated Murthys account. He said he was put off when three boyfriends turned up seeking marriage. Even my sisters son refused to marry her after knowing about her affairs, he had told the police.

          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 6: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee studiously took notes but captains of industry were reading an unwritten message: things are no longer the same with their one-time best friend.        
	The Bengal chief minister today returned to an open interactive session with industry  his first such engagement since November 2008.        
	However, after the interaction with the national council members of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) at a city hotel this afternoon, many said in private that they missed the flair, confidence and reassuring stamp of authority that had once made Bhattacharjee the most popular Left politician among industrialists.        
	Such expressions of misgivings need not be viewed as an undesirable certificate in the changed political climate of Bengal where industrialisation is no longer the catchphrase.        
	Still, the quarter of an hour Bhattacharjee spent with the business leaders threw up a sense of resignation tinged with a sympathetic understanding of the chief ministers predicament.        
	We are aware of the political climate. He is not in control of the situation and, therefore, lacked authority. Industry was not expecting any great announcement from him. Did you see anyone making investment proposals or seeking land today? asked a city-based industrialist who did not wish to be named.        
	Among those who participated in the interaction were Godrej chairman Adi Godrej, ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar, Pepsi India head Sanjeev Chadha and Aditya Birla Retail chief executive Thomas Varghese.        
	The last time Bhattacharjee had attended such a big interactive session with industry in public was on November 26, 2008. More than a month ago, the Tatas had pulled out of Singur. The next year was nightmarish for the Left, which kept haemorrhaging in election after election.         
	When the industrialists made suggestions today, Bhattacharjee took notes as if to reassure them that the government would look into them.        
	But apart from Deveshwar, who was asked by Bhattacharjee himself to speak on agriculture and the role of companies, no local industry leader asked any question or made any observation. In the months before Singur, few used to let go of an opportunity to make their voice heard at such meetings.        
	People who did speak skirted bandh and land acquisition, issues without which few industry meetings would be over earlier.        
	Bhattacharjee appeared to qualify his once-renowned support for corporate role in retail. Ignoring protests from Left partner Forward Bloc, Bhattacharjee had told a meeting on November 2007: We should not and cannot stop big retailers. It is my opinion, but, unfortunately, I am running a coalition government. And that is my problem.         
	However, responding to a remark by Aditya Birla Retails Varghese that his company had been waiting for three years for a licence to sell fruits and vegetables, the chief minister said today: Still our policy is not to encourage big corporate houses in retail sector. Still we are thinking about it. So when you are waiting for three years, it is not formalities.        
	Bhattacharjee seemed to be suggesting that a policy decision, rather than formalities, was standing in the way of the licence.        
	The lone question that brought the spark back in Bhattacharjee was one by Rajesh Shah of Mukand on the Maoist menace. Maoists are not in touch with the reality. We have defeated them politically and administratively in the past and will do so again, the chief minister asserted.        
	At the end of the meeting when participants were requested to record their opinions, one CII member is learnt to have questioned the effectiveness of meeting the chief minister.

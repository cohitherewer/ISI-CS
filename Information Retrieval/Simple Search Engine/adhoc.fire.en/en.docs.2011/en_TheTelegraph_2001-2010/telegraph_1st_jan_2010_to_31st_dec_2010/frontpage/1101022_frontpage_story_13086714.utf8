The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Be cool but gasp for air
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Be cool but gasp for air
          SANJAY MANDAL                                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 21: Metro Railway had shut down the duct that supplies fresh air to its tunnel in an apparent bid to save power and keep the platform cool, sources within the utility told The Telegraph a day after several passengers felt suffocated when a train jumped rails and got stuck in a tunnel.         
	A Metro Railway spokesperson admitted that passengers had felt suffocated but denied that the fans had been shut down. Our entire ventilation system, including the fans, work all the time during the services. There is no question of shutting them down and they were on when the train got derailed, he said.        
	Minutes after he spoke this evening, The Telegraph entered a station and found that the fresh-air fans for the tunnel were shut off. The official on duty said the fans for the tunnel were run for half an hour to one hour every day to ensure they were in working condition.        
	The name of the station is being withheld to protect the identity of the official.        
	A senior official conceded that the fans should be operating all the time but dont. The fans are off most of the time and this accident has shown us that the move is not correct, the official added.        
	Every Metro station has two ducts  one at each end  that are supposed to blow fresh air into the tunnel. Four others pump air into the platforms. (See graphic)        
	However, after most underground Metro stations became fully AC recently, the draft in the tunnels was found to be diminishing the effect of the cool air or drawing it away from the platforms.         
	This was apparently resulting in an overload on the air-conditioners and greater consumption of power. Metro found an easy solution in switching off the fans for the tunnel, the sources said.        
	As a result, when the train got stuck on Wednesday in the tunnel  about 10 metres ahead of Central on the Tollygunge-bound line  passengers struggled for fresh air. Many needed first aid and two had to be taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital with symptoms of suffocation.         
	There were people gasping for breath and a number of them were in a semi-conscious state, said an RPF jawan who had helped passengers out of the stranded train.        
	Such lack of fresh air can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning and even death, said critical care expert Rajeev Seal.        
	On Panchami evening, too, passengers had complained of breathlessness when a snag stalled a train a few metres outside Sovabazar station. Metro sources blamed the uneasiness on non-functioning fresh-air fans.        
	Some passengers were stranded for over 45 minutes on Wednesday  between the derailment at 9.20am and completion of rescue around 10.06am.        
	If a lot of people are stuck in a tunnel and there is not enough supply of oxygen and air, people are bound to feel suffocated after some time. People with pre-existing heart and lung diseases are more vulnerable and an emergency situation can crop up any moment, said pulmonologist Asok Sengupta.        
	The Metro sources explained the compulsion to keep the platform cool even if it meant shutting the fresh-air fan for the tunnel. The onus is on us now to ensure that passenger comfort is not compromised, that people dont get a chance to get angry, a Metro official said.

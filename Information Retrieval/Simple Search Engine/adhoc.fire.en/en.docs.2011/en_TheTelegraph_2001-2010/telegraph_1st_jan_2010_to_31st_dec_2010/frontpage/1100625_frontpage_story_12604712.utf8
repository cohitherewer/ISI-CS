          K.P. NAYAR                            Prime Minister Stephen Harper at the memorial in Toronto on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	Washington, June 24: On the 25th anniversary of the bombing of Air Indias Kanishka aircraft, Canada yesterday assembled its entire top political leadership to deliver an apology for the worst incident of aviation terrorism in history until September 11.        
	His hands clasped in an act of contrition, Canadas Prime Minister Stephen Harper stood before a memorial for victims of the Kanishka bombing in Toronto and told a large gathering: I stand before you to offer on behalf of the government of Canada, and all Canadians, an apology for the institutional failings of 25 years ago and the treatment of the victims families thereafter.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement on the anniversary, urging that we must rededicate ourselves to fighting and eliminating terrorism with determination and joint action was read at the meeting.        
	Harpers apology, which was expected after a judicial inquiry last week delivered a damning indictment of Canadas systemic failures which allowed the bombing, clears the air for a visit by Singh to Toronto for a G-20 summit which has been upgraded into a bilateral engagement between Singh and Harper as a special gesture.        
	In a statement in Ottawa, Harper explained the gesture by saying Canada and India are developing the tremendous potential of our relationship by rapidly expanding commercial, cultural and educational ties. I look forward to work with Prime Minister Singh to further capitalize on our shared strengths.        
	Yesterdays gathering at the Air India victims memorial  a granite wall inscribed with the names of the victims, a sundial and landscaped gardens on on the edge of Lake Ontario  was attended by the leader of the opposition in Parliament Michael Ignatieff, the leader of Canadas New Democratic Party, Jack Layton, public safety minister Vic Toews, Indias high commissioner in Ottawa, S.M. Gavai, Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty and Toronto mayor David Miller.        
	Delegations from Ireland and Japan had also flown into Toronto for the emotional ceremony.         
	Kanishka crashed into the sea off Irelands coast. Two airport baggage handlers at Tokyos Narita airport were killed when a bomb planted by terrorists on the same day exploded after the plane it was meant to destroy had landed in Tokyo.        
	At an equally emotional ceremony at a similar memorial for the victims in Vancouver, British Columbias premier, Gordon Campbell apologized for the failures which made the terrorist attack possible and its aftermath.        
	We are sorry that this ever took place in our country, Campbell said.        
	Canadas President of the treasury board and minister for the Asia-Pacific gateway, Stockwell Day and Indias consul-general in Vancouver, Ashok Das, attended the ceremony.        
	Day reminded everyone that there was still work ahead for the Canadanian authorities. Those who were the perpetrators of this horrendous atrocity have still not been brought to justice, he said.        
	As one in a series inadequate half measures over the years until yesterdays apology, Canada declared in 2005 that the anniversary of the Kanishka bombing would be observed as National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism.        
	Harper said in a separate statement marking the sixth such Remembrance Day yesterday that the best tribute we can make to the victims of terrorism is to ensure that atrocities like the bombing of Air India Flight 182 never happen again.        
	To that end, our government has introduced new measures to thwart terrorists and will continue to put the safety of all Canadians first, he assured.         
	Singhs statement, which was also read out in Vancouver, said: It is with a deep sense of pain and sorrow that I join families and friends in paying my homage to all those who fell victim to this most barbarous act of terrorism.        
	According to present plans, the Prime Minister is expected to drive directly from Toronto airport on his arrival on Saturday to the Air India victims memorial and pay tributes as his first official act on Canadian soil.        
	This plan may yet change as his hosts are extremely concerned about the Prime Ministers security during this event and have declared the memorial as a red zone to ensure that Singh places a wreath in memory of the victims without any incident.

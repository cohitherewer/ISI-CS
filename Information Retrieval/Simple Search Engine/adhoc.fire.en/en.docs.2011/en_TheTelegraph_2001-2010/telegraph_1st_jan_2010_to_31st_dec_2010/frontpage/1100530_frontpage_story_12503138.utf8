The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Open and shut polls? Need not   be so
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Open and shut polls? Need not   be so
           ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                                          
	One more election in Bengal and Mamata Banerjee one more step closer to smiling into the chief ministers office at Writers Buildings next year.         
	Its not just her hope, its also the general assumption. The big push that she had started in the panchayat polls of 2008, riding on the crest of her agitation against land acquisition for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees aggressive industrialisation drive, got bigger in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.         
	The Left was left far behind also in the Assembly by-elections that followed  in Sealdah, Bowbazar, Alipore and Belgachhia East  and in the two civic bodies at Asansol and Siliguri. If the results of the 2009 Lok Sabha polls were to be extrapolated for the Calcutta civic area, the Left with 22 wards trailed far behind the 119 of the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance.         
	So these civic polls offer a simple and entirely possible scenario of Mamata winning two more battles  one for Calcutta and another for Bengal  before the final showdown in 2011.         
	For the CPM, the loss of the civic bodies in Calcutta and Salt Lake is a possibility, but the real concern is how much of the lost ground it can recover  in Calcutta and the rest of Bengal  so that it is fit again to fight back in 2011.        
	But there is a possible second scenario and thereby hangs a different tale.         
	Consider the differences and ponder the questions they raise. The first and the most obvious difference between 2009 and these polls is the break-up of the Congress-Trinamul alliance. The question is not about the Congress being a small force in Bengal compared with Trinamul or even about the two parties making up yet again for the Assembly polls next year.         
	The real questions that the break-up raises are about the 2009 poll results. Everyone agrees the verdict was more an expression of anger at the CPM than a sudden surge of love for Mamata.         
	In 2009, the alliances vote rose to 44.67 per cent, but the big change in Mamatas fortunes was primarily because of a 7.5 per cent drop in the CPMs vote share from what it had been in both the 2004 Lok Sabha and the 2006 Assembly elections  a little over 50per cent.         
	But, despite the erosion of the Left vote, the difference between it and the Congress-Trinamul alliance in 2009 was just 1.6 per cent.         
	The collapse of the alliance has created two major grey areas in these civic polls. One, what was the Congresss share in the alliances total vote and how much of its success was because of the national factor, i.e. the all-India swing in favour of the Congress?         
	Theres no doubt, though, that the Congresss vote share was much smaller than Trinamuls, for the simple reason that the former fought for half the number of seats that Trinamul contested.                                
	But how small is the Congresss own vote? Interestingly, the Congress and Trinamul have never fought an election to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in an alliance. In the districts, lower-level adjustments among them and also the BJP, however, have long been an accepted practice.         
	The results of Assembly and parliamentary polls since 2001, however, make one thing clear  a Congress-Trinamul alliances share is far larger than that of a Trinamul-BJP tie-up. These polls also show that, despite its decline since Mamata took away a large chunk of the anti-Left vote in Bengal, the Congress has had an average of 14 per cent vote of its own. The last two civic polls in Calcutta in 2000 and 2005, when also the Congress and Trinamul fought separately, the former had a vote share of about 13 per cent.        
	So what happens if Mamata loses most of that Congress vote? Even if the Congresss vote isnt enough to fetch it many seats in Calcutta or most of the other 80 civic bodies that go to the polls on Sunday, it may cause much damage to Mamatas fortunes. The question is how much. Its easier to figure it out in an Assembly or parliamentary election. But in civic polls, with their small constituencies, small vote shares can have a big impact on the main players fortunes.         
	Then there is the other big question that the break-up of the alliance raises  how would the Muslim vote behave in this changed scenario? If the Muslims deserted the CPM in large numbers in 2009, this clearly had two broad reasons  one, the anger and fear in the community over the CPMs land-for-industry policy and two, the communitys anxiety not to let the BJP come back to power at the Centre and hence its decision to flock to the Congress and its allies (Trinamul in Bengal). Which one was a bigger factor? Did the Muslims in Calcutta see things differently from their compatriots in the Bengal districts?         
	The massive erosion in the Left vote was mainly in the rural areas, though the overall political pattern showed as strongly in the districts as in Calcutta. According to an analysis of the 2009 results by the New Delhi-based Lokniti-Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, the Left and the non-Left had an equal share of votes  44 per cent  among the professional and salaried people in urban areas.        
	Among the skilled and semi-skilled workers in urban areas, the Left was still ahead with 57 per cent of the vote, compared with the non-Lefts 37 per cent. It is among the business classes that the Left suffered the biggest reverse in the towns.         
	Finally, there is the question whether 2009 was an aberration or spike, as statisticians call it, because of a sudden and dramatic change in the normal voting pattern. In most elections in Bengal since 1984, except between 2004 and 2006, the vote shares of the Left and its opponents had been roughly equal.         
	If one week is a long time in politics, one year could be an eternity. The CPM hopes that the passing of one year has lessened the intensity of the anger against it. It points to the student union elections earlier this year as evidence of the changing mood.        
	For all the advances made by Trinamul, the SFI, the students wing of the CPM, won 252 of the 406 college polls and its allies another three. Trinamul and the Congress student bodies got 151. For the 88 colleges in Calcutta, the tally was 64 for the SFI and allies and 24 for the Trinamul students wing. (In 2008-2009, the comparative figures were 71 and 19).        
	 The Left camp also argues that increasing lawlessness and disruptions in public life could make more sections of the people sceptical, even fearful, about Trinamuls agenda for change.         
	But thats a fear the CPM has tried to arouse and exploit in this campaign. The question is whether it can be more powerful than the hope for change that Mamata dangles before Bengal.

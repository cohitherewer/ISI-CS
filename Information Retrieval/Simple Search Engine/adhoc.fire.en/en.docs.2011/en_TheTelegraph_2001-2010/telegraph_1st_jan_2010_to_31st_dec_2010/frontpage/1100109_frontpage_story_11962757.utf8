                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tiwari paternity notice
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            ND Tiwari                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: The old paternity suit today returned to haunt N.D. Tiwari with Delhi High Court asking him to reply to the plea of Rohit Shekhar, who claims to be his biological son.        
	The blow comes weeks after Tiwari resigned as Andhra Pradesh governor on health grounds following a TV report alleging a sex scandal in the Hyderabad Raj Bhavan.        
	The high court notice to Tiwari came on 30-year-old Shekhars appeal against a single-judge benchs dismissal of his original suit on November 3 on technical grounds. Tiwari, 86, has time till February 9 to reply.        
	Tiwari had earlier escaped the embarrassment of having to appear in court personally since he held a constitutional post. This time, he will have to turn up in court unless the bench, headed by chief justice A.P. Shah, grants him special permission to stay away and be represented by his counsel.        
	His resignation as governor also weakens his position in one way. One of the grounds on which Shekhars case had been thrown out was that of territorial jurisdiction. The court had accepted Tiwaris claim that he was a resident of Andhra Pradesh and not Delhi and so should not be tried by Delhi High Court.        
	Tiwari can no longer make the Andhra claim, and Shekhar, in his appeal, has cited that the former Congress leader and four-time chief minister maintains a permanent home in Delhi.        
	The other ground on which the suit was dismissed was that of limitation (time bar)  Tiwaris lawyers had argued that Shekhar should have lodged the case within three years of turning 18. Shekhar has challenged this argument in his appeal.        
	The young man, a law graduate, claims he is the son of Ujjwala Sharma and Tiwari and has demanded a DNA test to establish it.         
	Shekhar and his father Bimal Prasad Sharma claim they had taken a DNA test on their own at a private clinic and that the report established that Sharma was not Rohits biological father.        
	Shekhar claims he has several photographs and other evidence to prove he is Tiwaris son, and says the former governor conspicuously treated him as his son till he had turned 16.         
	Shekhar says he wants to fight the case to end the social stigma over the ambiguity surrounding his paternity. He has urged the high court to hear his case on merit instead of throwing it out on technical grounds.

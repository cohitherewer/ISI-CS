The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Allergies away, Mamata still cold
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Allergies away, Mamata still cold
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, July 8: Bengal housing minister Gautam Deb has made an offer that Don Corleone may have found difficult to refuse but not Mamata Banerjee.        
	Deb told Mamata he would do away with two allergies the Trinamul leader cannot stand  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the Left Front government  if she agreed to attend a meeting to hand over flats to subscribers in the Rajarhat New Township.        
	If the absence of the two failed to make Mamatas heart grow fonder, Deb was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice at the altar of allergies: he himself offered to stay away.        
	I have promised her that the chief minister would not be invited as she is allergic to his presence on such occasions. I even told her that there would be no placard mentioning the West Bengal government because she is allergic to that name, too. To top it all, I said I wouldnt go either if you were allergic to me as well. Only officers of the department will attend, Deb told the Assembly.        
	But, evidently, Debs medicine has not cured Mamata of the double or triple allergy.        
	The minister told the House that Mamata had asked him to put down the programme in writing in the form of a letter. I did so but she has not bothered to reply. I had also sent an invitation letter to Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. He has written back and asked us to name the date of the function, he added.        
	Deb, also a member of the CPMs state secretariat, later told to The Telegraph that his move is aimed at creating a healthy relationship between the ruling party and the principal Opposition for better governance.         
	The housing project involves 8,000 middle-income group and 12,000 lower-income flats but the real issue goes far beyond that.        
	Projects in New Town Rajarhat, the brainchild of Deb, have been delayed because of opposition from landowners supported by Trinamul, affecting a money-spinning system that used to keep all sides happy.        
	Referring to controversy about high-tension wires, Deb himself said: All development will get stalled if we cant buy land against good compensation packages.        
	Speaking of allergies, not all found Debs reference to Mamata, who is not a member of the Assembly, by name fully agreeable. In reply to a question, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim later said: She should have been referred to as the honourable railway minister.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Ashok Chaturvedi, Neera Yadav      
	Lucknow, Dec. 7: A bureaucrat voted Uttar Pradeshs second most corrupt by her peers became the first former chief secretary in memory to be jailed for graft today, in a winter of financial scandals involving the powerful in India.        
	It is beyond my view to think about the involvement of bureaucrats in corrupt practices, which is found to be correct (in this case), a rueful CBI judge said while convicting Neera Yadav, 62, and handing her a four-year term in a land allotment case.        
	Yadav, removed as state chief secretary in 2005 under Supreme Court orders because of the corruption charges against her, broke down and was provided a chair.        
	I am innocent.... I dont feel I have committed any wrong, Yadav, who was wearing a pink silk sari, told reporters at the Ghaziabad CBI court before being led away by policewomen.        
	The bureaucrat had enjoyed almost unfettered power under the rule of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Rajnath Singh. She has been accused of a string of irregular land allotments during her stint as head of the Noida Development Authority in 1992-96, the alleged beneficiaries including politicians across parties, bureaucrats, businessmen and her own daughters.        
	Her husband Mahendra Singh had been a BJP minister in the state before joining the Samajwadi Party. Yadav took voluntary retirement after Mayavati came to power in 2007 and both she and her husband joined the BJP last year.        
	Yadavs conviction came over a land allotment she had made in Noida to Flex Industries in violation of rules, which cost the exchequer over Rs 1 crore. Her co-accused, Flex Industries owner Ashok Chaturvedi, too was handed a four-year term and was led away in handcuffs.        
	The court delivered the verdicts in two land cases involving Yadav, acquitting her in the first case  bringing visible relief to her face  before convicting her in the second. Her lawyer said he would move Allahabad High Court for bail tomorrow and would also appeal the verdict.        
	The case against Yadav had started in 1997 but two governors, Romesh Bhandari and Motilal Vora, had refused the CBI sanction to prosecute her. In 2000, the Supreme Court directed the agency to register cases against her, and Yadav was chargesheeted in 2002.        
	Yet, in 2005, Mulayam kicked up a storm by appointing her chief secretary. After the apex court ordered her removal in October that year, Mulayam made her head of the state revenue board.        
	A month before her removal, Yadav had been seen standing close to Bill Clinton during the former US Presidents Lucknow visit in September 2005.        
	In 1997, Yadav was No. 2 on a list of the most corrupt IAS officers in the state. The list was drawn up by a committee of the state IAS association, and the voters included its members as well as lawyers and eminent citizens.

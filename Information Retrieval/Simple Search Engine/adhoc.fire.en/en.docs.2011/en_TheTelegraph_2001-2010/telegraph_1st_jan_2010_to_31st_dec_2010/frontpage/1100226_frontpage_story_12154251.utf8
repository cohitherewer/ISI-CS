The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | The takeaway: talks to go on
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                The takeaway: talks to go on
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                       The hands of Indian foreign secretary Nirupama Rao and her Pakistani counterpart Salman Bashir as they greet each other in Delhi on Thursday. (AFP)                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: If this was the breaking of ice, it meant just a crack  India and Pakistan stood on either side of it, one hand reaching out for a shake, the other still twisted in accusation, rather like an estranged couple nudged into another rapprochement bid.        
	At the end of their four-hour eyeball-to-eyeball at the Hyderabad House this afternoon, foreign secretaries Nirupama Rao and Salman Bashir went different ways and said quite different things.         
	The only commonality lay in their significant resolve to continue talking because they both found the meeting useful the rest was all disagreement.        
	Rao foregrounded Indias terror grouse and complained Pakistan had not done enough on the front to reduce the trust deficit with New Delhi. Bashir argued during his media conference a little later that Pakistan had done all that could be done under our laws to deal with Mumbai suspects and cautioned arch-browed that it would be unfair and counter-productive to make terror the focus to stall other issues in our relationship.         
	The Indian foreign secretary recognised the gains of the time when comprehensive dialogue (CD) was in progress but held that the Mumbai attack had erased trust and there was still a long way to go before New Delhi could think of a resumption at that level.         
	Her counterpart from Pakistan said it would not serve to go on talking about talking, making a blunt pitch for resuming CD. We have immense respect for the vision of your Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, the real issue here is political will to bridge the gap between expectations and mistrust. But we have to talk in a way that takes our relationship forward and creates an atmosphere from which all of South Asia can begin to benefit, he said.         
	To Bashir, the two neighbours should proceed with doable political agreements on de-escalation from Siachen and the demarcation along the Sir Creek in the upper Arabian Sea, on which, he held, negotiations had come close to resolution during the CD.        
	To the Indian side, clearly, such issues  even though they were on the table today along with the water dispute  must await clearance of the terror hurdle.         
	Rao came away from the bilateral, the first between foreign secretaries since the July 2008 meeting in New Delhi, with the impression that the Kashmir issue had come up briefly during the talks and been terminated upon her iteration of Indias stated position  basically a proprietary lay-off message that reserves the crisis in Kashmir as an internal matter and makes Indias territorial integrity non-negotiable.         
	Bashir had a contrary memory of how Kashmir had played out. At length and extensively, he said, Kashmir is the core issue, and I will say this again and again, we cant be dismissive about the issue, any effort to be dismissive will not be helpful. We have raised the issue of Kashmiri aspirations and human rights violations, we will continue to extend moral, legal and political support to the struggle of Kashmiri people for their rights.         
	Rao said Pakistan had offered no evidence to back allegations of Indian interference in Balochistan although Bashirs delegation did raise it.        
	She was crisp and clipped in her refutation: We told them the allegations were baseless and that we have no desire to interfere in the internal affairs of Pakistan.         
	Bashir made no mention of presenting evidence to India but held forth on possessing proof of Indian activities prejudicial to Pakistan.        
	Responding to a pointed query on the Indian role in Afghanistan, Bashir said: Indian activities in Afghanistan point to clear efforts at destabilising Pakistan. The supply of weapons, the funding of terrorists. We have ample evidence, including photographic, of this. So let India not lecture us. We are the worst victims of terror ourselves and the world recognises we are at the forefront of the war against terror.         
	Rebutting Indias allegations of soft-pedalling on the Pakistan-based terror network, Bashir said: I do not want to belittle anything, but there have been hundreds of Mumbais in Pakistan, there is no city in our country that is not affected. He then rattled off terror attack figures: 727 in 2008, 1,947 in 2009, 3,042 in the short time 2010 has been around. Loss of lives: 5,066.        
	Terror is something that does not recognise borders, it has no ideology, we believe it must be exterminated and we are ready to co-operate with India on facing it. We have condemned all acts of terror, including Mumbai and Pune, and I am not saying this pro forma.         
	Pressed again on the absence of action against the likes of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, who openly called for violent jihad against India as recently as on February 5, Bashir said: We have done what we can, we have a legal system. We were meant to have been given evidence against Hafiz Saeed by India. The fact is what we got is more literature than evidence.         
	The Indian side disputed Bashirs claim on the time Kashmir took with a counter-claim that 85 per cent of the dialogue had been devoted to Indias concerns over the export of terror. Indeed, New Delhi was quick to unplug an unattributable propaganda offensive against what the Pakistani foreign secretary had to tell the media.        
	Mocking Bashirs extended discourse on the fight against terror, a government source said: Well, Pakistan is a victim of its own creation when it talks about being under siege by terror, in our case, we are victims of what Pakistan is doing.         
	The source said the government had been surprised by the tone and tenor of Bashirs interaction with the media, although it was clear New Delhi hadnt been annoyed enough to immediately review its decision to go on talking with the enemy.

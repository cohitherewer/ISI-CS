          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 15: Jyoti Basus condition deteriorated rapidly late tonight after his renal system suffered irreversible damage during the day.        
	Key members of his medical board rushed to AMRI Hospital, where Basu is admitted, close to midnight. Basus son Chandan also reached the hospital at night.        
	Leaving the hospital around 12.40am, Chandan said: I came because it was an emergency. Asked whether he would return soon, Chandan said: I may, if there is an emergency.        
	A medical bulletin issued in the evening said that Basus ventilator requirement  which means the need for artificial oxygen  had increased significantly and he remained on complete sedation.        
	Basu is suffering from a condition in which the functioning of all major organs are affected by the malfunctioning of other organs, a doctor said. Apart from the failure of the lungs, kidneys, cardiovascular system and haemodynamic system (the flow of blood), his liver has been affected, he added.         
	Then there is significant fluid retention in his body, including the heart muscle, because of multi-organ failure, the doctor added.        
	As the fluid deposition was linked to kidney failure, the doctors tried two rounds of dialysis  for two hours yesterday as a test and three hours this afternoon  but the process didnt improve the kidneys or his general health condition.         
	Doctors said they could not administer some of the necessary drugs during dialysis, keeping in mind an earlier blood clot in Basus brain. Although the clot doesnt exist any more, his system cant take some of the drugs usually given during dialysis, said a doctor.         
	Basus cardiac condition has severely worsened since the past two days and his heart is not pumping enough blood into the lungs.         
	He is suffering from what we call tricuspid regurgitation, a condition in which there is back-flow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium of the heart, a doctor said.         
	For a person with normal cardiac function, the right ventricle of the heart pumps blood into the pulmonary artery. The blood flows forward through the artery from the heart to the lungs and the tricuspid valve blocks back-flow into the atrium.         
	The tricuspid valve in his heart is not functioning. So adequate blood is not pumped into the lungs and some amount is flowing back into the right atrium. This condition is because of the stiffness of the left ventricular muscle, which is creating more pressure on the right one, the doctor said.         
	The stiffness in cardiac muscles has resulted in the left ventricle not receiving the required amount of blood from the lungs. The blood not received by the heart is flowing into the liver and causing its dysfunction, the doctor added.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury visited the hospital.

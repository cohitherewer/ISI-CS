The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Haldar role to stay intact, says Gogoi
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Haldar role to stay intact, says Gogoi
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, May 27: Dispur today made it clear that the role of the Centres interlocutor P.C. Haldar will remain intact despite Delhi handing over the mandate to carry forward the political process with insurgent outfits to the state government.        
	The development is an indication that the state government will not upset ongoing peace initiatives in the run-up to next years Assembly elections and also keep options open on seeking the help of Haldar, a former Intelligence Bureau director, while dealing with Ulfa.         
	Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi said this on the sidelines of a PCC meeting at Rajiv Bhawan here when asked whether the state would appoint any other interlocutor/mediator to carry out the process initiated by Haldar in the changed scenario.         
	Haldar was appointed interlocutor for talks with three groups  Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel), United Peoples Democratic Solidarity and the pro-talks faction of NDFB  on October 31 last year. He was also asked to keep Dispur in the loop about negotiations with the outfits.         
	Haldars role will remain unaffected. If he wants anybody to assist him, we will provide. But it is better the way it is, as too many interlocutors/mediators can prove counter-productive. We will do everything possible for peace with other groups as well as Ulfa. We will try our best to facilitate the peace talks, which will eventually be held between the Centre and Ulfa, Gogoi told journalists.        
	Highly placed sources said Gogois backing of Haldar indicated that the expertise and experience of the former IB chief would be tapped, even if it is unofficial, by the state government, while dealing with Ulfa. The Gogoi cabinet yesterday decided in principle to start the talks process with Ulfa without Paresh Barua, the outfits commander-in-chief.         
	Gogoi said he was yet to receive any feedback from Ulfa on the decision to start talks.         
	It will take some time because some Ulfa leaders are still outside (jail). We will go ahead even without Paresh Barua, but he is most welcome to join. Even the citizens group, involving Hiren Gohain, is trying to establish contact, he said after the PCC function held to mark the death anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru and the induction of Maqsoodur Rahman Madani, president of the All Assam Jamiate Ahile Hadees, into the Congress.         
	A PTI report quoted Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, who was brought to GMCH for a medical check-up today, saying he could not comment on the peace process till the outfits general council decided on the issue. Rajkhowa, currently in custody, said the general council would also decide if talks would be held without Paresh Barua.

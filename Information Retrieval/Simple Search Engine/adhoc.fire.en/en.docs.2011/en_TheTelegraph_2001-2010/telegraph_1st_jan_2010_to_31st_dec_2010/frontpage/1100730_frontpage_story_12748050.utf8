	Islampur, July 29: A guardian was killed and at least two others suffered bullet injuries today when police opened fire on a school campus teeming with students and teachers, who had allegedly attacked the law enforcers and set at least nine vehicles afire.        
	Among the burnt vehicles were three police jeeps and five buses, three belonging to the North Bengal State Transport Corporation. Although the Rapid Action Force was deployed, they could do little to disperse the mob that blocked the busy NH31 for nearly five hours.         
	Five policemen and a block land reforms officer confined to a schoolroom for five hours were released around 7.30pm, half an hour before the blockade was lifted. The cops had come to execute a district administration order and take possession of a plot of land adjacent to Srikrishnapur High School, 7km from here.         
	In the evening, around 8pm, after the policemen were suspended till further inquiry and the BLRO told to go on leave, the local people allowed the body of 30-year-old Dipak Mirdha to be taken for post-mortem. Mridhas nephew is a student of the school. The body had been on the school verandah till then.         
	The inspector-general of police of north Bengal, Ranvir Kumar, who visited the school, said the mob had attacked two consecutive police teams, prompted them to open fire.        
	There is a dispute over the school ground. On one side a person is claiming it to be his property, while on the other hand, the school authorities are saying it is theirs. When the issue reached the district land and land reforms department, officials there sought police escort to measure the land, Kumar said. They were however, assaulted and confined. We are yet to know how many rounds were exactly fired as the investigation is still in progress.        
	According to the headmaster of the school, Swapan Pal, the land in question was under the control of the institution for the past 50 years.         
	Trouble began around 2pm, when Ganesh Gayen, a clerk with the refugee rehabilitation department here, arrived with an order from the additional district magistrate to take possession of the one-acre plot in front of the institution. Gayen was accompanied by BLRO Biswajit Banerjee and the five armed policemen.        
	On seeing them measuring the land, the teachers and the students of the school came out and protested. A heated argument followed and soon a crowd swelled in front of the school.         
	They dragged the BLRO and the policemen inside the building, and locked them up in a room. Witnesses said the policemen fired from inside the locked office room.        
	This Ganesh Gayen has misled the district administration into granting him possession of the land. We wanted to hold a discussion over the issue but Ganesh and his men attacked the school with stones, the headmaster said.        
	Pal said the police should have used tear gas to disperse the mob instead of opening fire on the campus.         
	Gayen, who was admitted to the Islampur subdivisional hospital after he was roughed up, said he had served notice to the school several times but the authorities did not want to part with the land that was rightfully his. I was brutally attacked by the students, teachers and the guardians, he said.        
	As violence spread in the area, local people started torching buses on the highway that connects Siliguri to Purnea More. Three police vehicles and a fire tender were also set on fire by the mobs.        
	Later in the afternoon, the divisional commissioner of Jalpaiguri A.K. Singh visited the school.        
	The police said Jyotish Das, whose sister is a student of the school, was admitted to the Islampur hospital with a bullet wound on his right leg. Deepak Das, also injured in the firing, was referred to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri.        
	While the Congress and the Trinamul Congress set up blockades on NH31, the SUCI has called a 12-hour bandh in Islampur to condemn the firing.

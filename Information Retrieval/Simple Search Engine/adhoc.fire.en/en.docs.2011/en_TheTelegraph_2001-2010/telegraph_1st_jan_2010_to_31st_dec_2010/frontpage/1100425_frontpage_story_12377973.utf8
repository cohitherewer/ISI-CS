The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Illegal mining scars Mughal era mosque
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Illegal mining scars Mughal era mosque
  - RTI exposes state departments negligence of Sahebganj relic, ASI feels vindicated after two years of struggle           SANTOSH K. KIRO                            Jami Masjid in Rajmahal                                        
	Ranchi, April 24: Rampant illegal mining is posing serious threat to a Mughal era mosque in Sahebganj, the mines department has conceded two years after the ASIs (Ranchi circle) relentless crusade to jolt the state out of its slumber.        
	The disturbing admission came to light following an RTI petition filed by a lawyer of Jharkhand High Court.        
	The Jami Masjid in Rajmahal was built by Maan Singh, one of the navratnas (nine gems) in Emperor Akbars court, in the 16th Century. The mosque made of Vindhyan sandstones and bricks is an epitome of Mughal architecture and is protected under the Ancient Monument Act, 1958.         
	According to provisions of the act, mining is prohibited within 200m of any historical monument. However, in Rajmahal, illegal mining takes place within 50m of Jami Masjid.        
	On December 16, 2009, Nityanand Mahto, a lawyer and resident of Rajmahal, invoked the RTI Act seeking answers from the ASI and mines department on what was being done to stall mining and protect the mosque.        
	On January 13, the ASI responded, saying it had written to various government departments for two years, but in vain. The ASI had knocked on the doors of deputy commissioner (Sahebganj), the mines secretary and even the state chief secretary.         
	In July 2009, the tourism department also wrote a letter to the mines secretary, asking him to ensure termination of illegal mining around Jami Masjid.        
	We have knocked on every possible door for the last two years, but illegal mining around the mosque continues unabated, N.G. Nikoshey, the superintending archaeologist of ASI (Ranchi circle) told The Telegraph.         
	Within two months of the ASIs reply, the mines department responded to the RTI plea. It said the government in unified Bihar had granted lease to mine china clay to one Victor Mines Corporation in August 1961. It was renewed in 1981, but till 2001.         
	An application for a second renewal has been pending with the Jharkhand government since, deputy director (mines) R.N. Prasad said in his response to Mahtos appeal, tacitly admitting illegal mining in the area.         
	According to Nikoshey, the ASI, in March 2008, had first written to the deputy commissioner of Sahebganj, asking him to stop illegal mining. Two more letters were rushed to the chief secretary in December 2009 and mines secretary in January this year.         
	When confronted, state mines secretary N.N. Sinha said he would urgently look into the matter. ASI officials should meet me immediately and brief me on the entire issue. I will look into the matter, he said.        
	Government sources said a deputy commissioner was usually vested with powers to stop illegal mining. But Sahebganj deputy commissioner K. Ravi Kumar was shirking his responsibility.        
	Kumar, however, denied the charge and said: The issue of mining here is very old. Things have to be verified before action is taken.

  - Rajnath, Ananth Kumar in Ranchi today to talk to MLAs        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Chief minister Shibu Soren presides over a meeting of JMM MLAs at his Kanke Road residence in Ranchi on Monday. Picture by Hardeep Singh                                         
	New Delhi, May 10: The BJP was forced to put off a decision on a Jharkhand chief minister today after hard bargaining by factions either led by MLAs or patronised by certain Delhi leaders with the party announcing that senior leaders Rajnath Singh and Ananth Kumar would be in the state capital tomorrow to take discussions forward.        
	Right now, it appeared to be a toss-up between Lok Sabha MP Arjun Munda and deputy chief minister Raghubar Das.         
	Some central leaders still rooted for former finance and foreign minister Yashwant Sinha. Their contention being that although he  a Lok Sabha MP like Munda  did not have caste on his side nor a following in the legislature party, he was ideal for cleaning up the system in the state and see the BJP made a mark in governance.        
	Besides his natural attribute as a tribal, Munda, a former chief minister, has formidable patrons in Rajnath, Venkaiah Naidu and L.K. Advani. Also said to command the loyalty of a majority of the MLAs, Munda apparently played his cards discreetly through loyalist and the Assembly Speaker C.P. Singh, who led the MLAs to the Capital on Saturday.         
	Das, a backward caste Vaish, is being backed by Ramlal, the general secretary in charge of the organisation and the RSSs man in the BJP.        
	A section of the BJP looked at him askance because of his alleged proximity to Parimal Nathwani, who though an Independent Rajya Sabha MP was supported by the BJP. Nathwani reportedly represents the interests of an industrial conglomerate perceived to be close to the Congress.         
	In Jharkhand, where politics has got intertwined with business aspirations and ambitions over the years, Nathwanis alleged Congress link by proxy has made him a bit of a suspect for the BJP.        
	So naturally we will be wary of his friends in our party, a source said.         
	Rajnath and Ananth Kumar, a party general secretary in-charge of Jharkhand, will be in Ranchi tomorrow to talk to each MLA separately. Their impressions will be conveyed to party chief Nitin Gadkari who was expected to make up his mind by Wednesday or Thursday.        
	The party will then announce its chief minister.        
	For the record, Kumar said the parliamentary board meeting, chaired by Gadkari and attended by Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and other senior leaders, was briefed about the talks held with the JMM and the All Jharkhand Sudents Union on Saturday.         
	We are fully confident of the JMM and the other allies support. We will have a common minimum programme with our allies and a coordination committee, Kumar told the press.        
	The BJP did not initiate a process of consulting MLAs in the recent past when chief ministers of two key states  Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh  were nominated by Delhi and unwrapped before the state as a fait accompli.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In family, a long winter ends

          RASHEED KIDWAI                                              
	New Delhi, July 8: The family has reunited after 30 years.        
	Jawaharlal Nehrus niece Nayantara Sahgal, who bitterly opposed first cousin Indira Gandhi and nephew Sanjay during and after the Emergency, told The Telegraph today that she was now in regular touch with Sonia Gandhi.        
	 I feel Sonia Gandhi is doing an excellent job under very difficult circumstances, the 83-year-old author said from her Dehra Dun home. I greatly admire the way she has conducted herself and handled everything.        
	The compliment, over 30 years after the 1975 Emergency had muzzled dissent, indicated a quiet thaw in relations within the wider Nehru-Gandhi family.         
	Although Rajiv Gandhi had a healthy regard for his aunt, past baggage had limited their interaction to just social occasions.        
	Sahgal, daughter of Nehrus sister Vijayalakshmi Pandit, never got along with Indira and Sanjay and had once compared the situation during the Emergency to that in Gulag Archipelago, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyns novel based on Soviet labour camps.        
	Sahgal, who also wrote on politics, had discovered during the 21-month Emergency that editors had started avoiding her. Then, someone keen to make a film based on her novel This Time of Morning abruptly dropped the idea.        
	The filmmaker, who lived abroad, reportedly conveyed to her that association with Sahgal could anger the ruling clique and jeopardise future sanctions for programmes from the information and broadcasting ministry, then headed by V.C. Shukla.        
	Today, Sahgal refused to dwell on the past. I do not wish to comment on the past or each individual of my family, she said, restricting her praise to Sonia.        
	Sahgals mother Vijayalakshmi Pandit and Sonias mother-in-law Indira never got along. At the height of the Emergency in December 1975, Vijayalakshmi had written pamphlets against the Indira regime.        
	Vijayalakshmis friends advised both her and her daughter to avoid writing on politics. But Sahgal refused to heed the advice.         
	In an article on the right to dissent, she recalled how historical figures  from Socrates to 16th-century theologian Michael Servetus who was burnt at the stake as a heretic  had been punished for disobeying the authorities.        
	I recalled that one could be sentenced to death by poison for teaching the values of the good life, if these were different from what the state taught. One could be burned at the stake, broken on the wheel or condemned to galleys for declaring, writing or printing heresies against the church or the monarch or challenging current theories about the sun, the earth and the stars.        
	From Socrates to Servetus and beyond, prison, torture or extermination had been ordinary matter-of-fact punishments for those who disagreed, Sahgal wrote.        
	In another article she said she was told to see chief censor Harry DPenha before publishing her novel A Situation in New Delhi. DPenha advised her to seek the home ministrys approval. But Sahgal, who also claimed that her telephone had been tapped, declined to see Om Mehta, the minister of state for home who was considered a close Sanjay associate.        
	I took my manuscript home and forgot about it. It had no importance now next to the sheer sickness I felt when I thought of admired, veteran leaders, some legendary for their contribution to India  in jail, of the thousands with no famous name or background to protect them, she wrote.         
	By one estimate, over 100,000 political activists of all hues were jailed during the Emergency.         
	Sahgal was not arrested during the Emergency but, on one occasion, her sister was told by a close Indira associate: We could pick her up under Misa any day.        
	The four-letter acronym stood for the dreaded Maintenance of Internal Security Act, which gave the government powers of indefinite preventive detention.         
	On another occasion, Shukla reportedly told Vijayalakshmi that her daughter wouldnt be able to write about politics. Nehrus sister had retorted that politics was not the lone subject her daughter was capable of writing on.        
	But Sahgal insists she does not want to comment on past events. At 83, she is satisfied that the core values that Nehru stood for are safe with Sonia and her son Rahul.

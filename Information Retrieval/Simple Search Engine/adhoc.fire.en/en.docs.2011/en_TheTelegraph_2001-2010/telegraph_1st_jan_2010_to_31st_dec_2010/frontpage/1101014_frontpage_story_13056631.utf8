The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | At 37, a joyous leap and a sad slide
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                At 37, a joyous leap and a sad slide
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Rahul Dravid (left), Cheteshwar Pujara                          
	Bangalore, Oct. 13: Two 37-year-olds took India to a momentous seven-wicket win, sealing a first-ever clean sweep, 2-0, over the once ruthless Australia.        
	But while Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid had something in common at the Chinnaswamy, this afternoon, the Airtel series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy actually ended very differently for them.        
	After the champagne and chocolate cake celebrations, Sachin left for Mumbai with two awards (MoS and MoM) in his bag, besides lifting his Test average in 2010 to a Bradmanesque 97.69. Absolutely mindboggling, but thats the truth.        
	Dravid, the local hero, went home with probably as much traffic in his head as there is on the roads here. For the uninitiated, its quite a bit.        
	Three dismissals in almost identical manner in the series first three innings made the team management drop Dravid down the order. Around lunch, it became the talking point.        
	Few were convinced by the official line  that Cheteshwar Pujaras promotion was wholly driven by the need to have experience after Sachin (at No. 4).        
	Perhaps, that did play a role, but the question being asked was: Had The Wall cracked?         
	Surely, our best No.3, in possibly his last India appearance on home ground, had to be in the middle, trying to take confidence from the rather frenzied adulation.        
	As it turned out, the team managements move became the proverbial masterstroke and Pujara left Australia bewildered. A parallel was immediately drawn with V.V.S. Laxmans promotion, to No. 3, in the epic Test at the Eden Gardens, nine years ago.        
	One isnt sure, though, whether Dravid was more surprised when told that hed be batting at No. 5 or, the Australians, on seeing the debutant emerge from the shadows, exhibiting a couple of Navjyot Singh Sidhus mannerisms.        
	Whatever, with no baggage (except the first innings contribution of four), Pujara went for his shots and found the gaps with little effort. A fine driver, he showed top-class temperament and vindicated a good many people.        
	The exuberance of youth  Pujaras 22  helped as well.         
	Pujaras 72 (in 129 minutes, off 89 deliveries, 7x4) and Sachins 53 not out, not to forget first innings centurion Murali Vijays 37, helped in quickly achieving the target (207). Victory came 20 minutes after tea, on the last afternoon.        
	Virender Sehwag left early, but the momentum wasnt surrendered and three partnerships in succession ensured that the Test wouldnt go the heart-stopping Mohali way.        
	Earlier, Australias second innings ended 53 minutes into the days play.        
	Id say weve just finished a fabulous series. How many teams, in recent memory, have defeated Australia 2-0? This clean sweep has to rank as a special achievement, Sachin said, during a one-on-one with The Telegraph.        
	Sachin, who registered 214 in the first innings, finished the series with 403 runs, at an average of 134.33. Im happy, yes. But more happy for the team. We got it right collectively, he added.        
	A dozen years after he gave Shane Warne nightmares, Sachin has probably ruined Nathan Hauritzs sleep for the rest of this season. Such was the thrashing he got that the off-spinner may need counselling.        
	Having presided over three losses in as many Tests (a dubious record last set in late 1988), Ponting accepted that his team didnt play good cricket over all the five days in both Tests and that they needed to be harsh with themselves.        
	Despite the drubbing, Ponting couldnt resist firing a parting shot. The result is probably a little bit harsh. India deserved to win, yes, but would find 2-0 a little flattering.        
	With the Ashes not far away, Ponting has quite a job on his hands. Not being able to last the equivalent of even three sessions in the second innings, in Mohali and in Bangalore, has to be his biggest worry.        
	There are some issues that we need to deal with and we need to get over them quickly, Ponting, who hasnt opened his account, as captain, in India, conceded.        
	Ponting cut a lonely figure at the presentation ceremony and afterwards, much in contrast to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who hasnt lost a Test series.        
	Australia, by the way, have gone down to No. 5 in the ICC rankings. Indias position, at the very top, has got stronger.        
	Jai h!

  India's bigger story faces Ayodhya test          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             People from various religions take a pledge for peace during a rally in Hyderabad on Wednesday ahead of the Ayodhya verdict. (AFP)                                         
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: A nervous shiver runs through calls for calm resounding across the political spectrum as the clock ticks close to a judicial verdict on the Ayodhya dispute by the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court tomorrow.        
	The all-round and even-toned commitment to the courts decree has been widely perceived as a silver lining to the unravelling of probably our most intractable row.        
	But the divisive history of the wrangle has led many to apprehend there might be a dark cloud attached to it.        
	Renewed appeals for peace echoed from high portals today, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi leading the exhort to restraint in the name of Indias plurality and syncretic tradition.         
	It is my humble request to all of you to accept the verdict in the same liberal spirit and great tradition that this country is known for. Have faith in the judiciary and maintain peace and communal amity at all costs. Indias biggest strength is the emotional unity of its people, Sonia said in a plea that, at once, evoked new faith in public equanimity and old fears that tomorrows ruling may breach it.                
	Following up on two cabinet resolutions over the past week and a message from the Prime Minister, Union home minister P. Chidambaram invoked the past and the future to buttress the case for communal concord.         
	He quoted Mahatma Gandhis Ishwar Allah tero naam, Sabko sanmati de Bhagwan and put premium on the belief of the young in a new India that he held had moved on.         
	Contending that the India story was a much bigger story, Chidambaram said: India has moved, especially for people born after 1992. They have a very different world view. Young people have moved on and they recognise that the India story is more than a dispute over religious places. It (India) is a much bigger story.         
	But as he allayed cause for anxiety, Chidambaram emphasised preparedness to meet any threat to law and order.        
	Cleverly, though, Chidambaram quoted the stated positions of various parties, including the BJP, on respecting the courts verdict, and put the onus of calm equally on them.        
	The government has been emphasising that tomorrows ruling is not the end of the road for either party; there is the option of an appeal to the Supreme Court and the government hopes it will quickly be exercised by whichever set that feels aggrieved.        
	At the political level, though, the jousting was sharp and left room for the eruption of a fresh blaze over the disputed site.        
	Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati sought to pass the buck even before the verdict has been pronounced. She complained tonight that enough security forces had not been made available to the state and the Centre would be fully responsible if any untoward incident took place.        
	The state demanded 642 companies of the central forces against which only 52 companies had been allocated, Mayavati said in a statement.        
	Asked the reason for the almost panicked appeals for peace, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh pointedly named the BJP. The BJPs attitude does not inspire confidence, he said. They behaved irresponsibly even after giving an undertaking to the Supreme Court.         
	The BJP, which fielded its Muslim face in MP Shahnawaz Hussain, took exception to Singhs invective and labelled him provocative. The BJP is a responsible political party. It has already appealed for peace. Digvijay Singh should not cross the limits of propriety and give nonsensical statements that could breach peace, Hussain said.         
	But having showcased its commitment to constitutionalism, the BJP is keeping its side-burners revved. While Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi has gone public with mature advocacy of public composure, party senior L.K. Advani was sharp in re-emphasising the case for a Ram temple at the disputed site on his rath yatra anniversary return to Somnath last week.        
	The BJPs dare is frontal: even if the Hindu claimants lose tomorrow, can the Congress eradicate the de facto Ram-lalla temple that already exists on the site?         
	A meeting of the partys core committee has been scheduled after the verdict to devise the partys line; it could well determine what may lie between the silver lining many see and the dark cloud many shiver at.

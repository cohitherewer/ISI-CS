                                  Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones				                           
	London, April 25 (PTI): Actor Michael Douglas has revealed that he learned his romancing skills from two married women who seduced him when he was a naive 16-year-old.         
	From Fatal Attraction with Glenn Close to Basic Instinct with Sharon Stone, Douglass on-screen love life has always been as passionate and dramatic as his real life.         
	Douglas, the son of actor Kirk Douglas, said he had an unforgettable tryst with two women when he was 16.         
	They were friends of my mothers. I was 16, they were 30, the 65-year-old actor told Elle magazine.         
	I remember one woman whod been pursuing me, and Id gone back home and was in bed with her. At an unbelievably inopportune moment, another woman popped out of the closet. Lets just say that took care of the rest of the night, said Douglas, who is married to actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, 25 years his junior.         
	Douglas did not identify the women as his mother, actress Diana Dill, still does not know about her friends adulterous exploits.         
	Growing up in the sixties, Douglas did not find such episodes shocking. His sexual initiation, he said, reminded him of the film The Graduate, in which the young Benjamin Braddock, played by Dustin Hoffman, is seduced by the middle-aged Mrs Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft.

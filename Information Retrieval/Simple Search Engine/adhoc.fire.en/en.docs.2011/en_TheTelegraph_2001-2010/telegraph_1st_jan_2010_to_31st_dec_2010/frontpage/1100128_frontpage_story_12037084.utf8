The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Antony overrules chief in land case 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Antony overrules chief in land case 
          SUJAN DUTTA                              Minister Antony and army chief Kapoor				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: Overruling the army chief, defence minister A.K. Antony has asked for disciplinary proceedings that may lead to a court martial against the military secretary, Lt Gen. Avadhesh Prakash, after he was indicted by an internal inquiry in Calcutta in the Sukna land transfer case.        
	The investigation convened by army chief-designate and eastern army commander Lt Gen. V.K. Singh recommended that the military secretarys services be terminated because Prakash had used his power to curry favour with a Siliguri-based businessman.        
	But army chief Gen. Deepak Kapoor had issued a showcause notice to Prakash demanding an explanation why administrative action should not be taken against him.        
	Prakash is due to retire at the end of this week. Senior officers in army headquarters are scheduled to attend his dining out farewell party tomorrow. If a court martial is ordered, Prakash will have to appear before it even after his retirement on January 31.        
	Lt Gen. G.M. Nair is slated to take over as the next military secretary tomorrow. The military secretary is responsible for all transfers and postings of army officers and even processes the papers for the appointment of the next chief.        
	A source in the defence ministry said Antony had made his views known to the army chief after the military secretary had responded to the showcause notice.        
	A court martial is most likely, the source said. Prakash may be the seniormost officer  the military secretary is one of eight principal staff officers (PSO) to the army chief  to be court-martialled.        
	In only one instance has the government summarily sacked an officer equivalent to a general. Navy chief Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat was sacked by the Vajpayee government in December 1998. But Admiral Bhagwat won back his privileges on Supreme Court orders.        
	In another case, Lt Gen. (retired) A. Sahni went to high court and got a stay on court martial proceedings against him. The Supreme Court lifted the stay.        
	At the very least, the overruling of the recommendation of Gen. Kapoor, who was striving for administrative action, is a slight to the army chief.        
	But so unusual is the move to direct a switch from administrative action to disciplinary action that it can be seen as evidence of the mild-mannered Antony having concluded that the army chief was being too protective of his principal staff officer.        
	It also means that the government has taken the Sukna land transfer issue as much larger than a case of suspected corruption involving the military secretary and Siliguri-based realtor Dilip Agarwal.        
	More important, it was a breach of security rules in the strategic chickens neck or Siliguri Corridor. This was brought out in the report of the court of inquiry (The Telegraph, January 13) convened by V.K. Singh.        
	Administrative action can mean non-recordable censure, recordable censure or sacking. While the censure can be given by the army chief, it is only the government that can terminate the services of an officer as punishment.        
	After the investigation in Calcutta, the army chief issued a showcause notice to Prakash asking him to explain why administrative action should not be taken against him. A source in the army headquarters said the chief was contemplating a censure.        
	Court martial sentences can vary from censure to cashiering (being stripped of rank and privileges and dismissal).        
	By ordering disciplinary proceedings against Prakash, Antony has sent a political message, too: that the instrument of court martial will now be used against senior officers also.        
	Another lieutenant general, P.K. Rath, who was the commander of the Sukna-headquartered 33 corps, is also likely to face a court martial.

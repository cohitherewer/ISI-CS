	Hyderabad, Apr 28 (PTI): The BJP unit of Andhra Pradesh today alleged that over one lakh Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals, who were staying illegally in the state, were trying to enrol themselves as Indian citizens during the on-going Census drive.        
	Speaking to reporters here, party spokesperson N V S Prabhakar demanded appointment of an IAS officer to supervise the Census exercise and ensure that no foreigners could enlist as Indian citizens, particularly in the old city areas.        
	According to Prabhakar during the Census, the government should take steps to weed out anti-nationals and illegal migrants staying in the state. He alleged that Hyderabad has become a den for terrorists and illegal activities due to an inept police force.        
	Vicar alias Vicaruddin, a terror suspect from the city, is missing for last three years and police were not able to track him, he said, adding there was no co-ordination between counter-intelligence personnel and Octopus, an anti-terrorist cell.

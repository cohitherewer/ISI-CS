The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Autonomy killer, cries expert

	New Delhi, May 5: The principal author of Indias blue  print for higher education re  forms has accused the government of distorting his panels   recommendations, warning   that some changes now   planned could work contrary   to the intentions behind the reforms.     Veteran scientist Yash Pal,   appointed by the Prime Minister to head the team that draft  ed the reforms blueprint, has   criticised key segments of the   structure for the proposed Na  tional Commission for Higher   Education and Research   (NCHER).    A codified collegium of experts to help pick vice-chan  cellors, and a national registry   of eligible VC candidates, pro  posed by a human resource development ministry panel,   will kill the autonomy of insti  tutions, Yash Pal told The Telegraph. The HRD ministry   panel is drafting the NCHER   bill based on Yash Pals blue  print.    They (the government)   appear to have completely   misunderstood concepts we   had recommended. This will   kill the autonomy of individual institutions, whereas our   reforms were meant to protect   autonomy, he said in an inter  view.     Yash Pal, a former University Grants Commission   chairman and now Chancellor   of Jawaharlal Nehru University, said he had asked the   HRD ministry panel drafting   the NCHER bill not to distort   our ideas.    HRD ministry sources con  firmed that Yash Pal had articulated his concerns to the   panel appointed by minister   Kapil Sibal.  I am increasingly getting   frustrated, added Yash Pal in   an outburst that coincides   with a government rush to fi  nalise the NCHER bill after in  troducing four other key edu  cation reform bills in the Lok   Sabha earlier this week.    Yash Pal said his commit  tee had suggested informal   discussions with experts but   the governments proposal   would end up creating a codified body and concentrating   power in the hands of a few.   What our committee had   suggested was that the   NCHER should allow for infor  mal discussions with experts,   not a list of codified body like   the so-called collegium   where people will hold im  mense power over the fate of   institutions, he said.    The registry and the col  legium would mean that each   central institution would be   completely dependent on a   handful of experts in charge of   deciding who heads these in  stitutions, the veteran said.   How can any set of ex  perts sit and decide who is   meritorious enough to earn a   place on the registry? Yash   Pal asked.     The HRD ministry had   held discussions across the   country on an earlier draft of   the NCHER bill, and the new   version is being worded based   on the feedback.   Under the earlier draft bill,   all institutions  public, pri  vate, central or state govern  ment-run -- had to pick their VCs from a registry of potential candidates. A collegium of experts would decide the names on the registry and would also select the VCs of all central institutions -- from the registry.  The revised bill allows state universities and private universities to pick their VCs from outside the registry but heads of all central institutions will need to be from among the names on the registry.   This means that some varsities will have a wider pool  at least on paper as political interfere is rampant in government-run institutes  to pick their VCs from while the central institutes options will be confined to those in the registry.   The HRD ministry has also decided to strip the NCHER of the power to fund universities. The earlier draft bill had proposed that the regulator fund institutions like the University Grants Commission.    In the new bill, the HRD ministry has included medical education within the ambit of the NCHER -- despite resistance from the health ministry that is simultaneously working on a parallel regulator -- sources said.

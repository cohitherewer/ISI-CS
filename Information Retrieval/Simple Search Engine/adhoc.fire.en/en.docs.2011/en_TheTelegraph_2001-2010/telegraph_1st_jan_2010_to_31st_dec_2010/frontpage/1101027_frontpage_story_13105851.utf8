The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Go-ahead for riot verdicts
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Go-ahead for riot verdicts
  - Stay remains on Gulbarga judgment        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: The Supreme Court today cleared the decks for courts to deliver verdicts in the Godhra train burning and several Gujarat riot cases but kept on hold the judgment in one in which chief minister Narendra Modi was questioned.        
	The go-ahead, eight years after the riots killed over a 1,000 people, came on a day lawyer Prashant Bhushan, appointed amicus curiae in the Gulbarga case in which Modi was quizzed, recused himself after the state government said he might be biased.        
	The top court had on May 1 last year ordered six fast-track courts to be set up in Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Sabarkantha and Anand to try over half-a-dozen cases of communal violence that followed the February 27 burning of the Sabarmati Express. (See chart)        
	A few days later on May 6, it rejected allegations of shoddy probe by the court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) to clarify the trial was on but ordered a stay on pronouncing judgments. The bench today vacated that stay.        
	The removal of the stay means the judgments in cases like Naroda Patia, where one of the worst massacres were carried out, can be delivered. Former BJP minister Mayaben Kodnani is an accused in the massacre in which 83 people were killed.        
	Todays order, however, does not cover the Gulbarga trial, the only case where hearing is not over yet.        
	Justices D.K. Jain, Aftab Alam and P. Sathasivam accepted the SITs plea for more time and asked it to complete the probe by December 2.        
	Modi has been quizzed by the SIT in connection with the massacre at Gulbarga Society where former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, who kept pleading over phone with top officials to rush security to the Ahmedabad building, was among the dead.        
	The bench issued notices to the state government on why the case should not be transferred to another court in view of allegations of bias against the judge. A public prosecutor had earlier quit, accusing the judge of browbeating witnesses.        
	Today, Bhushan withdrew from the case after the state counsel said he had pronounced views on the riots and might be biased.        
	Bhushan agreed that he had strong views on the riots and Modis alleged role. Asked to decide if he could be objective, Bhushan recused himself. It has to be purely your decision. Thats exactly what we wanted to point out, the bench said.        
	The bench requested Bhushan to return the papers relating to a confidential report by former CBI DIG A.K. Malhotra, who was asked to verify allegations of lapses in investigations by the SIT.        
	Please dont make any insinuation, Justice Alam snapped when the Gujarat governments counsel, Ranjit Kumar, wanted the court to take back the report lest Bhushan made it public.

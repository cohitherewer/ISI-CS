  - State police to seek remand of Pahan aide        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                
	Ranchi, Dec. 17: More than a year after rebels kidnapped and beheaded special branch inspector Francis Indwar, district police have netted a top-rung Maoist who is believed to have orchestrated the killing from Uttar Pradesh.        
	Gurwa Lohra alias Gurwa Pahan (25), arrested from Alapur in Ambedkar Nagar district of the northern state in a joint raid last night, is a trusted lieutenant of CPI(Maoist) zonal commander Kundan Pahan. He is the ninth Pahan aide arrested this month.        
	Ranchi senior superintendent of police (SSP) Praveen Kumar said Lohra was nabbed during a joint operation with the UP police and would be brought to the capital within two-three days, once the CJM of Ambedkar Nagar gave his permission.         
	Lohra is wanted in more than 24 cases of abduction and murder registered at different police stations in Ranchi and Khunti. Our officers will approach the CJM of the UP district to take him in police remand from judicial custody, the SSP said, adding that the breakthrough came after a police team from the city trailed the rebel for seven days.        
	The Maoist, who is the prime accused in the Hembrom Bazar abduction and decapitation of Indwar, is a resident of Sosokuti village in the Arki police station area of Khunti district. Indwar was abducted on September 30 last year and his beheaded body recovered on a road near Raisa More in Namkum in Ranchi district on October 6.        
	In another development, police arrested two youths from the Jagannathpur area for masquerading as PLFI rebels, extorting money from traders and killing a night guard.        
	The duo has been identified as Ram Kumar Rama (18), a resident of Khunti, and Guruwa Swansi, a resident of Upper Hatia. A mobile phone with two SIM cards used for extortion calls has been recovered from their possession.        
	The SSP said Rama and Swansi ran the racket in Jagannathpur and Tupudana, and had killed night guard Shivpujan Sahu 10 days ago. They had sent extortion notes using PLFI letterhead. Police are looking for a third member of the gang, Prabhat Kumar of Orissa, who is absconding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Fix finger at Pak again

          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Sept. 18: The Sun has again accused Pakistani cricketers of spot-fixing but left many questions unanswered.        
	The tabloid today claimed Pakistan rigged its scoring pattern during yesterdays ODI after a ringleader in the side was paid by a Delhi bookie via a notorious Dubai-based match fixer.        
	The newspaper, which claimed it had details of calls between the fixer and the bookie, said it had tipped off the International Cricket Council (ICC).        
	A source informed The Sun that a certain scoring pattern would emerge... and, broadly speaking, that information appeared to be correct, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said. We therefore feel it is incumbent upon us to launch a full inquiry.        
	The problem is, it was Pakistan who won, leaving open the possibility that it was England that threw the match. This was why the England and Wales Cricket Board was forced to seek a clarification from the ICC that if there was any kind of cheating, it was not the England players who were involved.        
	If there was spot-fixing, it could mean that in certain agreed overs, Pakistani batsmen would not score any runs or hit any boundaries, or would throw away their wickets.        
	But the ICC did not clarify what it meant by a certain scoring pattern, or whether the pattern extended to the whole innings, during which Pakistans lower-middle order staged a recovery after an early slump. Many people may doubt that such a recovery can be guaranteed without co-operation from the bowling side.        
	The Sun identified no guilty Pakistanis but its correspondent, John Etheridge, dropped some none-too-subtle hints.        
	Pakistan looked flat when they batted and managed just 241... on a ground where 300-plus is commonplace, he said without explaining why England managed only 218 on the same pitch.        
	Etheridge said: The two most dangerous players  Umar Akmal and Shahid Afridi  both succumbed in the doziest ways imaginable. Akmal attempted a reckless shot, then Afridi... deflected a throw on his stumps when still short of his ground.        
	Yet Afridis dismissal looked so freakish, it could hardly have been planned. Etheridge said: They might have been freak dismissals. Who knows.        
	Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt said: These are meaningless allegations without any proof. The ICC has not got in touch with us on any such accusation. That is total imagination. There is no truth in it.        
	Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi rubbished the allegations, saying: I thought we played hard cricket and tried our level best to win. I just see these new allegations as an attempt to put pressure on the team.

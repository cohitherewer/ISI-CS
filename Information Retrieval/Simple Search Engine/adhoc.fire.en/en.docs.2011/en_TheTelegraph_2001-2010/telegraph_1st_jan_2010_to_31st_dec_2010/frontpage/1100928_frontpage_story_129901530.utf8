	New Delhi, Sep 28 (PTI): Paving the way for the Allahabad High Court to deliver its judgement in the 60-year-old Ramjanambhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit, the Supreme Court today dismissed the plea for deferment of the verdict.
    "Having considered in detail the arguments of the parties, we are of the view that the SLP has to be dismissed.
    Accordingly, the SLP stands dismissed," said the apex court's 3-judge bench headed by Chief Justice S H Kapadia in a brief order.

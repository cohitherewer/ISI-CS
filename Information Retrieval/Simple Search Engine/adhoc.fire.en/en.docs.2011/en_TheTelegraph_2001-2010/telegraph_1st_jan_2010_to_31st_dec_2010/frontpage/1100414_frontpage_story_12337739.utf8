                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Peerless vandalised after accident refusal charge 
          OUR BUREAU                      The hospital lobby after the rampage. (Bishwarup Dutta)                          
	Calcutta, April 13: A private hospital that had allegedly turned away critically injured victims of a road accident which killed five was vandalised today and its staff assaulted with rods and scalpels in the worst mob attack on a healthcare institute in the city.        
	Peerless Hospital, off the EM Bypass, not only suffered extensive damage in the morning attack by a 300-strong mob but also came under official scrutiny for allegedly violating a humanitarian code that makes it mandatory for a hospital to treat emergency patients without demanding a monetary deposit.        
	The hospital contested the allegation, saying that four of the accident victims were brought dead while a critically injured child  10-year-old Shonai Tarapdar  died before doctors could revive him. We didnt demand any deposit. Our doctors were busy treating the injured (survivors) when they were beaten up, S.K. Roy, the managing director of the Peerless Group and non-executive director of Peerless Hospital, told a news conference in the evening.        
	The mob had also attacked doctors at the nearby Apex Institute of Medical Sciences, where the accident victims were taken after Peerless allegedly turned them away. Like Peerless, the nursing home denied demanding a deposit.        
	The crowd then returned to Peerless and ran riot.        
	The accident had occurred off Bagha Jatin bridge on the Bypass side around 6am after a Tata 407 carrying around 25-odd people collided with a lorry. The five casualties, all from North 24-Parganas, were flung off the vehicle on impact and fell on the road, a survivor said.        
	Baikuntha Mondol, 55, Swapan Poddar, 35, and Sheila Poddar, 25, died on the spot, while 12-year-old Arati Gayen succumbed to injuries on the way to Peerless Hospital, a two-minute drive from the accident site.         
	The mob fury began around 7.40am after Shonai, Baikunthas grandson, was declared dead. Suddenly, there was a crowd outside the Peerless gates. Someone shouted that the hospital had refused to treat accident victims and the mob went berserk, a witness said.        
	Police said the vandals were residents of tenements in the vicinity of Peerless Hospital, but nobody had been arrested till late tonight.        
	A teenager who was in the mob said people of the area had long held a grudge against the hospital. Today, we got the chance to get back, he said.        
	The siege of Peerless continued till noon, by which time the ground and first floors of the hospital were littered with shards of glass, broken furniture and damaged medical and office equipment, including computers. A part of the canteen was set ablaze.         
	Patients in the wards and cabins on the top two floors were spared the mob fury because the hospital staff locked the collapsible gates at the foot of the first-floor staircase.         
	A statement from the hospital said property worth over Rs 1 crore was damaged. Families of several patients shifted them to other hospitals.        
	Sources said the first police team arrived only around 8.15am, almost half an hour after the vandalism started although Jadavpur East police station is barely 2km away. It was only after reinforcements arrived and the police fired four rounds in the air that the mob dispersed, only to assemble again outside the closed gates.         
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra told The Telegraph: I have sought a report from the police. I cant make any comment before I receive it.         
	District magistrate Khalil Ahmed said: Going by the information we have received, it seems that there was negligence on the part of the hospital. We are starting a case.         
	Ruby Hospital, on the Bypass, had once lost its licence for turning a patient away.

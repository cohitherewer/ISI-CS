	Bangalore, Oct 12 (PTI): In a new turn to political developments in Karnataka, Governor H R Bhardwaj today offered one more chance to Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa to prove his majority in the Assembly on Thursday.
    Holding that the trust vote taken in the Assembly yesterday by the BJP government was "not in accordance with the law", the Governor sent a letter to the Chief Minister today saying that he has not proved the majority.
    The Governor, who had yesterday recommended to the Centre imposition of President's Rule on the ground that the trust vote in the House was "unconstitutional", is believed to have said in the letter that he was ready to give him one more chance to prove his majority in the Assembly on October 14.

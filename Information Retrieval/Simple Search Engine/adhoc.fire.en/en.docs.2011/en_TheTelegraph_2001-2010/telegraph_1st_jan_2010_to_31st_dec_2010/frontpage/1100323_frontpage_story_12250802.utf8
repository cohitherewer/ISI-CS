          OUR BUREAU                            Tharoor and (above) Jaitley                                 
	March 22: The love of cricket and Kerala runs so deep in Shashi Tharoor that he reached out across the aisle and sought Arun Jaitleys informal advice on the IPL auction process.        
	Sources said the Congress minister and the BJP leader were in touch with each other in the run-up to the IPL race in which Rendezvous Sports World, a consortium blessed by Tharoor, won the Kochi franchise.        
	As a Delhi cricket official, Jaitely, who is also a lawyer, is familiar with the nitty-gritty of cricket administration.        
	Tharoor is also passionate about cricket, recently co-authoring Shadows Across the Playing Field: 60 Years of India-Pakistan Cricket with former Pakistan foreign secretary Shaharyar Khan. As minister of state, Tharoor also revived the external affairs ministrys cricket team, which he captains now.        
	The sources added that Rendezvous won the bid on its own steam and Tharoors role did not give it any undue advantage. The consortium won it fair and square. The amount ($333.33 million) the consortium quoted was way above most of the others. The bidding process was transparent and that is why the rates went through the roof, a source said.        
	Considering the political sensitivities involved, both Jaitely and an aide to Tharoor denied they ever discussed the IPL.        
	He did not ask me. Nobody approached me on his behalf. It will be factually false if I claim so. He is a very good friend of mine and I knew he was speaking to various people but I was certainly not one of them, Jaitley said over the phone from Ahmedabad.        
	The Tharoor aide said there was no reason why the minister should have sounded out Jaitley for help. He could have spoken to Lalit Modi or Sharad Pawar or Shah Rukh Khan. I categorically state he did not speak to Jaitley on this issue, said the aide.        
	Tharoor was instrumental in bringing together the investors who wished to float an IPL team. He played friend, philosopher and guide to help them bid for a team from Kerala, the aide added.        
	By a curious coincidence, Kerala had earlier, too, played a part in facilitating a conversation across another political divide. CPM leader Brinda Karat had once met Jaitley to discuss the legal points of a case involving Kerala party secretary Pinarayi Vijayan.

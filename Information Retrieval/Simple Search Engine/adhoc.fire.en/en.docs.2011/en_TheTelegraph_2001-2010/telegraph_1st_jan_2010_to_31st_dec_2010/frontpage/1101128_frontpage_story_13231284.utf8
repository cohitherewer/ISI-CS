The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Warning and apology before whistle blows
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Warning and apology before whistle blows
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 27: US officials in Washington and New Delhi have spent the past 48 hours apologising in advance for any uncharitable words they fear some of their own may have used against Indians that are about to be leaked.        
	Whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks has threatened to release, in the next few days, classified US documents that may harm Washingtons interests, embarrass its friends, and create tension between them.        
	No one yet knows what exactly will be leaked but the Americans have reason to worry. Papers declassified a few years ago had shown US President Richard Nixon referring to Indira Gandhi as an old witch during the Bangladesh war, and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, observing: The Indians are bastards, anyway.        
	Indian officials, though, are worried less about insults and more about whether WikiLeaks might expose the intelligence practices and personnel that New Delhi employs to secure its interests in the region, particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan.        
	Sources said the Americans were now privy to these practices because of closer counter-terrorism cooperation with India and that, via them, these details may have landed in the hands of WikiLeaks.        
	The website says the size of the next release will be seven times the 400,000 Iraq-Afghanistan war logs it published last month, deeply embarrassing Washington.        
	In Delhi, some recalled the April 2003 leak of a US study on military relations with India, but said the WikiLeaks documents may have more serious implications for Indias security.        
	The 2003 study, based on interviews with 40-odd US policy makers, described Indian bureaucrats and generals as people who could be easily slighted or insulted, were difficult to work with, and were obsessed with history rather than the future. One commentator said Indians cannot think strategically.        
	The interviewees criticised Indians obsession with protocol, and the countrys rigid and centralised bureaucracy that was inimical to individual decision-making.        
	In 2003, New Delhi had not reacted to the report probably keeping the balance of power in mind, but the situation may have changed a little since then. Agencies quoted US state department spokesperson P.J. Crowley as saying: We have reached out to India to warn them about a possible release of documents.        
	The Americans can only draw hope from another set of declassified records that showed Kissinger saying about Indira, five years after the 1971 war, that I wish we had a man as strong as she in our cabinet.

  - Laws have done little to check influx of illegal migrants in Assam                                         
	The condition of Assam and her people is indeed sorry in many respects. It is a part of contemporary history that, under the leadership of All Assam Students Union and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad, the six-year Assam Movement over the foreign nationals issue came to an end with the signing of the Assam Accord (Memorandum of Settlement) on August 15, 1985.        
	 The Centre and the government of Assam signed the accord with representatives of AASU and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad in the presence of then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.         
	However, the stark truth is that the Assam Accord awaits implementation in essential particulars even after a quarter of a century.         
	Clause 15 of the Accord states that the ministry of home affairs would be the nodal ministry for implementation of several clauses of the memorandum of settlement.         
	 Clause 6 of the Assam Accord says: Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.         
	But throughout these years, not even a little finger was raised in favour of a constitutional amendment without which the desires and aspirations of indigenous people of many ethnic communities and tribal people having distinctive personalities cannot be fulfilled.         
	Lack of political will had done the trick, and this phenomenon of vote bank politics touched parties of different political complexion.                                                                           
	A Kalakshetra can hardly be a substitute for constitutional and other guarantees to protect, preserve and promote the identity of the Assamese people. The expression Assamese people includes different ethnic communities and indigenous tribal people forming Assams composite culture.         
	The Assam Movement was conducted not merely for the establishment of a refinery here or institutions of higher learning there, despite their acknowledged importance. The six-year-long movement was mainly directed at resolving the foreign nationals issue, which threatened the identity of the people of Assam in view of the unabated influx, principally from Bangladesh. That a quarter of a century should elapse without implementation of the basics of the Assam Accord is not only patently undemocratic but also completely irrational.         
	Clause 5.8 of the Assam Accord said: Foreigners who came to Assam on or after March 25, 1971, shall continue to be detected, deleted and expelled in accordance with law. Immediate and practical steps shall be taken to expel such foreigners. Thus, migrants up to March 24, 1971 have come to be accepted as part of the population of Assam and some two million people of different origins have been added to Assams population in the interest of socio-political harmony.         
	This was a decided contribution of the Assam Movement and a remarkable harmonising factor. It came to be accepted by all sections of people and political parties, including those who were opposed to the very rationale of the Assam Movement aimed at expulsion of proven foreign nationals. Under the clause, on and from March 25, 1971, all foreigners illegally settling in Assam are liable to be expelled. But precious little could be done in this regard because of the IM(DT) Act, which proved to be a stumbling block for expelling foreign nationals.         
	After a long legal fight, the Supreme Court on July 12, 2005, ultimately declared provisions of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983, and the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Rules, 1984, to be ultra vires the Constitution of India and struck these down. The respondents were directed to constitute sufficient number of Tribunals under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, to effectively deal with cases of foreigners who have illegally come from Bangladesh or illegally residing in India.         
	The Supreme Court verdict was widely welcomed in Assam. Certain sections that have long nursed the mistaken ideas that IM(DT) was a protective mechanism for religious and linguistic minorities of Assam demurred after the judgment. Petitions and counter-petitions were filed in the Supreme Court. However, the court declined to detract from its verdict. Therefore, there remained a single law in the country to deal with foreigners, that is the Foreigners Act, 1946.         
	Now the government was obliged to act on them while dealing with foreigners in terms of clause 5.8 of the Assam Accord. The verdict inter alia noted: (1) The IM(DT) Act has been so enacted and rules there under have been so made that innumerable and insurmountable difficulties are created in the matter of identification and deportation of illegal migrants. Though inquiries were initiated into 310,759 cases under the IM(DT) Act, only 10,015 people were declared illegal and migrants and finally only 1,481 illegal migrants were physically expelled upto April 30, 2000. (2) This was less than half per cent of the cases initiated. In West Bengal, where the Foreigners Act is applicable, 489,046 persons were actually deported between 1983 and November 1998 and even this result was termed as unsatisfactory in the counter affidavit filed by the Union of India. (3) Thus, there cannot be a slightest doubt that the application of the IM(DT) Act and the rules made thereunder in Assam has created the biggest hurdle and is the main impediment or barrier in identification and deportation of illegal migrants.         
	But woe betides the people of Assam even after repeal of the IM(DT) Act. Official duplicity and vote bank politics saw to it that the deportation process is reduced to a farce. Almost 25 years after the Accord, on August 5, Justice B.K. Sharma of Gauhati High Court reportedly observed while dealing with a writ petition filed by a deported Bangladeshi national that the entire machinery, including the Foreigners Tribunals, is a mere mockery and no useful purpose has been served. How long will the people of Assam have to face the sword of Damocles in the shape of illegal migrants from Bangladesh?         
	Following the renewal of the Assam Accord at the Prime Ministers level with the participation of Assams chief ministers and AASU representatives (May 5, 2005), the NRC should have been updated by September 2007. This was not done. After another tripartite agreement, pilot projects for NRC updating hopefully began recently at Barpeta and Chaygaon revenue circles. Violence marred the process at Barpeta because of communalising the situation by vested interests, possibly in cahoots with sections of the administration. Assams cabinet sub-committee cannot override the agreed modalities of the tripartite meetings. The NRC update ought to be completed throughout the state well ahead of the 2011 elections.         
	Legitimate and justified ethnic assertiveness assumed unprecedented proportions following the failure of the Centre to implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord. There is an emergent need to fulfil Clause 6 of the Accord as also Clause 7 in terms of implementation of L.C. Jain committees report on economic development.         
	 Let the Accord be implemented in letter and spirit even now. Let it be a time-honoured fulfilment respecting a quarter of a century.

	Fewer puja organisers have violated the high court norms compared with last year, said police and fire services officers after finishing their pandal inspection along with CMC and CESC officials on Tuesday.         
	We had to file FIRs against three big pujas and send notices to about 40 pujas last year. This year, not a single major violation has been recorded so far. This is a first in recent memory, said Bibhas Guha, the deputy director of fire and emergency services department.        
	The inspection team, led by joint commissioner Jawed Shamim and deputy commissioner (south) Supratim Sarkar, visited Suruchi Sangha, Mudiali Club, Badamtala Ashar Sangha, 66 Pally, Babubagan, Jodhpur Park, Ekdalia Evergreen, Park Circus and Singhi Park on Tuesday morning.        
	We made some suggestions to some of the puja committees. The north and central Calcutta pujas we inspected on Monday are also obeying the court order, said Shamim.        
	The cops asked the Mudiali Club puja organisers to keep one of the four exits that lead to a narrow alley closed in the evening and at night.        
	The organisers of the Suruchi Sangha puja could not produce documents to prove that they had sprayed fire-retardant chemicals on the pandal. They came up with the documents in the evening.        
	We held meetings with the organisers six months before Puja and that has helped. Also, very few pujas out of the nearly 1,800 in the city are using inflammable materials, added Guha.        
	Immersion order: The high court on Tuesday approved the PCB guidelines for immersion of idols in the Hooghly after this years pujas.        
	A division bench of Justice P.C. Ghosh and Justice Shukla Kabir made it clear that 50 per cent of the cost of cleaning the river would have to be borne by the civic authorities concerned.        
	According to the guidelines, puja organisers will have to immerse the idols within the deadline set by police. The remains of the idols, straw, flowers and garbage have to be removed from the river within 24 hours.

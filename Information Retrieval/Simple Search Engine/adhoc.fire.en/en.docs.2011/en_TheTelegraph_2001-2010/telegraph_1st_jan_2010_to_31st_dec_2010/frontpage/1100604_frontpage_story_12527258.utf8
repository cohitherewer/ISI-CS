	New Delhi, June 3: With the exit of Shibu Soren, the Centre has decided to go all out against the Maoists in Jharkhand.         
	Governor M..H. Farook sent a firm signal to Maoist rebels today when after meeting Union home minister P. Chidambaram here, he said the operations against the rebels would continue.        
	Asked if the strategy would change, Farook said that would depend on the field officers. However, it was clear that the home ministry had made up its mind on adopting a tough stance. Chidambaram is likely to visit Ranchi on Saturday while CRPF director-general Vikram Srivastava will hold a co-ordination meeting with the state police tomorrow in Ranchi.         
	Jharkhand has six battalions of the CRPF to counter the problem that, the state claims, has affected 16 districts. More battalions may be dispatched to step up operations against the rebel outfits, sources said, although Farook refused to comment on the matter.         
	Jharkhand is politically the most volatile of the Maoist-affected states and has corridors for the extremists into Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Bengal. To make matters worse, political will has been lacking in the state to act against the Maoists.         
	Whereas Soren was soft on the Maoists, the Congress was seen to be tough with Chidambaram at the helm. Within a section of the Congress, however, there was a feeling that the offensive should not be as tough as the party tried to get rooted.         
	While two block presidents of the Congress were killed by Maoists, youth Congress leaders were threatened and a fortnight back, a local Congress leader, Hemant Bage, was killed by the rebels.         
	Earlier, the CPI(Maoist) had threatened Congress leaders and workers in Jharkhand to snap ties with the party or face consequences. The Maoists had also gunned down Dalbhumgarh block president of Congress, Gobardhan Mahali, in Ghatshila sub-division on March 30.         
	Even now, sources said, the Congress was facing a tough challenge as Youth Congress workers were shying away from coming into the open due to threats, sources said.         
	Meanwhile, Farook said appointment of advisers to the governor would take a few days. Who will be appointed as advisers would be significant as it would also indicate the tone of the Centres strategy in its fight against Maoists.        
	The CRPF, in the meantime, seems to have pulled up its socks for a fresh offensive in Jharkhand. Today, the force was in high spirits as Srivastava received a laudatory note from Bengal DGP Bhupinder Singh on the forces role in Bengal.

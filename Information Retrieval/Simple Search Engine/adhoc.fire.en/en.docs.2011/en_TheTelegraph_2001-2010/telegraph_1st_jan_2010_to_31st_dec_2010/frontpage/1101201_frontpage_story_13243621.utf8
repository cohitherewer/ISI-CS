  - Barca 5, Real 0: Why it was such a magnetic attraction          KEIR RADNEDGE                                              Barcelona rsquo;s David Villa celebrates a goal in the game against Real Madrid. Barcelona won 5-0. (AFP)		      
	Winning is one thing; winning in style is something else. The wish and the attainment are two different beasts  which is why Barcelonas five-goal mauling of Real Madrid last night set celebratory bells ringing around the football world.        
	This was not because Madrid are in any way a negative team. Quite the reverse: one of the reasons Madrid have been so comparatively unsuccessful in recent years both in Spain and in the Champions League has been that, for all their attacking talent, the defence was abandoned and often left far too vulnerable.        
	Also, Madrid have their own history of winning in glory and style ever since their explosive initial impact on British fans  of a certain age, now!  with the 7-3 thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt in the European Champions Cup final way back in 1960 at Hampden Park.        
	That was a different era. But it was also an era in which the forces of positive and negative football duelled for supremacy.        
	Three years later, Milan faced Benfica in the European Cup Final at Wembley and nullified the attacking bravura of Eusebio and Co by replacing goal-scoring winger Paolo Barison with destructive midfielder Gino Pivatelli. He crunched all over Benfica playmaker Mario Coluna to such an extent that Coluna, in the era before substitutes, was reduced to passenger status. Milan won 2-1.                                
	The next two years saw European club football commanded by neighbours Internazionale. Ruthless coach Helenio Herrera took the already ingrained defensive tactic of catenaccio and improved it with a tidy sweeper, highly athletic man-for-man marking and high-speed counter-attacks.        
	Ever since, international club football has witnessed the see-saw of good and evil. Celtic and Manchester United subsequently twisted back the balance before Milan struck back and then came the years of Dutch dominance through Feyenoord and the marvellous total football of Ajax.        
	And yet in the 1974 World Cup Final the total footballers allowed themselves to be defeated as much by their own complacency and arrogance as by the focus and undeniable talent of a West German side who made winning their priority in front of their own fans in Munichs Olympic stadium.        
	The past 36 years have brought equality of a sort. For every team winning through pragmatism  at club and/or country level  there have been teams winning in style; exponents of what Pele called the beautiful game.        
	The first World Cup finals to be shown worldwide in colour, in Mexico in 1970, is revered in hindsight as the pinnacle of the game in an era before the weight of commercial high finance began to burden the finest players and teams with the sheer weight of commercial responsibility  both on behalf of their clubs and of their own personal status.        
	That commercial expansion raced ahead in western Europe because of the strength of its social and economic structures and high standards of living and leisure-time cash compared with most of the rest of the world (North America excepted). This was why European commentators and fans so enjoyed watching televisions initial transmissions of the African Cup of Nations and of the Copa America.        
	Here were players displaying their talents with a flamboyance and freedom rarely seen in Europe where new fitness levels allied to greater tactic sophistication and the fear of defeat  challenging directors status, managers job security and players lucrative contracts  had tightened up the game.        
	Commercial rewards did not depend on style, only on result. A slalom past four defenders, a tricky backheel or a mazy dribble brought nothing in terms of match points and table placings. No wonder a new breed of managers, trainers and coaches devised strategies which ranked entertainment value at the bottom of the list.        
	Arthur Rowe, manager of Tottenhams push-and-run champions at the start of the 1950s, once said: Football is a simple game, its players who make it complicated.         
	That is no longer the case. These days Rowe, were he still alive, might replace the definition players with sponsors, TV moguls and agents.        
	All todays players and managers began playing the game as children, out of sheer enjoyment and exuberance. They learned to love the game and, for many, a loyalty to its core values remains at the heart and soul of their work.        
	A coach who holds the magic recipe for success with style enhances not only his own reputation but that of his club, of his countrys football and of the game itself. That was why Barcelonas thumping of Real Madrid was such a magnetic attraction. UK television, that same night and in the middle of the game, was also screening Panoramas documentary inquiring into Fifas finances. Its this writers assumption that fans who wanted to watch both would have watched the football and recorded Panorama for later viewing.        
	Football should always come first.        
	Fans who took that option saw Pep Guardiolas Barcelona at their most decisive, most determined and most beautifully effective.        
	Xavi Hernandez, Pedro, David Villa (two) and substitute Jeffren Suarez scored magnificent goals which prompted a question over why Spain  built around Barcelona  had won the World Cup in such negative fashion (a winners lowest-ever eight goals in seven games) in South Africa only a matter of a few months back.        
	Spains World Cup win will live on only courtesy of the dust-gathering history books; but Barcelonas brilliance will live on in the memory of those who saw it.        
	Who would anyone (except, perhaps, Jose Mourinho and his president Florentina Perez) prefer to watch next time out?

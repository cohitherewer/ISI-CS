          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 27: Faced with a CBI probe into the alleged misuse of secret service funds, state police have gone back to the rule book to reinforce existing operating procedures and ensure that officers followed them in letter and spirit.        
	Today, the state iterated before Jharkhand High Court that it had no objection if the CBI was asked to probe the role of several senior officials, including former DGP V.D. Ram as well as former ADGP (special branch) Rajiv Kumar, who had allegedly misappropriated Rs 8.10 crore after making unauthorised withdrawals from the fund.         
	The affidavit, filed by home department deputy secretary Arvind Kumar, comes three days after chief secretary A.K. Singh filed a confidential report in the high court calling for an inquiry by an independent agency into the alleged funds fraud.        
	The image of the police, admitted high level sources in the force, has taken a beating ever since allegations of embezzlement of secret service funds by senior police officers surfaced. So it was necessary to put the existing rules together and ensure that police officers follow it in letter and spirit, said a senior officer requesting anonymity.         
	DGP Neyaz Ahmad said a foolproof system to prevent misuse of secret service funds is in place. We have to put them together and follow the rules in letter and spirit, he maintained.         
	ADGP (special branch) Ashok Kumar Sinha, who is the drawing and disbursing officer for the fund, said the matter was an an internal issue but admitted he was trying to improve the general administration of the special branch.        
	Significantly, the chief secretarys report submitted to court had also questioned Rajiv Kumars role in utilising secret service funds of Rs 4.50 crore allotted in 2007-08.         
	According to the report, Rajiv Kumar, presently on Central deputation, drew an amount of Rs 2.50 crore in March, 2008. Kumar claimed to have given an amount of Rs 1,39,28,000 to special branch for which no details were available. This is not clear for what purpose the amount was spent. When asked by the home secretary, Kumar said that all vouchers and registers pertaining to disbursement of this amount have been destroyed, the report pointed out.         
	An amount of Rs 1,24, 97,556 and Rs 25,00,000 was claimed to have been paid to M/s Komlab Dezign Pvt Ltd for the purchase of a device meant to intercept and analyse phone calls.         
	This device is available and working but stock entry and payment details are not available with the special branch, the report said.         
	When the chief secretary asked Kumar why the expense under the fund wasnt certified by then chief secretary A K Basu, Kumar said he was not aware of such a provision.         
	He claims ignorance of the provisions of the certification report by the then chief secretary as a cover for his inaction, A. K. Singhs report pointed out.         
	In his affidavit to court today, home department deputy secretary Arvind Kumar clarified that enquiry may be done by an independent agency like the CBI.         
	However, he requested the court to keep matters under cover to ensure that the identity of the several police informers, who may have received money under the secret fund, wasnt compromised.        
	The case is scheduled to be heard tomorrow.

  - New York foundation collects funds at awards event not attended by PM           K.P. NAYAR                      Ambassador Meera Shankar receives the award on behalf of the Prime Minister from Rabbi Arthur Schneier, the president and founder of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, in New York on Tuesday. (AP)                                
	New York, Sept. 22: An organisation in New York has collected at least $1.25 million in the name of an award for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by hosting a dinner here last night on the pretext that Singh would attend the event and personally receive the award.        
	The Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an organisation claiming to promote religious freedom, human rights, tolerance and interfaith dialogue, sold tables for the dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Grand Ballroom with tax deductible contributions of up to $100,000 per table.        
	The foundations World Statesman Award was received on behalf of Singh by Indias ambassador to the US, Meera Shankar, who told the audience that the Prime Minister profoundly believes in your mission.        
	It has been known for at least six months that the Prime Minister would not be in New York in September to attend the 65th UN General Assembly. External affairs minister S.M. Krishna is leading the Indian delegation and will take part in the Assemblys opening General Debate this week.        
	However, The Telegraph received a letter from the foundation in the first week of September soliciting a contribution and making an offer to make this correspondent a Co-Chair for the dinner at $100,000 (Patrons table), Executive Co-Chair at $50,000 (Benefactor table) or a Vice-Chair at $25,000 (Ambassador table).        
	The letter added that any contribution is much appreciated and will be recognised in the honor roll/printed program.        
	As recently as the beginning of last week, this correspondent contacted David Rosenstock who was selling the tables on behalf of the foundation and asked whether the Prime Minister would be present at last nights dinner.        
	He replied: As of now, yes. He will sit at the head table and make an acceptance speech.        
	Rosenstock added before ending the conversation that you know, being a head of government, he has many commitments.        
	Rosenstock said his company, Lorelei Enterprises, one of New Yorks event management companies, was acting as the benefit office for the dinner in honour of the Prime Minister.        
	Teresa Connor of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation told The Telegraph that the Indian embassy in Washington had been working with us from day one to make the dinner a grand success.        
	But it was only on Friday that she revealed that the Prime Minister would not attend and that Indias ambassador in Washington would receive the award in the name of Singh.        
	When this correspondent asked more questions, Connor referred further enquiries to a media relations company here, Rubenstein Associates, which put out a media release on Monday which screamed on top REVISED seven times.        
	The revised programme announced that Meera Shankar would stand in for Singh and that the Prime Minister would instead deliver a pre-recorded video message.        
	Repeated requests with the Indian embassy in Washington since Friday to throw light on the missions role in the fundraising in Singhs name, its obvious support for the foundation and the entire potentially controversial episode did not elicit any comment.                    
	The embassy would not even acknowledge that the ambassador would receive the award even after a media release was put out on behalf of the organisers of the fundraiser that she would do so.        
	A significant absentee at the dinner and award ceremony was the Indian consul general here, Prabhu Dayal, although the event was being held in his consular headquarters, New York. The consulate deputed two of its junior officials to accompany the ambassador to Waldorf Astoria.        
	In an eight-minute video address recorded earlier and sent from New Delhi, the Prime Minister told the dinner audience that for him, it was a great honour to receive this prestigious award.        
	He expressed appreciation for the foundations work without going into any specifics. The rest of the address was devoted to conditions in India and Indo-US relations.        
	In the light of the embassys complete silence about its role in the event, it could not be determined if the mission had told the Prime Ministers Office that a huge amount of money was being raised here in his name.        
	Veteran diplomats said it was unprecedented for organisations to cash in on an Indian Prime Ministers presence, more so when it was known that he would not attend the event.        
	A Chinese lady representing a Beijing organisation, who was at the dinner, but refused to give her name, said she came to know only one hour before the award ceremony that the Prime Minister would not be present.        
	Asked about her interest in attending the event, she said many influential New York Jews were associated with the foundation and that it gave her access to the Jewish lobby here.        
	The foundation is associated with prestigious and powerful people not only in the US but across the world.        
	For instance, Israeli President Shimon Peres dropped in briefly at last nights dinner and made some remarks in praise of Singh. Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a holocaust survivor who set up the foundation in 1965, said Peres had suo motu dropped in when he heard the event was taking place.        
	Similarly, the former US secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, who introduced the Prime Minister in absentia to the audience last night, is a former recipient of the World Statesman Award.        
	French President Nicolas Sarkozy, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazils President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva are all past recipients of the award, but it could not be determined immediately if the foundation similarly raised money in their names.        
	Representatives of several companies at the 64 tables last night said they paid for the dinner only to see Singh and hear him in person largely because of their business interests in India, although there were two other awardees, both from the corporate world.

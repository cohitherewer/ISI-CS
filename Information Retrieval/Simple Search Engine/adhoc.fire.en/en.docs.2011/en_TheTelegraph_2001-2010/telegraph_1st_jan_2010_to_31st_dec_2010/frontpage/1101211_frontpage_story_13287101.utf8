          AMIT ROY              LONDON
            Prince Charles and Camilla react as their car is attacked by protesters in London on Thursday. (AP)                                 
	London, Dec. 10: The thousands of Indians who come to London on holiday and shop in the West End will know the precise location in Regent Street where a mob protesting against student fees last night attacked the Rolls-Royce carrying Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.        
	The huge customised Rolls had come down Piccadilly and had turned round Piccadilly Circus, where tourists traditionally gather to take photographs, into Regent Street, one of the busiest junctions in London.        
	Charles and Camilla probably were in no real danger but the heir to the throne was protective of his wife, pushing her down on the floor and placing an arm over her.        
	The Rolls was kicked, the back window shattered and white paint daubed on the immaculately polished surface of the limousine.        
	The incident was an almighty shock to the collective British consciousness as the British royals expect to be loved, not set upon by their subjects, especially students.        
	The photograph of a visibly frightened Camilla will now be a defining image of the state of relations between the establishment and a section of the British people.        
	Charles and Camilla had left their home, Clarence House, next to St Jamess Palace, at 7.10pm and were on their way to a Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium.        
	They got there 10 minutes later but it must have been 10 terrifying minutes for a royal couple who are more used to being received with deep bows and flowers everywhere they go.        
	Adnan Nazir, 23, was among the first to recognise the royal couple. I said, Its Camilla! I wasnt trying to alert them (the protesters). I was just surprised to see her, he said later.         
	Up to 20 protesters then attacked the vehicle with fists, boots and bottles, chanting Off with their heads! and Tory scum!        
	Charles and Camilla arrived at their destination looking both shaken and stirred. They returned home in a police van.        
	The Metropolitan Police commissioner, Paul Stephenson, denied the police had made a huge mistake by allowing the car to enter Regent Street and brave the waiting mob.        
	He disclosed that armed police officers were close by and hinted, in a somewhat sinister sentence, that had it come to it, the protesters could have been shot dead.        
	He put this in code by telling the BBC: I do think that the officers who were protecting their Royal Highnesses showed real restraint  some of those officers were armed.

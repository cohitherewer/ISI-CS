          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 2: Chief minister Arjun Munda will embark on a four-day tour of the state from December 5 to assess peoples expectations and launch a slew of development and road projects in the Santhal Pargana region.        
	I will be using the road to assess existing road conditions and try to gauge the basic needs and expectations of the people. It wont be possible if I use an aircraft, he told The Telegraph about his short yatra scheduled to begin from Jamshedpur        
	It will also give me an opportunity to evaluate development initiatives taken by the government. It will be a kind of social audit too, he said.        
	On December 7, the chief minister will be laying the foundation of the Rs 1,100-crore Govindpur-Sahebganj road, to be constructed in Dumka with financial assistance of Asian Development Bank.        
	Last month, the state cabinet cleared the decks for constructing a bridge over the Ganges in Sahebganj, modifying the plan from build-own and transfer (BOT) to design-build-finance-operate and transfer basis. But several formalities have to be completed before laying the foundation stone, Munda added.        
	The chief minister, who holds charge of road construction as well as power, believes that laying good roads would not only refurbish his image but also that of the state that has seen no development on the ground because of political instability.         
	Munda also spoke of a plan to declare the holy city of Deoghar as the states first solar city by installing special lights to prevent incidences of electrocution that often happen during the rush of pilgrims in the month of Shravan.         
	In the first phase, we will be installing solar-powered street lights from Jasidih to the Lord Shiva Temple. Worth Rs 7 crore, funds will come from the state, Union ministry of non-conventional energy and MP area development fund, he said.        
	Besides, Munda will lay the foundation of a sports complex to be built at an estimated cost of Rs 14.72 crore and a 6km ring road from Satsang Chowk to the temple at a cost of Rs 50 crore also in Deoghar.        
	He will also launch the Ajay barrage irrigation project, construction of which started in 1960s.         
	My focus is on bijli, sadak, and pani, he maintained.        
	The chief minister clarified that the model code of conduct enforced in the state in view of the ongoing panchayat elections, would not be an impediment to launching these projects.        
	We are not touching projects where elections are to be held. Moreover, most of these projects are in urban areas where the elections are not being held, he pointed out.        
	The election code for panchayat does not ban the launch or inauguration of development and welfare schemes. However, these are not allowed in rural constituencies where elections are to be held.        
	Also, there is no bar on executing central, state sponsored new and old projects.

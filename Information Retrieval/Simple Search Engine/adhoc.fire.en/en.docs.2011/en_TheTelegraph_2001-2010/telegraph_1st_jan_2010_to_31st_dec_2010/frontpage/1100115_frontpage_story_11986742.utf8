The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Extremely critical, Basu on dialysis
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Extremely critical, Basu on dialysis
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Jan. 14: Jyoti Basus condition turned extremely critical today, forcing doctors to put him on dialysis and augment the support system for his lungs, cardiovascular system and central nervous system.         
	The doctors, who had been postponing dialysis for the past few days because of Basus age (95), decided to go ahead as he suffered a renal failure.         
	The doctors had initially planned to continue the dialysis, which started around 6.30pm, for four hours but they later more or less halved the duration.        
	Given his age and present health condition, it was difficult for him to sustain the process for more than two hours. Tomorrow, we have plans for another two hours of dialysis, a doctor said.         
	Toxic products such as creatinine, urea and free water are sucked out from the blood through dialysis when the kidneys stop functioning.         
	Although some of Basus vital parameters, like blood pressure and pulse rate, improved after the first round of dialysis, the doctors said the former chief minister continued to remain extremely critical. The doctors were to meet again late tonight to assess the situation.        
	He is having multi-organ dysfunction. Besides renal failure, his cardiac functioning has severely deteriorated. We have strengthened the support systems to keep his vital organs functioning but we need to monitor them at regular intervals, said one of the doctors. The functioning of his central nervous system had been impaired and three fresh bacterial infections have been detected in the tracheal suction tests, he said.         
	Till the completion of the first two hours of dialysis, Basus blood pressure fluctuated and despite increasing inotropes (pressure-stabilising drugs), the doctors found it difficult to keep the blood pressure steady.         
	According to a doctor, the heart was not pumping enough blood into the system, which had a cascading effect on the central nervous system and the kidneys.        
	Hospital sources said Basus condition started deteriorating since midnight as he started suffering from severe respiratory distress and his lung congestion intensified.         
	The kidneys and cardiac functions started deteriorating and he was running a very high temperature, a doctor said.         
	Around 1pm today, his condition deteriorated further as urine output went down significantly, indicating a renal failure. From 4.30pm to 6.30pm, there was no urine output and the blood pressure also fluctuated. Basu did not respond to any command as his drowsiness increased.         
	Dialysis was the only option left. The doctors created a temporary access for dialysis through a vein in his neck through which blood was sucked into the dialysis machine.         
	The machine works like a kidney and after the purification process, the purified blood is returned to the body through the vein, explained a doctor.         
	Adding to the complication was the detection of Escherichia coli, commonly known as E. coli, which causes urinary tract infection. Fresh tests of the bronchial suction also revealed the presence of new strains of acinetobacter and pseudomonas bacteria.        
	However, these infections were found in the suction taken out through the endotracheal tube. But all other parameters, which indicate existence of infection in the system, were normal. It seems these bacteria are colonised in the tube and there are chances of these getting into his lungs, explained one doctor.         
	According to him, the tube was installed through Basus trachea nine days ago and so there was every possibility of bacterial infection.

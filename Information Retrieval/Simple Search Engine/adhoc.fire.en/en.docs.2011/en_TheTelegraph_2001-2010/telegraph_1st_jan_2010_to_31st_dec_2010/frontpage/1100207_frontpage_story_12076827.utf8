          OUR BUREAU                      Narendra Modi and Pranab Mukherjee, who had a spat, shake hands at the meeting in Delhi on Saturday. (AFP)                                
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: The war on prices today became a war among politicians, compelling Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to play peacemaker.        
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee were locked in a running spat today at a conference of chief ministers and Union ministers convened by the Prime Minister to discuss ways to tackle soaring food prices.        
	Modi accused the Congress-led UPA of failing to deliver on its promise of foodgrain at Rs 3 a kilo to the poor, prompting Mukherjee to interrupt the chief minister and accuse him of politicising price rise, said sources who had access to the closed-door meeting.        
	But Modi said he was reminding the ruling coalition of its election promise and not politicising the issue. The two continued to spar. Mukherjee interrupted Modi at least thrice before Manmohan intervened, the sources said.         
	The Prime Minister said the Food Security Act provided for foodgrain at subsidised rates to the poor but the scheme could not be implemented immediately because of drought. He assured the participants, who included Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and railway minister Mamata Banerjee, that the government would provide cheap foodgrain to the poor after the impact of the drought eased.        
	Independent analysts agreed with the Prime Minister on the impact of the drought but pointed out that the country was paying the price for not providing irrigation facilities to more than half the fields.         
	Besides, fundamental problems such as poor railroads and highways make it tough to transport food during a crisis, leading to shortages and higher prices in many cities, they added.        
	Modi kept hammering at the Centre, saying the UPA-ruled states had failed to act against hoarders and that 83 per cent of raids on hoarders were carried out by non-UPA and primarily NDA-ruled states.         
	The sources said the Rajasthan chief minister and Congress leader, Ashok Gehlot, then wondered aloud: Where is the NDA today?        
	Modi, who at one point shook hands with Mukherjee, later defended his speech but added that he would not attend such meetings in the future if he was not allowed to speak.        
	The spat overshadowed the meeting so much that some BJP leaders interpreted the Gujarat chief ministers attack on the Centre as an attempt to project himself as the only Opposition leader capable of taking on the UPA and a reminder that when the time came, he could move to the national stage.        
	A BJP leader said it was also Modis way of reminding the party leadership of its failure to capitalise on inflation, which affects all sections.        
	But sources in the PMO said none of the other four chief ministers from BJP-ruled states supported Modi during or after the spat.        
	The conference concluded by agreeing to form a core committee of chief ministers and the central ministers concerned to deliberate on measures to increase agricultural production and improve delivery systems. Bhattacharjee and Modi are among the members of the panel.

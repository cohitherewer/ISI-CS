	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Even low alcohol levels rated as safe for driving can seriously impair the ability of people in their 60s to avoid obstacles while walking and may explain stumbling and falls after just two drinks.         
	European researchers who conducted a study to determine how alcohol influences responses to abrupt gait disturbances have found that only two drinks of vodka can cause people in their 60s to fail obstacle-avoidance tests.         
	Their chance of hitting obstacles while walking increased as their blood alcohol concentrations climbed to levels below 0.05 per cent or 0.08 per cent  the legal limits for driving after alcohol consumption.         
	We had not expected such large effects, said Jacques Duysens, a professor of rehabilitation sciences and biomedical researcher in Belgium and a member of the study team which has published its findings in the journal BMC Research Notes.         
	Falls even after low to moderate alcohol consumption may be because of inadequate, late and small reactions while avoiding obstacles, Duysens told The Telegraph.         
	One take-home lesson from the study, Duysens said, is the practice followed by some pubs in England that provide slippers to their customers to go home safely after a few drinks too many.         
	Earlier research had indicated that most falls were because of either stumbling or tripping. The key muscle that responds in such disturbances in gait is the biceps femoris  the muscle in the back thigh.         
	The earlier studies had shown that in older adults, this muscle has a shorter response time and shorter response amplitude  the muscles react slower and the dimensions of their movements are smaller.         
	The new study by Duysens and his colleagues at the Sint Maartenskliniek, a research institution in The Netherlands, suggests that the delay and decrease in the muscles response is because of changes in the central nervous system brought about by alcohol.         
	The pathways used in avoidance reactions are altered by alcohol consumption, the researchers said.         
	In the study, 13 volunteers above the age of 60 were given low levels of alcohol that raised their blood alcohol concentrations up to 0.6 per cent and asked to walk on a treadmill. They were challenged with obstacles posed to their left feet.         
	We found that alcohol levels considered safe for driving seriously hampered the ability to avoid obstacles, said Judith Hegeman, a team member at the Sint Maartenskliniek.         
	The study is part of an effort to identify the disturbances caused by alcohol in the neurochemical pathways in the brain involved in obstacle avoidance.         
	A major limitation of the study was its small sample number  only 13 volunteers. But, Hegeman said, the results were unequivocal.

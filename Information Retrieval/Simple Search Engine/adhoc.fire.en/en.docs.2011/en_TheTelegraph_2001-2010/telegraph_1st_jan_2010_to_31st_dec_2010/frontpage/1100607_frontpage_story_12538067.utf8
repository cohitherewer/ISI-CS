          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, June 6: The government has written to the Chief Justice of India that it wants back the primacy it enjoyed in judges appointments.        
	The executive had the final say in the appointment of high court and Supreme Court judges till 1993, when a controversial apex court judgment handed over that prerogative to a collegium headed by the Chief Justice of India.        
	The government has now been emboldened by the public disillusionment at the non-transparent way judges are appointed by fellow judges, the process being widely blamed for the corruption charges facing the judiciary.        
	Two months ago, the law ministry had written to the then Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, seeking his opinion on the proposal to let the executive have the final word on judges appointments.        
	A response is awaited, a ministry source said, adding this could take time because of the change of guard in the apex court. Justice Balakrishnan has retired and Justice S.H. Kapadia has taken over.        
	If the court rejects the proposal, the government might bring in a law to wrest back primacy in judges appointments, ministry sources said.        
	Currently, a collegium made up by the Chief Justice of India and the four other senior-most Supreme Court judges initiates the appointment process. Technically, the governments role is restricted to running a security or background check on the candidates finalised by the collegium.        
	Once a name is sent to the Centre, it can only return the name to the collegium for reconsideration. If the collegium sends the name back, the government has to accept it.        
	Before 1993, however, the apex court had itself ruled that although the Constitution directs the executive to consult the judiciary over judges appointments, its concurrence is not necessary.        
	In what is known as the first judges case of 1982, the court ruled that the government could override the opinion of the functionaries required to be consulted  that is, the Chief Justice of India.        
	But in 1993, the apex court interpreted consultation as concurrence and declared that a collegium of three senior-most judges and the Chief Justice would have primacy in judicial appointments and transfers. Its decisions would be binding on the executive.        
	Another judgment in 1998 enlarged the collegium to include the Chief Justice and the four other senior-most judges.        
	Balakrishnan later defended judicial supremacy in appointments as necessary on account of undue interference by (the) executive in judicial appointments in the past. He cited how three judges were superseded in 1973 and how judicial independence faced a threat during the Emergency.

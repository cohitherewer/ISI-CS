The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Green panel push for lead-free colours
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Green panel push for lead-free colours
          JAYANTA BASU                            An idol being painted at Kumartuli                                  
	A committee set up by the environment department has recommended that a significant amount of lead-free paints be provided free to idol makers this year to wean them off toxic colours.        
	The panel  headed by Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer in the environment department  will also appeal to puja organisers to avoid lead-rich colours and urge award committees to make the use of non-toxic paints a selection criterion.        
	The department will hold a workshop in Kumartuli in the last week of July to create awareness about the dangers of using traditional paints. Durga puja starts from October 14.        
	Our committee has been rooting the use of lead-free colours since 2008. Around 30 idols were painted with non- toxic colours in 2009. This year we want to provide significant amount of lead-free paints to idol-makers free in an attempt to popularise their use, said Mukherjee.        
	Kumartuli artisans have welcomed the move with a rider. Lead-free paints lend the same lustre to idols as traditional ones. But they increase the cost of an idol by Rs 500 on an average. Availability, too, is an issue, said Babu Pal, of Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity.        
	An additional cost of Rs 500 will not deter even smaller pujas from getting their idols painted with lead-free colours, said Debasish Kumar, a mayoral council member in the civic board and the mainstay of Tridhara Sammilani puja, off Rashbehari Avenue, that won Five Star in CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja award last year.        
	Availability is the real issue. If lead-free paints can be easily obtained, then the government should make their use mandatory.        
	Krishnajyoti Goswami, a biochemist and member of the environment departments committee, feels lack of awareness is the main problem. Idols makers are unaware that non-toxic colours are available in paint shops near Kumartuli.        
	Studies by the central and state pollution control boards have shown that the presence of toxic elements, such as lead, in traditional paints far exceeds the limit. These elements are released in the Hooghly during immersion. The water from the river reaches our home after treatment, which experts say is not foolproof in removing the toxic elements.

	April 17: Ticket holders worldwide, beware. That violinist onstage this weekend may be tired out by a 14-hour drive. That pianist may not be the one you expected to see. The concert hall doors may even be locked because of a cancellation.        
	Travel disruptions from Europes volcanic ash problem have brought a heavy measure of turmoil to the classical music world. More than in many other fields, its practitioners  conductors, singers, pianists and other instrumentalists  depend on plane flights. Opera casts are increasingly international.         
	Concert promoters, especially in the US, place a heavy premium on foreign talent. After all, where does jet set fit better than adjacent to conductor?        
	But opera houses and concert halls are also well accustomed to personnel changes, given the frequency of illnesses and injuries that can afflict the bodies inhabited by musical artists. So to the phones they went yesterday.        
	Carnegie Hall suffered an immediate casualty. The work of Louis Andriessen, the most prominent living composer from the Netherlands and a major figure in European music, was to have been featured in a concert at Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall tonight. But the performers could not arrive.         
	The pianist Gerard Bouwhuis was stuck in Amsterdam, Carnegie said.        
	The Bang on a Can All-Stars could not get out of Germany, where they were on tour, according to the groups executive director, Kenny Savelson. The All-Stars were to have given the American premiere of Andriessens new work Life.        
	Theyre sitting in a hotel in Frankfurt, Savelson said. No one really knows when the airports are going to reopen. At the very least, theyre in a very cosmopolitan environment there. Maybe thats a positive thing for the weekend.        
	Andriessen is composer in residence this season at Carnegie and is the focus of nine concerts. Carnegie said people could exchange tickets for that cancelled show for other Andriessen events.        
	The havoc affected the famous and the little known alike.         
	The young Finnish pianist Juho Pohjonen, who was to leave Helsinki, Finland, for a recital tomorrow in Vancouver, British Columbia, could not depart, and the more prominent Leif Ove Andsnes, who had an engagement to play Rachmaninoffs Piano Concerto No. 4 with the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra today, was stuck in Norway.

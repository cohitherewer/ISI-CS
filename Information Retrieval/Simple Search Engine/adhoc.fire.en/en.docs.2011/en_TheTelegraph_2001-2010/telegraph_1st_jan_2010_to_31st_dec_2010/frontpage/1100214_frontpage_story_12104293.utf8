          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            (Top) Nitin Gadkari; RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 13: Big brother RSS is keeping an eye on its errant offspring.        
	The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today did something it has never done  it sent someone to check how preparations were going on for the February 17-20 BJP national council in Indore.        
	The Sangh asked joint general secretary Suresh Soni, who occasionally doubles as the interface with the BJP, to see how things were shaping up on a 90-acre sprawl outside the city that would be home to some 5,000 party delegates the next few days.        
	The delegates will welcome new chief Nitin Gadkari and witness the passing of the baton from the old guard.        
	While the Sangh routinely nominates a functionary to observe and report on council sessions, it has never bothered with the preparations. Soniji checked each and every detail, said a Madhya Pradesh MP of RSS provenance.        
	Those in the BJP who had thought the Sanghs role would end with Gadkaris anointment admitted that the big brother would stare unblinkingly at what a party official called its errant political progeny.        
	Which means, BJP delegates had better not expect the seven-star fare the late Pramod Mahajan had dished out at a national executive in Mumbai in 2004 or the lavish meals served up by party chief ministers on such occasions.        
	Party insiders said every delegate  from L.K. Advani and Gadkari downwards  was resigned to a stay in tents and a Spartan diet of vegetarian food. Not that this is the first time tents are being used, though leaders like Jaswant Singh and Yashwant Sinha have, in the past, been excused from staying in them for personal convenience.        
	Convenience and comfort are words that the RSS has banished from our dictionary, cribbed a BJP MP.         
	Another recalled Sarojini Naidus famous remark about the costs entailed to keep Mahatma Gandhi in poverty and wondered how much poorer the Madhya Pradesh government would be after the four-day austerity binge.        
	The only concessions are 25 A-listers, including security-padded leaders like Advani, Narendra Modi and Murli Manohar Joshi, would live in single-room tents with attached bathrooms. For the rest, there will be four-bedded shelters and a common washroom.         
	The choice of names for the venues for the various sessions is also not coincidental. The campus has been christened Kushabhau Thakre Nagar after a former chief who continued to live in a sparsely furnished room in the BJP headquarters till the last and used an air-conditioner only on medical advice.        
	But the RSS is not only concerned with symbolism.         
	Aware of the dwindling returns of Hindutva card, the three resolutions the council is expected to debate and adopt will be on price rise, security and climate change.        
	BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who briefed the media today, said: Politics for development is Gadkaris main mantra. There will not be much focus on ideological issues.         
	The security resolution will be confined to the UPA governments declining control over Jammu and Kashmir and the resumption of dialogue with Pakistan with the underpinning that Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs strategic moves were governed by external pressure.

	Ranchi, June 6: A reluctant BJP nominated former MP Ajay Maroo for the Upper House on a day the Congress bought peace with Babulal Marandi-led JVM by promising that it would have no truck with JMM, nor would it try to form an alternative government.        
	The two parties decided to form a co-ordination committee with Marandi as chairman and a senior Congress leader as convener to take crucial decisions.        
	On his part, Marandi agreed to support Congress Rajya Sabha nominee Dheeraj Prasad Sahu, with the new arrangement indicating that the former chief minister would be at the helm of affairs as far as the Congress-JVM coalition was concerned in the event of mid-term elections.         
	Both Maroo and Sahu will file their nominations tomorrow.        
	The Congress was forced into climbdown mode after Marandi strongly opposed the grand old partys decision to announce Sahus renomination for the Rajya Sabha and threatened to field his own nominee.         
	Marandis stand sent the Congress leaders into a tizzy, forcing the partys Jharkhand in-charge, K. Keshav Rao, to rush here and persuade Marandi not to break out of the coalition.        
	He attributed the unilateral decision to lack of communication between the two allies.        
	During a meeting with Marandi, Rao is understood to have pleaded that it was difficult for the Congress to withdraw its nominee as the party desperately needed the numbers in the Rajya Sabha.         
	Marandi used the Congress compulsion as an opportunity to bargain for early Assembly elections in the state.        
	According to sources, Marandi was also upset with the Congress for hobnobbing with JMM in the recent past.         
	How is it that Congress leader Rajendra Singh was holding a series of meetings with Shibu Soren? Marandi reportedly asked Rao.         
	He was also displeased with Congress remaining silent when the JVM presented a memorandum to the governor, demanding dismissal of the Soren government.        
	According to sources, Marandi extracted a commitment from the Congress leaders that the Assembly would be dissolved by June 30. Otherwise, he threatened that his party would embark on an agitation.         
	Marandis perception was that the BJPs stock had nosedived in the state, creating political space for both Congress and JVM to shore up their tally in the Assembly.         
	Later, Rao said Congress as well as JVM were on the same page ideologically and emotionally for a secular, honest and stable government.        
	We are not interested in forming the government. We are more interested in stopping the day-to-day drama, he maintained.        
	Marandi also played along, stating that all confusion had been cleared and that his party would support the Congress nominee. He said that JMM had fielded a cash-rich and an outsider candidate. It is our responsibility to ensure the JMM nominees defeat and send him packing from the state, he said.        
	Meanwhile, the 18-member BJP could take solace from the fact that Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto was upset with Sorens decision to field Alchemist Group chairman K.D. Singh. Mahto, who heads the five-member Ajsu, said he would take a decision soon and did not rule out extending support to the BJP.

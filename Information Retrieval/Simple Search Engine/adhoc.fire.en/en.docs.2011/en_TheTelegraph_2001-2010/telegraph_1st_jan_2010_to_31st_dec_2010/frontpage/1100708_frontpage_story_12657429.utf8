          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, July 7: Air Indias Ranchi-New Delhi flight IC 810, with several VVIPs on board, experienced trouble while descending due to heavy cloud cover and had to hover above Indira Gandhi International Airport for half-an-hour, before landing around 5.30pm today, 45 minutes late.        
	All of us are safe, said Bandhu Tirkey, but added some passengers complained of giddiness once the flight failed to land on the first attempt.        
	Among those on board were Jharkhand Rajya Sabha MP Ram Dayal Munda, BJPs Arjun Munda, Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey, Lohardaga MP Sudarshan Bhagat and former MP Ajay Maroo.

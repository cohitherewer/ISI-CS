	With a glass Im pretty handy              
	Team India is not exactly singing the AC/DC number, but the history of cricket shows that match-winning performances and drinking can very well go hand in hand. Just that a Yuvraj Singh is no Gary Sobers, a Yusuf Pathan no Ian Botham and a Gautam Gambhir no Viv Richards.        
	After Indias exit from the ICC Twenty20 World Cup on Tuesday, captain M.S. Dhoni had cited partying after the IPL matches as one of the probable reasons  besides the extensive travelling during the 45-day Indian tournament  that some of his boys couldnt deliver in the West Indies. But that same Caribbean turf is witness to many a great cricketer partying till the morning and then blasting away out in the middle.                       Ian Botham with a child in 1992      
	Cricket legend abounds with tales of a Sobers and later a Richards living it up the night before and sending bowlers on a leather hunt the morning after. Someone like Botham took a lot of pride in his lifestyle. I enjoy a pint. Is that a crime? goes a famous Botham quote.        
	Not at all if one can back up the partying with the on-pitch savagery that Guy the Gorilla could pull off consistently. Cricket writer Frank Keating has revealed how Botham was the last man to leave an Indore bar at dawn on the first day of the match against Central Zone during the 1981-82 Indian tour before walking out in an hour and scoring a brutal 122 with 16 fours and seven sixes.        
	Maybe Mahendra Singh Dhonis boys are not just up there with the best. Even if they hadnt partied during the IPL and been very stringent with their schedules, Gambhir and Pathan would have struggled against the short ball and Yuvraj would have looked out of shape. As Imran Khan said on a TV channel: Did India have the matchwinner to win the World Cup? The answer is no.        
	How much of a spoilsport can a late night be? Hear it from Mandira Bedi: I dont get this partying excuse. The late nights didnt seem to have taxed the cricketers while the IPL was on. They are all responsible national cricket team players and they should be knowing their limits.        
	If they dont, it can sure be a problem. Too much of alcohol and physical exhaustion at a party can certainly affect a cricketers performance, says Nisith Ranjan Chowdhury, sports medicine specialist and medical expert of world soccer body Fifa. They must have at least six to eight hours of sleep, and in the morning, they must undergo proper stretching and warm-up exercises to be match-fit.        
	Sources in ITC, The Sonar, the hotel where all the IPL cricketers were lodged during their stay in Calcutta, have stories to share about how some players would party till the morning and then have Do-Not-Disturb tags hanging from their door knobs till way into the afternoon.        
	Clearly, there was no stricture on partying and drinking. We also drink and go to parties but then we take responsibility for the lives of passengers so why cant cricketers be alert and fit enough to perform? asked a Calcutta-based pilot.         
	But pilots are only allowed to drink alcohol till 12 hours before take-off. The cricketers have no such written rules.        
	 Fitness trainer and coach Ranadeep Moitra says: You may be physically there on the cricket pitch but mentally you are somewhere else, thanks to those extra hours in the pub or disco. Every cricketer is likely to have his own pre-match routine and the IPL partying must have disrupted that completely. You can be terrific on a particular match day but you cannot simultaneously party hard and play well day in and day out.        
	Chris Gayle, famous for his rendezvous with Sherlyn Chopra at nightclub Dublin, showed what that terrific match day can do, with his 66-ball 98 almost pushing India out of the tournament. Did we have a Gayle in our team who could have made the difference? Potentially yes, actually no.        
	Maybe Dhoni was just echoing the new BCCI mantra of not mixing cricket and parties. Not only has the new IPL commissioner banned the after-match parties from IPL IV, the BCCI had barred Indian players from attending late-night parties during the T20 World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Session swallows Karat line 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Session swallows Karat line 
  - CPM boss safe till next party congress, Mamata misses chance to see BJP fill Left vacuum        J.P. YADAV                                     
	Vijayawada, Aug. 10: Prakash Karat has got the extended session of the CPM central committee to endorse the withdrawal of support to UPA-I and his aggressive anti-Congress line, yielding a little ground to the Bengal unit but reinforcing his perch for a while.        
	The extended central committee in its review fully endorsed the decision to withdraw support to UPA-I as correct and necessary, the CPM general secretary told reporters at the conclusion of the meeting today.        
	The decisions can now be reviewed, if at all, by only a party congress. Such a meeting is not scheduled before the Assembly elections next year, which means Karats policy cannot be challenged irrespective of the election outcome in Bengal and Kerala.        
	He (Karat) can relax till the next party congress. The issue of withdrawal of support has been settled. Now no leader can raise it, a delegate said.        
	Karat said the extended central committee felt that the CPM should have withdrawn support earlier and not allowed the UPA-I government to go to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In a self-critical analysis, we felt that maybe we should have withdrawn support earlier, he added.        
	The general secretary refrained from stating that one of the reasons for delaying withdrawal of support was in consideration of the Bengal partys request to at least wait till the panchayat polls were over.        
	Karat made some concessions to the eastern unit and declared that the entire party would rally to defend Bengal. But he reaffirmed his aggressive anti-Congress line, saying that supporting UPA-I in 2004 was an exceptional situation and categorically ruled out forging any alliance or a united front with the Congress.        
	There is no debate on that. The alliance with the UPA is ruled out. 2004 was an exceptional situation. We supported the Congress only to keep the BJP out, Karat said.        
	On the aborted third front experiment before the last Lok Sabha polls, Karat passed the test with minor criticism. The review report said it was a correct approach in the given situation, adding that it failed in terms of an effective all-India alternative.        
	If Karat took some criticism on the counts of support withdrawal and the third front, he succeeded in using the Nandigram stick to beat Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with.         
	The extended session endorsed that though no land was acquired in Nandigram, the campaign by the Opposition damaged the partys image, Karat said.        
	The party has dumped the Singur model and will undertake a national campaign against acquisition of peasants land to repair the damage.        
	Karat said the political line was to fight the Congress and the BJP while emphasising the independent Left activities. Asked about sparing the Congress in Bengal, Karat termed it a faulty assessment. In Bengal, Trinamul is spearheading the attack on the Left and the Congress is a mere appendage to it. Naturally, thereby, our target is Trinamul Congress, he said.

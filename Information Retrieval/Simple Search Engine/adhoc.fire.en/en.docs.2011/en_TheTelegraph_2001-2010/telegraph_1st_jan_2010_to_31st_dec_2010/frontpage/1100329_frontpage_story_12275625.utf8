          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               The facade of St Edmunds in Shillong and (top) the burn marks on the ventilator where the kerosene bombs were hurled. Telegraph pictures				                                       
	Shillong, March 28: Unidentified attackers hurled kerosene bombs at the office of the principal of St Edmunds School and an adjacent office in Laitumkhrah around 1.30 this morning.        
	The two guards posted at the main gate were probably asleep when the bombs went off.        
	It appears that taking advantage of the rain, the miscreants jumped over a small gate to enter the school premises as the main gate was locked, the East Khasi Hills superintendent of police A.R. Mawthoh said.         
	The windowpanes of the principal M.T. Syiems office and the adjacent office room were broken and there were also black marks on the ventilation, indicating that more than one kerosene bomb had been hurled.         
	A revolving chair was completely gutted while another chair and blower were partially burnt.        
	The police said they came to know about the incident at 6.20am today and immediately rushed to the spot.         
	We also met the principal, but the motive of the arson is yet to be known, a police official at the Laitumkhrah police station said.         
	The police who examined the rooms said materials collected from the room would be sent for forensic tests.         
	There was smell of kerosene in the rooms and we presume kerosene was used to make the bomb, the police official said.         
	The reason for the attack remained unknown.        
	The police are yet to ascertain if any disgruntled pupils, past or present, were involved.         
	There were complaints from several quarters regarding a hike in school fees at the end of last year.         
	Moreover, on March 2, a Class VII student of the school, Justin Kharmalki, pushed his classmate, Mansa Passah, from the first floor, breaking his leg.         
	Justin was later suspended from the school.         
	According to Mawthoh, the people who hurled the bombs knew the layout of the school and different rooms.         
	Principal Syiem said it is an attempted arson case and the police are investigating the matter.         
	Asked about Justins suspension, she denied that this had anything to do with the attack.         
	She also denied that the hike in the school fees led to the incident.         
	Established in 1923 by the Congregation of Christian Brothers (India province), the school is one of the most reputed in the Northeast, attracting students from not only from Calcutta but all over eastern India.        
	It is not only the academic qualities of the school that drew them, but the overall ambience that it provide for developing the personality, an alumni of the school said.         
	An organisation called St Edmunds Past Pupils Association exists worldwide along with its charitable arm, SEPPA Gives.         
	The operational headquarters of SEPPA and its charitable arm is at Guwahati. An annual meet of Seppans and families worldwide is held in February every year.

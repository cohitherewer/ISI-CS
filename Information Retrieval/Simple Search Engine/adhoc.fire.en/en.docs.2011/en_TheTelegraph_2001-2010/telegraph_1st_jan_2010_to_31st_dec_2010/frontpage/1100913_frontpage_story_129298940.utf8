										                      Prime Minister Manmohan Singh                          
	New Delhi, Sept 13 (PTI): Voicing concern over the unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today sought to reach out to the people there, saying their grievances have to be addressed and promised talks within the Indian Constitution with those who abjure violence.
    As his government weighs options to deal with the situation in Kashmir, Singh emphasised on the need for better delivery of services and generating avenues for economic advancement of the people of the state.
    "Unrest in the state of Jammu and Kashmir over the last few weeks is a matter of concern. The youth of Kashmir are our citizens and their grievances have to be addressed," he told top commanders of the armed forces at a conference here.
    "We are willing to talk to every person or group which abjures violence, within the framework of our Constitution," he said.

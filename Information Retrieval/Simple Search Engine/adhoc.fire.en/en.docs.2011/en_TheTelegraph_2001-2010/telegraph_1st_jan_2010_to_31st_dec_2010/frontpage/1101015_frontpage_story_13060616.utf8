The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Closure pales before opener, Delhi wants to party more 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Closure pales before opener, Delhi wants to party more 
          SUJAN DUTTA                                      
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: Pop patriotism gift-wrapped in bursts of laser lights and a promise to rock the world marked party time for Delhi as it gave itself full marks tonight in the test that was the 19th Commonwealth Games.        
	If the CWG organisers were trying to rival China in a coming-out party, they were beaten by themselves. The Games closure did not touch the heights that the opener scaled.        
	Delhi turned out in the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium tonight to celebrate itself in the closing ceremony. But every time the performances and the music and the lights raised expectations, the mood fell short of the magical.         
	Its guests for two weeks  some 5,000 athletes and officials from 71 countries  joined in the fun, many of them by now knowing we are like this only. But before the music ended many of them were leaving.        
	We are like this only was the theme of the opening ceremony that made the UPA governments aam aadmi telegenic on the Incredible India train. In tonights festivities, there was little novelty barring the medley of martial arts with which it opened.        
	The rousing moment really was when the martial music played by the armed forces bands struck Saare jahaan se achcha as they marched out of the venue.        
	In the galleries, the red-and-white-shirted army of some 20,000 volunteers danced and 60,000 spectators cheered and applauded  and booed Suresh Kalmadi  but the sense of elation that the opening ceremony created was missing.        
	Mesmerising, said Anupama Kanwar, a north Delhi resident. Lekin thoda party aur hona chahiye (but I wanted to party more), she said even as she left before it ended, fearing a crush in the Metro train.        
	The finale of the Commonwealth Games was more relaxed and, yes, joyous too, but it surprised with too little. Expectations were high after the opener.         
	In the closure, the organisers fell back on Bollywood with oft-heard numbers belted out by top singers lapsing into the kitschy.                           Congress MP Rahul Gandhi (top) and Union minister Farooq Abdullah at the closing ceremony on Thursday. (PTI)      
	On the ground, where the athletes were seated, however, they didnt seem to mind. Many of them danced. The parade of the athletes is less spectacular in the stadium than it is on television. Spectators looked up to the giant screens to identify the heroes and heroines.        
	From the galleries it was the medley of eight Indian martial arts with which tonights ceremony opened that was the most spectacular.         
	At once fiery and passionate, the martial arts performers of eight different styles from Gujarat to Nagaland and Kerala to Punjab did their routine to the same beat. Tens of thousands clapped rhythmically to the accompanying percussion.        
	Delhi is ready to forget its lapses tonight. Its over, said 35-year-old Raveen Verma from his seat in a stand where the spectators were mostly recipients of complimentary passes. We have to celebrate without a glitch tonight and we have got more than 100 medals, he added as spectators around him nodded.        
	Vermas wife works with a unit of the CWG organising committee. Most entrants through Gate 14 to Section B of the stands have a relative directly or indirectly involved with the organisation of the Games.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was loudly applauded  louder even than Sonia Gandhi  and competed with Sheila Dikshit for the cheers.         
	Suresh Kalmadi was roundly booed  first, when he gave away the medals for marathon and later, when he gave his speech, taking care to lavish praise on all the bosses from the Prime Minister to Rahul and Sonia Gandhi (for buying tickets and sitting in the galleries instead of heading for the VIP section to watch events) to P. Chidambaram and the cabinet secretary.                                      
	When Shaan belted out we will we will rock you, the second stanza of the Queen song probably got drowned in the overloud music that accompanied it but Delhi was saying it aloud: You got mud on yo face/ You big disgrace/ Kickin your can all over the place/ We will we will rock you/ We will we will rock you.        
	Scotlands tartan-kilted dancers and bagpipers put up a tightly knit performance after the CWG flag was handed over for the 2014 Glasgow Games. The Scots had flown in more than 400 performers and tonnes of equipment, including props that ballooned to create the huge arcs that distinguish a bridge over Clyde river.        
	In the end, however, the razzle-dazzle of the ceremony dissipated in a flash of laser lights and overloud Bollywood numbers. Delhi found itself. Party time but euphoria wanting. Its only like this.

	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Watch it, pesky telemarketers! Your time could be up once the new year rings in.        
	Starting today, mobile phone users irritated by unsolicited calls selling credit cards to sauna belts to holiday packages can dial or send a text message on the toll-free number 1909 to stop the nuisance. But the crackdown will begin only from January 1, 2011.        
	According to new rules issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), a customer can choose to totally block marketing calls and texts or opt to receive them selectively. He/she could partially block any one or more of the following seven categories: banking/credit cards, real estate, education, health, consumer goods/auto, entertainment and tourism.        
	When a customer is in the partially blocked category, he will only get SMSes and not commercial calls, said a Trai official, adding that only those who do not register for any category would get both calls and messages.        
	The new rules also mandate that no commercial communication, even in case of unregistered customers, can be sent between 9pm and 9am.        
	The Centre had asked telecom companies to crack down on telemarketers after finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said in early August that he had got a call offering him attractive loans when he was in the middle of a price rise debate in Parliament.        
	Sunil Mittal, the owner of Bharti Airtel, had yesterday hoped the menace would end soon. I delete 25 SMSes a day and it is really a nuisance.        
	Under the earlier regulations, customers had to register with a national do not call (NDNC) list by going online and wait for 45 days for the request to take effect. But at the end of the waiting period, the calls would continue.        
	In contrast, when a call will be made to 1909, a customer care executive will take the subscriber through a series of questions and issue a registration number. It will take only seven days for the registration to be completed.        
	Mobile phone users can start registering on the toll-free number starting today, the Trai official said.        
	If a customer is registered on the NDNC list, he/she will continue to be registered under the fully blocked category and need not re-register on 1909. This number can be used to register, de-register or change from partially to fully blocked categories.        
	If the unsolicited calls continue after seven days of registration, a customer can call or send a text on the same toll-free number to make a complaint. Mobile service providers will have to address the complaint in seven days.        
	Theres help for customers who choose not to register with 1909, too. All calls from telemarketing firms will from now on come from a number starting with the digits 70.        
	Any call that comes from any number beginning with 70 will be a commercial call and the customer has the choice to receive or not receive the call, the Trai official said.        
	The only messages exempt from the regulations are transactional ones from banks, insurance companies, telecom service providers, airlines and from educational institutions to parents. But these have been restricted to texts only.        
	Trai has also made it mandatory for all telemarketing firms to register with the National Telemarketer Register. Those found flouting rules will have to pay hefty penalties.        
	For the first offence, a telemarketing firm would be charged Rs 25,000. That would go up to Rs 75,000 for the second one, Rs 80,000 for the third, Rs 1,20,000 for the fourth, Rs 1,50,000 for the fifth and Rs 2,50,000 for the sixth mistake, the Trai official said.        
	After the sixth offence, a telemarketers connection would be snapped by all service providers for two years.        
	Mobile service providers said the new rules were a step in the right direction. But we have to look at the implementation part of the regulations in the given time frame, Rajan S. Mathews, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, said.

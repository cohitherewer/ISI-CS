The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Framework for job training in schools
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Framework for job training in schools
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Kapil Sibal at the conclave                                  
	Delhi is set to constitute a national vocational education framework within a year to equip students from Class VIII onwards with job skills, Union human resource development minister Kapil Sibal announced in the city on Wednesday.        
	Sibal was speaking at the Higher Education Conclave 2010 organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce on Industry Academe Partnership  Dynamic Alliance to Facilitate Change.        
	He said once the new framework was in place the Central Board of Secondary Education would introduce subjects such as carpentry and refrigeration and offer degrees. For instance, Bengal can focus on a course in leather technology to provide skilled manpower for the tanneries around the city just as Assam can introduce tea cultivation as a subject.        
	Students will be able to study these subjects from Class VIII onwards along with the conventional curriculum. The vocational subjects will be offered at 10 levels with a certificate each for completing every level.        
	After completing the first four levels, students will be offered a degree in that subject equivalent to a Class XII pass certificate. The tenth level certificate will be equivalent to a postgraduate degree.        
	Explaining the need for the framework, the minister said Delhi had set itself a target to increase the gross enrolment ratio in higher education from 12.4 to 30 per cent within 2020.        
	Even after the ratio increases there will be nearly 150 million children who might not be able to pursue conventional or professional courses in higher education. We need to evolve a national policy on vocational education for these students who will not be able to go for higher education, said Sibal.        
	The minister rued the lack of initiative to strengthen the industry-university partnership. He called for more private participation in higher education, saying that once the gross enrolment ratio in higher education was raised to 30 per cent, the country would need nearly 800 more universities and 40,000 additional colleges.        
	How many of you have gone to the universities and given them suggestions? Sibal asked the industry representatives present at the conclave.        
	Nobody raised a hand.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT              uniform ruse            1. Maoists in security forces rsquo; gear walk into village on Thursday night, split themselves into groups   and pick out the homes of their targets            2. They knock and identify themselves as   personnel from Binpur police station            3. Familiar with the uniform since a CRPF camp   was set up nearby, unsuspecting villagers open   their doors. They follow when told they have to   help the police             4. Four bodies found on Friday morning, hands tied behind their backs and heads almost blown off

	Shilda, May 14: Maoists in battle fatigues posed as a security patrol to gain CPM supporters trust in a West Midnapore village last night, led four men out and shot them dead in a tactic that could make sitting ducks of unwary populations anywhere.        
	This morning, Chandabila residents found the four bloodstained bodies, hands tied behind their backs, laid out a short distance from one another across the middle of a road 10km from the village. The posters left beside them declared that these police informers had been punished by a peoples court.        
	The killings raised fears that the ploy could be replicated elsewhere, especially since battle fatigues  the camouflage gear worn by security forces, especially during jungle warfare  are easily available and may allow wearers to carry weapons without being challenged.        
	The police had no answers, with West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma merely confirming that there is no law against people wearing battle fatigues and Jhargram SP Praveen Tripathi stating the obvious: The Maoists killed these men just to create panic.        
	His boss, Bengal director-general of police Bhupinder Singh, made a less obvious claim: the Maoists were on a killing spree because they were cornered.        
	CPM worker Nazrul Mir, 42, and party supporters Ashok Ahir, 36, his brother Sanatan, 38, and Swapan Ahir were all shot through the head. Nazrul was a small-time cattle trader and the other victims were day labourers in a village of mostly poor people living in mud-walled houses with thatched or tiled roofs.        
	Chandabila, about 7km from Shilda town where Maoists had massacred 24 Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans in February, is a CPM pocket on the turf of the rebel-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, and looked on security force patrols as its friends.        
	Gopinath Singh, 45, a labourer, said the villagers were woken up around 11.30 by the sound of heavy footfall on dry earth followed by loud knocks on the doors of some homes.        
	He saw 30 to 35 people in camouflage outfits, many carrying rifles. As they wore uniforms that we are used to seeing every day, we did not suspect them, Singh said.        
	Nor did Ashok or Sanatan, said their mother Khadubala, 75. Nor did Nazrul.        
	My husband opened the door to find people wearing dresses used by the police and CRPF who regularly patrol the area, said Nazruls wife Basera Bibi, 35.        
	They said they had come from (the local) Binpur police station and asked him to accompany them. My husband followed them but I became scared and asked, Where are you taking him? They said, Dont worry, your husband would be back tomorrow morning.        
	A relative of Basera was among the first to see the bodies around 7.30am today, on the Shilda-Bankura Road that cuts through Etela forest.        
	This is the handiwork of Maoists. We believe there were about 20 guerrillas accompanied by residents of neighbouring villages who identified the homes of the victims. We are searching for them, SP Tripathi said.        
	The Maoists today held a West Midnapore bandh to protest the alleged arrest of squad member Soma Mandi and press for her production in court.        
	DGP Singh said: Their bandh has seen no response. They are under pressure to make their presence felt. They are feeling cornered and so they are killing innocent people.        
	A fifth man, a 62-year-old CPM branch committee member in Purulias Arsa, fell to suspected Maoists bullets last night.         
	A group of 30 dragged farmer Sukanta Mahato out of his home in Pathardih village, tied his hands and feet and shot him twice about 300 metres from his house, sources said. Posters the killers left behind proclaimed Mahato a police informer.

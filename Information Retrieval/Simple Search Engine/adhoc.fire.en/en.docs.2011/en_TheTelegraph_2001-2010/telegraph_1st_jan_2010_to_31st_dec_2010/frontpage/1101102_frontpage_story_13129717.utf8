          OUR BUREAU                            Babita Ganguly                                  
	Nov. 1: A mother of two who is wanted in the murder of Gorkha leader Madan Tamang leaped through the first-floor window of her house in Darjeeling on spotting a police squad and bolted but could not evade arrest as she fell into a ditch and fractured a leg.        
	The 39-year-old Babita Ganguly, a Gorkha Janmukti Morcha activist whose name figures in the chargesheet filed by the CID in the murder case, has undergone surgery on her right leg.         
	Taking no more chances, the police have posted a team inside the female surgical ward of Darjeeling District Hospital.         
	When Babita saw the 25-member police party approaching her three-storied home at Kakjhora, around 3km from the Mall, she flung open the window and jumped.        
	Before the stunned squad could gather its wits, the lady bounced back to her feet and started to sprint, according to police sources. After covering around 10 metres, she slipped and fell, the sources added.        
	Based on a court order on absconders, the CID had attached Babitas property three days ago. Today, we received information that she was back and raided her house, a police officer said.         
	We conducted a raid on her residence around noon but when she tried to escape, she fell and fractured her leg, said D.P. Singh, the superintendent of police, Darjeeling.        
	However, Binay Tamang, the assistant secretary of the Morcha, said: Babita Gangulys leg was fractured because of the police and we will apprise the National Human Rights Commission of the incident.        
	Babitas husband Rabi Ganguly, who works in the district panchayat and rural development office in Darjeeling, is also a Morcha activist. The couple have an 18-year-old daughter and a son aged 11.         
	The police claimed that Babita was part of the core team involved in the murder. She could apparently be seen in video footage showing the venue of a meeting in Darjeeling where Madan Tamang was hacked to death in daylight in May.

          OUR BUREAU                            Dipan Banerjee                                  
	Aug. 13: A young engineer from Howrah who was found dead in his Navi Mumbai flat knew his assassin and had let the person in, police said today while blaming personal enmity for the murder.        
	We have cracked the case, but cant disclose the details immediately for the sake of the investigation, Navi Mumbai police commissioner Javed Ahmed told The Telegraph.         
	Dipan Banerjee, 25, who worked with Larsen and Toubro, was found with multiple wounds, possibly inflicted with a small sharp weapon, in a bathroom that was bolted from outside.        
	Assistant commissioner of police (Vashi division) Purushottam Karad, who heads the probe, said the police had been able to establish the motive. We have solved the puzzle. He was killed because of personal enmity.        
	He promised to disclose all details by Saturday evening. Hopefully, we would be able to net the accused by then.        
	Acquaintances back home and friends across the country wondered who could have killed the gentle and polite Dipan who loved his books more than anything else as a student.        
	He was a senior design manager at L amp;Ts Powai factory, but the company clarified that it was an entry-level post. He had not been coming to office for a few days before his murder. So, when his family called from Calcutta (on Wednesday) and sought our help, we sent some of our staff members to his apartment, an L amp;T spokesperson said.        
	By the time the L amp;T team arrived on Wednesday evening, Dipans friends had reached the B-401 flat of Sylvia Building  in the satellite citys Airoli area  along with his landlord and property broker.         
	The flats door was open. The friends panicked after seeing the body in the bathroom through a crack in the door and property broker Nanak Keswani called us, said Karad.        
	The police believe Dipan was killed on Tuesday. His laptop, mobile and camera had been removed after the murder.        
	Dipan had called his sister Somali Biswas earlier on Tuesday night. She said the call got disconnected after a few minutes. Later that night, when Dipans parents rang him, the phone was switched off.         
	Dipans father Asit Mohan Banerjee too is an engineer. He retired from the CMDA last year. The Banerjees have been living at Harinath Nyayratna Lane in Shibpur for more than 60 years.        
	An uncle said Dipan went to the Shibpur Ramakrishna Vidyalay.         
	He was very gentle and polite in nature. Who could have killed him? wondered neighbour Suswagata Bandopadhyay.        
	Dipans school headmaster Mrinal Mukherjee remembered him as a very bright student who was dear to the teachers.         
	He had studied electrical engineering at the Calcutta Institute of Engineering and Management (CIEM) and was doing his business administration course at the LN Welingkar Institute of Management in Mumbai.        
	Dipan arrived in Mumbai two years ago and had been staying at Sylvia Building in Sector 8A of Airoli for three months. Earlier, he used to stay with some friends in another Navi Mumbai apartment, but he moved out so he could focus better on his management studies, said one of his colleagues at L amp;T.        
	A CIEM alumnus who was in touch with Dipan over mail said he remembered his batchmate as a nipat bhalo chheley (very good boy). He came sixth in his department and was always very studious, said the engineer, posted in another L amp;T unit.         
	Dipan was cremated in Navi Mumbai around 1pm today in the presence of his sister and brother-in-law. There was a days delay in handing over the body as Maharashtra police rules stipulate that a body can be handed over only to a blood relative after post-mortem, Karad said.         
	Earlier, Dipans brother-in-law had flown down alone from Calcutta to collect his body. His sister arrived today.

	Ranchi, May 11: The BJP got down to business in the state capital today by holding one-on-one discussions with its MLAs to zero in on a chief minister, but the JMM chose to rattle its ally by raking up issues of equal share and respect in a coalition.        
	BJP central observers Rajnath Singh and Ananth Kumar spent over four hours here and met as many as 17 of 18 party MLAs, a majority of whom apparently backed Arjun Munda as their choice of chief minister.        
	But while all this was on, the JMM central executive committee seemed to be dwelling on other ideas. Indicating a nuanced shift in its stand of supporting a BJP-led government, the partys legislature party leader Hemant Soren said they would not form a government at the cost of the interest and respect of JMM.        
	The executive committee resolution was apparently adopted to try and win over some of its disgruntled MLAs who were all along against supporting a BJP-led government.         
	It was also aimed at the BJP which has so far rejected the JMMs proposal of rotational chief ministers.         
	The committee, the apex policy-making body of the JMM, comprises 75 members. At todays meeting chaired by chief minister Shibu Soren, the party resolved to negotiate with the BJP to remove some of the bottlenecks that still existed on forming the new government.        
	We will form the government only when we get equal share and due respect in the coalition, Hemant told The Telegraph quoting the committees resolution adopted today.        
	Both BJP and JMM have 18 MLAs each in the 82-member House.         
	After the BJPs meetings were over, its national vice-president and Jharkhand in-charge Karuna Shukla said there was no internal tussle over the state leadership.        
	On the question of rotational chief minister, she said, We will clear the confusion with the JMM.         
	She said Singh and Kumar, who arrived here this morning on a chartered plane, would brief party president Nitin Gadkari about their choice of chief minister after returning to New Delhi tomorrow.         
	The party president would announce the name in a day or two.        
	Of the 17 MPs interviewed by them, P.N. Singh, Nishikant Dubey, Sudarshan Bhagat, Ravindra Pandey and Devidhan Besra were among the first. Speaker C.P. Singh was the only one who did not take part in todays exercise.        
	Munda, the MP from Jamshedpur, also reached the party headquarters and met Singh and Kumar. As many as 14 district unit presidents, though not invited, also met them and threw their weight behind Munda.         
	If the MLAs have their way, Munda could be the chief minister, said a senior BJP leader.         
	During their interactions with MLAs, BJP central leaders sought their views on the JMM too, especially the unpredictable nature of the Sorens. They also expressed surprise at some of them setting up camp in Delhi to try and influence the party leaderships choice.        
	An MLA known to be a Munda supporter explained to the central leaders that they were being confronted by the people of the state for delaying the formation of a government.         
	We wanted to apprise the central leadership that the delay in taking a decision was sullying the image of the party, the legislator from Singhbhum explained.                                                              
	MLAs who stayed back in Ranchi yesterday, apparently at the behest of state party president and chief ministerial aspirant Raghubar Das, played safe and said they would abide by the parliamentary boards decision.                          
	We are ready to accept whatever the BJP parliamentary board decides, said Laxman Gilua, the MLA from Chakardharpur.        
	The JMM, however, would decide on its next course of action only after the BJP came out with a name. The ball is in the BJPs court to take the initiative to form a stable government. We are waiting for its decision, Hemant said.         
	JMM organisational secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the party would decide whether Guruji would resign or not only after the BJP came clean on its demand for chief ministers by rotation.        
	Todays JMM executive committee meeting was attended by 65 members. Among those who skipped were Simon Marandi, Teklal Mahto, Lobin Hembrom, Sita Soren and Paulus Surin, who is in jail.

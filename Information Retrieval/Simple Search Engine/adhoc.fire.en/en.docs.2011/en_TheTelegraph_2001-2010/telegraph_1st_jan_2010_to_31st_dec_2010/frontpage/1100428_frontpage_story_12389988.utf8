  - Diplomat based in Pak held          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                    
	New Delhi, April 27: A middle-level Indian diplomat posted in Islamabad who apparently nosed around for secrets unrelated to her work has been arrested on the charge of spying for Pakistan.        
	Delhi police sources said Madhuri Gupta, 53, a second secretary and Urdu interpreter at the Indian high commission, was disgruntled with the way her career was going and had passed on information for a lot of money.        
	The arrest comes at a time Manmohan Singh is believed to be keen on reviving the peace process and is expected to meet the Pakistan Prime Minister on the sidelines of the Saarc summit, which begins in Bhutan tomorrow.        
	PTI quoted a former Indian diplomat, K.C. Singh, as saying this was the first penetration by Pakistan into an Indian mission. Pakistani officials claimed it was all a ploy by Indian hawks to scuttle the peace moves.        
	Gupta, posted to Pakistan in August 2007, was summoned to Delhi on the pretext of sending her to the Saarc summit and arrested on her way from the airport to her home here on Sunday.        
	Police sources said the unmarried Gupta had aroused suspicion through her constant questioning about information she didnt need to know, and had been under watch by Indian spy agency RAW for over a year. A senior RAW official in Pakistan is under the scanner as a possible accomplice.        
	The sources said that during her earlier postings in Malaysia and Delhi, Gupta had kept requesting a Pakistan posting citing her love of Urdu  which means Pakistani spy agency ISI may have already got in touch with her.        
	Gupta, a government employee for 30 years who had been promoted to the IFS Group B cadre, apparently felt she deserved more after so many years of service, a source said.        
	An intelligence source said the importance of the documents Gupta was believed to have passed on were unclear. But the extent of the damage, done over more than two-and-a-half years, seems substantial.        
	Yesterday, a court sent Gupta to five days police custody. She has been booked under the Official Secrets Act and if convicted, can be jailed for 10 years. She will be tried behind closed doors.

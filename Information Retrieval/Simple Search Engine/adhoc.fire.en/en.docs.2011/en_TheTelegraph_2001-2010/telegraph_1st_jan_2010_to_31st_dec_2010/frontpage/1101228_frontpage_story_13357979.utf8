          OUR BUREAU                              
	Guwahati/Nagaon, Dec. 27: Leading cardiac surgeon Ramakant Panda, who had conducted a heart surgery on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last year and on chief minister Tarun Gogoi this year, was injured in a road accident on his way to Kaziranga National Park this afternoon. Among the injured were Pandas son and driver.        
	They were airlifted to Guwahati in the evening after being given first aid in Nagaon civil hospital.         
	The vehicle in which Panda was travelling hit a truck head on near the Down Town Resort at Samaguri in Nagaon district.         
	The renowned cardiac surgeon was accompanied in the car by his daughter Sanel, 18, son Swasat, 20. Pandas wife Sanghmitra and his sister-in law were travelling to Kaziranga in another car and were not injured.        
	The principal and chief superintendent of Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, M.M. Deka, said Panda had suffered minor injuries on the head and leg.        
	 He is all right. A special team of doctors is conducting investigation on all those injured in the accident. Investigation had confirmed clavicle fracture of Pandas son but there is nothing to be worried about. His driver was operated upon by a team as he was bleeding profusely, Deka said.         
	Deka said Panda and his son were released from the hospital late in the evening.         
	Since Dr Panda is a state guest, he along with his family will be staying at Raj Bhavan for the night. Doctors of the GMCH will be in constant touch with Panda, Deka said.         
	Nagaon deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu said Panda had a minor scalp injury and swelling in the leg. His CT scan report was normal, he added.         
	Dr Panda kept telling us that he did not have any injury and the driver should get better treatment. He left his bed and rushed to the driver to ask about his injuries, said Ranjan Goswami, a senior surgeon at the Nagaon Bhugeswari Phukanani civil hospital.         
	His driver Sonar had said in Nagaon: I made all possible attempts to prevent the mishap but failed.         
	An internationally reputed cardiac surgeon, Panda has performed over 12,000 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries and over 700 bypass surgeries. He was conferred the Padma Bhushan in January.         
	The cardiac surgeon is also the vice-chairman and managing director of the Asian Heart Institute, Mumbai, where Gogoi was operated upon by him in August.         
	Gogoi and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma visited the GMCH to see Panda. Governor J.B. Patnaiks wife Jayanti also called on the surgeon.

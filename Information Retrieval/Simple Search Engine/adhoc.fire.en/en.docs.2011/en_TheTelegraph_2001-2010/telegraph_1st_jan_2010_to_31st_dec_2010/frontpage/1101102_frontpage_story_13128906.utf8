	Darjeeling, Nov. 1: Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung today met P. Chidambaram in Delhi to clear the last hurdles before the creation of an interim authority for the Darjeeling hills, which both sides agreed should be in place by December-end.        
	The Morcha chief also indicated to Chidambaram that his party would be more flexible on the contentious issues that had been dogging the talks so far.        
	The Morcha described todays talks as positive and said all contentious issues related to the formation of the interim authority would be resolved in the next round of talks at the political level.        
	Home ministry sources also said the talks were encouraging and the Morcha leadership was showing flexibility so that the interim authority could be put in place soon. We hope that it will be place by the end of the year, a home ministry official said.        
	After the meeting with Chidambaram, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri told The Telegraph: The talks today were positive and we are very hopeful. We discussed all the contentious issues which would be taken up in the next round of political tripartite talks and are likely to be solved soon.         
	Darjeeling MP Jaswant Singh accompanied the Morcha delegation of Gurung, Giri and party central committee member Jyoti Kumar Rai to the meeting with the Union home minister.        
	The four main issues that have so far been coming in the way of the interim authority are its territorial jurisdiction, its authority to manage the tea garden lands, the mode of selection of its members, and its legislative powers.        
	Party sources said Gurung today indicated to Chidambaram that the Morcha was willing to be flexible to sort out those issues which had appeared to be intractable. The Morcha is keen that the interim authority is in place before the model code of conduct comes into force ahead of the Assembly elections, a Morcha leader said.        
	The party has worked out a formula to resolve all the four issues, which it hopes would find acceptance with both the Centre as well as the Bengal government.         
	To resolve the problem of territorial jurisdiction, the Morcha would suggest the setting up of a joint verification committee in the next meeting.         
	We will suggest that some mouzas of Siliguri be immediately transferred to the interim authority subject to the state governments approval, a Morcha leader said. The rest of the territorial demands of the Morcha, related to the Dooars and the Terai, can later be examined by the joint committee to find out if they are justified.        
	The Morcha has so far been insisting that the entire Dooars and Terai be included in the interim authority at the time of its formation.        
	Regarding the composition of the interim authority, the Morcha will scale down its demand and suggest that about 40 of the 50 members that it wants in the new set-up be nominated by the party only for the first year, followed by elections the next year. The rest of the members could be appointed by the governor.        
	So long, the Morcha had wanted to nominate all members of the interim authority for the entire tenure.         
	During the period when it has only nominated members, the interim authority would not exercise any legislative powers.         
	The Morcha hopes that the Centre and the state would agree to extend the authority of the interim set-up to tea garden lands as well.         
	As a further concession, the Morcha leader said, the party leadership would tell the government that only the elected board would take up the issue of the regularisation of the workers who are on contract in the DGHC.        
	A meeting is on the cards with union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee for a special package so that the interim council can bear the financial burden of regularisation of the workers, a Morcha leader said.         
	Also, the source said, the pact between the Centre, state and the Morcha would not be termed as a memorandum of settlement but memorandum of understanding since the interim authority would only be a temporary arrangement.

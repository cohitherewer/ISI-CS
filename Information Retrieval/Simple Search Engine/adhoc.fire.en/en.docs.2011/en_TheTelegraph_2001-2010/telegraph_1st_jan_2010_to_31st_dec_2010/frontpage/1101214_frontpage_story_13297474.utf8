          SANTOSH K. KIRO      
	Ranchi, Dec. 13: What does a documentary star have in common with a former Reserve Bank of India officer and a doctors son? Its the panchayat elections and the urge to serve the rural populace, which is why all three are in the poll fray from Ranchi district.        
	Thirty-year-old Suryamani Bhagat is vying for the mukhiyas post in Budmu panchayat, about 40km away from the capital. A Sanskrit graduate from Marwari Womens College, Suryamani has devoted over a decade of her life to saving the forests of Budmu, one of the four blocks that went to polls today in the district. The others were Chanho, Mandar and Khelari.         
	Her work on environmental issues won the attention of Unicef, which made a documentary on her life in 2008. She also features in school textbooks with the state human resource development department incorporating a chapter on her in the book on environment studies, which is part of the Class V syllabus.         
	Environment apart, womens empowerment and development in agriculture will be my focus if I get elected, a confident Suryamani said.         
	While Budmu is surrounded by dense forests and is considered a rebel zone, Chanho and Khelari too are Maoist sensitive, unlike Mandar which is relatively free of the problem.         
	At a time when educated youths are leaving their villages in search of a livelihood, I decided to come back to provide constructive leadership to my fellow villagers, said Lawrence Kujur (50), a former Reserve Bank of India official. Kujur is contesting for the post of zilla parishad member from Mandar East and is confident of a win. His focus is irrigation and education.         
	As hundreds of voters braved the biting cold to queue up since early morning, Mandar West zilla parishad candidate Kanchan Kerketta explained why he was in the fray.        
	I want to serve my people in my own humble way, said the candidate who is widely known and respected in the area, mainly for the deeds of his late father Benjamin, a doctor. Villagers remember how his father devotedly ferried patients to and from the Mandar Holy Family Hospital in his old car.

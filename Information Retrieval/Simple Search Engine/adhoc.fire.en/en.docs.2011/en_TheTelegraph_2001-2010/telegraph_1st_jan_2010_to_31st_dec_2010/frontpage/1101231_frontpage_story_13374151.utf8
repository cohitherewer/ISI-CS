  - Govt removes legal shackles        BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: The government today threw the education sector open to investment from corporate houses in a big way by allowing them to set up institutions under Section 25 of the Indian Companies Act, a demand denied so far.        
	The private sector was so far allowed to set up educational institutions only as registered trusts or societies. The Union human resource development (HRD) ministry will now allow these to be set up as not-for-profit institutions under Section 25.        
	These institutions can make surplus from education but cannot divert it for any purpose other than expanding the same institution.         
	The decision is expected to lead to a rapid rise in private investment in higher education. The Reliance Group recently said it planned to set up a world-class university.        
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal announced: We will henceforth allow companies registered as non-profit entities under Section 25 of the Companies Act 1956 to establish technical institutions to allow good corporates to set up institutions. However, no joint venture can apply for this.        
	Corporate houses have been demanding such a provision for a long time, saying it is much easier to function as a Section 25 company than as a trust or society.        
	It is a good decision. A lot of serious players will come now. They will set up institutions and provide quality education, said Anjan Roy, economic adviser to business chamber Ficci.        
	P.T. Giridharan, joint director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, said Section 25 companies are formed as not-for-profit organisations to promote commerce, art, science, religion, charity or any other useful activity.        
	He said that like any other company, these educational institutions set up under Section 25 will now be regulated by the ministry of corporate affairs.        
	They will have to submit their income-expenditure statements to the Registrar of Companies under the ministry of corporate affairs. In case of any irregularity, the ministry can order inspection under Section 209 of the Companies Act, Giridharan said.        
	Unlike limited companies, though, these institutions will get exemption from certain strict provisions of the Companies Act, such as convening statutory meetings of members.        
	Education is on the concurrent list of the Constitution. Now this decision will bring these types of companies under the realm of central legislation, namely, the Companies Act 1956. Trusts functioning comes under state laws, Giridharan said.        
	Like a society but unlike a trust, a Section 25 company can be dissolved. After dissolution and settlement of all debts and liabilities, the companys funds and property can be distributed among its members if the memorandum signed at the time of registration says so, an official said.

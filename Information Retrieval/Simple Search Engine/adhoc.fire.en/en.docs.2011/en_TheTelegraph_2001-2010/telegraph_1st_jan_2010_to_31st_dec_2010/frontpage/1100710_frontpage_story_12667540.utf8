          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            The body of Surat Jaman lies in the car at Dwarka in Goalpara on Friday. Picture by Eastern Projections                                        
	Dhubri, July 9: Bandh anarchy killed an elderly farmer in Goalpara this morning when a stone hurled by a protester hit him in the chest, a day after six-year-old Durlav Sethia suffocated to death in Kokrajhar on the derailed Garib Rath.        
	Surat Jamal, 60, was on his way to Krishnai from Singhimari (in Meghalaya) to buy cattle when a supporter of the All Koch Rajbongshi Students Union aimed a stone at the car around 10am.         
	A 36-hour Assam-Bengal bandh, called by the Separate State Demand Committee, is being supported by the All Koch Rajbongshi Students Union and all its wings.        
	What was our fault? I was going to Agia with my grandson, Ariful Ali, to my sisters house at Agia and Jamal was going to Krishnai. I live at Singhimari and he lives at Khalisamari (in Dhubri district) and we met at the Singhimari bus stand in the morning and decided to travel together, Wahela Bewa, Jamals relative, said over phone from Goalpara civil hospital where she had taken Jamals body for post-mortem.        
	Why do we have to become victims of others wars? she asked. Where is the government... there is arajakata (anarchy) all over in Assam, she said.        
	It is in this state of arajakata, as Wahela calls it, that Durlav, a Class I student of Maharishi Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School at Silpukhuri in Guwahati, died when a blast targeted the Garib Rath train early yesterday.         
	If yesterdays blast was part of the war for sovereignty launched by the anti-talks faction of the NDFB, todays killer stone was hurled by those seeking a separate Kamtapur.         
	Askar Ali, the driver of the car in which Jamal was travelling, said he had gone to Singhimari last night to drop a patient from Guwahati and had stayed back since it was too late to return.         
	This morning, when I was returning to Guwahati some passengers flagged me down and asked me if I could drop them at Agia Chowk, the driver said. When they were between Dwarka and Deuli, a boy hurled a stone that hit the man sitting behind, Ali said.         
	He said the car was travelling at 60kmph, which would mean the stone hit Jamal really hard.         
	The man (Jamal) screamed in pain and I did not stop... he was groaning in pain and I drove straight to Agia Public Health Centre where the doctor declared him brought dead. I then came to Agia police station and reported the incident, he said.               
	Goalpara superintendent of police, Luis Aind, said the police had picked up seven All Koch Rajbongshi Students Union activists from the area and they were being interrogated.         
	Jamal leaves behind his wife, three sons, two daughters, three grandsons and two granddaughters.         
	The students organisation has also called an indefinite Bongaigaon district bandh from today in protest against the burning down of its office at Bongaigaon by an irate mob yesterday.

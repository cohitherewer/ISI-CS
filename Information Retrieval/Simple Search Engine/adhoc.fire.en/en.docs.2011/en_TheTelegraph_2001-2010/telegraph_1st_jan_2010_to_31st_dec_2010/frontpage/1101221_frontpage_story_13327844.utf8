The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In Silli block, a vote for power 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                In Silli block, a vote for power

	Ajaygarh, Dec. 20: Lok Sabha elections 2009: less than 54 per cent turn out to vote in Silli block of Ranchi district. Panchayat elections 2010: a healthy 70.5 per cent of the electorate queue up to choose their representatives.        
	Nowhere was the stark contrast in the voting pattern in the block more evident today than in Ajaygarh, a remote hamlet about 50km from the state capital.         
	During the general elections, villagers refused to vote as they felt that no matter who was chosen, the new MP would never be accessible to them. But the panchayat elections were a different story altogether. Of the 628 eligible voters from the village, more than 500 had cast their ballot by 1pm amid tight security.         
	According to residents of Ajaygarh, this poll would give them the power to decide for themselves and carry out development work on their own. They also voted because they wanted electricity. Not because it would light up their homes, but because it would keep marauding elephants away.         
	They wanted water to irrigate their lands so that they could produce their own food and not have to go to Silli to earn a living as labourers.         
	Ranchi MP Subodh Kant Sahay never paid any attention to our problems and we boycotted the general elections. This poll is different. Our neighbours will be our representatives who can do the work we need here, said Devki Nandan Manjhi, a retired government school teacher, as he waited with other villagers for his turn to vote.         
	The region is inhabited mostly by Kurmi Mahtos and tribals. Voters had turned out in large numbers to return deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto to the Assembly when he contested from Silli. But they are not too happy with him today. They complained that Mahto had promised them roads a decade ago, but it became reality only a few months ago.        
	These roads should have been built 10 years ago. As promised, Mahto should have also provided us with irrigation facilities by now too, complained Krishna Kumar Bedia, a student of S.S. Memorial College, Dhanbad, who had come to his village to vote.         
	Ajaygarh, a part of Nagedih panchayat, is surrounded by thick forests and a narrow path running through the hills connects it to the Ranchi-Silli state highway. Though Maoists have not been able to make a mark in the area, thanks to the villagers disinterest in the Red ideology, elephants more than make up for that trouble.         
	Last year, tuskers killed a villager. They also destroyed paddy crops. This year too, they visited several times, but have not wreaked havoc.

  - Mamatas festival card tells a story           ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                              The card sent by Mamata      
	Calcutta, Oct. 15: This festive season, a select 2,000 people in Bengal can flaunt a greeting card designed by Mamata Banerjee, showing a painting by her and carrying her printed signature.        
	Apparently, the railway minister herself drew up the list of 2,000  oops! 2K, going by her own style statement in the card that is perhaps a reflection of her penchant for text messages where such shortcuts are useful.        
	The recipients, described as friends in politics by a senior Trinamul Congress leader, include industrialists, officials of chambers of commerce, consulate representatives, bureaucrats and celebrities, sources said.        
	Our leader cannot keep wishing people who have been lambasting her publicly. She has had to be selective, said a Trinamul leader, making it plain that the amra-ora (us-them) divide in Bengal runs too deep to be ignored even while sending Puja greetings.        
	If the list of recipients is a pointer to who Mamatas friends may be, the cards contents reveal her preference for Tagore and passion for painting. The envelope identifies her as a sansad (MP), not as the railway minister or the Trinamul chief.        
	The cards cover carries an image of Durga with her arms outstretched, spreading the message Om. The caption, which mentions the year according to the Bengali calendar, says: Sharodiya Deepavalir Shubhechchha  1417.        
	The grass and flowers at the bottom may remind some of the Trinamul party symbol. The large eye at the centre of the image gives an impression that the goddess is watching everything. She is shown aiming her trident at an adversary, who is not visible on the card.        
	Who else can the invisible demon be but the CPM? The picture says it all, said a Trinamul MP whose opinion Mamata had sought after designing the card.        
	Party insiders confirmed that Mamata always sought feedback from close aides on her paintings, poems and even political speeches.        
	A Trinamul MLA said Mamata had begun her rough pen sketches for the card in the first week of August more than two months ahead of Puja.              
	Tagore is one of her favourite poets and so she used his words to wish her friends in the festive season, a key member of Mamatas culture clan said.        
	One of the cards two inside pages quotes from a Tagore poem: Anandalokey mangalalokey birajo satya sundaro.        
	The other inside page carries Mamatas greetings and a printed signature (Mamata written in Bengali). It mentions the year, this time according to the Gregorian calendar, as 2k10. The three numerals are in the Bengali script but the k (lower case) is from the Latin alphabet.        
	This kind of mix of Bengali and English can be seen as a style statement, said graphologist Mohan Bose.        
	He, however, suggested that it could also be a slip resulting from stress. When the mind has to process a lot of things at the same time, it can make such slips. Many examinees have the same problem ----- they suddenly cant remember a certain word in Bengali and write it in English, Bose said.        
	With the Assembly elections due by next May, Mamata cannot be blamed if she is feeling a little stressed, but Trinamul sources ruled out the script amalgam being a slip. Mamata had designed the card with a lot of care and was not under any time pressure, they said.        
	Didi is always very meticulous about detail while making sketches and paintings. Thats why she began working on the card early in August. However, within five-six days, she had put her finishing touches to it, the Trinamul MLA said.        
	After she was satisfied with her creation ---- and the feedback -- the artwork and desktop publishing were done at a party leaders office. It was then sent to a private digital press.        
	We have initially placed an order for 2,000 cards. The number may go up later, said an insider at Mamatas back office.        
	Trinamul sources said the card had been fashioned on a concept Mamata had developed for the Bakul Bagan Sarbojanin Puja theme this year.

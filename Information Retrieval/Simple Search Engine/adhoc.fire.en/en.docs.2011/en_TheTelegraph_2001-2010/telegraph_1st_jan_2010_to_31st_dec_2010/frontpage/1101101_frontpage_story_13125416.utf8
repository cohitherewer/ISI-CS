                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Guess who got a lakh and where
  - Tally of two rallies in Bankura: Mamata draws bigger crowd than Buddha          BARUN GHOSH AND AMIT UKIL                                                    
	Oct. 31: Crowd comparison is a hazardous business but when Mamata Banerjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee pick the same place to address meetings within a space of 24 hours, the temptation seems worth the risk.        
	When the two venues separated by 200 metres on a riverine ground are in Bankura, the once-impregnable bastion of the Left, the lure of the inexact exercise becomes irresistible.        
	So heres the crowd count  give or take a few thousands  Bhattacharjee: 50,000-plus; Mamata: nearly 1 lakh.        
	Mamatas rally was held at Satighat on the outskirts of Bankura town. At the other end of the ground  the Gandheswari flows by on one side and people stand on a dried-up strip of the riverbed to listen to political speeches  was the venue from which Bhattacharjee addressed a rally yesterday.         
	Turnout figures are one of the most divisive factors in Indian politics (those who take the trouble or pretend to count invariably have some vested interest), with estimates varying by wide margins.        
	Against such an acrimonious backdrop, there seemed to be some consensus today that Mamatas meeting drew a larger turnout than that of Bhattacharjees.        
	A district intelligence branch official said: I was on duty to oversee the chief ministers rally yesterday. But going by todays estimate, the turnout was much bigger at the Trinamul leaders rally.        
	The char at Satighat, about 280km from Calcutta, can accommodate around 1.5 lakh people. Nearly a lakh turned up today compared with yesterdays 50,000-plus, said an official of the district administration.         
	Sumita Mondal, 35, who lives near the Satighat bus stand, attended todays rally as she did the one yesterday.         
	I was overwhelmed by todays gathering. Yesterday, I came here to hear our chief minister. But I did not find such a big crowd or such excitement among them. Didi today really outshone Buddhababu, she said.                                 
	A turnout at todays rally in Bankura is not without significance, considering the CPM has all 12 MLAs and two MPs in the district.                    
	I am at the moment busy at the state committee meeting. I will have to enquire from party people in Bankura whether todays turnout was bigger than yesterdays, Basudeb Acharya, Bankura MP and CPM central committee member, said in Calcutta this afternoon.         
	A leader of the Forward Bloc, which has pockets of influence in Bankura, conceded that Mamata was able to draw people from large parts of Bankura to her rally. There was no denying that a huge crowd attended todays rally, he said.         
	A CPM state committee member, however, sought to downplay todays turnout by claiming that Mamatas party had brought truckloads of people from outside Bankura to fill the ground. Trinamul managers brought in people from outside because they dont have many supporters in Bankura. So, a turnout at the rally is not a guarantee that Mamata would sweep the polls here, he said.        
	In Bankura, the Opposition that drew a blank even in last years Lok Sabha elections made its presence felt only during this years civic polls when Trinamul snatched the Bankura municipality from the Left. In the neighbouring Burdwan  another Left citadel  the Opposition had improved its margin of votes in all three parliamentary seats.        
	Overwhelmed by the huge turnout at the rally she addressed after laying the foundation stone for a coach rehabilitation plant at Anara in Purulia, Mamata said this afternoon: I am sure that the CPM will lose in all seats in Bankura because people have joined us to protest the state-sponsored terror.        
	Many chorused in unison that they would desert the CPM this time when Mamata asked them from the dais if they would vote for the ruling communists.        
	Mamata did dwell on her pet themes too: job creation and withdrawal of central forces from Jungle Mahal.        
	I am not going to budge an inch from my demand to withdraw joint forces from Jungle Mahal as the CPM is misusing them to expand its base, she said.

  - Bihar votes for tomorrow, gives Nitish a landslide of a chance
  - Victor gasps, Lalu groans				       SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                          
	Patna, Nov. 24: Bihar has emphatically endorsed its tryst with a new destiny whose crafty author is a bestseller called Nitish Kumar.        
	He has alchemised, with political cunning and workmanlike diligence, a winner weave in which Biharis have glimpsed the rare glimmer of a better tomorrow.        
	Theyve embraced it wholesomely and with unprecedented unanimity, shaking off calcified loyalties, making nonsense of the arithmetic of caste, creed and class, announcing, full-throated, that Bihar is now moulting out of its disabling stereotypes and raring to catch up with the rest.        
	Its a verdict that stunned the victors more than it did the vanquished: a 200-plus blizzard for the Janata Dal (United)-BJP combine in a House of 243 that immediately put Nitish in the record books and a deep furrow on the grinning visage.        
	Huge, he gasped in a private moment on what was mostly a hectic public day. Huge, baap re (my God)! This is not a victory, this is a responsibility, the people have placed on me a huge burden of responsibility. The victory is theirs, what I have got is a tough job.        
	The losers gasped even louder, but they were having to suck air rather than savour it. As triumphal troupes began to trickle past Nitishs 1 Aney Marg bungalow kicking up confetti clouds, a surreal silence closed in on Lalu Prasads 10 Circular Road residence just round the bend.        
	Defeat had never knocked so hard at these gates; for several hours, Lalu refused to answer. He lay cut in half, reduced from 55 to 20-odd, his political future wheezing in his face on low oxygen.        
	His better half lay more summarily decimated: Rabri Devi was not only shown the door in both Sonepur and Raghopur, shes also been dethroned from her proxy throne of leader of Bihars Opposition. She never bothered showing up to own defeat. Lalu Prasad, as ever, did the talking on her behalf.         
	But today was a day even his famed gift of the gab seemed to have deserted him; he sounded like a superannuated big gun shooting blanks. He emerged before the media aptly bewildered, with a theory ineptly bizarre.         
	We accept this verdict, but this is a mysterious verdict whose secrets I will reveal to you later, he said, unwilling to meet the mandate in the face. There is a deep mystery to it, I will tell you later. How has this happened, this topsy-turvy thing?        
	But what left Lalu Prasad utterly mystified was simple to Nitish. This is the result of work and delivery, there is no confusion about it. And people who are still wondering why they have been rejected and why we have got this mandate should pay attention to this: the people of Bihar want good governance, they want to move on, they have become stakeholders in a bright future and they have invested in it.         
	Baat-cheet aur khokhli naarebaazi par taala laga diya hai logon ne, ab we spasht roop se kah rahen hain ki humko pragati chahiye aur hum pragati mein bhagidaari karenge (The people have put the locks on useless talk and empty sloganeering. They are clearly saying they want progress and they want to become partners in this progress).        
	Nitish, typically, preferred to foreground future imperatives rather than dwell too much on his landslide. Thats over, I thank the people of Bihar profusely, now on with the job.        
	The joyous eddy of the faithful kept thickening around Nitish as the day wore on, first invading his normally sanitised lawns, then spilling over into the chief ministerial residence itself. Sweets and bouquets, a hail of hurrahs, the premises were redolent with the heady aroma of power retained.                           
	Nitish spent a long time just saying no-no to flowers and garlands, no to sweets, no to eager entreaty. Kaam mein lagna hai, kaam ka aadesh hai janata ka (we have to return to work, the direction of people is to work).        
	The flush of success was on more vibrant display around the precincts of Nitishs ally, the BJP. Crackers, drumbeaters, buglers, puffs of colour dusting the celebratory air.        
	But their bulged kitty notwithstanding  the BJP has gained in excess of 30 seats  party leaders were quick to recognise and credit the chief source of the bounty.         
	Its a massive win for us, but it has all happened under the skippership of chief minister Nitish Kumar, said deputy chief minister Sushil Modi. It is his image and style of working that has done the trick.         
	They are loath to admit it on record, but it is not lost on the BJP leadership, in Patna or in New Delhi, that what they have earned is a consequence of their alliance with Nitish. It is dear and critical enough for them to have tamely given in to Nitishs no Narendra Modi diktat.        
	In hindsight, admitted a senior BJP functionary, it was in the best interests of the alliance to have kept him out. Nitish insisted on having his way for good reason, that decision has probably got a whole lot of minority votes.        
	Todays result is not unprecedented for its one-sidedness of numbers alone. It is also singular in the way Bihar appears to have gone for what it saw as the best, and only, bet. Nitish has embossed his stamp all across the state, he has earned the backing of all sections of people.         
	This is not a region-specific or a caste-creed specific mandate, said Saibal Gupta of Patnas Asian Development Research Institute. This is an all-encompassing, all-embracing mandate which is historic in nature. From here on the entire matrix of Bihari politics could change, everyone will have to alter their ways, Lalu Prasad and the Congress most of all.         
	Perhaps they will begin to, once they have recovered from the shock of electric Nitish.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | National law cradle in tribal quota fix
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                National law cradle in tribal quota fix
          AMIT GUPTA                             SEAT WORRIES                                        
	Ranchi, Nov. 28: Studying law can go a long way in helping them fight for their rights, but tribals who make 26 per cent of the states population barely seem interested in pursuing the subject.        
	If admission figures at the newly opened National University of Studies and Research in Law are anything to go by, only one tribal student has enrolled for the five-year integrated course on BA (Honours)-LLB (Honours), which offers as many as 50 seats.         
	The lone ST student, Anindita Guria, secured an all-India rank of 13,743 in the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). She scored 77 out of 200 in her paper.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, vice chancellor of the university A.K. Koul expressed helplessness. What can we do? Nobody, barring one ST candidate, with a valid CLAT score has applied. We will fill up the remaining five seats in the ST category with general candidates, he said.        
	For the current academic year, the law varsity is offering 50 seats, 25 each for students from Jharkhand and outside. The 25 state seats are again divided into 13 general, six ST, three SC, two EBC and one BC while the 25 seats for outsiders are reserved for 12 general, seven OBC, four SC and two ST students.        
	Varsity sources admitted that two seats reserved for ST students from outside Jharkhand will also have to be filled up by general students. The situation is similar for the SC category. Out of the three reserved state seats, the admission list suggests only one eligible candidate.         
	Winner of Padma Shri and noted academic Ram Dayal Munda called the trend unfortunate. Norms should be more relaxed for tribal aspirants, Munda, who had once served Ranchi University as its vice chancellor, said.         
	For consolation, OBCs have fared well. In fact, topping the admission list of Jharkhand is Manjeet Kumar Sahu with a CLAT rank of 1,112 and score of 131. In the ninth position on the merit list is BC student Smita Tejaswee.         
	Admissions for second list rank-holders are open till November 30 while the law varsity may come up with another list if all 50 seats are not filled. Till Saturday, 33 aspirants enrolled for the course.         
	The states first law cradle is set to start classes from December 1 on its temporary campus at BIT, Mesra. However, Chief Justice of Jharkhand High Court Bhagwati Prasad will formally inaugurate the session on December 18.

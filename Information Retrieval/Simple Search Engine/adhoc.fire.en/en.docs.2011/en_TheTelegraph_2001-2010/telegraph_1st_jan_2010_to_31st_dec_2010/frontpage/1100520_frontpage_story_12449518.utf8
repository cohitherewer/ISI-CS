The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Target test pass must for cops
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Target test pass must for cops
          KINSUK BASU                             The Metro report on cops off the mark in June 2008                                  
	Calcutta police have made it mandatory for their inspectors and sub-inspectors to clear the firing test but there is no word yet on possible punitive action against those who tend to perpetually shoot off the mark.        
	Officers who will fail will be put through practice sessions and asked to reappear in the target test which will be held again and again till all the cops make the cut.        
	Sources at Police Training School in Alipore said of every 10 officers taking the test, on an average three-four fail to score the pass marks of 25 out of 50. But since the scores are not mentioned in the service records, there were no plans to hone the shooting skill of the failed candidates who would happily go back to their action stations.        
	The test, used to be held once in a while, was merely a ritual, said a senior officer at Lalbazar. But now with the new system being introduced, inspectors and sub-inspectors will develop a sense of target.        
	An officer in charge of training said: We dont expect the officers to be experts in sharp-shooting, for which there are dedicated units such as Special Task Force and Rapid Action Force. But that is no excuse for inspectors and sub-inspectors to be bad shots, especially since handling firearms is as important as preventing crime.        
	The test at PTS is conducted mostly with small arms since the Alipore campus lacks space for a long shooting range. The scoring pattern is simple. Officers are given 10 rounds of ammunition each for a Browning pistol and a sub-machine carbine. Each round carries five marks and an officer has to score 25 out of 50 in either category to clear the test.        
	Hitting the target is a reflection of ones mental alertness as well as physical fitness. The officers who fail to score the pass marks are now asked to come back and take the test again. The process is repeated till they attain the required level of efficiency, said a senior IPS officer.        
	A section of sub-inspectors and inspectors are not excited about the new move. The officers feel that long hours of law and order or investigation duty leave them too burnt out to retain the requisite shooting skills.        
	Besides, even the quality of bullets is not up to the mark. They are very old and outdated. And if you are not regularly practising, you are bound to lose your skill, said an officer of New Alipore police station.

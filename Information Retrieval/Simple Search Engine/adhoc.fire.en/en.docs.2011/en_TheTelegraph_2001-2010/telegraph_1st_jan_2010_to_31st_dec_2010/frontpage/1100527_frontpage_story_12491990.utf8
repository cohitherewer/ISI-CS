          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                            Graffiti on the wall of a city home. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	If your wall being splashed with poll graffiti without your consent wasnt bad enough, the State Election Commission is out to make you rather than the guilty political parties pay for the whitewash.        
	The commission, which had made little effort to rein in the paintbrush brigade in the run-up to the civic polls, has released around Rs 20 lakh of the taxpayers money to wipe walls clean of the united colours of graffiti.        
	We have released the amount of nearly Rs 20 lakh to whitewash the walls of both government and private buildings defiled by political parties, said Khalil Ahmed, the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas and returning officer for the May 30 civic polls.        
	All 48 police stations in the city have been asked to ensure that defaced walls are whitewashed before polling day. They have been allotted Rs 1,000 for each area within 100m of a polling booth.        
	Mission Whitewash, however, doesnt include walls of private buildings whose owners had given permission  even if under duress  to parties to use these for poll propaganda.        
	They cant prevent our walls from being defaced, they cant take action against the political parties responsible for it, they cant even protect us if we complain. And now they are using taxpayers money to clean those walls. If this isnt a farce, then what is? said Ashish Banerjee, the president of the Orient Row-Talbagan We Care Committee.        
	The We Care Committee had recently forced candidates contesting the elections from the area to wipe some defaced walls clean by threatening to boycott the polls if they failed to do so.         
	A resident of Alipore said the commissions decision to whitewash defaced walls with taxpayers money at the tail-end of the campaign period was reason enough to doubt its efficacy.        
	Most of the walls were defaced by the first week of May. What were they doing for the past three weeks? he demanded.        
	An official of the poll panel claimed that the police had registered over 110 cases of graffiti violations against various parties till last weekend. But neither the police nor the commission has records to prove that the offenders were penalised.        
	According to the rule book, defacing the walls of a government building is banned. The same rule applies to private walls whose owners refuse permission to parties to paint poll graffiti. Offenders can be jailed for up to six months and/or fined up to Rs 50,000.        
	Police officers pleaded helplessness about the lack of enforcement across town, citing a loophole in the law that stipulates penal action against those who defaced the wall rather than those who asked them to do it.        
	A former official of the Election Commission said that recovering the cost of whitewashing a defaced wall from a political party was not easy either. This can be done only if cases are pursued in the municipal court, he added.        
	The only recent instance of parties doing a clean-up act was after Metro highlighted the police cases against the CPM, Congress and the Trinamul Congress for defacing the wall of a Calcutta University hostel in Waliullah Lane, off Ripon Street.

	Patna, July 7: Protesting against the recent killing of a top-ranking rebel, the outlawed CPI(Maoist) party has ground connectivity to a halt between Bihar, Jharkhand and parts of Chhattisgarh.         
	Most night trains went off tracks and buses and trucks chose to stay parked in stands in the wake of the two-day CPI(Maoist) shutdown.         
	The railway administration cancelled as many as 13 trains originating from Patna, Ranchi, Varanasi and Chopan that would have in course of their journey penetrated rebel-hit areas of Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.        
	CPI(Maoists) gave a nation-wide bandh call to protest against the killing of rebel Cherukuri Rajkumar Azad in Andhra Pradesh. While Maoists have already alerted people against undertaking train journeys during the bandh, the administration also joined in, sounding a high alert.        
	All police stations in the rebel-affected areas have been sounded with a high alert, with instructions to keep constant vigil on public property, the Bihar director general of police, Neelmani said.        
	Jehanabad, Makhdumpur, Guraru, Gaya, Dehri-on-Sone are Maoist-affected areas that out-bound trains need to cross to enter Jharkhand and then Chhattisgarh. The cancelled trains include 3348, 3347, 625, 629, 738, as well as 8612, 8312 and 8632 which despite originating from Varanasi, pass through the rebel-hit areas of Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	We have cancelled trains because rebels have been making them their prime target, inflicting enormous damage on life and property, the chief public relations officer, east central railways, Dilip Kumar said. None of the Patna-based buses bound for Ranchi, Ramgarh and Jamshedpur took off from Patnas private and public bus stands.

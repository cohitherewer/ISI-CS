The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Japan softens on nuke deal

	New Delhi, June 10: This past month, Japan appears to have relented from its earlier opposition to civil nuclear trade with India.        
	Tokyo has also put in place a framework that will allow it to help private Japanese companies involved in nuclear power generation to secure overseas contracts to build civil nuclear plants.        
	Japan, a victim of the nuclear horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has traditionally been reluctant to do nuclear commerce with countries that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty or the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.        
	During his India visit in December, outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama had again asked New Delhi to sign the two treaties, suggesting it could pave the way for increased civil nuclear co-operation between the two countries. But Manmohan Singh had reaffirmed Indias position on the subject.        
	Last month, however, Japan and India agreed to set up a working group to look into the subject of nuclear trade as part of their energy dialogue. Sources said the two countries hoped to sign an agreement later this year, which would require India to promise it would not conduct any more nuclear tests  a guarantee similar to the one India has given the US.        
	In return, Tokyo will allow its companies  Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  to partner the US and French companies that are seeking to build nuclear power plants in India.        
	This will facilitate quicker operationalisation of the Indo-US nuclear deal after the US Congress ratifies some of the pending clauses of the 123 Agreement.        
	Two of the biggest US companies that plan to build nuclear power plants in India General Electric and Westinghouse Electric Co  are either partly or wholly owned by Japanese companies.        
	GE and Hitachi had struck a 60:40 international joint venture in 2006. The same year, Toshiba bought Westinghouse for $4 billion. French firm Areva has a 30 per cent stake in Mitsubishi for overseas operations.        
	The recent changes Japan has made to its legal framework relating to this sector are partly a result of losing some lucrative contracts.        
	The Japanese, along with French, US and Russian companies, dominate the global nuclear business. In December, Japanese and US corporations lost a $20.4-billion contract to build four nuclear power plants in the UAE to a South Korean consortium.        
	The Korean consortium was strongly backed by Seoul, with the Korean Premier even flying down to the UAE. Japans government, nuclear power plant manufacturers and electric power companies learnt their lesson and recently bid for a Vietnamese contract unitedly.        
	Tokyo has formed an integrated power suppliers group, bringing Japans 17 private companies involved in the civil nuclear energy sector under one umbrella.         
	Sources said the government had promised to help the group get overseas contracts.

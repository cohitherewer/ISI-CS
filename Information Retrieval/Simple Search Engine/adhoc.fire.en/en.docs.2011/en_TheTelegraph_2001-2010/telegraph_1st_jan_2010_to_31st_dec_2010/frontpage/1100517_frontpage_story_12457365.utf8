The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A way out of spam: Put a tax on it 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                A way out of spam: Put a tax on it 
  - Economists debate a levy to end worldwide misery of mailbox clutter           SAUMITRA DASGUPTA                                                    
	Mumbai, May 16: Economists have started chattering about a transaction tax on emails  a germ of an idea that could fly if governments are brave enough to latch on to it and thereby end mankinds collective pain over mailbox clutter.        
	It will be a while before the seminal idea is whipped into a storm. One will certainly have to wait much longer before any government can work up the courage to impose it. But the principle of a nominal tax could find instant support from the 1.4 billion email users worldwide who are forced every day to wade through tonnes of spam before they can read the really important messages.        
	Harvard professor N. Gregory Mankiw reckons that this is an idea that could catch on. I know my life would improve under such a tax, says Mankiw in his widely read blog.        
	Mankiws suggestion is in response to a readers blog post which calls for a penny tax on email that would probably generate large amounts of revenue.        
	I think an excellent Pigouvian tax would be a tax on emails, reads the blog post that draws enthusiastic support from Mankiw, who teaches the famed introductory economics course (EC 10) at Harvard and was an adviser to former President George W. Bush.        
	The Pigouvian tax is named after the influential Cambridge economist Arthur Pigou (1877-1959) who developed the concept of economic externalities. The tax  which is designed to produce efficient market outcomes  is usually levied on economic activity associated with a large negative externality, which in this case is the dreaded mailbox clutter.        
	Many emails involve a negative externality (I dont really want to receive them) and almost all the ones I really want to get are worth much more than a penny or so to the sender, says the blogger.                    
	Says Mankiw: Even better, if possible, might be to have the recipient set the price! I would happily raise mine to a dime, and let the government use the revenue to fix the long-term fiscal imbalance or cut other more distortionary taxes.        
	According to one study, 247 billion emails are sent everyday around the world  that is 2.8 million emails every second. So, even a piffling tax could generate massive revenues.        
	Workable proposition        
	Would the idea work? It probably will.        
	Email servers are necessarily centralised and networked and all e-mail senders are ipso facto connected to an ISP (internet service provider) who is charging them for access. The transaction costs and evasion problems seem low, suggests the unnamed originator of the idea.        
	Variants of the Pigouvian tax have been used to end similar problems like traffic congestion in Londons central business district through the levy of a hefty tax on cars entering the zone. Sheila Dixits government is looking to experiment with a similar levy on motorists in Delhi during the Commonwealth Games to free congested roads near sporting venues.        
	Another variant of this tax is the levy on environment polluters to achieve a desired outcome  a greener environment.        
	But there are a number of problems associated with taxation of online activity and governments around the world are still struggling to come up with efficient taxation models.        
	India already imposes a service tax on payments made to ISPs. So, in one sense, Indians are already paying an indirect levy for right to surf the web, download data and catch up on mails.        
	A tax on emails may be harder to levy and administer here, considering that most of the gigantic mail servers are located in the US. It could also throw up cross-border taxation issues and spark a flight of servers to zero-tax destinations. But those are issues too far out in the future.        
	Flip side        
	A tax on emails could, however, spark outrage akin to the time when Britain introduced the Black Penny  the worlds first pre-paid adhesive postage stamp  in May 1840 which essentially transferred the burden of payment for the service from the recipient of the mail to the sender. The US had its first postage stamp in 1847 and pre-payment became mandatory only in 1855.        
	One way round this would be to accept Mankiws suggestion that the recipient pays when he opens the mail. But this might prove disagreeable if one ends up paying tax on spam that is opened accidentally.        
	It might also open up business opportunities for digital verification companies like Verisign, which may have to work under federal contract in the US. Similar deals may have to be struck with other governments.         
	Spam may still abound. But one could use filters to prioritise digitally stamped emails  and which are therefore presumably legit  and weed out the dross and gross. It would make life easy for everyone.        
	But there is a broader debate that will arise. The originators of the worldwide web had a more evangelical dream that is now under threat: they had wanted to create a platform that would be free from government intrusion, oversight or taxation.        
	A tax on emails would allow governments to poop the party that has rocked the world since 1991 when Tim Berners-Lee created the worlds first website using hypertext language.

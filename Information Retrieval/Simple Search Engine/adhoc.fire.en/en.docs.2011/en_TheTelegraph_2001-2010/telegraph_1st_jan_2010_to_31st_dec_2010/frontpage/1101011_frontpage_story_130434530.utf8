                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rs 2o-25 cr paid to dissident MLAs, alleges Yeddyurappa
										                              
	Bangalore, Oct 11 (PTI): Railing against the opposition JDS and Congress for attempts to destabilise his government, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa today said that a comprehensive inquiry would be conducted to expose the "money power" used to lure MLAs.
    Alleging that Rs 20 crore to Rs 25 crore was paid to dissident MLAs, Yeddyurppa said he would order a comprehensive inquiry to expose this. "I will not spare them easily. I know from which source the money has come and how much money was distributed by each", he charged.
    The Chief Minister was addressing a press conference after he won the trust-vote by voice-vote.
    Despite winning the confidence motion, many ministers seem anxious about the fate of the Government and what action the Governor H R Bhardwaj may recommend.

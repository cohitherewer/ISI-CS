  - Laugh at Pakistan but remember Indias record isnt squeaky clean           OUR BUREAU                            Mohammed Azharuddin (top) Ajay Jadeja                                
	Hello this is Pakistani Radio Sports News.        
	First well start with the results of tomorrows match....        
	If you are tempted to gloat over this widely circulated text-message, you may do well to reflect if the joke is on Pakistan alone.        
	For, India hasnt come out of the past decades match-fixing scandals smelling of roses either, having allowed those under the cloud to have the last laugh.        
	Mohammed Azharuddin is today a member of Parliament, courtesy the countrys ruling party, though he continues to serve the life ban imposed 10 years ago by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). His challenge to the ban, defeated in a lower court in Hyderabad, is pending with a higher court.        
	Ajay Jadeja had his five-year ban overturned by Delhi High Court after three years, and became captain of Delhi and later coach of Rajasthan. He is now a celebrity cricket analyst on news channel NDTV.        
	Sure enough, a second SMS joke is also doing the rounds, saying the channel has an edge in match-fixing coverage because of Jadeja. The former player, however, has gone missing from NDTVs sports bulletins since the current spot-fixing scandal made headlines, having been replaced by Sunil Gavaskar.        
	The latest on the controversy is that Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamir were on Thursday dropped from the ODI series  apparently after the England players refused to play against them  but Pakistan said they had opted out because of mental torture. (See Sport)        
	None among the tainted trio, however, is accused of match-fixing, which was the charge against Azhar and Jadeja. Both were indicted for their close contacts and nexus with bookies/punters by former CBI joint commissioner K. Madhavan, whom the BCCI had appointed to examine the investigative agencys findings.        
	Madhavan said of Azharuddin: In his case, the misconduct is aggravated, as he was the captain of the Indian team for long and let down the country and the cricket-loving public in a despicable manner.                          
	Manoj Prabhakar, accused by the CBI of being close to bookies, was banned for five years too for unbecoming conduct as a national player, but has since coached the Delhi team.        
	It passes on a message to not just cricketers but also people at large that even if you are caught you will be accepted, said cricket writer Pradeep Magazine.                          
	Asked if the Congress ticket to Azhar in the 2009 general election did pass on such a message, party leaders hid behind technicalities, saying there was no criminal case against the ex-cricketer and that the BCCI, which banned him, was not a legal authority.        
	The partys problem is that Azhar was picked by a committee headed by Sonia Gandhi and fielded from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, a state directly handled by Rahul Gandhi.        
	It wasnt just the Congress, the Telugu Desam and the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen too had offered tickets to Azhar. One AICC functionary said it would have been impossible to keep out a candidate like Azhar when known criminals contested polls.        
	This argument, which seems to make light of sporting scams, appeared to win the CPMs endorsement too. Brinda Karat first refused to comment on the Congresss recruitment of Azhar, then said dismissively: The Congress has bigger tainted leaders. Why talk of Azharuddin?        
	The BJP response was restrained, with Rajya Sabha Opposition leader Arun Jaitley, who is also a BCCI vice-president, saying: I will not comment.        
	Ravi Shankar Prasad, the partys chief spokesperson, said it was a matter for the Congress.        
	One Congress leader fell back on the peoples verdict argument, saying Azhars popularity showed the people had forgiven him. The cricketer had himself aired this view after his poll victory, saying: If it (match-fixing) were an issue, would I have been elected? The people have given their verdict.        
	Some of the people, though, cant stop laughing at Jadejas absence from the small screen.        
	Hi, now that match-fixing has raised his ugly head once again, we will not see our beloved Ajay. We really miss u, MR. CRICKET EXPERT, wrote Soumya on Jadejas social networking page on the NDTV website social.ndtv.com/ajayjadeja.              
	Jadeja has not even been answering viewers messages on the website, which he did regularly till a week ago.        
	NDTV was not forthcoming with an official reaction despite phone calls and an email to their whole-time director K.V.L. Narayan Rao, who is travelling. A senior member of the channels sports team, speaking unofficially, said Jadeja was out of the country.        
	Please do not read too much into his absence from our bulletins. He had planned this visit before this story broke, she said.        
	She said the channel had hired Jadeja in 2005, two years after the high court lifted his ban. He had worked in several other channels before he came to us.        
	Azhar too seemed to realise the vulnerability of his position and went a little on the back foot on Thursday, two days after having sought punishment for the Pakistanis involved in the scandal.        
	Right now these are just allegations.... Anyone can say anything but at the end of the day (the) law will take its time, he said in Delhi.        
	Its in his hometown that Azhar has suffered the worst because of the scandal. When the controversy broke in 2000, he was virtually boycotted in Hyderabad, though part of his unpopularity had to do with his divorce and remarriage to Sangeeta Bijlani too.        
	His ill-conceived remark about being targeted because of his religion drew severe criticism from minority leaders and he had to retract it. Friends and close associates kept their distance even during Ramzan, and the Chandrababu Naidu government stopped inviting him to official iftars and VIP dinners.        
	The 2009 elections have ended the boycott but Azhar is still not much discussed in Hyderabad.        
	Magazine, the cricket writer, said the players alone shouldnt be under the scanner.        
	Its connected with the greed of cricket administrators. The team atmosphere becomes such that young players like Mohammed Aamir are pressured into such acts. Only banning youngsters like him wont help. There is a need to find out how the entire episode came about.

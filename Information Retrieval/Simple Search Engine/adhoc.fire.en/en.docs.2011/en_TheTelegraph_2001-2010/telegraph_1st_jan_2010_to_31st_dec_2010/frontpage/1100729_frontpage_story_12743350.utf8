  - Panchayats to be formed by Dec.10        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Governors adviser VS Dubey                                        
	Ranchi, July 28: Jharkhand today unveiled plans to hold long overdue panchayat elections under Presidents rule so that rural bodies were in place by December 10, a move that will ensure the state was no longer deprived of Centres grants to the tune of Rs 500 crore for backward regions.        
	At a marathon meeting presided over by governors advisor V. S Dubey, it was also resolved that the states first ever rural polls would be held under the State Panchayat Act, 2001, amended by the Shibu Soren government, allowing 50 per cent reservation for women and removing various anomalies regarding quotas for STs.        
	The ordinance to amend the act, earlier promulgated by the governor during Sorens tenure, was also tabled on the floor of Parliament today.        
	Among the others who attended todays meeting were state election commissioner S.D. Sharma, governors advisor R.R. Prasad, home secretary Rajbala Verma and DGP Neyaz Ahmed.        
	We are presuming that Parliament will ratify the ordnance within a week. Once that happens, we will go ahead with the elections. Tentatively, the elections will start on November 15, the state foundation day, Dubey said.        
	Dubey had earlier indicated they were looking at October 15 to start the election process. But the state will not be able to get requisite number of security forces as Commonwealth Games will be on in Delhi. Besides, there are major festivals like Dussehra and Diwali, he said.        
	So we decided to hold the elections from November 15, he added. The state, he said, would need over 70,000 security personnel for the panchayat polls that would be conducted in four phases. The entire process would be over by December 10.         
	Dubey, however, made it clear that these were tentative and could change in the case of exigencies.        
	We want to hold the elections as early as possible as the state is being deprived of around Rs 500 crore (allotted by the Centre to backward regions) every year. We have set deadlines for preparing several mandatory notifications. These are preparatory measures before the poll process starts, he added.        
	Deputy commissioners (DCs) have been asked to publish revised electoral rolls and also disintegrate the lists for every ward till July 31. Since the exercise was on for quite some time, he felt, it would not be a difficult job.         
	The DCs have also been told to notify the booths in every panchayat by August 7. All these should be over by August 20, he added.        
	State election commissioner S.D. Sharma said the commission was working in tandem with the state to hold the elections at the earliest.         
	Under the amended act, posts of zilla parishad chairpersons have been reserved for Scheduled Tribes in scheduled or reserved areas. In non-scheduled areas, Scheduled Castes and backward communities will be granted reservation proportionate to their population.        
	The state has decided not to reserve posts of zilla parishad chairpersons for Scheduled Tribes in non-scheduled areas. Besides, 50 per cent seats will be horizontally reserved for women. It means that women will be given 50 per cent reservation at all levels and everywhere.         
	The amendments were okayed at a cabinet meeting held on April 9.        
	Also, the panchayat elections will not be held on party lines in Jharkhand.

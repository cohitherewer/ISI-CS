	New Delhi, Aug. 1: Usain Bolt isnt the only one to balk at coming to the Delhi Commonwealth Games.        
	The revelation of Games-related corruption and poor construction seems to have sullied Indias image abroad, with dozens of foreigners calling to ask if it would be safe to sit in the stadiums.        
	To cap it all, Britains tax authorities have contacted the Indian high commission expressing doubts on the expenditure claims by UK firm AM Films, hired for Games-related services by chief organiser Suresh Kalmadi without a tender or written contract.        
	We get several calls daily from abroad and within India. People want to know if the stadiums are structurally safe or whether they pose a threat to lives, said an official at the Central Vigilance Commission, which last week exposed substandard construction of stadiums and corruption in the bidding process.        
	On Saturday, three people from Australia rang up very concerned  they have booked tickets for the event. All the callers are very excited. Its so embarrassing, the official said.        
	Instead of an opportunity to showcase the best of India, the Games may become cause for a loss of face. If theres any mishap, our head will hang in shame in front of the world.        
	Already last week, a Bengal diver got injured when a drainage cover came off at the Rs 175-crore SP Mukherjee swimming complex, opened on July 18. The complex is a mess of loose tiles and grills, scattered iron rods and unfinished staircases. When a part of its false ceiling too collapsed, the vice-president of the world swimming federation was provoked enough to call the construction shoddy.        
	Today, the Rs 150-crore weightlifting stadium, built partially with imported Canadian maple wood, presented a sorry picture at inauguration: of leaking roofs, waterlogged floors, a cracked ceiling and wet patches on the walls.        
	However, the issue on which Kalmadi seems truly cornered is the payment of 450,000 (Rs 3.2 crore) to NRI-run AM Films for transportation, accommodation and other services during the October 2009 Queens Baton relay in London. The baton, which reached Calcutta today, was released by Buckingham Palace in the presence of the Queen and President Pratibha Patil.        
	Kalmadi today claimed AM was drafted in at the last minute at the recommendation of the Indian missions protocol official, Raju Sebastian, and furnished purported email correspondence from Sebastian as proof.        
	But Indian high commission officials in London said they would need to check if the mail was genuine and claimed that Sebastian, a lower-division clerk, was too junior to have been dealing with such a decision. They said AM Films was not on the missions list of approved vendors.        
	When AM owner Ashish Patel tried to recover the value-added tax on the fees he had paid his suppliers, UK tax authorities expressed surprise at the lack of paperwork and sought the Indian missions assurance that Patel had spent the money he claimed he had.                    WITH INPUTS FROM AMIT ROY

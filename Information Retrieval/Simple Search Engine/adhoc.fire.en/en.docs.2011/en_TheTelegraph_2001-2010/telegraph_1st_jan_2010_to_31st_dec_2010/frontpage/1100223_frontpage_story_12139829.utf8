	Marjah (Afghanistan), Feb. 22 (Reuters): A Nato airstrike in Afghanistan mistakenly killed 27 civilians, the government said today, hurting a campaign to win over the local population and defeat Taliban insurgents.        
	The Afghan cabinet condemned the killings as unjustifiable after an aircraft fired on civilians, mistaking them for insurgents, in the south near the border of Uruzgan and Dai Kondi provinces.         
	Civilian casualties have caused friction between the government and foreign forces.        
	Initially the Afghan cabinet reported 33 deaths, but later clarified that 27 had died. Yesterdays toll was still the highest number of civilian deaths in months.        
	The incident was not part of Operation Mushtarak, a major Nato-led campaign to clear Taliban militants out of neighbouring Helmand province in the south.        
	Nonetheless, it could still undermine government and Nato efforts to win over civilians under a plan to wrest control of Taliban bastions and hand them over to state authorities before the start of a gradual US troop withdrawal in 2011.

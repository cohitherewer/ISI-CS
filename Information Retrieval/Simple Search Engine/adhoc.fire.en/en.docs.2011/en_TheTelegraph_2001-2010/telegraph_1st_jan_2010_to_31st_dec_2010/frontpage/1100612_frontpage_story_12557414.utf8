The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Force option for Manipur
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Force option for Manipur

	New Delhi, June 11: The Centre is considering using force against the protesters who have imposed an economic blockade on Manipur for the past two months.        
	The All Naga Students Association, Manipur, has blocked the states two supply lines, National Highways 39 and 53, since April 11 to express opposition to the autonomous district council elections. The Naga Students Federation has not been allowing any vehicle to enter Manipur from Nagaland since last month.        
	Delhi has been compelled to consider using force under pressure from civil society groups in Manipur.        
	It (force) is one of the options, a senior home ministry official said. Ministry sources said the decision to use force might be taken formally as early as Monday if no breakthrough was reached by then.        
	However, the sources said the government was still hoping the blockade would be called off. Force is the last option and we hope the issue will be resolved amicably, a source said.         
	Some Naga Students Federation leaders are now in Delhi, speaking to various political groups to explain their point of view. Apparently, they are also under pressure from the Nagaland government and the Naga Hoho to rethink their strategy.        
	The blockade had been intensified after NSCN(I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah was refused entry into Ukhrul, Manipur, in May.        
	Many accuse the Centre of blundering on the issue. While Delhi gave Muivah permission to visit his native village in Ukhrul, it failed to take the Manipur government into confidence. By the time it tried to sort things out, both sides had hardened their positions.

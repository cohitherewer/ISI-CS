          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Nov. 18: The spectrum controversy has embedded one figure in public consciousness: Rs 1.76 lakh crore, something that prompted Jayalalithaa to say the common man will be hard-pressed to find out how many zeroes do you add to this number.        
	Thats the presumed loss to the exchequer as a result of the decision-making by A. Raja, who has resigned as telecom minister, while issuing telecom licences and 2G spectrum in January 2008.        
	But what is lost in the cacophony is that this figure is based on some dodgy presumptions and raises questions about the number-crunching methods adopted by the audit sleuths at the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).        
	The CAG did put out four figures in its report while calculating the notional loss to the exchequer. It had worked in the caveats as well  but the largest number appears to have hogged the limelight.        
	The big beef really was over the way Raja had spurned suggestions from several quarters, including the Prime Minister and the finance ministry, to kickstart a process of price discovery for the 2G spectrum through auctions.         
	But hindsight can be a terrible thing and masks the perceptions and the realities that had existed at the time when the entire exercise was being carried out.         
	No one was certain how the 3G auction would go in April this year. In fact, two months before the auction, the government had estimated in its budget for 2010-11 that it would get only Rs 35,000 crore from the auction of spectrum for 3G services as well as broadband wireless access (BWA).         
	It will be interesting to ask  with the benefit of hindsight  who made this estimate and why it was never challenged by the people who now sing the virtues of price discovery from auctions.         
	The 3G and BWA auctions yielded revenues of Rs 1.03 lakh crore, which means the government had underestimated its receipts from the auctions by almost Rs 68,000 crore.        
	It is facile to claim that an auction would have yielded the same results for 2G licences two years ago. The truth is that Indias experience with auctions hasnt been great  witness the miserable results for the oil and gas blocks over the past 10 years.        
	But lets turn to the big figure  Rs 1.76 lakh crore  and see how the figure was arrived at.         
	The loss can be broken up into three categories: the 122 new licences for 2G spectrum (an estimated loss of Rs 1,02,498 crore based on the 3G pricing terms), the 35 dual technology licences (loss of Rs 37,154 crore) and the spectrum above the contracted quantity of 6.2MHz for existing players (Rs 36,993 crore).        
	But experts dont think this method of computing the loss to the exchequer is either fair or plausible.        
	Says the former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, Ved Jain: The calculation based on the auction of 3G spectrum is not the right thing. The telecom scenario in the country in 2008 was completely different from 2010. The market hadnt heated up as it had during the 3G auctions.        
	The CAG report, however, justifies the calculation on the basis of auction rates of 3G spectrum, stating that telecom regulator Trai had proposed in 2006 that it was fair to compare 2G with 3G and recommended 3G prices to be adopted as current price of 2G spectrum in 1800MHz band.         
	Trai in another report in May this year had said that all future allocations of second generation (2G) spectrum, beyond 6.2 megahertz (MHz) for GSM players and 5MHz for CDMA players, could be sold at prices discovered through the 3G auction.         
	With industry players contesting the proposal, Trai has gone back to the drawing board and is still debating the entire issue of pricing of 2G spectrum based on the 3G market price.         
	This is a serious issue and there are various telecom forums that need to study the case before reaching any conclusion on the notional loss to the exchequer, said former Trai chairman Pradip Baijal.        
	Industry experts contend that all operators who were granted spectrum in 2008 had received only start-up 2G spectrum of 4.4MHz in the telecom circles where they operate.        
	Going by this, the CAGs estimates of the notional loss to the exchequer because of non-auction of 2G spectrum would be much below the reported Rs 1.76 lakh crore, they added.         
	The CAG report confuses the issue a little more by coming up with three other yardsticks. The loss estimated by the CAG was around Rs 57,700 crore based on what Swan Telecom had received while offloading its equity in the market in new licences. Then again, the loss would be Rs 70,000 crore if the calculations were based on the price Unitech had earned after diluting its equity.         
	Another criterion adopted by the CAG to work out the potential loss was based on S Tels sudden offer to pay more for 2G spectrum: it had stepped up its offer from Rs 6,000 crore to Rs 13,752 crore for the allotment of 6.2MHz of spectrum for a period of 10 years.        
	With so many figures flying around, questions are being raised about the methods and the calculations.        
	Instead of attempting to come to a specific value of 2G spectrum which could have been possible only through an efficient market-discovery process, we have looked at the various indicators to assess a possible (presumptive) value, from the records made available to audit rather than going for any mathematical/econometric models, said an auditor.         
	To answer Jayalalithaas question, 10 zeroes have to be added after 176 to make it Rs 1.76 lakh crore.

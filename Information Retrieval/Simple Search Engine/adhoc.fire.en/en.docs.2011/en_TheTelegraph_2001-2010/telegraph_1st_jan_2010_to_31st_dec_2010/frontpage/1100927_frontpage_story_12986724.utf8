                          Salman Rushdie                    
	London, Sept. 26 (PTI): Author Salman Rushdie has termed the British monarchy and its traditions as stupid and archaic.         
	The winner of the Booker of Bookers, who has a penchant for controversy, said in an interview to The Sunday Times: The monarchy and its traditions are archaic stupid... a British oddity.        
	Asked, then why did he accept the knighthood, Sir Rushdie, now a British citizen, said he had received an honour from the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France, and it would have been extraordinary to accept something from the French state and then refuse something from my own country.         
	The 63-year-old author thought the ceremony was all structured around this furious archaic thing of queens and knights, all a bit stupid, but its what we do. And I think, thanks very much. We got our medal and left.

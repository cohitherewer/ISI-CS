  - SC rejects plea but recommends addition of two years          OUR BUREAU                                    
	April 22: The Supreme Court today recommended that the Bengal government consider raising the retirement age for college teachers from 60 to 62.        
	Although the court left the decision to the state, the observation is an embarrassment for the Left Front government and CPM education czars.        
	We cannot issue any direction to the state government to increase the age of superannuation since it is within the domain of the legislature or executive and certainly not within the domain of the judiciary, a two-judge bench said.        
	The issue has been on the boil in Bengal since the mid-1990s, when a lobby of college teachers had demanded the retirement age be raised from 60 to 62.        
	Last year, the Union human resource development ministry had suggested to state governments that the retirement age for college teachers can be raised even to 65, prompting college teachers in Bengal to renew their demand.        
	After a state administrative tribunal passed an order in favour of the teachers demand, the government moved Calcutta High Court, which set aside the order.        
	The All Bengal State Government College Teachers Association, an anti-Left body, then took the matter to the Supreme Court. Appearing for the association, its general secretary B.B. Chakraborty argued that since teachers did intellectual work and not physical work, their retirement age should be increased from 60.        
	Although the court agreed with Chakrabortys contentions and took note of his argument that longevity had increased in the country, it dismissed the associations appeal after recommending a sympathetic consideration of its demand.        
	We recommend to the state government to consider this aspect of the matter sympathetically and consider increase of the age of superannuation in respect of teachers to 62 years throughout the state because they only do the intellectual work and not physical work, the court said.        
	College teachers in Bengal welcomed the recommendation. Tarun Naskar, general secretary of the All Bengal University Teachers Association, another anti-Left body, said the state government should take immediate steps to raise the retirement age.        
	The government must change its policy; it will help solve the problem of lack of teachers in colleges, Naskar said.        
	State higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri told The Telegraph he was not aware of the apex courts recommendation.        
	The retirement age for college teachers in Bengal is 60 years. As of now I can only say that we do not have any plans to increase the retirement age, the minister said.        
	According to a teacher at a prominent city college, the main motive behind the governments opposition to raising the retirement age is political.        
	If the retirement age is 60 years, new teachers can be recruited frequently and that helps the CPM make political gains, the teacher alleged.        
	But with the winds of change blowing in Bengal, the West Bengal College and University Teachers Association (WBCUTA), a CPM-controlled association, has joined the chorus for a higher retirement age.        
	We support raising the retirement age for college teachers. But the Centre must bear the additional financial burden, said Tarun Patra, WBCUTA general secretary.

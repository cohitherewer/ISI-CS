          ANITA SINGH                            The Dharavi slum in Mumbai. File picture                                  
	London, Jan. 25: Indian authorities have accused Kevin McCloud, the television presenter, of damaging the countrys tourism industry by making poverty porn.        
	Diplomatic officials are preparing to lodge a complaint with Ofcom, the media watchdog, about the content of McClouds Channel 4 series, Slumming It.        
	In the two-part documentary, the Grand Designs host visited Mumbais squalid Dharavi slum. It showed children living among open sewers, dead rats and toxic waste, and residents scavenging on the citys rubbish dump.        
	Sources say the Indian high commission in London granted a filming permit in the belief that McCloud was making a programme highlighting Mumbais architectural history, and officials were horrified to see the end result.        
	We thought it would be about the architecture of Mumbai but it was only about slums, nothing else. He was showing dirty sewage and dead rats, children playing amongst rubbish and people living in these small rooms. He never talked about architecture at all. This was poverty porn made to get ratings, and we are upset, the source said.        
	Many people know India but for people who dont travel, they will think all of India is like this. Of course it will affect our tourism. It is not representative at all.        
	We are not saying, Dont show Dharavi, but the show was not balanced. There is so much more to Mumbai and so much more to India.        
	The original synopsis submitted by the programme-makers said: Kevin McClouds passions are buildings and people and he will explore the architecture of Mumbai... Maharashtrian, British, Gothic and post-modern.        
	The source said: When the production company applied, they said the name of the documentary was going to be Grand Designs. They said it was part of a celebration of all things India and that he would look at different kinds of architecture. He didnt do any of this. Only occasionally did he mention the community spirit and the low crime rate and the fact that rubbish is recycled there.        
	People forget that this nation is 60 years old. We are a young nation and its not easy to bring 300 million people out of poverty just like that.        
	Slumming It was part of Channel 4s ongoing Indian Winter season. Of the five programmes shown so far, four have been set in the Mumbai slums, including a Slumdog version of The Secret Millionaire  a reality show in which millionaires go incognito into impoverished communities and agree to give away huge sums of money.        
	The source accused Channel 4 of cashing in on the success of Slumdog Millionaire, the Oscar-winning film which kicked off the season.        
	McCloud has praised the community spirit in Dharavi, claiming that the British government could use it as a model for social sustainability. The Prince of Wales has hailed Dharavi as a model for urban planning.        
	In a joint statement, Channel 4 and the production company, talkbackThames, said: We have not received a complaint from the Indian high commission. The programme explores if city planners and architects can learn from the way Asias biggest slum has evolved and developed high levels of sustainability. Kevin McCloud follows everyday life in Dharavi and the film is a balanced and insightful account of his experience there.        
	While it raises issues such as acute levels of poverty and the lack of sanitation, the programme also highlights many positive aspects of life in Dharavi such as the real sense of community as well as low levels of crime and unemployment. We believe that the film raises some important points around the issues of poverty and city planning and is in the public interest.

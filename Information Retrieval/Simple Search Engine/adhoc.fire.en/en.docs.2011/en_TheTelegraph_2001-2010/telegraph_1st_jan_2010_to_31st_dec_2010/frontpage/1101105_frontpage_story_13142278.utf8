          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: Next time you brush off an unwelcome courier with advice to leave it at the reception, think twice. Especially if you happen to be the commerce secretary of the country.        
	A notice cancelling the credit card of a person named Rahul Khullar for failure to pay dues was pasted on the main entrance door of Udyog Bhavan on Tuesday.        
	Udyog Bhavan, part of the edifices of power in the capital, houses the office of the commerce secretary and the incumbent is named Rahul Khullar.        
	When The Telegraph phoned the commerce secretary at his home this evening to confirm if he was the man mentioned in the notice, the person who attended the call said: I have no wish to talk to you on this.        
	Udyog Bhavan staff stopped this reporter from taking notes on the contents of the notice and removed it this evening.        
	From what could be seen, the notice, attributed to SBI, said the credit card was being cancelled for non-payment of dues of Rs 35,773.50. Dated September 1, it reminded the said Khullar that he had not responded to three previous reminders to clear the dues. Another document, dated November 2, was pasted along with the letter.        
	The irony of such a notice outside an edifice that lords over commerce involving the country was not lost on the staff. One of them said it was a mischief done by a novice bank employee who had no understanding of power hierarchies.        
	A source said the employee pasted the notice at the entrance after he was refused permission more than once to meet Khullar. It could not be established if the dues were a subject of dispute or whether any complaint was pending.        
	The person had come before, too, with the request to meet Khullar. He told us that it was an important document that had to be hand-delivered. But we could not let him go in as there was no directive from the secretarys office, said an official at the reception.        
	The bank employee, apparently an officer, refused to leave, following which the staff phoned the secretary. The officials personal secretary asked the security staff to tell the visitor to leave Udyog Bhavan as he had not sought any appointment and that the document may be left with the reception.        
	The bank employee did what he was told and some more: he left the envelope at the reception and, on his way out, pasted a copy on the main door. We were taken aback. We did not know what to do. We thought it was illegal to tear off a bank notice, said the reception official.        
	However, later this evening, the notice was removed.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 2: The teaser rate home loan schemes may have to be wound up pretty soon.        
	The innovative home loan scheme, which the State Bank of India (SBI) pioneered in February 2009, became an instant hit in a highly competitive market by offering a deep discount interest rate in the first year before reverting to market rates in subsequent years.        
	Later, SBI sweetened the scheme by offering a discounted rate in the first two years, prompting a spate of me-too offers from competitors.        
	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  which had earlier sounded a warning against these schemes since borrowers were not fully briefed about the surge in their EMIs (easy monthly instalments) in later years  today decided to clamp down on teaser rate loans by raising the amount that banks must set aside to hedge against default risks.        
	The central bank raised the provisioning norm for teaser rate loans to 2 per cent from 0.4 per cent, which means that banks will now have to set aside an amount that is five times more than they do at present.        
	The new provisioning rule will apply to standard assets of commercial banks. A standard asset is a loan where the customer hasnt slipped on his repayment schedule. However, banks still have to make a provision to hedge against the risk of default.        
	Banks will certainly be discouraged from coming out with such teaser rate home loans from now on, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.         
	Another banking official said the alternative would be to raise the interest rates but that would blunt its appeal.        
	SBI had popularised teaser rate home loans by offering a fixed 8 per cent interest rate on home loans in the first year. Later, it would morph into a floating rate over the remaining term of the loan.        
	The countrys largest bank tweaked the scheme earlier this year. The existing scheme is valid till December.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said the bank had not decided whether to extend the scheme. We will take a call in December, he said, indicating that the bank would have to examine whether it would remain feasible after the new provisioning norm kicks in.        
	Explaining why it had raised the provisioning requirement, the RBI said banks often failed to assess in the loan appraisal stage whether the borrower had the capacity to repay at the higher rates in the subsequent years of the loan.        
	The RBI also seemed concerned about the prospect of a growing asset bubble in housing with property prices peaking above pre-crisis levels.        
	To counter the situation, the central bank raised the risk weight on residential housing loans of Rs 75 lakh and above to 125 per cent from 100 per cent. This effectively means that banks will have to provide more capital against such loans.         
	At present, banks have to set aside Rs 9 for every Rs 100 they lend (known as the ratio of capital to risk weighted assets). If the risk weight is raised to 125 per cent, it means that they will have to set aside Rs 11.25 for every Rs 100 they lend.        
	It is felt that banks are likely to pass on this increased cost to borrowers and, therefore, home loans above Rs 75 lakh will become expensive.         
	It may impact demand in the high-end residential segment but the mid and affordable housing sectors will not be impacted significantly, an industry source said.        
	The central bank also laid down a regulatory ceiling on home loans under which no bank will be permitted to provide a loan that is more than 80 per cent of the value of the asset being purchased.         
	In other words, if the cost of a house is Rs 1 lakh, banks can provide a loan of only up to Rs 80,000. The borrower will have to stump up the rest.        
	The new rule could unscramble the special tie-ups that real estate developers forge with a few banks for prestigious projects where customers have to put up only 10 per cent initially and 5 per cent on possession. Under the arrangement, the borrower pays 85 per cent through EMIs after taking possession. These arrangements may no longer be possible now, said a bank official.

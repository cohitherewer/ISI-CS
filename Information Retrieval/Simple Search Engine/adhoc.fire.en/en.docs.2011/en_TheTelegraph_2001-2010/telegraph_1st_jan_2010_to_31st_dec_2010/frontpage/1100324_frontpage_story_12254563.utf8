          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, March 23: The cabinet today agreed to look for 10,000sqft built-up space each in Dhanbad and Jamshedpur for setting up software technology parks.        
	In order to generate more employment, the decision to set up such IT parks across the state was taken by the Arjun Munda government a few years ago, but nothing much progressed.         
	Todays decision, however, does not clarify whether the state government will take rent or lease or acquire land to create 10,000sqft area in the two cities.        
	The cabinet also took a few other decisions some of which are as follows          
	The state will release its share of Rs 6.53 crore for the development of the Adityapur auto component cluster        
	The Backward Region Grant Fund (BRGF) schemes of the Centre and the state will be run in East Singhbhum        
	Power Finance Corporation Consulting Limited has been nominated the consultant to find out a joint venture partner developing Vanahardi coal block allotted to the JSEB.        
	It will be given a consultancy fee of Rs 21 crore. But the joint venture partner will have to pay back the consultancy fee to the JSEB.        
	The JSEB will be given another Rs 81 crore for renovation of Units IX and X at PTPS         
	The HEC has been given aid to the tune of Rs 72.80 crore against rehabilitation package

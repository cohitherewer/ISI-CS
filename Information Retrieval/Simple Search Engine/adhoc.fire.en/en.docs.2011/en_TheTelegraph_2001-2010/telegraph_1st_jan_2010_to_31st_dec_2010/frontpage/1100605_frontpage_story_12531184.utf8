	Ranchi/Bokaro, June 4: JMM chief Shibu Soren today rushed to Delhi with son Hemant to explore the possibility of forming a government in the state, using the Rajya Sabha elections as a bait.        
	Sorens move comes amid signals that Babulal Marandi is upset with the Congress for unilaterally renominating Dheeraj Prasad Sahu as its Rajya Sabha nominee.         
	The BJP central election committee, meanwhile, put the decision to announce its RS nominee on hold and authorised party chief Nitin Gadkari to decide by June 6, a day ahead of the deadline for filing nominations. The polls are scheduled for June 17.        
	Though the Sorens could not be contacted, party sources said they would be exploring options for talks with leaders of both Congress and BJP. They will try to buy support to form a government in lieu of the JMMs support to the other partys nominees for the Upper House, a JMM source said.        
	The JMM chief earlier clarified in Bokaro that his party was talking to top leaders of both UPA and NDA, but insisted that letting the cat out of the bag at this juncture would not be advisable.        
	A few JMM MLAs, including Mathura Mahto, held a meeting with Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto at the residence of Haji Hussain Ansari, only to reiterate that the JMM nominee for the Upper House was not final.        
	As the arithmetic for the Rajya Sabha polls stands, no alliance has the numbers necessary to bag a seat. So, the JMM-Ajsu approach will be crucial and could see the realignment of political forces after the elections.         
	The Assembly with 81 seats is divided into three blocks  Congress-JVM (25), JMM-Ajsu-Independents (25) and BJP-JD(U) (20). The role of the five-member Ajsu, too, will be crucial if the JMM does not put up its candidate. The support of 28 MLAs is required to elect a member of the Rajya Sabha.        
	Little wonder then that Congress state president Pradeep Balmuchu discussed the issue with Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto, before announcing the party nominee. The BJP is also in touch with Ajsu.        
	Meanwhile, Babulal Marandi said he had called a meeting of JVM office-bearers tomorrow in the aftermath of the Congresss unilateral decision to announce its candidate. We will neither indulge in horse-trading nor allow anybody else to do so, he reiterated.         
	Though Marandi would not elaborate on party strategy, a senior JVM leader said the Congress had declared its candidate without speaking to Marandi. The Congress wanted to talk to Marandi after announcing Sahus name, but he refused to oblige.        
	It wont be surprising if the JVM parts ways with the Congress and put up its own candidate in order to keep its 11 legislators together, said a senior JVM leader, requesting anonymity.         
	According to BJP sources, there is a keen tussle among three contenders  Dhirendra Agarwal, Ajay Maroo and Anil Sinha. Gadkari, according to sources, is already on a sticky wicket for mishandling the political crisis in Jharkhand. A defeat in the RS election will put a question mark on his leadership further, said a source in the BJP.        
	Earlier, speaking in Bokaro, Soren said the state would have a new government within four weeks as Presidents rule would not solve its problems. The JMM is in touch with bigger parties as well as Independent MLAs and also smaller parties for the formation of the next government, he declared, adding that one must keep in mind that without JMM support, no government in the state could survive.         
	Soren held two rounds of talks with Congress leader Rajendra Singh at the Bokaro steel plant guesthouse where the latter was understood to have delivered an important political message from Sonia Gandhi. Singh, however, said he discussed the Rajya Sabha elections with Guruji with a request that he should not nominate any outsider to the Upper House.        
	In another U-turn, Guruji said there were several candidates and leaders in the fray for a Rajya Sabha ticket, including former deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto and Sanjiv Kumar. Soren had declared Sanjiv Kumars name in Giridih yesterday.

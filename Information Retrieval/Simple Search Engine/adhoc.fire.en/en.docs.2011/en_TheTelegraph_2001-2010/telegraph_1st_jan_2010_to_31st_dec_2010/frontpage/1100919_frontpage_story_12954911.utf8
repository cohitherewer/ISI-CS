  - Morning fire at 22 camac street raises uneasy questions          A STAFF REPORTER                             Young shoppers outside 22 Camac Street after the fire on Saturday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: A minor, early-morning fire today exposed the lack of firefighting preparedness at the Camac Street building that houses Westside and Pantaloons, and prompted the question what might have happened had the flames struck in the peak Puja-shopping hours.        
	The fire broke out around 8.45am at Bombay Shiv Sagar, a vegetarian restaurant on the first floor of 22 Camac Street, long before the outlets and malls were to open at 11am and was put out before 10.30.        
	There were no shoppers in the building  which houses 35 establishments including a Pizza Hut outlet, the Amoda Spa Bar, offices and shopping malls  and none of the about 100 people present, mainly security and cleaning staff, was injured.        
	But the incident underlined that the city had learnt nothing from the disaster at nearby Stephen Court, following which a high-level committee had asked the fire department and civic authorities to ensure buildings observed fire-safety rules.        
	Fire officials said 22 Camac Streets fire hydrants were defunct and its lack of a generator delayed the firefight.        
	The fire had started in the smoke-exhaust duct of Bombay Shiv Sagar, divisional fire officer Tapan Ghosh said.        
	The duct was not cleaned regularly. Waste stored near its mouth on the terrace caught fire. It is a clear case of negligence, he said. The fire spread to an adjacent cable duct. Had it spread to the air-conditioner duct nearby, it would have been disastrous.        
	Fire officials said the alignment wheels in the buildings three fire hydrants, which control the flow of water from the underground reservoir, were defunct. The mall authorities said the reservoir had water, but what use is that if we cant reach it? an official said. The electricity had to be switched off after the fire, but there was no generator in the building (to operate the fire brigades pumps).        
	The tenants who own establishments in the building expressed anger at the lack of firefighting arrangements. We will withhold rent payment and pressure the management to make adequate firefighting arrangements. We pay thousands of rupees as maintenance charge every month, one of them said.        
	Its clear that no maintenance was ever carried out. Most of the equipment are not working; the rest are missing, Ghosh said.        
	All the establishments in the building opened in the afternoon except those on the first floor of Block B  including Bombay Shiv Sagar  and Amoda Spa Bar and Pantaloons. Amoda said its staff had gone home and Pantaloons said it hoped to open tomorrow.

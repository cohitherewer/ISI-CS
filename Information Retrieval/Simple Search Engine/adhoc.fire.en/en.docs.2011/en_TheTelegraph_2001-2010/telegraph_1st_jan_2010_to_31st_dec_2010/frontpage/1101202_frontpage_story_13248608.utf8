	Calcutta, Dec. 1: The stone did hit Tapas Kumar Bose, the inspector who was in the line of a missile hurled during a BJP march on Tuesday and whose photograph appeared in The Telegraph on Wednesday.        
	I never let my guard down. I dont know what happened yesterday. I was looking towards the left and trying to evade a stone hurled at me when another BJP supporter attacked me from the front. I failed to see it coming, recounted the officer-in-charge of Bowbazar police station, looking at a freeze-frame of the concrete chunk flying at him in todays newspaper.        
	Bose, 55, was hit while on duty at the BB Ganguly Street-Phears Lane crossing.        
	For the police veteran, the pain was as much psychological as it was physical. Nobody likes being hit, least of all a law-enforcer. A blow like that from a rioter is embarrassing as well. There was nothing I could do about it, though, he said.        
	Bose, running a fever and still on painkillers, said he did not take leave today because staying away would have sent the wrong signal to the troublemakers.        
	They had obviously come prepared to trigger mayhem on the streets despite their leadership seeking permission for the rally by saying that it would be a peaceful demonstration. We were completely unprepared for violence of this scale, he said.        
	The closest Bose had come to being attacked by a mob in such a manner was in 1999. I was then posted at Tollygunge police station. I was in plainclothes when a fatal bus accident triggered mayhem. I ran towards the vehicle to stop some youths from torching the bus, only to be hit on the forehead with a stone, he recalled.

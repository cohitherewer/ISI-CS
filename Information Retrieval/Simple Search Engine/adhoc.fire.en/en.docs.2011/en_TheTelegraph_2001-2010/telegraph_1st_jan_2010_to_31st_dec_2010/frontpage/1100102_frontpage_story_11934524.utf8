The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Last meal at NYs Tavern on the Green
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Last meal at NYs Tavern on the Green
										      K.P. NAYAR                        A diner soaks in the Crystal Room of Tavern on the Green on Wednesday, a day before the landmark restaurant shut down in New York. (AFP)				                                       
	Washington, Jan. 1: When I woke up in the new year, New York had changed forever, at least for me, and for many others who love reporting from the Big Apple. The famed 27,000 sq ft restaurant on Central Parks west side, Tavern on the Green, where I picked up many front page stories -- and lots and lots of gossip in the 1990s during prime ministerial visits to the annual UN General Assembly that was not for printing -- served its last meal on new years eve last night.         
	Tavern on the Green, has been a New York landmark since 1934 and its bankruptcy is a stark reminder that Americas economic catastrophe is only getting worse and will not alleviate in 2010, the brave front by president Barack Obamas spin masters notwithstanding.        
	Tavern on the Green is the second professional spot in the Big Apple that I have lost to Americas economic meltdown in the year that has just passed. The first was the Rainbow Room, which offered the best night-time, luminous view of Manhattans dazzling skyline. It was a poor substitute to Windows on the World, the 106th and 107th floor restaurant atop the North Tower of the World Trade Center that was destroyed on September 11, 2001.        
	But it was in the Rainbow Room and its adjacent facilities which occupied an entire 65th floor of the Rockefeller Center that everyone who counted big in the Big Apple had gathered for the finale of week-long celebrations of Indias 60th year as a free nation organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry.         
	That was when India was firmly put on the radar of Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange, a build-up to the countrys newly-acquired spot in the Group of Twenty nations that was formalised last year.        
	By a curious coincidence, both Tavern on the Green and the Rainbow Room opened their doors exactly 75 years ago when New York was clearly on the road to leaving behind Londons City in competitiveness as a global financial centre.        
	Their closure is evidence that places like New York and Washington, which had been expected to be the bulwarks against the rising tide of Americas economic disaster are no longer immune. Actually, New York thrived in one sense from last years onset of the economic crisis.        
	With the dollar declining for a while, foreigners picked up Manhattans real estate like never before at a time when properties were falling by the minute to foreclosures everywhere else in the US.         
	Like the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, which bought my favourite Art Deco landmark on Manhattans east side, the spectacular Chrysler Building for $800 million in the first weeks of the financial meltdown in 2009.        
	And tourists flocked to New York from Europe, China and South East Asia to take advantage of a weak dollar.         
	The slide of the dollar has stopped, at least for now. In fact, the currency has strengthened. But that has taken away New Yorks shield against a backlash from the travails of Wall Street, the long time patrons of establishments such as Tavern on the Green and Rainbow Room.         
	The closure of these two landmarks, and many other lesser known establishments in New York is a warning that barring a miracle, places like New York and Washington too will soon be up against the travails of the rest of America.        
	Yesterday, the US Labor Department released figures, which, on the face of it, held out optimism that claims for unemployment benefits had dropped, the job market was recovering and that the economy is slowly on the mend.        
	In fact, it is a conspiracy of silence embraced by the US media, which is spreading the illusion that life is getting better for Americans, not worse. Such figures are seldom challenged in the US media, ostensibly to avoid panic and make things any worse than they now are.        
	Yesterdays year-end unemployment claim figures, for instance, do not include millions of Americans who have already exhausted the benefits they are entitled to when jobs are lost: typically Americans get only 26 weeks of dole from states when they lose their jobs.        
	To avoid a crisis, the Obama administration and the US Congress have temporarily extended these benefits for 73 additional weeks, paid for by the federal government.        
	At least one million of these people will be without any unemployment aid by early March when these extended benefits begin to run out in February with many more millions to follow.        
	But by leaving millions in this category out of yesterdays figures, Americans have gone into the new year feeling good that things are getting better.        
	A record 20 million people collected unemployment benefits at some point in the US in 2009, a year that saw joblessness crossing 10 percent.        
	The jugglery with figures and the medias unwillingness to challenge them are reminiscent of Soviet era practices, when, for instance, East Germany was ranked as the 12th most industrialised country in the world. After reunification, West Germans discovered that they had inherited a shell economy in the east, bolstered by misleading figures just as the US government is doing now.        
	The year that has just ended saw as many as 140 banks fail in America. But almost everyone of those failures was announced on a Friday: many small towns in the US do not publish newspapers during the weekend and the ones that do have more features than news.        
	Even 24-hour television news channels have less news programming on Saturdays and Sundays. So most Americans are unaware that banks in the US are falling like nine pins on a bowling alley.        
	For those who enjoy black humour, there is something positive. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insures bank deposits here, is creating more jobs: in 2010, the FDIC, which acts as a receiver for failed banks, will increase its staffing by a significant 23 per cent.        
	Its available money to cover deposits has been beefed up and its operating budget has also been boosted, all of which point to more American banks failing in the new year.        
	Last week, a visiting friend wanted to go to an old haunt which he regularly patronised when he used to live in Washington. We bundled into a car and headed for the bar, but alas, it was no more.        
	The incident would not have meant anything if three other places that we went to that evening had also not closed their doors permanently.        
	But the closure of these establishments, unlike the landmarks in New York, do not leave any pervasive sense of loss. It is not only those like me who have reported from Tavern on the Green and Rainbow Room who will miss those bits of Manhattans history.        
	 quot;Rainbow Room quot; was the sort of place with a dance floor where affluent tourists in New York could fantasise that they were dancing under the stars, where every couple could imagine that they were Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, who patronised the place once.        
	New York heavyweights like Richard Parsons, the chairman of Citigroup, George Pataki, the former New York governor and philanthropist David Rockefeller Jr. all miss the Rockefeller Center Club, one of Manhattans most exclusive clubs, where they were regulars at breakfast, lunch or dinner. That too closed its doors in 2009.        
	It is often said across the world that governments are the last to fall. But Washingtons new wave of closures is a sobering brush with the reality that all will not be well here, as many hoped, in the year ahead.

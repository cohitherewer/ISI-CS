   PC letter arrives after six days          ARCHIS MOHAN MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                                     
	Dec. 27: When P. Chidamabaram wrote to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asking him to immediately disarm CPM cadres he may have been unaware that his ministry was sending the explosive missive by a carrier pigeon to underscore the urgency.        
	The mystery of light in Delhi, darkness in Calcutta about the letter has been resolved with a glimpse of how government communication travels. Six days after the letter being written, it was handed in by a delivery man from the General Post Office at 11am at the state secretariat today.        
	Home ministry officials in Delhi said the letter, dated December 21, was despatched via speed post the next day, blaming the holiday season and the postal departments inefficiency for the delay.         
	If anyone finds it surprising that government communication such as this travels by speed post, let this be revealed in the governments defence that fax machines are not unknown in officialdom.        
	For some unknown reason, this letter was not faxed to the office of the Bengal chief minister. Senior home ministry officials said such letters were usually faxed after they were despatched by normal/speed post.         
	One official cited a reason. It wasnt faxed as it was marked secret. If this is a new trick devised by the government of India to beat WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, the official did not say so.        
	A fellow bureaucrat found the defence a bit lame: It didnt remain much of a secret by Friday. That was the day when the operative part of the letter containing the words Harmad Vahini, which Mamata Banerjee is wont to use to describe armed CPM cadres, was leaked to the media but Writers Buildings said it knew of no such communication. And so did the situation remain till this morning.        
	Sources said the letter may have been leaked on the assumption that Writers would have received it by the afternoon of December 24. The leakers hadnt accounted for postal capriciousness.         
	Radhika Doraiswamy, secretary in the department of posts, said a speed-post letter from Delhi should reach Calcutta in two days, that is, by December 24 in this case. I do not know what went wrong with this one, she said, adding, if the holidays come in between, they wont deliver.        
	In Calcutta, the postal department was being treated more charitably. Officials in the chief ministers secretariat said the letter was despatched from the home ministry on December 24, three days after it was written.         
	It was sent out on Friday. Saturday and Sunday were holidays. We received it in the first hour of office today, said an official.        
	If it is true that the letter was leaked to assuage an angry Mamata Banerjee, who has been spitting fire over alleged misuse of the joint forces, the Trinamul leader would not be happy to learn it was lying in the home ministry for three days after being written.        
	It might lead her to doubt that despite the strong words  I would urge you strongly to... ensure that all armed cadres, either under the name of Harmad Vahini or any other name, are immediately disarmed and demobilised Delhi was less than serious.         
	Although the common practice is to send a fax on the day a letter is despatched by post, in this case none has reached the state so far. A senior state bureaucrat said the fax precedes the hard copy in cases where urgent or prompt action is needed.         
	The purpose of the fax is to urge the state government to initiate action without waiting for the hard copy. In this case, the home ministry did not seek any such prompt action that had to be taken before the hard copy reached the chief minister. That is possibly why there was no fax sent on December 21, the official added.        
	In other words, immediate in government language must mean not urgent.

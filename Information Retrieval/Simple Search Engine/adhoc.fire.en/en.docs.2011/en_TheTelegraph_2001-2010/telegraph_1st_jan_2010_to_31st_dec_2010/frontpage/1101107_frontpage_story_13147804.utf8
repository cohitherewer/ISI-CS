                                Kommersant journalist Oleg Kashin. (AFP)                            
	Moscow, Nov. 6 (Reuters): A leading Russian newspaper journalist was in a coma today after two men broke his legs, jaw and fingers in an attack his editor said was likely linked to his coverage of Opposition parties.        
	The Kremlin has been widely criticised by rights groups for doing too little to solve a string of journalist murders that have made Russia one of the most dangerous places in the world for reporters.        
	Police said they had opened a criminal case over the attempted murder of Oleg Kashin, 30, a political reporter with Kommersant, Russias best respected general news daily.        
	They didnt just rough him up. To make their point they broke the fingers of a journalist, Kommersant editor Mikhail Mikhailin told Reuters by phone. Im stunned.        
	Doctors induced a coma after Kashin was admitted to hospital with two broken legs, a damaged skull and a jaw fractured in two places, Mikhailin said. He said doctors would decide on Monday if they could remove him from intensive care.        
	Within hours of the attack, President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the prosecutor general and interior minister to take special control of the investigation, the Kremlin said in a statement. The criminals must be found and punished, Medvedev said on Twitter.        
	Kommersant cited witnesses as saying Kashin was attacked in an underpass near his Moscow apartment by two men. Its an attack on someone who was trying to tell the truth, the head of Russias journalists union, Mikhail Fedotov, said after the attack. There is no question it was linked to his work.

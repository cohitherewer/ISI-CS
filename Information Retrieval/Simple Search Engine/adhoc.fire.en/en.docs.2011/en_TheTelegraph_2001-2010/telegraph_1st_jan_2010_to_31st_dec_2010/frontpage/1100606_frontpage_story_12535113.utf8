The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pawar line comes under strain in Manohar rebuttal
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pawar line comes under strain in Manohar rebuttal
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  (From top) Manohar, Pawar and Modi                                 
	June 5: Shashank Manohars gloves are off.         
	After vowing not to fight through the media, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president today issued a media release, tearing into Lalit Kumar Modi.        
	In fact, one of the issues raised by Manohar, both during a telephone chat with The Telegraph and in the media release, is sure to make Sharad Pawar and his immediate family very uncomfortable.        
	Red-faced, actually.         
	It revolves around the unsuccessful bid for the Pune franchise by Aniruddha Deshpande, managing director of City Corporation Ltd. The Pawars hold over 16 per cent of the companys shares.        
	According to Manohar, Modi, the suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman and commissioner, didnt inform the governing council that Deshpande would be bidding in his individual capacity, the line now adopted by the dramatis personae  including the Pawars.         
	Thats ironic as Modi has accused Manohar of withholding information!        
	At no time did Mr Modi tell the governing council that Mr Deshpande would be placing a personal bid even though the tender documents were taken in the companys name. Why was that not revealed? Mr Modi has been portraying himself as being most transparent, but the reality is otherwise, Manohar said from his Nagpur residence.         
	Specifically, on that issue, the media release reads: Mr Modi, who claims to be above board in all matters, did not think this very cogent and important piece of information should be shared with the governing council members/officials. The bid could have been rejected at the threshold if it had been from Mr Deshpande, in his individual capacity, as it did not carry necessary information about the bidder.        
	Apparently, the supporting documents included an earlier resolution of the City Corporation Ltd board, authorising Deshpande to even run the team. The later resolution, asking the managing director not to involve the company, didnt feature at all.        
	It contradicts the stand of the Pawars, who have been insisting that theyve had nothing to do with any IPL bid.         
	Pawar, a former president of the BCCI, will get to head the International Cricket Council in a few weeks. Some associated with the world body have, privately, already begun questioning his association with the murkier side of the IPL.        
	That the BCCI is the strongest player (off the field, at least) is, for now, a huge plus for the Union minister.        
	To talk of Manohar and Modi.         
	I dont think Ive ever reacted to anything that has been said against me. However, Ive done so now because Mr Modi has (also) attacked the institution I happen to be president of. The public mustnt get the impression that the BCCI is packed with crooks, Manohar maintained during the telephone chat.         
	He added: Ideally, I like everything to be settled internally, but Mr Modi, who stands suspended, left me with no choice. The public should not be misled, thats my concern. As for what some may say about me, I leave it to the people at large to judge. Theyre aware of my credentials.        
	Manohar clarified that the IPLs interim chief, industrialist Chirayu Amin, had not been one of the bidders for the Pune franchise, eventually won by Sahara.         
	Modi, who headed the IPL till April 26, has claimed otherwise.        
	Mr Amin wrote to me on March 17 saying that if the bid (by City Corporation Ltd) was successful, then he would invest up to 10 per cent, but after getting the sanction of the BCCI.              
	I didnt place that before the governing council, ahead of the opening of the fresh tenders for the two new franchises (on March 21), because there was nothing definite. The operative word was if... one doesnt deal with ifs. Had a clear proposal been there, the matter wouldve been discussed. So, I didnt withhold information or hide anything from anyone.        
	Indeed, in the media release, Manohar has exposed Modi: The truth is that it was Mr Modi himself who sent a message to the (prospective) Pune franchisee, through Mr Ajay Shirke, president, Maharashtra Cricket Association, asking them to contact Mr Amin and to ask him to be a part of the consortium.        
	For the record, BCCI secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasan is involved with the Chennai Super Kings. Like Amin, vice-president from West, he sits on the IPLs governing council.         
	Manohars media release ends with the following: Mr Modi, who is in the dock, is trying to tarnish the image of the BCCI by making false and misleading statements time and time again when (in fact) the BCCI has landed in an embarrassing situation due to his misdeeds.        
	...The BCCI is the best-run sports body in the country and the image cannot be allowed to be tarnished by people like Mr Lalit Modi.        
	Modi is unlikely to stay quiet. Hell again be up to some mischief, sooner rather than later, a BCCI-watcher predicted.

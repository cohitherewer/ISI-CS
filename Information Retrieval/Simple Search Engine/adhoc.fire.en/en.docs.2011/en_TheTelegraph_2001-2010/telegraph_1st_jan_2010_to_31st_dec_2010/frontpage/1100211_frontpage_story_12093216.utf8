                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                SC eases a burden on doctors
  - Leeway for different   line of treatment        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: The Supreme Court today said doctors couldnt be held negligent just because they had followed a different line of treatment or opted for risky surgeries with perceived higher success rates.        
	A two-judge bench also made it clear that medical professionals had to be saved from malicious proceedings, as it underscored the importance of letting doctors operate without a halter round their neck.        
	The ruling clears the air on a grey area that sometimes prompted patients relatives to blame the line of treatment followed by a doctor and cite it as evidence of negligence.        
	The reference to the need to remove the halter around the neck does not carry much legal implications but the courts unequivocal statement will spell relief for doctors who complain of the sword of litigation hanging over their heads as they treat patients.        
	The clarification came as the court upheld the ruling of the national consumer disputes forum and threw out an appeal for compensation by the widow of a man who died following post-operative complications.        
	In their ruling, judges Dalveer Bhandari and H.S. Bedi said an error of judgement or an accident was not proof of negligence on the part of a medical professional.        
	So long as a doctor follows a practice acceptable to the medical profession of the day, he cannot be held liable for negligence merely because a better alternative course or method of treatment was also available or simply because a more skilled doctor would not have chosen to follow  that  procedure the judges said.        
	To prosecute a medical professional for negligence, the court added, it must be shown that he did something or failed to do something no medical professional would have done or failed to do.        
	The bench said there was scope for genuine difference in diagnosis and treatment and no medical practitioner could be hauled up for negligence merely because his conclusion differs from that of another.        
	The court pointed out that often a doctor had to adopt a procedure that involved a higher element of risk but which he believed had greater chances of success. (But) just because a professional looking to the gravity of illness has taken higher element of risk to redeem the patient out of his/her suffering which did not yield the desired result may not amount to negligence, it said.        
	It would not be conducive to the efficiency of the medical profession if no doctor could administer medicine without a halter round his neck. It is our bounden duty and obligation of civil society to ensure that medical professionals are not unnecessarily harassed or humiliated so that they can  perform their professional duties without fear.        
	The court said that at times doctors had to be saved from complainants who use criminal process as a tool for pressuring medical professionals/hospitals, particularly private hospitals, for extracting uncalled-for compensation. Such malicious proceedings deserve to be discarded against medical practitioners.        
	The ruling came on an appeal by Kusum Sharma, who had slapped a Rs 45-lakh compensation case for medical negligence against Delhis Batra Hospital and several doctors after her husband, a senior Indian Oil Corporation manager, died following post-operative complications.        
	Sharma had been operated upon twice at Batra Hospital, first on April 2, 1990, to remove a malignant tumour and again on May 23 to arrest complications after surgery. He died on October 11.        
	His wife alleged there was nothing in the hospital records to show that the tumour was malignant and needed to be operated upon.        
	The doctors claimed they had deleted all reference to cancer from the patients discharge sheet on his wifes request as she feared that her husband would become mentally disturbed if he came to know of his medical condition.

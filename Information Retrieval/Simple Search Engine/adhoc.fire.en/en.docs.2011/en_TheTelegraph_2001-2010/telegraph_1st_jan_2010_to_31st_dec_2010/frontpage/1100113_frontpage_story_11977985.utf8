  - Bonding over Indira, hilsa and symbolism           ARCHIS MOHAN AND CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            Mamata and Hasina hug in Delhi. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Daughter, the Dowager and Didi  between Hasina Wajed, Sonia Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee, theyve loosened the often stiff and ceremonial atmospherics of a state visit and lent it an air of intimacy.        
	Protocol was motioned to step aside to make way for the personal, subcontinental narratives became leaves of a family album, banquet menus were shunned for hearth meals savoured up close and gifts were chosen not to be ledgered into toshakhanas (official godowns) but to be treasured in shelves at home.        
	Hasina and Sonia rediscovered their common ties of politics and history, Hasina and Mamata their wistful separation by politics and geography.        
	Mamata gave Hasina notun gurer sandesh and a set of Dhonekhali saris and, after the two had supped a meal of rice and tangy Padma hilsa (ferried thoughtfully by the Bangla delegation) at the latters Maurya suite, Hasina presented her volumes one and two of her work collected thus far.         
	The railway minister was sharp to pick the right, and riverine, metaphor  Mamata spoke of her and Hasina being on the same boat rather than the same train, which she may well have employed given her current charge.                                            Hasina delivers a speech after receiving the Indira Gandhi prize in New Delhi. (AFP)      
	Sonia got the vaunted rows at the Rashtrapati Bhavan ceremony  to award Hasina the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize  vacated of a clutch of Union ministers  Ambika Soni, Mallikarjun Kharge, G.K. Vasan and Vayalar Ravi  so the Bangladeshi premiers sister, Rehana, and other family members could be seated up front.        
	The UPA chairperson was quick to spot Hasinas family relegated to the back of Ashoka Hall and made urgent corrections by instructing Soni.        
	As if to return the gesture, Hasina departed from text to pay glowing tributes to Indira Gandhi that went beyond her role in midwifing Bangladesh. Recalling the aftermath of her father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahmans assassination in August 1975, Hasina said: We had nowhere to go at that time. Our government then did not allow us to return to our homeland. It was Indira Gandhi who gave us shelter. We took political asylum and stayed in Delhi for six years. Indira at that time, she said, was truly like our mother.         
	Both Hasina and Sonia are women of destiny and tragedy, and today, also among the worlds most powerful. Quite like the woman they jointly recalled: Indira.        
	Her (Indira) name is, of course, inextricably linked with the birth of Bangladesh, said Sonia. Indira Gandhi derived so much inspiration from her father. You too followed your fathers footsteps. You have been a fighter from the student days, and have experienced blood and tears, suffered and lost almost your entire family and lived in exile.        
	She also recalled the coincidence  perhaps crafted between the first India visit of Sheikh Mujib on January 10, 1972, and Hasinas own arrival this time on the same date 38 years later. Even today, I can sense the euphoria and excitement of that historic moment, Sonia said.        
	Freed from a Pakistani jail, Sheikh Mujib was then on his way to his newly independent country. His daughter had arrived all these years later to give that country a new set of ties that bind it to the country that gave its blood so Bangladesh could be born.

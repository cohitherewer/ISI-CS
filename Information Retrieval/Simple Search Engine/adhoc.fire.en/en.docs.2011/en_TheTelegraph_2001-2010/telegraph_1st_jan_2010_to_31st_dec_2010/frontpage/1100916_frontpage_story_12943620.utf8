The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Delhi defers hard decisions
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Delhi defers hard decisions
  - Breather for Omar but fissures on armed forces act          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                            Farooq and Mehbooba                                       
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: Beleaguered Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah earned a reprieve and a baffled Centre bought itself yet more time today.        
	They papered over sharp strategy differences and postponed any hard decisions on Kashmir until an all-party team returns with a first hand assessment of the increasingly angered and intransigent mood in the Valley.        
	There was no takeaway for Kashmir from a five-hour all-party session at the Prime Ministers house. There was for Omar Abdullah.        
	The chief minister who chose to sit out of the meeting even though he was in Delhi  perhaps to avoid being face to face with demands that he quit owning responsibility for the Valleys drift into anarchy  clearly appeared to have bought a fresh lease in power.        
	Emerging from the all-party meeting, his father and National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah emphatically denied any governance deficit under Omar and claimed his son had been praised by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	It was a very encouraging meeting, we are very satisfied, a beaming Abdullah said, not wanting to engage in any questions over either Omars future or the rift between the NC and the Congress.                                
	A whisper campaign for Omars removal had begun in sections of the Congress, and the NC had hit back alleging a conspiracy to destabilise the chief minister. Omars failure to contain the violence in the Valley and his near-total disconnect with the Kashmiri street have placed him in deficit with the Centre which has begun to look at other options. But sources told The Telegraph that in the absence of any substantive decision on the way ahead, the Centre has decided not to open another front by unsettling Omar at the moment.        
	Omar did come for sharp criticism from PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, who believes his removal is a necessary first step to corrections in Kashmir. But then neither Mehbooba nor the BJP (which too has demanded Omars dismissal) thought it fit to push the demand during the all-party meeting.        
	Precarious and ill at ease till yesterday, Omar will now host the all-party delegation which, in all likelihood, will be headed by Union home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	But Kashmiri voices are already labelling it a futile and farcical exercise. Amid the clamour of contrary notes emerging from the all-party meeting, a top PDP leader said: What is an all-party delegation going to tell us about the Kashmiri mood that we do not already know? This is just a blundering governments face-saver, it obviously does not know what to do.         
	Consensus continues to elude the government on what do with the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). All parties other than the BJP and the Shiv Sena appeared to back revocation of the armys special powers in the Valleys non-border districts but Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs problems on the issue lie within.        
	Some senior Congressmen from the state like Ghulam Nabi Azad and the defence establishment have bluntly opposed any tinkering in the name of preserving national security interests.        
	Congress president Sonia Gandhi chose not to speak her mind on the subject, saying that my party is willing to support a process of healing and dialogue in partnership with the people of the state.        
	The Prime Minister, too, made no direct reference to the AFSPA and instead spoke in general terms on the need to restore peace. Both leaders struck a sombre note on the loss of lives in Kashmir and stressed that there needs to be introspection on why Kashmiris, especially the youth, are so irate. We know that there are some inimical forces within and beyond the State, Sonia said, But we also must ask ourselves why is there so much anger? Why is there so much pain, in particular among the youth? We must give them hope, we must understand and respect their legitimate aspirations.        
	In a pointed plea to go the greater distance in meeting the grievances and aspirations of Kashmiris, she said: We need to be magnanimous and mature in our approach, as befits a strong, confident and inclusive democracy. This alone, I believe, can create space for reconciliation and bring an end to turmoil and conflict.        
	The unstated message from both is clear --- they are for revocation of the AFSPA, if only as a symbolic sop to Kashmiris, but they would ideally like unanimity on the move. The reassertion of their advocacy of the AFSPA by the BJP, and the armys blunt no to being able to operate without the act make it plain that if the Centre does want to push its line, it will have to demonstrate the will to stand by its convictions even if it runs against complete consensus.

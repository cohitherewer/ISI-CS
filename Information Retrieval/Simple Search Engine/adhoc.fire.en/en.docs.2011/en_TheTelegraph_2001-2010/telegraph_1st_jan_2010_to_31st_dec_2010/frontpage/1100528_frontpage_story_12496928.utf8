	 Jhargram (WB), May 28 (PTI):Sixty-eight passengers of a Mumbai-bound express train were killed and 200 injured in a Maoist attack here early Friday that derailed 13 coaches, five of which were hit by a goods train coming from the opposite direction.
    Maoist-backed People's Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA) claimed responsibility for the derailment of the Howrah-Kurla Lokmanya Tilak Gyaneshwari Super Deluxe Express that occurred in eastern India's West Midnapore district, about 150 kms from Kolkata.
    Confusion prevailed over whether a bomb blast or an act of sabotage by removal of fish plates led to the derailment, in yet another Naxal attack targeting railways.
    "PCPA has left two posters near the rail tracks clearly owning responsibility for the derailment," IGP (Law and Order) S Karpurakayastha told PTI in Kolkata.

	New Delhi, May 24 (PTI): Describing Naxalism as the biggest internal security challenge of the country, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the Central government must help the states to deal with the menace.  
	 quot;This is a problem which has acquired (such a) magnitude that cooperation between the Centre and states is absolutely necessary and the Central government must help states in every possible way, quot; Singh said at a national press conference here.  
	He, however, said law and order was primarily the state governments responsibility.  
	 quot;As far as I am concerned, I do recognise that law and order is primarily a state responsibility, quot; he said.  
	Asked about Home Minister P Chidambarams statement that he had a limited mandate in tackling the Maoists, Singh said the minister had already explained what he had meant by his statement on the issue.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 20: Milk prices could increase in northern India, Sharad Pawar has indicated, triggering fears of a cascading effect in the east and a demand from Mayavati for his ouster as agriculture minister.        
	If milk costs more as the minister suggested, it will join a basket of sugar and other everyday food articles whose prices have shot up recently.        
	Pawar suggested that the price of milk would increase because of a dip in production and asked states to decide on the co-operatives demand for higher rates to ensure procurement.        
	Unless there is a decision (on prices), I do not know whether the states will be able to procure (milk) to meet the demand. We are facing insufficient availability of milk, especially in north India. In October, we had taken a decision on prices. Today, there is a demand that we should hike the prices, Pawar told a conference.        
	There is a gap of 18 lakh tonnes between demand and the current milk supply, he added.        
	Milk prices in Bengal range between Rs 20 and Rs 26 a litre. According to industry sources, any increase in prices in northern India will push up prices in Bengal, a milk-deficient state.         
	We are dependent on the north Indian states for skimmed milk powder and butter. So, if milk prices go up there, it will have an impact on prices here as our cost of production will go up, said A.K. Chanda, chief general manager, Mother Dairy, Calcutta.         
	A higher procurement price in northern will have an impact on fresh milk prices as well, he added. Producers here will also demand a higher price, Chanda said.        
	Pawar, however, dismissed suggestions that he wanted an immediate hike in milk prices. It is a state subject. We dont take decision here. No state has demanded a hike in milk prices. Some states have said here that three to four months ago they had raised milk prices, which have improved the supply, he added.        
	But Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati accused Pawar of making irresponsible statements that were actually encouraging hoarders and black marketers.        
	Mayavati said she would not attend the January 27 conference called by the Prime Minister to discuss price rise unless Pawar is removed from the ministry. The Prime Minister should immediately show the door to Pawar. If he does not do so, it will prove that Pawars statements on price hike have the backing of the Prime Minister, she added.

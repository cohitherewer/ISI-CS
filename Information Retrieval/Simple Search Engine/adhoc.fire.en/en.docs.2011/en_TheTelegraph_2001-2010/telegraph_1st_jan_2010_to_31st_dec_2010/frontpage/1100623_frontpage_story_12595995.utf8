The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pending MoUs on HC radar
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pending MoUs on HC radar
          CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE                              
	Ranchi, June 22: In its strongest admonishment yet for the sluggish pace of industrial growth, Jharkhand High Court has asked the administration for a report on the status of all pending MoUs, observing that the state, rich in natural resources, cannot be allowed to sell its abundance for a pittance.         
	A division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Sushil Harkauli and Justice D.N. Patel indicated its displeasure at the lackadaisical approach by the powers that be while hearing a PIL on the matter and gave the administration two months time to come out with the status report.        
	Ironically, the courts observation comes a day after the industries department completed a review of all pending projects wherein investors were invited to participate and also air their grievances.        
	While it was decided to annul at least six MoUs of companies who had shown no interest in getting their proposals off the ground, several steel firms, who had undertaken substantial work, blamed pending forest clearances and land issues for their inability to launch projects.        
	Today, while hearing the PIL filed by Ma Adishakti Bhrashtachar Unmulak Ebam Nagrik Adhikar Raksha Samiti, Jharkhand High Court directed the administration to examine and technically analyse every MoU signed with private companies and explain the hurdles in their implementation.        
	The samiti, an NGO that claims to work for peoples rights, has alleged that because of the delay in implementation of the MoUs, there has been no development in the state.        
	The samiti requested the state to constitute a cell to monitor the pending MoUs and tackle the problems due to which the agreements could not be enforced. The monitoring cell, it said, should also chalk out solutions for the state and private companies.        
	The counsel for the samiti told the court that ever since Jharkhand was formed, the state had entered into more than 50 MoUs. Yet there were only a handful of industries in the state.         
	New entrepreneurs who wished to invest in the state shied away at the attitude of the government, the samitis counsel said.         
	Had the government been more cooperative and interested in honouring the MoUs signed with private companies, the state would have had more industries and there would have been more development, the petitioner added.        
	The samiti also pointed out that had the MoUs been honoured, they would have opened up various employment opportunities for those living the hinterlands.        
	The state had rich mineral resources which were not being tapped uniformly. Agriculture alone wasnt enough for the states prosperity and industrial development was the key to growth in Jharkhand, the samiti maintained.

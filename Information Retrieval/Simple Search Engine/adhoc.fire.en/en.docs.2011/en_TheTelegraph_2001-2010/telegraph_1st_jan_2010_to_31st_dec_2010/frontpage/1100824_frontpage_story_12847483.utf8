	Aug. 23: Fifteen years after turning pro, the Asansol-born Arjun Atwal has become the first golfer from India to win a US PGA Tour event. He entered the record books in Greensboro yesterday by topping in the Wyndham Championship.        
	The 37-year-old Atwal, who has close ties with Calcutta and the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), spoke to The Telegraph from his Orlando residence this morning  it was then well past 1am in Florida and hed just arrived from North Carolina.         
	Excerpts:        
	Q: What were your first thoughts after the biggest win for an Indian?        
	A: (Laughs) Not much, actually... It didnt sink in immediately.        
	Q: But you must have been aware that youd created history, scripted a defining moment in Indias golf...        
	A: Its for you, in the media, to dwell on the history bit... I wasnt thinking of it. Rather, I was focused on what I needed to do... Where Im concerned, I see this win as the fulfilment of something Id set out to achieve many years ago... Its personal gratification... Id been working hard, but not getting the results... Today, it feels good.        
	Q: So, what made the difference in Greensboro?        
	A: I was able to put together four rounds of good golf, I was consistent. Id been playing well in recent months, but never for four rounds in one tournament. Things changed in the Wyndham Championship.        
	 Q: Having had to qualify, frankly, how much of a chance did you give yourself?        
	A: Look, Ive got to tell you this... When I qualified, last Monday, I told my caddie (Laddie) that Id win... I did, believe me... I said I had nothing to lose and, so, would give it my all. I was right.        
	Q: How important a role does Laddie play in Team Atwal?        
	A: He keeps me calm... Like yesterday, in the heat of the situation, he ensured I remained relaxed... Generally, he keeps it light on the course, idea being that I relax. Hes been with me for a year.         
	Q: Is he getting a bonus?        
	A: Yeah... Hell be happy.         
	Q: Besides taking home $918,000, you won back the PGA Tour card. What gave more satisfaction?        
	A: Oh, the card, most definitely... I dont need to go through the qualifiers for the remainder of this year and the next two years... Among other tournaments, Ive qualified for the champions-only event in Hawaii, next January, Augusta and the PGA Championship... I have plenty of opportunities ahead of me.        
	Q: Did the vanquished have anything to say?        
	A: Hardly met anybody, because theyd left by the time I finished.        
	Q: Who are you dedicating this win to?        
	A: My family... Parents (Bindi, Rupi), wife Sona and kids (Krishan, Shiva)... Ive been blessed to have such a supportive lot around me.         
	Q: Celebrations...        
	A: (Laughs) Probably something at home in the evening... My friends want a big party.         
	Q: It wasnt an easy field... Were you, for example, tense towards the close?        
	A: There was nervousness, yes. I guess, in such situations, one has to stay calm. I did and went for it (the trophy).        
	Q: Has Tiger Woods congratulated you?        
	 A: He did, yes... Tiger said he was proud of me.        
	Q: Did he call or text a message?        
	A: Tiger called, soon after Id won.         
	Q: Just how much have you gained by being Tigers practice partner?        
	A: Lots... Tiger has been the No. 1 for years. Ive gained not merely as a golfer, but as a person. I consider myself fortunate to have him as a friend. I value the relationship.         
	Q: At the highest level, what counts for more  skills or mental toughness?        
	A: Both... You cant have one and not have the other... Mental toughness and skills complement each other. You need the skills to reach a particular position and, once there, you need mental toughness to go further.        
	Q: How do you get over the tough times, either on the course, or off it, if youre injured?        
	A: I just keep going... It helps that I have such a supportive family... I have a tendency to get a bit low, but my wife is a real pillar of strength. She keeps saying I cant afford to feel that way... Says other things, too... Like, when I got back home, one of the first things she said was that I needed to lose weight!        
	Q: Thats being hard, isnt it?              
	A: (Laughs) I told her lady, you count the cash and leave it at that.        
	Q: Youre driven by goals.        
	A: One has to be driven by something.         
	Q: Its said that whenever youre really being challenged, you think of the late Swami Satyanand, from Munger. Is it so?         
	A: Thats correct... Swamiji is no more, but he remains my guru. I continue to draw strength from him... Its a very personal thing.        
	Q: Being thousands of miles away, do you have occasion to reflect on your RCGC connection and the role it has played in your development?        
	A: Of course, I have fond memories of Royal... In fact, at the presentation, when I was asked whether Id ever played at an old-fashioned facility, like the Sedgefield Country Club, I found the question odd... I had to tell the audience that Id been brought up on the greens of RCGC, which today is 181 years old! The US doesnt have anything that old... Im proud of my Royal connection.        
	Q: Finally, what next?        
	A: (Laughs) A lot more wins! I know Im capable of adding to the silverware I dont have a PGA Tour event for the next six weeks or so, so I could head for Europe and play there for a couple of weeks... As we speak, though, Im not sure.  
	YOUR QUESTIONS  
	 What has Arjun Atwal achieved?  
	 Atwal, 37, became the  first Indian golfer to win   a US PGA Tour event   by lifting the Wyndham Championship on Sunday in Greensboro, North  Carolina. The US PGA
  Tour is the most coveted Tour in the world.  
	 Is it an achievement only in the Indian context?  
	 No, the Florida-based Atwal has done what no one in the world has for 24 years: win on the US PGA Tour as a ldquo;Monday qualifier. rdquo;  
	 Who is a Monday  qualifier?  
	 Someone who has come up through an early-week qualifying event, held
  before the main tournament for those not automatically eligible for the main event.  
	 Why was Atwal  not eligible?  
	 He ldquo;lost his Tour card rdquo; last month after a poor run.  Earlier, a shoulder injury had prevented him from playing and earning  prize money.  
	 Has the situation changed now?  
	 Yes. The victory has earned Atwal his status on the US PGA Tour for the rest of
  this year and the next two years. He will now qualify automatically for  Tour events.  
	 Is winning a US PGA  Tour event the ultimate  in golf?  
	 It is a close second.  Winning one of the four  Majors is the ultimate. These are: Augusta
  Masters, US Open, The (British) Open and PGA Championship.  
	 What does Atwal rsquo;s   victory mean for  Indian golf?  
	 ldquo;It rsquo;s a defining moment, rdquo; said Brandon De Souza  of Tiger Sports Marketing. ldquo;Jeev Milkha Singh, Jyoti Randhawa and Atwal had shown earlier that Indians could win in Europe and Asia. Now Atwal has crossed the last frontier. The only thing left is for one of them to win a Major. rdquo;  
	 What does it mean  for Calcutta?  
	 Atwal was brought up in Calcutta, where he learnt his early golf lessons. He played at the RCGC, and still does whenever he visits his old city.  
	 ldquo;He was a wild kid, playing at RCGC, with enormous talent. He always had his sights set on the US tour. He is the best dreamer  on a golf course I have seen. Now, he will be
  a bigger role model,  encouraging youngsters  in Calcutta to take to golf, rdquo; De Souza said.

	Ratu (Ranchi), Oct. 29: Jyotsna Singh, BDO of Ratu, was so happy to be among the first in Jharkhand to get a 12-digit Adhar number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) that she kept it in her office for the first few days to show off!         
	Jyotsna is among first 100 officials and government employees of the block, around 18km from Ranchi, who got their Adhar cards delivered at their doorstep by India Post after they got themselves enrolled and their biometric samples taken ever since the UIDAI drive was launched in the state on September 24.        
	I got my Adhar ID card a day before the puja holidays. As I was among the first few to get the UID numbers, I kept the document here in my office for about four days to show others, she said.        
	The authority had promised to deliver the cards within 25 days of recording personal details. But some, like Jyotsna, were pleasantly surprised to get their cards within 20 days flat.        
	I got my Adhar number yesterday. And I am happy to note that the ID card is error free, said Vijay Bahadur Singh, block agriculture officer of Ratu, proudly displaying his card bearing number 6768 0875 5975.         
	Enrolment for Adhar numbers was launched in Jharkhand from Ratu block on September 24 and continued till October 6.         
	Initially, around 400 officers and government employees of the block were enrolled and their biometric samples sent to the UIDAI headquarters in Delhi, which prepared the cards with the unique numbers and got them delivered.        
	The government employees were specifically chosen so that they could act as introducers when the enrolment drive, including collection of biometric samples, moves to villages.        
	The idea is to have the introducers identify and vouch for persons without any official ID before they are enrolled for a UID number.        
	 The task of enrolling villagers for Adhar numbers may be taken up from the first week of November. Details are being worked out, said Arbind Prasad, assistant director-general of UIDAI for Jharkhand.         
	 Once allotted to an individual, an Adhar number becomes his unique ID number which can be used by him/her to avail of any service at, say, a government department or a banks etc.        
	State rural development department has been notified as registrar of the UID project that is being taken up initially in the five districts of Ranchi, Lohardaga, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Deoghar.

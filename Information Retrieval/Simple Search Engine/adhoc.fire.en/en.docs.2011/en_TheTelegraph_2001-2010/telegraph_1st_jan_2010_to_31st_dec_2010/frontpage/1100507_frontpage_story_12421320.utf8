	 She wants to join the IAS, preferably in the Uttarakhand cadre. We are elated. Its definitely a matter of pride for all of us, said her mother Sudesh Lata Sundriyal.         
	Tanvis optional papers were sociology and public administration. She cleared her Class X Board exams in 2000 from Ranchis Delhi Public School before switching over to Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali for her Plus two.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                All-party team to meet PM on drought
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 12: Chief minister Arjun Munda today chaired his first all-party meeting that resolved to meet the Prime Minister and request him for a package to help the state execute drought relief measures, signalling an effort to build consensus among his allies and the Opposition on serious and contentious issues facing Jharkhand.        
	Attended by all ministers, except deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto, who is away at Vaishno Devi for a pilgrimage  Chandra Prakash Chaudhary represented Ajsu  the meeting also advocated the declaration of a famine code in the state, but Munda maintained that the situation did not warrant that as of now.        
	I am happy that representatives from almost all leading political parties participated in this meeting and gave their suggestions, Munda said. When the state was under Presidents rule, a central team had visited drought-hit areas, but we are not aware of what happened to the committees report. Now, I will be meeting the Prime Minister with an all-party delegation. Let us hope that things work out well, he added.        
	On the demand for imposing the famine code in the state, the chief minister seemed reluctant as of now, but did not rule out its possibility in the near future. We dont want to make it a cry wolf story, Munda clarified.        
	Tomorrow, if a famine-like situation really arises, no one will believe us. Considering the quantum of rainfall received and subsequent cropping in different areas, Jharkhand is not a fit case to be declared famine-hit. We dont want to lose our credibility before the world. However, we will keep an eye on what was happening and will do the needful accordingly, he added.        
	Todays meeting also decided to set up all-party committees in various districts to review the drought scenario and monitor relief measures at the ground level. Gradually, such committees will be replicated at block and panchayat levels.        
	Leaders hoped that since elected panchayats were likely to be in place by the end of the year, monitoring drought relief schemes would become easier for the state government.         
	Munda reminded parties that his government had already decided to provide 20kg foodgrain at Re 1 per month to 11 lakh BPL families and also to those whose names did not figure in the list.        
	Also, strict implementation of welfare and job schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme would also be ensured, he promised.        
	Senior Congress member and leader of the Opposition Rajendra Prasad Singh opined that in the larger interests of the state, Opposition parties were ready to extend all possible help to the Munda government on the issue of drought.        
	But, the state government should also talk to DVC and coal companies to enable farmers to use water available in mines and dams, he said. This apart, Congress delegations would also be meeting the Prime Minister and Union finance and agriculture ministers to request them to send teams to remote areas to assess the drought situation in detail.        
	RJD state president Girinath Singh stressed on activating irrigation projects, especially in rain shadow areas of Palamau division.         
	JVM principal general secretary Pradeep Yadav said he was happy the government gave a patient hearing to his partys views on the famine-like situation, but added it was too early to certify that it was doing good job.         
	CPM state secretary J.S. Majumdar opined that it was a good start. The CPI-ML (Liberation) walked out of the meeting once Munda started speaking. We were not given an opportunity to present our views. Moreover, the governments approach lacked seriousness, said partys state secretary Janardan Singh.

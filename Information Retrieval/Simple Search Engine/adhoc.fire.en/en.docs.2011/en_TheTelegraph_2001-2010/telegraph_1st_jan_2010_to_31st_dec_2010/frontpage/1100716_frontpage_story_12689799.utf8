	Ranchi, July 15: The Supreme Court order permitting Tamil Nadu government to go beyond the 50 per cent cap in education and jobs if quantifiable data justified it is likely to stir a hornets nest in Jharkhand with two former chief ministers asking the governor to open the case.        
	Former chief minister Babulal Marandi wanted Governor M..H. Farook to call an all-party meeting if the state wished to reconsider the Jharkhand High Courts interim order of 22, August, 2002, which had quashed the 73 per cent reservation policy adopted by his government.        
	The 73 per cent quota was implemented by the Marandi government based on the recommendation of a cabinet sub-committee headed by then welfare minister Arjun Munda.        
	Munda, now the BJP general secretary and Jamshedpur MP, said the governor should make an amendment in the states reservation policy in view of the apex court order.         
	The Supreme Court has indirectly endorsed our recommendations, he said.         
	Marandi, who said he had agreed to hike quotas for the sake of backward classes, was of the opinion that the issue should either be settled through an all-party meeting now or be left for the next elected government to decide on.        
	Following various PILs on the states quota policy, a five-member constitution bench of Jharkhand High Court had granted 50 per cent reservation for state government jobs and admission to educational institutions in its interim order.         
	The bench also reserved 27 per cent for general and open categories with the remaining 23 per cent to be decided on merit till the Supreme Court came out with its final order in the TN case.         
	On October 8, 2002, the Marandi government announced a new reservation policy, earmarking a lions share of 26 per cent for tribals, slashing quotas for SCs to 10 per cent and OBCs to 14 per cent in government jobs.        
	Under the earlier 73 per cent quota policy, the STs had a quota of 32 per cent, OBCs 27 per cent and SCs 14 per cent.        
	Not surprisingly, backward caste ministers in the Marandi government  Madhu Singh, Ramchandra Kesri and Sudesh Mahto  stayed away from the Cabinet meeting which cleared the new policy.              
	Significantly, the state was yet to gather quantifiable data on OBCs.         
	Backward Commission chairman Justice (Rtd) Loknath Prasad told The Telegraph that he had sent a proposal to the state three years earlier to conduct a survey of backward castes to work out a separate quota for extremely backward and other backward categories in view of the Supreme Court order.         
	However, the state government did not hold the survey as it would mean an expenditure of Rs 24 crore. So, we recommended splitting the backward quota (eight per cent for EBCs and six per cent for OBCs) as per the old data. Roughly, 47 per cent of the population in Jharkhand belong to the backward classes, he pointed out.        
	Prasad admitted that the latest apex court ruling would spur those representing backwards to resurrcet their demand.        
	Former BJP MP Ram Tahal Chaudhary also said the state government should revisit the reservation policy in view of the Supreme Court order and identify the quantifiable data of backward castes in the state.        
	Former advocate-general Anil Sinha noted that the state could hope to raise the court-mandated 50 per cent cap only if it collected the quantifiable data and place it before the Backward Commission.         
	But, it is set to open the floodgate for litigations, he added.

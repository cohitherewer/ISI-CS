	Jan. 12: In the age of the Internet where kite-flying and rumour-mongering are not an uncommon sport, the kite that flutters at the end of a string still gives a high  in Ahmedabad, not in Calcutta.        
	Its like nirvana. The thrill and joy one gets flying kites is rare, said British national Derek Kuhn, now in Ahmedabad for the eighth edition of the International Kite Festival, the event that heralds the harvesting festival of Uttarayan.        
	His daughter Clara, on her first visit to India, even won a prize for a kite she had made with appliqu designs.         
	My spirit is soaring, like the colourful kites, the 22year-old postgraduate student gushed after winning the third prize in the category of collage kites.        
	Kite enthusiasts from all over the world look forward to the annual Gujarat show, bringing along their designs crafted after months of labour.         
	Sim Sarak and her husband Ceang Yarin decided to build a kite that produces a musical sound when it soars and is helped by a strong wind. The couples kite, made from paper and bamboo, depicts the Cambodian temple of Angkor Vat. Our kites represent the culture of Cambodia. They signal the unification of music and dance, said Sim.        
	What unites the kite flyers, both from abroad and those from India, is a passion for a pastime that dates back 2,800 years and most probably has its roots in China.         
	A kite, the colourful kind flying over Gujarats skies, takes around three months to make and an investment of anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 5 lakh depending on the material used. Bhavna Mehta, 40, who won first prize in the foreign-type painting colour combination category, said she was sure she would triumph.         
	I knew I would win. It took me three months to make this kite, which has a painting of a Ladakh gompha (monastery), said Mehta, who knew little about kites until she got married in 1991 and came to Gujarat.        
	The earliest evidence of Indian kite-flying comes from 16th-century Moghul miniature paintings.         
	For an activity requiring an investment of time and money, it still has takers among the GenX. Ahmedabad teenager Deep Mehta, a first-year student of information technology, says he has been flying kites since he was seven.        
	I love computer games and the Internet but the excitement I get flying kites is much more, said the 16-year-old, who has many foreign friends who are kite enthusiasts like him.        
	Im in touch with several friends in the UK, US, Belgium and Argentina who became my friends during previous kite festivals. We are in regular touch and share ideas about making kites with a difference.        
	Mumbai-based flier Deepak Kapadia, who has conducted kite-making workshops in France, pointed out that the pastime, a huge draw in Gujarat and other places like Jaipur and Jodhpur, does not have the same following in metros where people have little time. Not many people know about kite-flying, though it is a wonderful adventure sport which is good for your eyesight and completely engrosses you, he said.         
	Some youngsters in Calcutta, a city with a great tradition of kite-flying, admit they are ignorant about the sport.         
	Pratik Das, 16, the same age as Ahmedabads Deep, confessed he has never flown a kite. I dont know anything about flying kites. I never asked my parents for one and they never got me one either. I dont get the time for it and Im not sure of places where they are available. I think outdoor sports like football and cricket are more exciting, he said.        
	Sourav Seal, 17, said he would try his hands on a kite string on Viswakarma Puja, but rarely otherwise. Nobody ever taught me the mechanism. A couple of friends and I tried it ourselves. It didnt work out too well so we lost interest, said Sourav.         
	Manik Pahari, 28, a member of the West Bengal Kite Flyers Association, said teenagers had little interest in the sport. The youngest in most of the kite clubs would probably be 26. I dont see too many youngsters below that age taking an active interest in the sport. A few of them participate during the Pujas but are not passionate about it, he said.        
	The origin of kite-flying in Bengal can be traced back to 1850 when Wajid Ali Shah, the erstwhile nawab of Awadh, was banished to Metiabruz. With little to do, he would indulge in two of his greatest passions, chess and kite-flying.         
	The babus of Calcutta were fast to catch on. What was sport for Wajid Ali Shah and 500 of his courtiers in exile became a pastime for rajas, maharajas and zamindars of 19th-century Bengal who would splurge on currency notes tied to the kite tails and had their names inscribed in their show of opulence.        
	Kite dealers in Calcutta said Bengal still had an interest in the sport. We have four good seasons for kites in Bengal when there is a huge demand. One is during Viswakarma Puja in September, from Makar Sankranti in January till Saraswati Puja and Akshay Tritiya in March. Places where demands are high are Baruipur, Barasat, Serampore, Khardah, Titagarh and Chandernagore. In Calcutta the demand peaks during summer. We end up supplying nearly 1 lakh kites in a season and even run short of stocks, said Bablu Sen, a wholesale dealer of kites based in Santosh Square, who has been in the business for 42 years.        
	But though the sale of kites has increased, profits fail to keep pace. There is a lot of demand but we can hardly make any profit. What we sell at Rs 2 per piece is sold at Rs 5 in other cities. We hardly make more than Rs 5,000 from a months supply and the cost of raw material too has gone up, said Sen.         
	S.N. Jamil Akhtar of Asad Kite Shop, a wholesale and retail outlet in Metiabruz, agreed. The demand is as strong as it used to be 10 or 20 years ago but customers still demand the same old rate. Transport and labour costs have risen and we dont get any support from the government which could promote this as a sport like they do in Gujarat, he said.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                7-hour Maoist gunfire stalls hostage search

	March 7: Maoist gunfire held off 300 security personnel for over seven hours today and prevented them from entering an area where kidnapped headmaster Ranjit Duley was suspected to have been kept hostage.        
	By the time the gun battle in a forest on the Bankura-West Midnapore border was over and the joint forces could step into three villages  pinpointed by tracking the mobile phone of the abduction leader  there was no trace of the headmaster.         
	Unconfirmed reports suggested that one Maoist died in the encounter and five were injured.         
	The police suspect the headmaster was shifted during the encounter, although it has not yet been established whether Duley, abducted by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities on Friday afternoon, was in any of the three villages  Keshia, Bhalukbasa and Ringta.        
	In the evening, the committees militia leader, Sidhu Soren, called Duleys son Dipak from his fathers mobile phone and told him to publicly condemn todays police attack on innocent villagers and detention of 37 of them.        
	Sidhu Soren told me that if I did this, he would release my father, Dipak told The Telegraph. I told Sidhu Soren that I would carry out the demand tomorrow, he added.         
	It is not clear whether the captors have dropped the earlier demand that six prisoners be freed. The 48-hour deadline to release the six, including two held in connection with the murder of a police officer, in exchange for Duley expired this afternoon.         
	Todays offensive suggests the state government is willing to consider options other than negotiations to secure Duleys release, unlike in the case of police officer Atindranath Dutta whose freedom was bought by releasing 13 women accused of minor offences.        
	A West Midnapore police officer said there was no instruction from the administration to carry out any negotiation for the release of the headmaster. We were told to try our best to rescue Duley, the officer said.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said in Calcutta: Raids are continuing. We will have to find him (Duley).         
	DGP Bhupinder Singh said: We have made considerable progress. We expect to find him (Duley) soon.        
	Today at 3am, the central forces, including Cobra jawans, set out on foot towards the three villages on the border of the two districts following information that the headmaster was being held captive in one of them. Apart from a tip-off, calls from the mobile phone of Soren were traced to Bhalukbasa forest.         
	The security forces formed a semicircle outside the three villages around 4am and waited. At 7am, when they advanced, shots were fired from Keshia village and the security forces returned the fire.        
	As there was steady gunfire, we progressed carefully. The gunfire stopped around 2.30pm, an officer said.

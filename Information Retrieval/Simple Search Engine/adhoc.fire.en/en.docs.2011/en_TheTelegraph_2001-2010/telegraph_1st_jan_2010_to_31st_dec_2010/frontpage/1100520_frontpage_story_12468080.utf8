The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cabinet trouble worries Munda
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cabinet trouble worries Munda
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA       
	Ranchi, May 19: The BJP and the JMM woke up to the complexities of forming a cabinet without ruffling too many feathers today, barely 24 hours after striking a deal on power sharing that is expected to come into effect on May 25.        
	If Arjun Munda, the BJPs chief minister-in-waiting, spent the day wooing two Independents to beef up his partys numbers in the Assembly, the JMM struggled to find the best use of the five ministerial berths in its share to quell a simmering rebellion in the ranks.        
	Munda went into a huddle with the two Independent MLAs along with Speaker C.P. Singh at a state Assembly chamber. Both Videsh Singh and Chamra Linda have so far supported the Shibu Soren led government.        
	Although Munda claimed the two would be on board this time too, Linda, who is backed by the Church, was yet to declare his support to a BJP-led government.         
	Another Independent MLA, Bandhu Tirkey, who had been backing the Soren government so far, has already withdrawn support.         
	The combined strength of the BJP, JMM and Ajsu is 41 in the 82-member House. So, the coalition will need a cushion of a few Independents to be able to run a government smoothly.         
	Munda, who left for Delhi today and was expected to return on May 21, is aware of the arduous task ahead of him. Cabinet formation, as always, will be his first challenge since he has only two ministerial berths in the BJPs share.        
	As of now, the BJP has three ministers  Barkuanr Gagrai (tribal), Baidyanath Ram (SC) and Raghubar Das (OBC).         
	According to party sources, with Munda  a tribal  leading the team, Das would lose his deputy chief minister status. Also, food and civil supplies minister Gagrais tribal credentials would not be enough for him to stay on.         
	The search is on for Das and Rams replacements. It is possible that Das will be replaced by Arun Mandal, an OBC, said a source, adding that accommodating the deputy chief minister would prove to be tricky for the BJP.        
	 The JMM has its own problems. Of the five ministerial berths in its share, one is for Hemant Soren, who will be deputy chief minister. Welfare minister Haji Hussain Ansari is expected to continue as the face of the minorities.        
	The fight is for the remaining three cabinet posts. At present, the JMM has three ministers_ Hemlal Murmu, Mathura Mahto and Ansari, besides chief minister Shibu Soren.        
	According to a JMM leader, one way for Soren to win over the dissenter MLAs, namely Lobin Hembrom, Nalin Soren, Simon Marandi, Teklal Mahto and Aquil Akhtar, was to drop human resources minister Hemlal Murmu.         
	But thats easier said that done since Murmu was a true loyalist.         
	Soren, in the meantime, has shifted to Bokaro where he will stay on till May 21 to attend various party functions to commemorate the death anniversary of his eldest son Durga.

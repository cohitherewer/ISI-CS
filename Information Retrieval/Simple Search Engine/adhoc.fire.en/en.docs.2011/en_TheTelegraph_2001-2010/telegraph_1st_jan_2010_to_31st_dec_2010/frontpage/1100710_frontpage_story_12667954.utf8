The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shivaji ban off, Raj declares war
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Shivaji ban off, Raj declares war

	July 9: The apex court today cleared the decks for the publication and sale of James Laines Shivaji  The Hindu King in Muslim India in Maharashtra, but the sound and fury over the controversial book are far from over.        
	The Supreme Court turned down the state governments plea to ban the book, saying it had not followed mandatory procedure while invoking the ban. The bench agreed with Bombay High Courts decision to lift the ban on the book that, according to the state, makes derogatory comments about Shivaji and contains material promoting social enmity.        
	In Mumbai, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena was quick to react, saying it would not allow sales of the book. We will not allow any bookstore to stock copies of the book, party chief Raj Thackeray said on the sidelines of a party meeting in Matunga. Let them dare to keep the books in the stalls. We will deal with it in MNS style.        
	The book written by Laine, an American professor of religious studies, was published in 2003 in New York and New Delhi. On January 5, 2004, Sambhaji Brigade cadres ransacked the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune  where Laine had done research  on grounds that the book defamed the Maratha king.        
	Ten days later, Maharashtra issued a ban on the book under CrPC Section 95, which empowers a state government to ban books if they contain any material that can lead to breach of peace and tranquillity and cause communal tension. Publication of such material is punishable under the IPC.        
	In late January 2004, the state government withdrew the notification. On December 28, 2006, it issued a fresh one, which was challenged by advocate Sanghraj Rupawate, documentary filmmaker Anand Patwardhan and social activist Kunda Pramila in a petition.        
	In 2007, the high court lifted the ban, after which the state approached the apex court. The high court said the states notification was not sustainable in the light of the apex court quashing criminal proceedings against Laine over allegations that his book attempted to disturb communal peace and harmony.        
	The state government said it favoured continuation of the ban. Home minister R.R. Patil said: I personally, and the state government also, feel that the ban should continue. We will take a decision after reading the full judgment of the court. We will seek legal opinion from the advocate general before making the next move.        
	NCP legislator Udayan Raje Bhosle, who is a Shivaji descendant, said: We will not allow printing of the book. As a descendant of Chhatrapati, it is my responsibility to protect his name. A pro-Shivaji group staged a protest in Satara.

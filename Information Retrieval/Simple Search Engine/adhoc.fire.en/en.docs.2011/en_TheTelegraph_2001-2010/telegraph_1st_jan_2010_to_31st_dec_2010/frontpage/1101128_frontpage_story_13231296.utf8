The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | To Brussels, with a tiny gift
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                To Brussels, with a tiny gift
  - Hasina works knitting needles for 4-week-old great-niece          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Hasina Wajed in Brussels. (Reuters)                                        
	Dhaka, Nov. 27: At a time scam-scarred Indian politicians are struggling to disentangle themselves from the webs they have woven, Bangladeshs Prime Minister has been busy with knitting needles, glowing in grandmotherly bliss.        
	When Hasina Wajed left Bangladesh this week on a three-nation tour, she had a little gift tucked away in her suitcase.        
	Amid all her travel preparations and official work for the preceding two weeks, Hasina had been toiling away on a white-and-pink sweater meant for her four-week-old great-niece in Belgium who is named after her.        
	Lilatuli Hasina Siddiq is the daughter of the Prime Ministers nephew Redwan Siddiq, who lives in Brussels and is the son of Hasinas only living sibling, Sheikh Rehana. Hasina and Rehana were in West Germany on a goodwill tour in August 1975 when all the other children of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were assassinated during a coup in Dhaka.        
	Winter is knocking at Indias door too, but in the season of corruption scandals, few politicians probably have the time or inclination to un-knit the creases on their foreheads and start knitting wool.        
	But it hadnt been easy for Hasina, either. It took her days to find the right kind of wool and needles and select a design, leaving her racing against time to finish the sweater ahead of the official tour that began last Sunday night.        
	People close to Hasina say she had decided to start knitting as soon as she was told of the childs birth on October 31.        
	 She sent people out to buy the needles and even specified the needle numbers. But since most people now wear readymade woollens, it was difficult to get the needles she wanted, said Baby Moudud, a journalist with news agency bdnews24.com who frequents Hasinas home.                          
	In the end, she (Hasina) settled for whatever needles were available. She told us she was knitting after a very long time, Moudud said.        
	The next worry was the design. Hasina wanted a prepared design and sought help from her daughter Saima Wazed, a child psychologist who lives in Canada. Saima apparently told her to consult the Internet. Eventually, Hasina herself created the design.        
	Aides said an excited Prime Minister told them this was the first time she was knitting winter wear for any of her or her sisters grandchildren. Hasina has four grandchildren from Saima and one granddaughter from her son Joy and his American wife Christianne.        
	All the others will now ask why I did not knit sweaters for them, she joked.        
	Journalists and people close to Hasina know her as a very good grandmother to her childrens kids. She cooks delicacies when the grandchildren come visiting.        
	The Prime Ministers trip started in Moscow, where she attended a conference on tiger conservation and prodded the Russian government to speed up financial and technical assistance for the planned Rooppur nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.        
	She arrived in Brussels yesterday to meet her little namesake and interact with community leaders of expatriate Bangladeshis living in various European countries. Hasina left for Japan this afternoon for a five-day visit.

   - World Editors Forum postponed            
	New Delhi, May 12 (PTI): The World Association of Newspapers and Newspaper Publishers (WAN-IFRA) has called off the 63rd World Newspaper Congress and postponed the 17th World Editors Forum scheduled in June due to the failure of the Lebanese host organisation to meet its financial commitments. Both the events were scheduled to take place in Beirut from June 7 to 10.    
	According to a release from WAN-IFRA quoting its President Gavin O'Reilly the events were called off because of their Lebanese counterparts as they were responsible for security and other significant infrastructural and service expenses. The Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar has informed WAN-IFRA that it is unable to provide the agreed funds to host the meet in the wake of the 2009 financial, economic and political crisis in the region. Expenses incurred in hosting the meet were estimated at 1.6 million Euro and could not be covered by registration fees alone, the release said.  
	 The 17th World Editors Forum would now be held in Hamburg, Germany, from October 6 to 8 in conjunction with IFRA Expo from October 4 to 6, the release said.   
	WAN-IFRA is the Paris (France) and Darmstadt (Germany) based global organisation of the world newspapers and news publishers with subsidiaries in India, Singapore, France and Sweden. The forum represents more than 18,000 publications, 15,000 online sites and over 3,000 companies in more than 120 countries.

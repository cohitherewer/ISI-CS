          AMIT ROY                      Alexander McQueen                          
	London, Feb. 11: The world of fashion was left reeling tonight after the death in London of one of its youngest and brightest stars, Alexander McQueen, who apparently took his own life.        
	The controversial but talented designer, who was only 40, was born Lee Alexander McQueen but was persuaded to adopt his middle name as his personal brand by his mentor and guide, Isabella Blow, who also committed suicide three years ago.        
	Sources tonight said it was believed McQueen had been found hanging.          
	McQueens death came just days before London Fashion Week, which is due to open on February 19, and as final preparations were made to unveil his spring collection.  
	Last week, writing on his Twitter page, McQueenWorld, McQueen told followers his mother, Joyce, had died: im letting my followers know my mother passed away yesterday .. RIP mumx        
	A minute later, he added: but life must go on!        
	On Sunday, his friends did not realise just how fragile his mental state was when McQueen wrote: sunday evening been a f****** awful week but my friends have been great but now i have to some how pull myself together...        
	Today, shortly before 5pm, his body was removed from his flat in Green Street, off Park Lane in Mayfair.        
	A product of the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, McQueen was often depicted as the enfant terrible of British fashion but he had a worldwide following among young designers.        
	One of the most respected fashion designers in the world, McQueens clothes were described as sexy and distinctive, dramatic and different, perfect for red-carpet presentations and late-night rock gatherings. He was favoured by celebrities like Madonna, Lady Gaga and Naomi Campbell and was named British fashion designer of the year four times.        
	McQueen was born in the East End of London on March 17, 1969, the youngest of six children. His father was a taxi driver and he left school at the age of 16. It is said he was already making dresses for his sisters at a young age but was given his first break at Savile Row tailors Anderson amp; Sheppard after joining as an apprentice.        
	During his time working at Savile Row, his clients included Mikhail Gorbachev and the Prince of Wales.        
	In 1996, he was dubbed the hooligan of English fashion after being named head designer at Givenchy in Paris. The tag was seen as more of a reference to his close-cropped hair than his fashion style and McQueen went on to silence his critics.

  - Obama touch in chief ministers people-friendly industry police tweak          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Arjun Munda browses through Change We Can Believe In at his Ranchi residence on Tuesday. Picture by Hardeep Singh                                         
	Ranchi, Nov. 2: Arjun Munda is not pursuing industrialisation as a policy aggressively, indicating a change in the approach he advocated strongly in his earlier stint as chief minister in 2005.        
	Manpower ko chorkar development dhokha hai. (We will be cheating on the people if they are left behind in the development process). It will be dangerous if we import people from outside to run industries here, he said in an exclusive interview with The Telegraph.        
	Inspired by US president Barack Obama  he was reading a book of his speeches, Change We Can Believe In  Munda, in his third innings as chief minister, said he was working on a plan that would not only take the state on the fast lane of development but also ensure that people were benefited.        
	Obama is young and energetic and a dynamic leader in world politics. For him, manpower is an asset. They have a migration policy and they allow entry of people of a certain intellectual level only, he pointed out.         
	Maintaining that serious players were keen on implementing their MoUs, the chief minister said the government would make the Resettlement amp; Rehabilitation (R amp;R) policy more attractive.        
	I dont want a colonial pattern of development. We have to adopt a holistic approach for the overall development of the area where an industry is to come up. The people should be part of the development, he said.        
	Experience, he said, had shown on many occasions that future generations of a family which received compensation for being displaced ran into trouble. Several of them revolt and join extremists. So, we are also going to revise the surrender policy making it more people friendly. We need to persuade the youth in villages to shun the path of violence, Munda said.        
	Extremism is not a disease but a symptom of long neglect of peoples basic needs. They will fight if they dont get the means to survive, he added.        
	But, he also wanted people to be productive. We are in talks with Planning Commission to set up ITIs in every block where anyone can get automatic admission without appearing for any tests after clearing class eight. They should also be allowed to pursue their general education simultaneously, he said, adding that efforts were on to set up English medium schools in 203 blocks.        
	On specific projects, Munda said a special economic zone for automobiles and auto components, cleared by the Centre to be set up in Jamshedpur, was his dream project.         
	Setting up the SEZ, the foundation stone for which was laid by him in 2005, would be a definite boost for auto exports from the region.         
	We are in talks with industrialists to set up plants which to supply steel for the automobile sector and make the automobile sector viable. At present, automobile companies in the state buy special steel from Sunflag or Mukund Steel, he pointed out.         
	 On other plans, the chief minister said the government would convert Ranchi-Birmitrapur (Orissa), Ranchi-Vidhanganj, Barhi-Ranchi-Bahragora-Bhadrak, Ranchi-Kharagapur stretches into four lanes for easier access to Haldia and Paradeep ports.         
	It will be completed in the next three years. We have to open the land locked state. The chief secretary will be appointed nodal officer to tackle obstacles like forest clearance, land acquisition, etc, in widening these roads.         
	On his IT initiative, Munda clarified he was yet to receive a response from Infosys, Wipro, TCS and Tech Mahindra for setting up an IT park. One IT park has the potential to give jobs to at least 10,000 people, he said.        
	 We are also planning to give a life of comfort to the software personnel that are to be employed at these IT parks. The completion of the ring road will facilitate expansion of the capital, he said.

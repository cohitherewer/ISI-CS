          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi/Ranchi, May 30: Shibu Sorens late night resignation infused fresh life into a hitherto dejected state BJP unit with MLAs impressing upon the central leadership that it was the right time for the party to step in and form a government with the support of the JMM.        
	But so far, the senior leaders have stuck to their guns and maintained that after being stood up by Shibu Soren and his son Hemant, it would not be prudent for a national party like the BJP to once again form a government with the unpredictable JMM as a key partner.         
	The state unit has nevertheless convened a meeting of its MLAs tomorrow to hammer out a solution and expects several senior leaders from Delhi to attend.         
	But doubts remain on how many of them would be able to come to Ranchi.         
	For, only former party president Rajnath Singh is available in Delhi.         
	Party chief Nitin Gadkari is in Nagpur and general secretary Ananth Kumar in Bangalore.         
	And although some of them are scheduled to return to the national capital tomorrow, it is unlikely they will be able to come to Ranchi.         
	A senior state BJP leader confided that his party would be making serious efforts to form an alternative government in Jharkhand and that the party was not averse to taking JMM support to explore new avenues.         
	Such decisions will be taken by our central leadership. Here, we will continue to strengthen our party organisation, said state BJP general secretary Ganesh Mishra.         
	According to sources in New Delhi, the BJP central leadership was as divided as before on the question of accepting JMM as a partner to form a new government in Jharkhand.         
	Senior leaders Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Lal Krishna Advani were of the view that after what Shibu Soren had done, there should be no truck with the JMM, said a party source in New Delhi.        
	Rajnath and Ananth Kumar, the sources believed, despite all that had happened, were still in favour of the BJP leading a government in Jharkhand even it has to be with the JMMs support.         
	If we went ahead and formed a government under a JMM leader, what stops us now from forming a government with the partys support? said an MLA echoing the sentiments of almost all the state BJP MLAs.         
	These MLAs, it is believed, are still trying to persuade senior leaders to see their argument and come around.

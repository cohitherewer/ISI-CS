The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nick Clegg. the new star of British politics
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nick Clegg. the new star of British politics
          AMIT ROY                            Nick Clegg (left) with David Cameron (centre) and Gordon Brown during the first of three televised debates in Manchester                                  
	London, April 18: Nick Clegg, the 43-year old leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, has suddenly been transformed into the most talked about man in British politics after media and polling pundits decreed he had won last weeks US presidential style debate against Gordon Brown and David Cameron.        
	 Clegg today dismissed as absurd a report in the Sunday Times that he was now the most popular party leader since Winston Churchill, who had an approval rating of 83 per cent in 1945, compared with 72 per cent for Clegg, 19 per cent for Cameron and 18 per cent for Brown in the latest poll conducted by YouGov.        
	 But other polls reflect the common view among media analysts that Clegg was more impressive than either the Tory or the Labour leader in the first of three debates, an American innovation that has just been introduced in a British general election and seems likely to stay.        
	 There is general agreement that Richard Nixon lost the debate and the presidential election to the young and much more personable John F Kennedy in 1960.        
	 Britain, like India, has a first past the post system of parliamentary democracy so that even if increased support for Clegg is matched by a higher vote for the Lib Dems, it does not mean the party will win the general election. This is because many constituencies are held by Labour or the Conservatives with huge majorities that will not be overturned by even a strong surge of support for the Lib Dems.        
	 However, in a tight finish, Britain may end up with a UPA-BJP situation: the Lib Dems, should they win several more seats, could prevent Cameron from getting an absolute majority and thereby allow Brown to remain prime minister by forming a coalition with Clegg.        
	 On the basis of the YouGov poll, The Sunday Times today offered this assessment: Cleggs party is one point behind Labour on 30 per cent, with the Tories on 33 per cent having a slender lead of three points. The poll suggests David Camerons Tories are on course to secure 239 seats, only 46 more than they have now. Labour, despite being second in terms of the popular vote, would get the most seats, with about 287 MPs, giving Gordon Brown a fighting chance of clinging on as prime minister. The number of Lib Dem MPs would increase from 63 to 93, putting them in a strong position to dictate terms in a hung parliament.        
	 The scale of the Lib Dem bounce varies from paper to paper. The most dramatic though unlikely one is a BPIX survey for the Mail on Sunday, which gives Cleggs party an overall lead. The Lib Dems have soared 12 per cent over the past week to 32 per cent, while the Tories are down seven points on 31 per cent and Labour dropped three to 28 per cent.        
	 During last weeks 90-minute debate, a new experience watched by over 9m British voters, Brown appeared to be going out of his way to woo Clegg, frequently using such phrases as: I agree with Nick.Nick will also agree with me.        
	 He said this even when it was obvious that Clegg did not at all agree with the prime minister.        
	 Clegg, to his credit, attempted today not to get too carried away.         
	 I think people are getting a little hyped up, he said. The campaign is still in its early stages. Its only a beginning. Its a small door which has been opened to encourage people they can get engaged, get involved and there are more possibilities available to them than simply repeating the stale old two-party politics of the past.        
	 In the remaining days of the campaign before the election on May 6, both Clegg and Lib Dem policies will come under more searching examination. Whether the medias love affair with Clegg will last till polling day remains to be seen.        
	 A senior Lib Dem taking a cautious attitude is Lord Navnit Dholakia, the partys deputy leader in the Lords, who explained to The Telegraph some of the ground realities of British politics: There is a hard core Labour vote and there is a hard core Tory vote. In between is the gel  the result of a general election is decided by no more than 3-4m voters.        
	 Dholakia, who was campaigning for his party today in Hammersmith in west London, pointed out that that the Tories needed a national swing of 7-8 per cent to get an overall majority of one. That is a tall order at the moment.        
	 Dholakia said he would wait until the second and third debates between Brown, Cameron and Clegg before making a more informed prediction on how the election might go. On Cleggs India connection, he said: He was about to go to India when the election was declared but he is fully briefed.        
	 One of the seats where an Indian origin Lib Dem candidate is standing is Leicester South, where Parmjit Gill has a very good chance of winning, according to Dholakia.        
	Gill first won Leicester South in a by-election in July, 2004, after the death of its sitting MP. He lost the seat to Labour in the general election in May 2005. He is up against a Labour majority of 3,717  8.8 per cent of votes cast in 2005.        
	 He concentrated on the ethnic votes last time, said Dholakia. I told him he needs to win white voters as well.        
	 Gill was on the campaign trail today but his agent Joan Garrity said that apart from attending Baisakhi celebrations today, the Lib Dem candidate had been summoned to separate meetings with the Federation of Muslim Organisations, the Hindu Forum and the Church of England.        
	 The Lib Dems are certainly making a valiant effort to bring Muslims into the mainstream of British politics  its spread sheet on its 25 Asian parliamentary candidates specifies their religion.        
	 Twenty of the 25 are Muslim, two are Hindu and three, including Gill, are Sikh.         
	 This fits in with the general assessment of the Indian High Commission that people of Indian origin are keener either to go into business or enter such professions as medicine, the law and accountancy. Politics does not interest them.        
	 It is estimated that Britains Muslim population stands at 1.6m; the Hindus number about 1m and Sikhs around 300,000-400,000.        
	 The ethnic candidates are hoping to benefit from Cleggs higher profile.        
	 We are getting more time on television, commented Dholakia. I am happy.        
	 Nicholas (Nick) William Peter Clegg was born in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, on January 7, 1967, and educated at Westminster School, which hothouses its pupils for Oxbridge. Clegg was an undergraduate at Robinson College, Cambridge, and read anthropology. He speaks five European languages.        
	 He was first a member of the European Parliament (MEP), before becoming Lib Dem MP for Sheffield Hallam only in 2005. He was elected party leader in 2007.        
	 He and his Spanish wife, Miriam Gonzlez Durntez, a high flying Spanish lawyer, have three sons.         
	 He wont be able to live down an indiscreet interview to GQ magazine in which Piers Morgan asked him the kind of question no Indian interviewer would dare to ask even Shashi Tharoor: did he consider himself good in bed.        
	 I dont think I am particularly brilliant or particularly bad, said the Lib Dem leader.        
	Since the only judge of that is my wife...        
	 When Morgan asked about other women in his life, he replied: Yes, ok, well, not for a very long time.        
	 When Morgan asked how many, Clegg responded: Not a list as long as yours, Im sure.        
	 How many are we talking: 10, 20, 30? Morgan persisted.        
	 No more than 30, answered Clegg.        
	 This provoked columnist Amanda Platell to write in the Daily Mail: Nick Clegg reveals he has slept with no more than 30 women in a toe-curlingly frank interview.        
	Or should we assume that, like chain-smokers who lie to their doctor that they smoke only ten a day, Cleggs real total is in fact far greater than the one to which hes admitted? In which case the mind boggles. Alas, the damage didnt end there. When asked if he could ever be unfaithful to his wife, Clegg replied, I certainly hope not.        
	Hope? Hardly the ringing endorsement most women would like to hear from their husbands. Even for the leader of the Liberals, isnt this taking things a bit too liberally? Forgive the crudeness, but its no wonder the LibDem leader has a new nickname  Nick Cleggover.        
	 One thing is certain: if Clegg becomes a cabinet minister, the Mail will pay a lot of money to track down some of the lucky 30.

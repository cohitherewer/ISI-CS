          JOHN MARY                            Nazir Musaliyar with his daughter Nabela                                  
	Thiruvanathapuram, May 5: A Kerala Christian school that threw out a Muslim girl allegedly for wearing a headscarf (maftha) is facing the ire of student organisations and probes by several government agencies.        
	The states director of public instruction, A.P.M. Mohammed Haneesh, today ordered a probe against the Believers Church English Medium School in the southern district of Alappuzha, which issued a transfer certificate (TC) to the Class IX student, T.N. Nabela, on April 26.         
	Her father Nazir Musaliyar alleged the school authorities could not tolerate a student with headscarf. Nabela had cleared Class IX but was denied promotion to Class X, he alleged.         
	The authorities had dissuaded her from wearing the scarf and were waiting for an opportunity to send her away, said Musaliyar, who is the imam of a local mosque.        
	However, Philipose Thomas, the education officer of Believers Church schools, alleged a conspiracy by vested interests to defame the school. The school had never barred anyone from wearing the headscarf, he claimed, though it was not part of the uniform.         
	Other students have been wearing headscarves, to which weve not objected. But Nabelas parents wanted to take her away for some reason and we were persuaded to assign the headscarf (matter) as the reason on the TC. This was to make it clear that the transfer was not because of poor academic performance, Thomas said.        
	Locals said most students took off their headscarves at the school gate and kept them in their schoolbags till they left after classes. But unlike them, Nabela used to don the scarf at school.        
	Haneesh, the director of public instruction, said: The school will have to take back the student. Its an issue of rights violation if it (the allegation) is true. And if the school does not readmit her, the government will withdraw the no objection certificate to the school.         
	Alappuzha collector P. Venugopal has convened a meeting of both sides on May 7. The state human rights commission has ordered a probe against the school.        
	Activists of the SFI, the ruling CPMs student wing, and the AISF marched to the school, ending in a brush with police. The Popular Front of India, a combine of pro-Muslim bodies, staged a sit-in and demonstration.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                12 districts in drought shadow
  - Governors council orders express relief, Rs 390cr at disposal        OUR BUREAU                                                   
	Ranchi, Aug. 3: Jharkhand today declared 12 districts drought-hit, acknowledging that poor rainfall had affected crop cultivation and setting in motion usual administrative measures to initiate relief measures on a war footing.        
	At a meeting of the governors advisory council, the 12 districts were identified as Latehar, Ramgarh, Chatra, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Khunti, East Singhbhum, Jamtara, Palamau, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Ranchi and Jamtara.         
	The Telegraph had reported yesterday that the governors council was likely to name the districts worst affected by scanty rainfall today, a move that was likely to be followed in days or weeks to come by another announcement wherein more parched districts would be added to the list.        
	According to the directorate of agriculture, paddy coverage in the state has been at 409.354 hectare against a target of 1,692 hectare. From April, the state received 324 mm rainfall till August 2 against a normal average of 907.8 mm, prompting various political parties to ask Governor M..H. Farook to declare the state drought-hit.         
	Todays announcement was followed by a roadmap to undertake a slew of relief measures by using a Rs 390 crore corpus available with the state disaster management department.        
	Both rainfall and crop cultivation were below 50 per cent of the usual average, noted cabinet coordination department principal secretary Aditya Swaroop.         
	Outlining various relief measures, he said, Construction and repair of check dams would be taken up on priority to prevent drainage of water. Special measures would be taken to promote alternate cropping, distribution of seeds and fertiliser, he added.        
	Swaroop also spoke of implementing employment generation schemes to check migration of labourers and strengthening PDS. One PDS outlet in every panchayat will store 10 quintals of foodgrain, he said.        
	This apart, the administration also announced that:        
	 Antyodaya and Annapurna schemes would be executed strictly         
	 Officials had been asked to ensure availability of fodder for cattle and drinking water         
	 Drinking water and sanitation department had been directed to ensure drilling machines were in order        
	 Forest department would carry out afforestation work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act        
	 Officials were directed to ensure old age and widow pension were disbursed regularly         
	 Doctors and medicines were available at all health centres        
	 ICDS and midday meal schemes functioned effec- tively         
	Over Rs 390 crore is available with the disaster management department. Maximum possible relief work will be taken up as per provisions of calamity relief regulations. Departments have also been asked to prepare detailed reports on additional requirements. Accordingly, the Centre would be requested to provide more funds, Swaroop explained.        
	Jharkhand has been experiencing scanty rainfall since 2001, prompting then chief minister Babulal Marandi to declare 14 districts drought-hit. The trend is continuing ever since.        
	Last year, Farooks predecessor K.Sankaranarayanan declared the entire state as drought-hit.        
	Budget push for rebel zones        
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee tabled Jharkhands first supplementary budget of Rs 1,242.71 crore in the Lok Sabha, earmarking Rs 200 crore for roads and bridges in 11 Naxalite-hit districts.        
	The supplementary budget included Rs 510.05 crore under State Plan (development), Rs 652.01 crore under nonPlan (establishment, salary) and Rs 80.65 crore as states share for executing centrally sponsored schemes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Centre issues   airfare deadline 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Centre issues   airfare deadline 
  - Wednesday 5pm diktat          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: The Centre today directed all major airlines to publish route-wise and date-wise fares on their websites by 5pm on Wednesday, days after they proposed exorbitant last-minute ticket prices over four distance bands.        
	Sources said all airlines were likely to fall in line as Air India had already taken the lead in slashing peak fares. We are here to serve people we will always price ourselves right, a spokesperson for the airline said.        
	Other airlines are also believed to have agreed to cut fares from the peak rates of over Rs 20,000 on metro routes. Kingfisher Airlines, however, protested against the proposed cuts, the sources said.        
	The directive was issued after officials of the civil aviation ministry and the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation met representatives of Air India, Jet Airways and Kingfisher. They had met officials of no-frills carriers IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir on Saturday.        
	Officials said the governments implied threat of action by invoking anti-cartel legislation at Saturdays meeting appeared to have brought recalcitrant players in line. That state-run Air India did not toe the line followed by private airlines also helped, an official said.        
	A government release said all airlines had been briefed about the tariff provisions in the Aircraft Rules and asked to upload route-wise fares with date of purchase to enable predictability for fliers. All airlines have been asked to comply with the direction latest by 1700 hrs of 8 December 2010 and this has been agreed by them, the release said.        
	Hours before the meeting, Kingfisher boss Vijay Mallya said on the sidelines of a Ficci meet that airfares could not be capped in a liberalised environment. It is a function of demand and supply. It is not exploitation by the airlines.        
	A source said todays directive did not mean airlines would go out of their way to lose profit on routes like Delhi- Mumbai. All that will happen is the extraordinary high fares we were seeing since November 15 will be replaced by the high fares we saw in October and early November.        
	Delhi-Mumbai spot fares had been going for Rs 15,000 a seat in October and early November. But they shot up from mid-November, with airlines telling the DGCA they could even charge Rs 40,000 on distances of over 1,400km.        
	This year, fares have been on the rise but some kind of a rationale has to be established. We cannot have spot fares to Mumbai or Calcutta which rival fares to London and Vienna, said Debasish Chatterjee, the director of Citi Travels.

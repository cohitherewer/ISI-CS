  - Alberto from pamplona manages only nine          
	If Alberto Undiano was going for a record, he failed miserably.        
	The Spaniard racked up only nine yellow cards in Germanys 0-1 defeat by Serbia in Port Elizabeth. His consolation may be that this was, at least, a statistic to rival the note that the last time the Germans lost in the group stage was in 1986.        
	The sociologist from Pamplona  famous for the annual running of the bulls  has been a Fifa referee since 2004 and is a familiar figure in the Uefa Champions League.        
	He has also twice been a winner of Spains referee of the year prize. It may be no coincidence that the award was named after an official, Emilio Guruceta, who was famous or infamous, depending on your club loyalty  for awarding a multiplicity of bookings and expulsions.        
	Staying close to home, the first notable card-sharping at the World Cup was by yet another Spaniard, Antonio Lpez Nieto, when he issued 16 cautions and two expulsions in a tie between Cameroon and Germany in the 2002 finals.        
	This was emulated in 2006 when Russias Valentin Ivanov marked his last major international tournament, in a bad-tempered second-round match between Portugal and Holland, by also issuing 16 yellow cards but a superior four red cards.                  Referee Undiano. (AFP)      
	That was not the expectation when former Fifa referee Ken Aston of England thought up the cards system in 1966. The concept struck him as he stopped at a traffic light while driving home from Wembley after Englands contentious game against Argentina.        
	Aston had been the games refereeing assessor and had been involved in the protracted altercation which saw referee Rudolf Kreitlein send off Argentina captain Antonio Rattin. For a long time Rattin refused to go, claiming misunderstanding. Aston had to come down from his seat in the stands to enforce the law.        
	Later that day, Aston realised that yellow and red cards would make the referees disciplinary decisions clear. The scheme was tested at the 1968 Olympic football tournament in Mexico City and then introduced into the World Cup back there two years later.        
	Thus the historic first World Cup yellow was issued by German referee Kurt Tschenscher to Soviet Union midfielder Yevgenhy Lovchev in the opening match against hosts Mexico.        
	Occasionally, the system goes wrong. In the last World Cup, Englishman Graham Poll showed a second yellow card to Croatias Josip Simunic but forgot he had shown him a first and let him play on against Australia. Only when Poll showed Simunic a third, right at the end of the game, did he realise what he had done.        
	From Kreitlein to Aston to Tschenscher to Lopez Nieto to Ivanov and on to Undiano has been a long and colourful journey. Undiano has a tough standard and the World Cup is still only midway through the group stage.        
	How, then, may the cards stack up as the tension grows?

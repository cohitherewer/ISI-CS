The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Writers employee held on fraud charge
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Writers employee held on fraud charge
          A STAFF REPORTER                            An investment racket has been busted at Writers Buildings with the arrest of a finance department employee                                  
	A clerk in the state finance department was arrested at Writers Buildings on Thursday on the charge of illegally collecting money from his colleagues by promising high returns and defaulting on repayment.        
	Kallol Bala, 45, a resident of Habra in North 24-Parganas, had allegedly been running the racket since 2005. Police have learnt that he owes close to Rs 5 lakh to five of his colleagues.        
	The arrest followed a complaint by Subrata Dutta, who alleged that Bala owed him Rs 60,000, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen. We expect others to turn up and lodge complaints.        
	Bala has been booked under IPC section 420 (cheating). If convicted, he could be demoted, suspended or even dismissed from service.        
	Police said Bala, posted in the service records section of the finance department which is housed in Writers Buildings, ran the show on behalf of Disha Co-operative.        
	Bala would promise a monthly return of 1.5 per cent while collecting money, which he used to deposit in various banks. Some of his colleagues told us that initially they did get the returns on time though the amount they had deposited was small, said an officer.        
	As word about the success of Balas scheme spread, several clerks in the finance department started pledging money with him.         
	Kalpana Mondal, for instance, deposited Rs 1.3 lakh, while Ujjwal Roy handed over Rs 90,000 to Bala. The complainant, Subrata Dutta, had deposited Rs 60,000 in October 2005.        
	Four of Balas colleagues have lodged written complaints against him with the finance department in the past few months.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said Bala had been showcaused soon after the complaints were filed. When he failed to give a satisfactory reply, a departmental proceeding was started against him. The matter was also discussed with the chief minister, Dasgupta said.        
	The minister blamed the Centre for not framing a stringent act to control such activities.

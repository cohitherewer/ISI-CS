                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Contempt notice to Gurung
  - Supreme Court hauls up Morcha for NH31A blockade          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, June 11: The Supreme Court today issued contempt notices to Gorkha Janmukti Morcha president Bimal Gurung and two others for repeatedly violating its order not to obstruct NH31A during frequent agitation for and against Gorkhaland. The national highway is land-locked Sikkims only link with the rest of the country.        
	A two-judge vacation bench of Justices Deepak Verma and K.S. Radhakrishnan issued the notices to Gurung, Morcha assistant secretary Binay Tamang and Mukunda Majumdar, the president of the Bangla Bangla Bhasha Banchao Committee, an anti-Gorkhaland outfit based in Siliguri.         
	The bench also asked the Union government and the chief secretary and home secretary of West Bengal to explain why the steps that they had taken to keep the national highway free of blockades were not working.         
	The court had earlier, acting on a petition filed by Gangtok-based social activist .P. Bhandari, passed two orders asking political parties to refrain from blocking the national highway as it caused immense hardships to the people of Sikkim. Bhandari in his PIL had claimed that students, patients and tourists going to and from the state were severely inconvenienced by the frequent blockades on the highway. He later filed a contempt petition against the Morcha and the Bhasha Banchao Committee.         
	Bhandari alleged that the two outfits had together called for at least seven strikes since December 14, 2009, for and against Gorkhaland. Emboldened by these strikes, the Morcha, he said, had called for another 10-day shutdown from June 12. The Morcha later withdrew the bandh. But Bhandari sought another direction from the court (by filing a contempt petition) to ensure that the outfits complied with the two earlier orders.         
	Bhandari also urged the court to award the outfits and their office-bearers the maximum punishment under the law for flouting its orders.                           
	Although the Contempt of Courts Act prescribes a jail term of maximum six months as punishment, the Supreme Court can in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction can award any punishment to those accused of violating court orders.         
	On July 3, 2008, the top court had passed an interim order asking the Centre and the Sikkim and the Bengal governments to take all steps to ensure free traffic on the highway.         
	any obstruction to NH31A to and from Sikkim results in Sikkim being almost completely cut off from the rest of India, the top court had observed. It had also asked the agitating outfits to ensure that there was no blockade on the national highway.         
	In another order, the second one, passed on January 25, 2010, the court had warned the outfits that the order applied to them too.         
	Any lapse in following these directions will have serious consequences, including detention of office-bearers and persons who are responsible for doing such obstruction, the court had cautioned.         
	Appearing for Bhandari, senior counsel P.H. Parekh drew the courts attention to the fact that the two organisations had been frequently blocking the national highway during their agitation.         
	He said one of the outfits (the Morcha) was planning to lay siege to the highway from June 12. The siege would cause serious hardship to the people of Sikkim as the highway was the lifeline of the land-locked state, he said.        
	Bhandari said the Bhasha Banchao Committee had called a strike on May 14 followed by a two-day bandh by the Morcha. During both the bandhs vehicles were attacked along the highway. We had submitted photographs and other evidence along with the contempt petition to the Supreme Court, he said.

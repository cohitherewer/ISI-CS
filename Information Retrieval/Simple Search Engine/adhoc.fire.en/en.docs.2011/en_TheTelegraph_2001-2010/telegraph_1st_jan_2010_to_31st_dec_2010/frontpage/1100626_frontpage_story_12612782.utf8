          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, June 25: Just when the Left Front made it official that we are in the government but not in power, manna dropped from heaven in the form of the fuel price hike        
	The CPMs labour arm, Citu, pounced on the godsend and announced a 24-hour transport strike from 6am on Saturday to protest the price increase. Public transport services such as buses, minibuses and autorickshaws will be hit but private vehicles will be allowed to ply.        
	The strike call within an hour of the Centre announcing the price decision, taken at a meeting boycotted by Mamata Banerjee, betrayed how desperate the Left is for an issue it can take to the Assembly polls less than a year away.        
	A few hours earlier, the Bengal governments chief whip, Syed Mohammed Masih, had articulated that despondency. We are in the government but not in power. We are bleeding and being attacked, Masih told reporters in the Assembly lobby.        
	Masih was referring to the administrations inability to stop alleged attacks on CPM workers but the admission mirrored the helplessness and drift in the government after successive election defeats at the hands of Mamata.        
	From Bengal to Delhi, the Left leaders thrust made it evident that they were more keen to highlight Mamatas inability to stop the fuel price rise than debate the economic compulsions cited by the Centre.        
	Brinda Karat described Mamatas boycott of the group of ministers meeting as hypocrisy while Benoy Konar called it a gimmick.        
	CPM leaders pointed out that no matter how much Mamata tried to distance herself from the price hike, she could not alter the fact that her party was the second-largest partner in the UPA government and she would have to share the responsibility.        
	Twisting the knife in Mamatas discomfiture, CPM state secretariat member and Citu state president Shyamal Chakraborty, who announced the transport strike, said: We hope that the Opposition will also support our strike.        
	However, Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee criticised Citu for calling the strike. We know that the fuel price hike will cause hardship to common people. But calling a strike at the drop of a hat will not solve the problem. Instead, we should make an appeal to the Centre to roll back the increase, he said.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said the strike had been called with a political motive to rejuvenate party workers who have got demoralised after the civic poll reverses.

	Washington, April 21 (PTI): Indian-American star Kal Penn, who is returning to acting after a short stint in President Barack Obamas administration, was robbed at gunpoint in Washington.        
	Penn, 32, best known for his roles in the Harold amp; Kumar films and Mira Nairs Namesake, was in the Dupont Circle area of Washington at 1.20am (local time) yesterday when a gunman forced Penn to lie down on the ground and stole his wallet and cellphone, the police said.         
	Jennifer Goodwin, Penns agent, confirmed the TMZ.com report that the actor was robbed early yesterday. Penn was a prominent campaigner during Obamas 2008 White House bid, and was offered a job in the administration in 2009.

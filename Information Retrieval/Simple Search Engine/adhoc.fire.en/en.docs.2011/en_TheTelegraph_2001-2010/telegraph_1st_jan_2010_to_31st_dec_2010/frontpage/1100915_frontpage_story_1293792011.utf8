	Mumbai, Sep 15 (PTI): The Indian Cricket Board (BCCI) today welcomed the Bombay High Court's decision to dismiss suspended IPL Chairman Lalit Modi's petition challenging the constitution of its disciplinary committee and decided to continue the hearing in New Delhi.
    Modi had demanded recusal of Arun Jaitley and Chirayu Amin from the disciplinary panel, saying they were biased against him.
    The three-member committee, which met last evening at Jyotiraditya Scindia's residence, is scheduled to meet in New Delhi at 2:00 pm today.
    "We are happy that the court did not give any relief to Mr Modi. The Committee will proceed, the witnesses are already on the list and the meeting would go ahead," BCCI CAO Ratnakar Shetty told reporters.
    "BCCI has always adopted a stand that we are not vindictive, we want a proper inquiry and a charge sheet was given to him (Modi).

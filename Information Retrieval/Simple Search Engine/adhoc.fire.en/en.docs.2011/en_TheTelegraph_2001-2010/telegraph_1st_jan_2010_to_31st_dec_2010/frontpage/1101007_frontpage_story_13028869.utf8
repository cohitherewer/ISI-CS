The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India-bound? Pack Hinglish
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                India-bound? Pack Hinglish
  - Between parties, Charles displays linguistic familiarity          AMIT ROY                                     
	London, Oct. 6: When Barack Obama comes calling next month, perhaps the US President can take a tip from Prince Charles: pack some Hinglish along with the customary Namaste, India.        
	In the British Army, and in the Royal Navy, we have vocabulary and working practices which have come directly from India. It is not just our soldiers and sailors who use words such as dhobi, pukkah, dekko and loot, Charles yesterday told Indian Army officers, whom he met with his wife Camilla at the 12 Corps headquarters in Jodhpur.        
	I know from my sons  who are both officers serving in the British Armed Forces  that the peculiarly Indian word chuddies has also entered the mainstream English language. And, of course, our messes are remarkably similar to yours. You are now as likely to find chicken tikka on the menu as roast beef, he went on.        
	He was referring to the TV comedy Goodness Gracious Me and comedian Sanjeev Bhaskers catchphrase, Kiss my chuddies!  which the prince had taken note of earlier, too.        
	Having done his duty by reading the Queens message at the opening of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi and taking tea with President Pratibha Patil, Charles and Camilla found they could mix business with fun more effortlessly in the company of fellow royals, first in Patiala and then in Jodhpur.                     
	Before they flew back to London on Tuesday night, the couple attended the reception given in their honour by Gaj Singh in Jodhpur as the final event of their four-day tour. The ex-maharajas wife Hemlata Rajye and daughter Shivranjani were also present as the night sky was lit up with a firework display.         
	Simon Le Bon, leader singer of Duran Duran from the early 1980s, and his wife, Yasmin Le Bon, a former model, were among guests who lent glamour to the party at Bal Samand Palace, located by a lake. It is understood the model Kate Moss was also there.         
	The day was given over to public functions and meeting villagers, schoolchildren and the like.         
	Meeting senior officers from regiments affiliated with the 18th Battalion, Charles reminded his audience at the 12 Corps headquarters: Our armies have very deep historic bonds, our forebears have fought together, lived together and died together.         
	He went on: But it is not just a shared history that binds us. We share a set of values that underpin the way our military works. We believe in democracy, in civilian control, in human rights and free speech.         
	Camilla is a patron of the Marwari Horse Society which supports this rare breed of horse from the Jodhpur region. In the grounds of Bal Samand Palace she was shown some of the horses used in the past by Indian cavalry regiments.         
	A Colonel Umaid Singh from the organisation gallantly offered to send some of the horses to the UK for the Queens Diamond Jubilee in 2012.         
	The Duchess of Cornwall politely turned him down. It would be lovely if we can have them but there are some problems with quarantine.         
	There were a pair of gaily decorated horses at the reception, where a fashion show was also put on for the royals.        
	On Monday, Charles and Camilla had attended a more elaborate black tie affair hosted by Amarinder Singh, the former ruler of Patiala. The hosts wife, Preneet Kaur, is the Union minister of state for external affairs.         
	Over 160 leading politicians, military officers and local dignitaries were invited to the brightly lit New Moti Bagh Palace.         
	The Sikh Regiment band played carefully selected melodies as Charles and Camilla descended the wide stone stairway from the palace into the garden.         
	Dinner, arranged in an exquisite, air-conditioned tent, included Indian and continental delicacies based on old recipes from Patialas royal kitchens. On the menu were fish korma, smoked chicken and seared salmon, with a dark and white chocolate mousse for dessert.         
	Camilla wore a Bruce Oldfield ice-blue satin dress with a lace over-dress.

	Srinagar, Aug 16 (PTI): Curfew remained clamped today in several areas of the Kashmir Valley where a strike called by separatists disrupted normal life. Curfew is in force in Srinagar, Anantnag, Bijbehara, Sopore, Kupwara, Trehgam and Bandipora, police said. Restrictions on the movement of people have been imposed in other areas including Hyderpora in Budgam and Sumbal in Bandipora.         
	The restrictions have been put in place as a precautionary measure after protests yesterday left more than 30 persons injured in Bandipora, Srinagar and Shopian, they said.         
	The hardline faction of the Hurriyat Conference headed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani has issued a fresh 10-day calendar of protests and demonstrations.        
	 Shops and business markets, educational institutions, banks and private offices were closed and traffic was off the roads.

  - Murder kingpin, 8 others accused of gun attacks arrested        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Jamshedpur, Jan. 27: After more than a month of a frenetic hunt, police have arrested nine members of an amateur gang, led by one Pankaj Dubey, who, they claim, orchestrated most of the attacks on doctors and businessmen in the steel city.        
	The arrests were made in Bistupur, Jugsalai, Kadma, Bagbera, Kasidih and Sakchi over the past three days. Police have recovered nine pistols, two motorcycles and eight mobile phones along with 24 SIM cards of various service providers.        
	East Singhbhum SP Naveen Kumar Singh said a common motive behind the attacks could be the gangs pursuit of supremacy in the underworld. The gang was involved in almost all the recent cases of murders and attacks on doctors and businessmen. We have gathered enough evidence, which will be presented in court, he told reporters, adding that more arrests were likely soon.        
	Those arrested, besides kingpin Pankaj, have been identified as Mashook Manish alias Monu Singh, who is the son of a police constable, Manmohan Mishra, Sheikh Heshamuddin alias Kabir, Mahesh Singh, Brajesh Singh, Ramesh Thakur, Alamgir alias Bechu Bhai and Ashok Singh. All are aged between 18 and 25.        
	According to the SP, Pankaj and Kabir had criminal records while the others were novices. The gang first struck on October 19, when it fired on a petrol station in the Circuit House Area with the sole intention of upsetting Ashoks estranged brother and pump owner Ajay Singh. Ashok is Pankajs right hand and helped raise the gang by misguiding local youths.         
	Singh claimed that interrogation had revealed Pankajs involvement in the December 3 attack on retired Tata Main Hospital (TMH) doctor P.K. Mishra. The doctor had allegedly tried to molest his girlfriend when she went for treatment at his residence-cum-clinic in Kadma. An agitated Pankaj even met the doctor and sought an explanation. A few days later, the latter was shot at and injured during morning walk.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, Mishra admitted that he had an altercation with a friend of an ailing girl, but claimed he had never misbehaved with the patient. If the police still want to grill me, I am ready to co-operate, he said.        
	On December 11, the gang targeted prominent builder Rohit Singh. They fired on his car in front of his residence in the Circuit House Area, but no one was injured.         
	Six days later, senior TMH doctor Prabhat Kumar, who was apparently whipping up public sentiment over the attack on Mishra and aiding police investigations, was killed at his Northern Town residence in Bistupur.

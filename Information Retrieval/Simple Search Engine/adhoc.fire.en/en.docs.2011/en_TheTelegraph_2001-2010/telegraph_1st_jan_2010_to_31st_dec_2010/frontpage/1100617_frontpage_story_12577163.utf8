                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mr. Mayor hear us
										      As Shovan Chattopadhyay was sworn in as the new mayor of Calcutta, we asked some residents of the city about what the tasks they would like Chattopadhyay to take up first.                              
	 Sarani Ghosh, MBA student              
	Please improve the road conditions. There are too many potholes around.        
	The rains leave the city flooded every year. Please see that we dont have to suffer from water logging this year too.        
	Please see that our drainage system is improved.               
	 I would expect him to do his work properly and crack down on corruption, and to fulfill our basic demands, something his predecessors failed to do.              
	Jayati Kundu, homemaker.               
	Fixing the drainage system should be a priority.        
	 A proper system of disposal of garbage should be developed. Currently, roads are often littered with refuse and stray dogs and cows feed on them, creating an unhealthy environment.         
	There are a lot of people in the city who are working night shifts. Please ensure better safety on the roads, so as travelling in the night may not be an unsafe option.                     
	I expect he will keep up to his promises that he has made when he contested for the elections.                    
	Pradip Chakraborty, working professional              
	The drinking water which corporation supplies us should be clean and pure.         
	The roads should be well maintained, so that traffic jams are reduced         
	I would request him to make our city a good place to live in.                    
	 I hope he will really turn Calcutta into a city to be proud of, not only residents, but also for people visiting from abroad.              
	Sushmita Mondal, working professional              
	Smooth roads.         
	Rains are a blessing everywhere, but for us it becomes a curse, as water logging invades and disrupts our daily life. Please ensure that this problem is solved.        
	Garbage disposal is not done properly in many places, please ensure that it is taken care of everywhere.                     
	 I expect him to keep his promises and help us to live a better life in this wonderful city.               
	Amar Sen, artist              
	Top three demands:-        
	The drainage system is pathetic. He needs to solve this problem urgently         
	Garbage cleaning and its proper disposal should be done properly everywhere.         
	There are many illegal buildings and constructions around the city. This corruption should be stopped as lives of many people are involved with it.               
	I have just toured back from Germany and felt that our city needs true beautification. We have a lot to attract the tourists from all places. I would expect that he really takes care of our citys beautification.                    
	(As told to Debarati Mukherjee)

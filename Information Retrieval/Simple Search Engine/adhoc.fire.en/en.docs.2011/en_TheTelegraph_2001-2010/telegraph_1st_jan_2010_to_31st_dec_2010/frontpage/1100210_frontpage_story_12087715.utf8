                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Swu, Muivah expected in April
  - DELHI TO ANNOUNCE INTERLOCUTOR, SAYS PILLAI          OUR BUREAU                                           
	Guwahati/Kohima, Feb. 9: The Centre today announced that the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) leadership had proposed to come to India for talks in April and that an interlocutor would be named by this week.         
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillai announced this on the sidelines of the 58th North Eastern Council meeting at the Assam Administrative Staff College in Guwahati during an unscheduled interaction with reporters.         
	You will be happy to know that the NSCN (I-M) leadership has agreed to come for talks to be held in April. We have also decided to name an interlocutor for the talks by this week, he said.         
	On the proposals to be discussed with the Naga leaders, Pillai said these would be discussed with the NSCN leadership before being divulged.         
	Sources said the Centre had prepared a 29-point counter proposal to the 31-point charter of proposals submitted by the Isak-Muivah group to hammer out a solution to the over 60-year-old Naga political imbroglio. The two sides have held over 60 rounds of talks since 1998, but an acceptable solution remains elusive.         
	While official sources said the Naga leaders had agreed to come between April 1 and 10, the group said the visit of its chairman Isak Chishi Swu and general secretary Thiungaleng Muivah would be decided by the joint council of the Government of the Peoples Republic of Nagalim.         
	The GPRNs kilonser (minister) for information and publicity, Vikiye Sumi, told this correspondent that they had not received any communiqu about the proposed visit of their leaders, but it would be decided by the joint council.         
	Rh. Raising, the secretary of steering committee, the highest policy making body of the NSCN, said according to the agreement with the Centre, the talks should be held at the prime ministerial level, in a third country and without pre-condition.         
	However, Swu and Muivah are prepared to come to India to discuss the Naga issue with Indian leaders if the Centre is sincere about hammering out a solution, he added.         
	But, Raising said the group had nothing to discuss with the Indian home ministry and had turned down two invitations from the ministry of home affairs.         
	Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio, who attended the NEC meet, said the prospects of an amicable solution had brightened and all the groups were in a reconciliatory mood because of public pressure.         
	I hope there is some progress as the leaders are likely to come to India. The reconciliation process has reached the district level to bring the groups together, he added.         
	He, however, pointed out that the process has been on for 12 years, reflecting the patience of the Naga people. The NSCN (I-M) announced a ceasefire in 1997.

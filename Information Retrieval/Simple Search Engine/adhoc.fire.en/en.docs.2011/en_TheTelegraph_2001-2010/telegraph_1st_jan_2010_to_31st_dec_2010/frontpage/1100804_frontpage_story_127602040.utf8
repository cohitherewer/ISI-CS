	New Delhi, Aug 4 (PTI): Planning Commission will be ready with the final draft of the Integrated Action Plan (IAP) for development of Naxal-hit districts in the next few days, Home Minister P Chidambaram said today.
    The Plan panel has been asked to enlarge the scope of the IAP to cover maximum number of the 83 Naxal-affected districts in seven states, he informed the Rajya Sabha during Question Hour.
    Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had last month indicated that IAP may include a Rs 13,742 crore financial package for the 35 worst-hit districts.
    Chidambaram said development was the first part of the two-pronged strategy for dealing with the problem of naxalism and added that IAP will apply to districts beyond the 35 affected ones.
    He said there was no evidence to suggest that Naxalites were receiving money from abroad.

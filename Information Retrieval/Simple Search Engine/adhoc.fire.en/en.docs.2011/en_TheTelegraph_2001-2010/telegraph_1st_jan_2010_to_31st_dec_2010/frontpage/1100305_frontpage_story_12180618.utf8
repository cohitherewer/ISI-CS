	Lucknow, March 4: At least 63 backward caste villagers, more than half of them children, were crushed to death in a stampede around noon when the gate of an ashram collapsed, unable to withstand the pressure of people making a dash for free food and small gifts.         
	Many of the victims were Dalits, whose welfare has been the USP of chief minister Mayavati, herself a Dalit. The poverty-driven tragedy unfolded in a crucible where a political race is on to woo Dalits.        
	Brij Lal, the additional director-general of police, Uttar Pradesh, said among the dead so far, 37 were children while 26 women fell trying to rescue the kids.         
	Over 10,000 people, most of them from poor, backward caste families, had gathered outside the ashram at Kunda in Pratapgarh district, around 185km east of Lucknow, for a bhandara (a community religious feast).        
	Pratapgarh is on the border of Rae Bareli and Amethi Lok Sabha constituencies, currently represented by Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul.         
	Rahul has been trying to woo Dalits by visiting backward caste villages in his constituency, sharing meals with them and even on occasions spending the night on their charpoys. Of late, youths from Pratapgarh had been tilting to the Congress, swayed by the pro-Dalit campaign of Rahul and Sonia.         
	Todays rush for a free meal is, however, a grim reminder of the plight of Dalits in Uttar Pradesh, 42 per cent of whom live below the poverty line and are landless.                 
	The much-publicised bhandara had been organised by Baba Kripaluji, who runs the ashram, to mark his wifes death anniversary. For the past few days, ashram authorities had been making announcements in villages about todays event where apart from free food, gifts like saris, utensils and clothes for the poor were to be distributed.        
	The ashram, funded by a trust based in North America, is located on a 6-hectare plot in Kunda, also the empire of strongman Raghuraj Pratap Singh or Raja Bhaiyya.        
	The ashram can be accessed through four huge arched gates, which lead to the Ramhanki temple. The authorities decided to open only one gate at noon.         
	When the gate facing the eastern side of the temple on the main road opened suddenly at 12, the people, who had been waiting for long, began to stream in, said R.N. Tripathi, an officer of Kunda police station.        
	Such was the rush that one side of the arch-structure caved in, sparking panic as the people ran helter-skelter. Some people were crushed to death under the gate, while others tripped and came under the feet of the rushing crowd as they tried to escape through a narrow corridor. More than 200 people were injured.        
	The children fell first and the women in their attempt to save them fell on them, said Shiv, who was among the crowd. The crowd just trampled on whoever fell on the ground. Other eyewitnesses said many of those killed had fallen into a borewell near the gate.         
	Lal, the additional director-general of police, said a probe had been ordered. Most of the victims are women and children as they could not run to save their lives, he said.        
	Sita Devi Paswan, a woman who fractured her leg and had bruises in her hands, said they had run out of patience. We had been waiting for three hours since 9am. I was waiting behind 500 people. When the gates opened, the people were trying to push in and enter as quickly as possible. There was a sound of a crash and people began running, said Paswan, who is admitted in the district hospital at Pratapgarh.         
	Baba Kripaluji Maharaj has gone underground fearing a backlash. Many in Pratapgarh today raked up the ashrams controversial past. In 2000, over 30 foreign sadhvis had suddenly left the ashram and returned to their countries, abandoning their work for the poor.

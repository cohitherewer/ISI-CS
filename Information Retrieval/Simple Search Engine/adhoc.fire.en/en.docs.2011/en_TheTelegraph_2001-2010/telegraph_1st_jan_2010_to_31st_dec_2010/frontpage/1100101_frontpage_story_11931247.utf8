										      The Sen interview: Nothing wrong with seeking change. The central question is what kind of a Bengal do we want?      Now you can say twenty10 and so on for 89 years -SPECIAL ISSUE                         Amartya Sen at his Santiniketan home on Christmas Day.

	The first decade of the millennium proved to be a study in contrasts. It began on a doomful note with the war on terrorism, followed by a series of terrible highs and lows. The global economy looked up, then plummeted. In various parts of the world, people lost, won or lobbied for their human rights. With the advent of global citizenship, climate change became a serious talking point on the highest international fora. On Christmas Day, during a long car ride from Pratichi in Santiniketan to Dum Dum airport in   Calcutta, Nobel Laureate AMARTYA SEN																							 spoke to Somak Ghoshal of The Telegraph on the shape of the decade gone by as well as the challenges that lie ahead of India, and the world, in the next 10 years. Excerpts from the interview:                                 
	Q: What is your assessment of the last decade?         
	A: The last decade has seen a lot of exciting things, both positive and negative. The negatives are probably more dominant. We saw 9/11 and the accentuation of global terrorism. On November 26, 2008, there was a ghastly incident in Mumbai. There was also organised violence of a non-terrorist, but sectarian and communal, kind. Perhaps the pre-eminent example of that would be the Gujarat killings of 2002. There were other such events around the world, as in Sudan, which saw the targeting of the southern Christian population by extremists from the north.         
	There was the completely misconceived war in Iraq, based on the hypothesis that Iraq had an alliance with al Qaida, which was not true, and that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, which was also not true. But it was certainly true that Iraq had a dictatorial regime. However, there are many other countries with dictatorial regimes. So it was an oddly ill-conceived war, which put the fight against global terrorism back rather than forward. There was also an intervention in Afghanistan, though with more logic to it; it did lead to the displacement of the Taliban. This, too, was one of the consequences of 9/11, and certainly had some positive effect in Afghanistan in preventing the busting of girls schools and the punishing of people with any kind of non-orthodox view. But such activities are still going on, partly fed by the deflection of American concentration on Afghanistan, thanks to Iraq. A confrontation that began early in the decade is still continuing.         
	There have, however, been some positive achievements as well, of which an understanding of the need to take internationally co-ordinated action on global warming is a very important example. There is also a greater understanding that terrorism cannot be dealt with by any unilateral approach. No country, not even the US, can plausibly dictate to other countries how they should think. The fact that unilateral approaches, including the US-led policy of military intervention in Iraq, have been so problematic has made the importance of multilateralism much better understood.         
	There was also an important positive change in America in the form of moving away from ignoring the views of the rest of the world to a position in which Barack Obama takes a much more world-friendly view. It is also a social change in which issues of domestic justice, including medical benefits for all American citizens, have become important in American politics.        
	Indeed, America was the only rich country in the world which did not have medical insurance automatically provided for every citizen or legal resident. That it still doesnt have. But, by the recent changes that are going on, there would be a much greater opportunity for the American citizen or legal resident to make use of the medical facilities that the country is able to offer. So there have been some positive changes, including a better recognition of the need for global thinking, whether it be on multilateralism in tackling terrorism or in addressing global warming. Also, some progress has been made in advancing the understanding of the need for more global justice, and specifically for the elimination of some huge cases of global injustice, such as rampant illiteracy, ill-treatment of women, and people dying of diseases without medicine or any medical attention even though effective treatments are known and appropriate medicines are inexpensive to produce. On these issues there is much more vocal and informed discussion today than in the previous decades. I would regard these as substantial achievements. But we have to see how these recognitions translate into policies and public actions over the next decade or so.         
	Q: While taking office for the second time last year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke of the decisive decade. In what ways do you think it would be decisive?         
	A: I think Manmohan may have been partly talking about the world, but he was also talking about India in this. In India, there was a kind of popularity of the communalist approach, led by the Hindutva movement, which seemed to be in ascendancy in the last two decades. But in the decade thats just finishing, what had seemed like a relentless march towards greater and greater sectarian understanding of Indian politics had a big setback.         
	I think Manmohans first prime ministership in 2004 came at the end of a marginal victory on the part of the secular parties led by the Congress. Since then, secularism as one of the major planks or platforms of Indian democracy has been consolidated, including in the 2009 elections, when the Hindutva-oriented parties had a further setback. So I think it is possible that in making the statement you quote, Manmohan might have been concerned about putting Indian secularism on a very firm footing in the coming decade.         
	Manmohan must have been also concerned, in the quoted remark, with the economic development of the country. Indias growth has been quite high over the last decade, even though the sharing of the gains of that development has been quite unequal. There is a huge potential for doing much more with the resources that are generated by high growth. And I think that when he described the next 10 years as the decisive decade, he was thinking both of maintaining Indias high growth and departing from the past in making the results of development much more equitably shared than what happens at the moment.         
	And there, in my judgement, he could sensibly begin with extending basic education and basic healthcare to all. Whether the policies that will come will entirely live up to the expectations generated by the demands would be important to watch.         
	Also, the role of India in the world is something, I do know, worries Manmohan, and he will welcome the fact that India seems to have a much better reception in the world now as a global actor. He would want that to be further strengthened and consolidated.                     Amartya Sen. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya    
	Q: What are the likely pitfalls that lie ahead of India?         
	A: Pitfalls are always difficult to guess because you can typically perceive that you are in a pitfall only when you actually fall! So Im not sure that it would be easy to predict what the potential pitfalls are. But certainly, India has had a role in the past of voicing concerns that are not only its own but also of the underdogs of the world. After India became independent in 1947, for many years after that, India was maddening the rest of the world by being hugely moralistic about its own role in championing the cause of the underdogs of society. But even though that vocal level was probably not sustainable, and not entirely fair to the other countries, the fact remains that there was a strong sense of global concern in Indias position.         
	India has been very successful in some ways in terms of domestic expansion of the economy and in terms of the global recognition of its importance (even though it has not been terribly successful in other respects, for example, in expanding healthcare and basic education for all Indians). There is, however, a danger in the possibility that India has become  or at least has given the impression of having become  less concerned with fairness to the underdogs of the world and much more concerned with its own self-interest. Now, any nation making its policy will naturally put some of its self-interests in a special position: in some ways that is indeed what the government is, among other things, charged to do. But then, thats not the only thing that a government is charged to do. We are not only citizens of a country, we are also citizens of an interdependent world.         
	Take the case of global climate. It is right that India should point out that the Americans and Europeans have polluted the world in the past for a long time. Thats a justified complaint. But I think historical restitution never quite works. The lines taken by Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Martin Luther King Jr. saying Forget trying to get justice for the past, but bear in mind the inheritance of the injustice of the past in injustice today and try to do something about it  that I believe is the right approach.                     
	Therefore, wanting a global contract that is fairer to the interests of the poorer parts of the world, including India, China or Brazil, is appropriate.         
	But then to say that there is no contract we will ever sign if its binding, seems to me to assume that we have an exemption from our global citizenship role that other countries in Europe or America cannot have. I think our attitude requires a critical evaluation because after all it is the job of every country to decide what it can fairly do to reduce a global danger that the entire humanity is facing today. To say that we will under no circumstances accept a binding contract isnt a very good way of beginning to talk. A much better way of beginning is to say that we will indeed be party to accepting a contract, even a binding contract, provided the contract itself is fair and takes into account our legitimate concerns and those of other countries that are poor.         
	The second point Ill make is that there are still other countries which are very poor and which are not having the economic growth rate of China or India or Brazil or South Africa. That includes the bulk of the continent of Africa and some of Asia too. So there is an issue of fairness to the world, and India should not savour the role of doing to Africa today what Europe and America have done to India in the past, namely fill up what may be called the global commons  that is the global atmosphere  with its own muscular presence while leaving very little room for Africas economic development.               
	As Africa starts developing, it will still have the same kind of problems that India speaks about today, namely, the need to have some emissions that go with economic growth, which would be a part of Africas attempt to expand its living standards. So we have to take a wiser and a fairer view of the world community and the globality of our moral concerns.         
	There is a certain danger that in the flush of nationalist rhetoric our moral understanding may be lost. I know this is not a popular call. After talking about all this in a meeting in Delhi, I can see from the Internet that Ive been comprehensively attacked by many for being against Indias interests. Well, Im not being against India at all! Im just pointing out why we must try to stand up for the interests of the poor in the world, and that includes us. We have to stand up also for the poor who are not having even the benefit of growth now, or an opportunity to expand their living standards (with more emissions right now). We have to take into account the future, and the future particularly of countries that are often even poorer than India is. There is nothing anti-Indian in reviving the spirit of a global sense of fairness, which has been a part of our national thinking  it was quite central to our national movement right from the beginning. What Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and Jawaharlal Nehru articulated again and again was part of what fired our national movement. It is important that we (I speak here as a proud Indian citizen) do not lose the rich heritage of global awareness that we have.         
	Q: You have already extensively articulated your thoughts on primary education in India. Where do you see Indian higher education going in the next decade?         
	A: I bore everyone silly by talking again and again of primary education. Even though your invitation to me is to talk of higher education, I wont get there without first talking about primary education. This is because India has expanded its higher education at least quantitatively in a very dramatic way, in some ways qualitatively too, while primary education, despite some expansion, is still relatively neglected. We still have a high proportion of illiteracy, a high proportion of schoolchildren who actually dont go to school for one reason or another  because of the lack of facilities, the lack of school sometimes, or the lack of quality teaching. As you know, the Pratichi trust, which was started with my Nobel money about a decade ago, has been very concerned about how to increase the coverage as well as the quality and effectiveness of primary education. In my judgement, that remains a bigger challenge than higher education.         
	Having said that, since youve asked me about higher education, Id say that there has been a kind of differential success in some areas like in technical education, where quality control has been quite well observed, as in the IITs, the IIMs, and also in some elite colleges connected with the sciences and the arts and traditional higher education. So in patches, we have produced very good higher education, but there are also a whole lot of higher educational institutions in which quality needs much greater attention than expansion.         
	We have already had a lot of expansion, now we need consolidation. There is more need to pay attention to quality today than earlier when the number of universities was small. Its very good that we have so many universities now and so many people get doctorates, but it is critical that the quality of education be enhanced to make it commensurate with the promise that higher education offers.         
	Q: Is there a fair way in which the issue of land for industry could be resolved over the next 10 years?         
	A: Theres always a fairer way than other ways because that is the nature of these judgements. If theres no solution that you regard to be really fair, then you have to see that among the ones that are not really fair, which is the least unfair of them all. And that will be the fairer solution under the circumstances. Thats one of the arguments in my book, The Idea of Justice, namely that you dont look for a perfect system, but you look for how to remove injustice and unfairness in the world to the extent we can and as speedily as possible.         
	Are there ways of enhancing the land policies that exist now? I would suggest three different aspects of the land question, which is a very misunderstood question and polarises people. This question has not been as well thought through as it could be, given the tradition of cerebral politics in India, of having very high quality analysis that goes into economic thinking, which forms the backbone of political issues. The ways and means of expanding education, healthcare and land reform have always had an intelligently and decently worked out intellectual basis. There have been arguments and counter-arguments and the pros and cons of policies on education and healthcare are fairly well understood now. The land question remains rather fog-bound, if I may put it that way, in loudly articulated pronouncements  on different sides.         
	So what are the problems that need special attention? There is, first, the political issue. If you take land with the object of it being used for industry, that object could be effectively frustrated by opposition by political groups if they see in it their interest to do just that. A policy that cannot be implemented  no matter how fair in itself  cannot be a very good policy. There is no such thing as some policies being right in theory but not in practice, because if they are not right in practice, then they are not right in theory if that theory is concerned with practice.         
	Central to the political issue in a democracy like India, where any party can make a huge mess by organised protests, there is need for political maturity on all sides, and the necessity of a certain understanding among political parties to see that if something is in the interest of the region or the country then that should be allowed to go ahead rather than stopping it by using the means that a democratic structure tends to allow. It is easy enough in Indian politics to bust up pretty much any arrangement through an enormous amount of agitation and sometimes even through violence.         
	There is a need for those who institute these policies to take into account the likely political impact, including that of land acquisition. Take Singur, which was such a big political event last year. Bengal does need industries (and the general approach into which Singur fits was not wrong in that general perspective), but there was a case for not regarding the acquisition of land as the first resort. Indeed, my argument, which I have spelled out in two articles in The Telegraph more than a year ago (The Industrial Strategy, Dec. 29, and Policy by Discussion, Dec. 30, 2007), has been that forcible acquisition of land should not be the first resort  it can only be the last resort when much of the land has been freely bought by the industrialist in question. (I have to note some frustration here that some critics of my alleged views like quoting me second-hand but citing from an interview I gave  preferring to rely on what a reporter thought I said  rather than examining what I actually said in my own essays!) You can buy a lot of land just on the basis of market prices and they are not a very crippling part of the investment cost for industry. Try to use as much of the market as possible in acquiring land, because industries operate on market principles and theres no reason why that should not also apply to land.         
	However, it may turn out that much of the land has been secured but there are small bits that are holding up the whole project. People can make a huge amount of money by holding a key to the feasibility of a factory. That may be a moment, with the consent of the population and with the help of public discussion, to say that now we have reached the stage of last resort, where we have to acquire. The public can understand that argument much better than a first-resort acquisition of land.         
	The second issue is not just political feasibility, but that of fairness to the owner. If you have actually purchased the land in the market, then at least the concern that was very dominant in Singur, namely, whether people were getting a fair compensation for their land, would not have arisen because they would have sold the land only if they had reason to sell it. As a last resort, if you have to acquire some land because some people are demanding astronomical prices, using their blackmailing ability in preventing a factory, then the case for acquisition may well arise. So I think in terms of the interests of doing justice to the owners of land, the policy that Im suggesting would have features not only of political feasibility but also of fairness to the owners of land.         
	The third aspect is very important, and often neglected: that the people whose interests are affected are not only the owners of land. They are, positively, those who would benefit from the industrial development, and negatively, those who may be dependent on agriculture without owning the land. Bhaagchashi would be a good example of the latter. In that case, there would be a need to see that justice is done to them. That has to be a part of the public policy of the government, namely the interest of the community. The interests of the non-landowning population have to be considered taking into account both what is being lost and what is being gained  and for whom. In the case of Singur, there were interests of the general population in industrial expansion that the rhetoric of the oppositional movements tended to ignore: there are economic benefits in getting jobs either in the factory or through economic expansion in the surrounding area connected with the factory. Singur, which I often pass when going by car between Santiniketan and Kolkata, now stands like a ghost town. If it had developed there would have been a booming economy around it, and that would have given an enormous amount of jobs to the people. That issue cannot be brushed away even if the political rhetoric of the oppositional movements did not favour that concern.         
	On the other hand, there is a further question about the interests of the peasants and of the local population. Would the displaced people have been able to get jobs in the factory? How much would they benefit from the local business boom that would have undoubtedly accompanied industrial development in Singur? There are good reasons, based on economic reasoning, to think that the local boom  now sadly lost  would have been substantially beneficial to the local population in and around Singur, but we do need a critically scrutinised confirmation that this general economic expectation is indeed correct and robust. These issues are not only for the government to think about, but also for the media as well as Opposition parties. As far as the general issue of justice to the people at large is concerned, it is very important for all the parties  the government, the Opposition, the protest leaders  to consider, with seriousness and sincerity, the interests of the diverse community that make up any particular regional population. It would certainly be helpful for the government to have public discussions on these subjects with other parties to arrive at some conclusion on what would be the right thing for the government to do.         
	Q: So what is your overall take on the Singur events and their aftermath, and the general demand for change that has become so popular in West Bengal since those days of agitation around Singur?         
	A: My take on the Singur issue is that the basic idea of industrial development is right (and West Bengal does need many more industries for rebuilding a prosperous economy), and in that respect, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees basic policy was correct. And yet there were two major lacunae in the governmental implementation of the industrialisation strategy. One was in treating land acquisition as the first resort rather than as the last resort, and the other in not having adequate public discussion with other parties to arrive at some agreed conclusions.         
	Now, its sometimes said that if the Opposition does not want to sit down with you, you cant force them. If there is a tremendous amount of effort to try to get the Opposition to sit down with you and even then you dont succeed, then, of course, an intelligent voter will pay attention to the fact that there was a real effort on your part to do that. The public does pay sympathetic attention to genuine efforts.         
	Given the way that West Bengal politics has developed in recent years, theres so much disaffection now with the ruling CPM leadership, people tend to think that nothing else matters but what is called change. But we have to ask what kind of a change would be able to generate economic development, social stability and fairness to the people. Would a mere change in the political party in power ensure the rule of law and order, which is absolutely essential for economic development as well as for social peace and security?         
	Bengal has been one of the most industrialised parts of the world since long back. Even Ptolemy wrote about the prosperity of the region through industrial development. Traders from country after country, the British, the Danes, the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Flemish, the Dutch, were competing with each other in the 17th and 18th centuries to do trading in this part of the world, mainly getting industrial products. Our prosperity was based on industry, in addition to a flourishing agriculture, between which there need be no rivalry. When Britain occupied India, Bengal was the richest part of the country, and today its become one of the poorer parts. In this the de-industrialisation of Bengal  in the British colonial period and also after Independence has played a big part.         
	The CPM policies of the past also contributed to this condition, not just because of the intransigence I was referring to, but through giving industrial leaders the impression that this was a not very friendly state to base your industries in. The CPM has reversed its obstructionist policies now  indeed quite strongly but by the time the policies were reversed, the general disaffection with the CPM was such that people wanted it to go. (Many of the opponents of the government  both on the Right and on the Left  seem strangely unsure now about the critically important role of industrialisation, which need not be at all harmful to agriculture in general.) There has been a growing and increasingly vocal demand for change  and only for change. Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting change, if we think through what kind of a change is needed. Now theres an odd alliance of some who are much more to the Left of the CPM joining hands with those who are much more to the Right of the CPM. What they have in common is opposition to the CPM. And one would say here that to some extent, in the dialectics of West Bengal politics, the CPM has contributed to this disaffection around it, whereby both at the Right and the Left people may be opposed to it and united against it. But this is also a time for the population of West Bengal in general to rethink where they are actually going. Simply to say we want change: full stop! is not itself a very articulate view. It depends on change of what kind, in what form  what constructively do we want?         
	The most articulated part of the policy of change on which a consensus is sought between the Right Opposition and the Left Opposition is to say that we want to displace the ruling party from office. Then, there will be different people occupying those offices. Well, thats not an adequate policy, even if it tends to appeal to those who are fed up with the Left Front being in office for so long. The question is when you yourself come to office what are you going to do? How are you going to establish law and order? How do you propose to remove injustice to the neglected underdogs of society? How would you reverse Maoist violence without ignoring the sense of injustice, especially to tribal people, from which that violence draws its strength? How would you prevent the CPM from doing to you what you may be doing to the present government  by busting governmental plans of economic transformation? How would you develop industry? How would you re-establish the sense of security that is essential for social life as well as for economic expansion? I wish the dialogue about change would take more note of the diverse issues that have to be addressed and not just of changing those who sit in office.         
	The central question is: what kind of a West Bengal do we want?         
	Q: Do you think India would be ready to take some tough, even unpleasant, decisions to sustain its rate of economic growth?         
	A: Im not a great believer of unpleasantness being a way for high growth rate or for economic development in general. I think economic development is not like fighting a world war. Churchill may have been right to promise nothing other than blood, sweat and tears, but bloodshed and tears are not very effective ingredients of economic development. Indeed, in that reading lies a huge possibility of counterproductive policies. In the past, this approach has been used to say lets think of democracy later but we must have economic development earlier, which is a completely unsound reasoning. Without democracy, youre not in a position to make sure that the underdogs who have been neglected get the attention they deserve. We might, through good luck, get a ruler who is very good, like Akbar, or we might get a ruler who is very far from good, and then we get a terrible policy. Akbar or Asoka was not controlled by democracy, but we were lucky to have emperors like that at that time  but we cant rely on luck. So we do want a systematic influence on the priorities of governance, through democracy, particularly in the form  I discuss that idea in my book The Idea of Justice  of governance by discussion. Similarly, it has often been said that you cannot remove poverty until the time when there is a huge amount of national wealth and prosperity. This is ridiculous because the poor are living their lives right now, rather than waiting to live a life in the future, and a lot of things can be done for them here and now. So we have to think about how to make human lives better with more freedom and well-being  right now, as well as in the future.         
	So I dont think blood, sweat and tears are very high contributors to economic good. But your question is still sensible, because sometimes decisions have to be taken that may be unpleasant to some. Even though the demands may sometimes come from a small section of the community, and they may be against the interests of others and of poorer people, those demands may be hard to resist if the small group demanding them happens to be very powerful. You may then have to stand up against them. Quite a lot of policies of subsidising commodities, which are used by the rich rather than the poor, have played their part in generating pressure groups that are very active.         
	The basic question to ask is not how to take an unpleasant decision, but how to take a good decision. And if the good decision turns out to be unpleasant for some part of the community, which is small but powerful, and if that makes those good policies unpleasant for the government to execute, well then, you have to have the courage to take unpleasant decisions of that kind. However, the general cultivation of militarist unpleasantness is not a part of my understanding of economic development at all.          WHAT SEN SAID  On Manmohan
  The role of India in the world is something, I do know, worries Manmohan, and he will welcome the fact that India seems to have a much better reception in the world now as a global actor
  On climate
  Wanting a global contract that is fairer to the interests of the poorer parts of the world hellip; is appropriate. But then to say that there is no contract we will ever sign if it rsquo;s binding seems to me to assume that we have an exemption from our global citizenship role...
  On bengal
  It is time for the population of Bengal to rethink where they are actually going. Simply to say lsquo;we want change: full stop! rsquo; is not itself a very articulate view

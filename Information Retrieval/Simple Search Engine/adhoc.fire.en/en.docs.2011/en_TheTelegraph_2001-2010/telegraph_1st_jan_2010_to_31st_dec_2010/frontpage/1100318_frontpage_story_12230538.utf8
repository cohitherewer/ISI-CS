The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | America spoons out Headley sweetener 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                America spoons out Headley sweetener 
          K.P. NAYAR                            David Headley                                  
	Washington, March 17: When it comes to timing, you have to give it to the Americans.         
	With the media build up today for David Coleman Headleys guilty plea to charges of providing material support for terrorist attacks in Mumbai and anticipation over his formal plea tomorrow, any effort by New Delhi to complain about the Obama administrations neglect of India has become a non-starter.        
	On the ground in New Delhi, the US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, Robert Blake, will follow up from Friday with a major public relations exercise to placate Indians ahead of prime minister Manmohan Singhs visit here next month and external affairs minister S.M. Krishnas follow up trip in the last week of June.        
	Headleys lawyer John Theis told reporters in Chicago yesterday as foreign secretary Nirupama Rao was finishing her three days of meetings in Washington that this is the result of lengthy discussions with the government. I expect there will be a plea agreement that will be available to the public.        
	The official word here about Headleys planned guilty plea is that he is doing it to avoid a death sentence. But that argument does not hold water since it is unlikely that the prosecution could have built up a watertight case against him that calls for capital punishment.        
	That is because Denmark has firmly and consistently refused to co-operate with the US in this case or share any information about Headley or his Canadian accomplice Tahawwur Hussain Rana although Copenhagen would have been the direct target of their plot to blow up the Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten newspaper.        
	Other European countries have also refused to provide the US with crucial details about the terrorist duos transit flights through Europe to India or Pakistan and other details about their activities on the Continent.        
	European Union members are against the death penalty. They are prohibited by law from sharing information about cases abroad in which the death penalty may be applied.        
	Limited information from Denmarks national intelligence service PET has been reaching the US within Natos framework of institutionalised co-operation, but sources in Chicago familiar with the case insist that this is grossly inadequate in building up a strong case.        
	PET would have to pay dearly for any excessive co-operation if it turns out that Headley and Rana are sentenced to death on the basis of any evidence that is presented in the case which came from this spy organisation.        
	Part of the reason why Headley has been sitting pretty and pleaded not guilty to both the Mumbai and Copenhagen charges against him is that his lawyers know that the US may have to eventually give an assurance to Denmark about not seeking the death penalty against their client before meaningful evidence can reach Chicago from across the Atlantic.        
	The view here is that if Headley pleads guilty to charges that he scouted targets for the assault on Mumbai in 2008, he is doing so on orders from his former minders in the shadowy world of American intelligence.        
	Headley was a double agent who worked for US intelligence and he pleaded guilty in court on drug-related charges on the orders of his minders in 1998 to continue his clandestine work for the US Drug Enforcement Administration.        
	For now, however, Headleys guilty plea will be a major public relations coup within India for the Americans at a time when Indo-US relations appear not as close as they were under the Bush administration.

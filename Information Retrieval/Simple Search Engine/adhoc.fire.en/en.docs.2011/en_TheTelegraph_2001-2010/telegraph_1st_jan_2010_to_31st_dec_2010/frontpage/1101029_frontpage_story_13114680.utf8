  - Serving spy chief makes first public appearance in British agencys 101-year history           JOHN F. BURNS AND ALAN COWELL                      John Sawers in London on Thursday. (Reuters)                                 
	London, Oct. 28: At an appropriately hush-hush venue, before a not-so-hush-hush audience of newspaper editors and TV cameras, the head of Britains Secret Intelligence Service today made the first public appearance by a serving chief of the agency in its 101-year history.        
	But John Sawers, whose organisation is widely known as MI6 and has been made famous by James Bond, devoted much of his 30-minute address to the central role of secrecy in maintaining security and to what he called Britains abhorrence of torture to extract secret information.        
	Secrecy is not a dirty word, he said. Secrecy is not there as a cover-up. Secrecy plays a crucial part in keeping Britain safe and secure. If our operations and methods become public, they wont work.        
	Sawyers, 55, took over the agency after the retirement of his predecessor late last year. Previously he had been a high-profile diplomat, serving as Britains ambassador to the UN and in other posts.        
	The organisation traces its history to a decision by defence planners in 1909 to create a Secret Service Bureau. The body evolved through two world wars and the Cold War, feeding the plot lines and character lists of spy thrillers from James Bond to George Smiley.         
	But for decades, the identity of its chief was the biggest secret of all. Sawers took up his current post in November 2009, becoming the 15th chief of the service and inheriting the codename C, after the first chief, Mansfield Cumming, who signed himself C.        
	Why now, might you ask? Sawyers said of his decision to go public. The answer, he said, was that the debate about MI6 was not well informed and in todays open society, no government institution is given the benefit of the doubt all the time.        
	His appearance reinforced a trend among Britains spy bosses to shed the traditional cloak of their trade. The move followed a first public speech by Iain Lobban, the director of Britains electronic eavesdropping agency, and several appearances by Jonathan Evans, the director-general of MI5, which is responsible for domestic security in contrast to MI6s focus on overseas operations.                    
	Despite the nature of Sawerss job, said Frank Gardner, the BBCs security correspondent, this is someone who loves the limelight.        
	A willing performer in front of the media, Sawers seldom missed an opportunity to speak at the stakeout  a microphone positioned outside the UN Security Council  whether or not the subject under discussion was one in which Britain had a particular interest.        
	Britains Press Association news agency said before he spoke that his host, the Society of Editors, had requested that the venue for his speech not be made public in advance.        
	Even before his appointment, Sawers seemed to offer a break with tradition, letting himself be seen in Facebook photographs having fun in a park, wearing a red fleece and a Santa Claus hat and playing Frisbee on a beach.                    Daniel Craig, who plays Bond    
	The photographs were posted by Sawerss wife, Shelley, who had chronicled the activities of her family and friends on the Facebook page, whose existence was disclosed by the tabloid Mail on Sunday.        
	Officials have said Sawers began his career with the Secret Intelligence Service before switching to diplomacy. The Times said he worked in Yemen and Syria in his early years in intelligence.        
	He enjoyed a brisk ride to the top with an unusual amount of sharp-end operational content, including pioneering township diplomacy in twilight apartheid South Africa, wrote friend and fellow former diplomat Charles Crawford.        
	In addressing the issue of torture, Sawers said Britain sought to avoid actions that could lead to torture, even though that might help terrorists maintain their ability to carry out attacks. The issue of torture is hotly debated in Britain and has been the focus of much public questioning about whether the British secret services used information from spy agencies in other countries that was obtained under duress.        
	Sawers called torture illegal and abhorrent under any circumstances.        
	If we know or believe action by us will lead to torture taking place, were required by UK and international law to avoid that action, he said. And we do, even though that allows the terrorist activity to go ahead.        
	Some may question this, but we are clear that its the right thing to do. It makes us strive all the harder to find different ways, consistent with human rights, to get the outcome that we want.        
	Sawers said one-third of his agencys resources were devoted to combating international terrorism and called MI6s work the secret frontline of our national security.        
	Few know about the terrorist attacks that we help stop, he said.        
	He singled out agents recruited by MI6 to spy on Britains behalf, calling them true heroes.        
	While he has not spoken publicly until Thursday about the work of MI6, he made two public appearances to give evidence at an official inquiry into the Iraq war, both about earlier assignments as a foreign policy adviser to former Prime Minister Tony Blair and as the British representative in Baghdad.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, July 30: AASU today joined hands with 24 other student organisations to launch a united movement to pressure Dispur into resuming the process of updating the National Register of Citizens, 1951, and stop construction of all mega dams for power generation.         
	The influential students union made the formal announcement of the agitation during a news conference here this evening after a daylong meeting with leaders of 24 other students organisations. The Sadou Asam Tribal Sangha, All Bodo Students Union, All Rabha Students Union, All Mising Students Union, All Assam Moran Students Union, Karbi Students Union and NC Hills Indigenous Forum, among others, will launch the movement.         
	AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya told the media that all the organisations expressed solidarity on the NRC update and movement against construction of mega dams.         
	He said the government must realise that the NRC updating process cannot be put on hold and if it is not started at the earliest, the state would embrace a major agitation.         
	Bhattacharyya said a delegation comprising representatives of AASU and 24 students organisations would meet the Prime Minister, Union home minister and Assam governor before August 15 to demand their intervention.         
	He said the meeting also appealed to the All Assam Minority Students Union not to vitiate the atmosphere of the state by communalising and politicising the NRC issue. The meet resolved to launch a statewide agitation if Dispur did not stop construction of the Lower Subansiri project.         
	Bhattacharyya said the organisations would again meet and discuss the issues on August 20 and 21. The government must concede to our demands before the August 20 meeting, he said.

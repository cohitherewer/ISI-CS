          G.C. SHEKHAR                                              
	Chennai, Nov. 11: J. Jayalalithaas offer of support to the UPA today sent shock waves through the DMK, although central Congress leaders have played down her statement and emphasised that there is no vacancy in Tamil Nadu.        
	The DMK has already been unnerved by the strident posturing from some Tamil Nadu Congress leaders, who have been criticising the M. Karunanidhi government and speaking openly about power-sharing after next years Assembly elections.        
	Chief minister Karunanidhi has of late been recalling the DMKs soft corner for the Nehru-Gandhi family to keep the Congress happy.        
	Jayalalithaa, meanwhile, has drawn large crowds at the four rallies she has held in the past few months. She today offered to make up the UPAs numbers in case the Centre acted against telecom minister A. Raja over the spectrum scandal and the DMK pulled out in protest.        
	I would say where the Congress is concerned, where theres a will, theres a way and if the Congress is able to summon the political will to act against Raja, I can show to the Congress that the political coalition doesnt have to collapse, the AIADMK leader told news channel Times Now.        
	Reacting to her remarks, Congress media department chief Janardhan Dwivedi made it clear that the DMK is our important ally, but nevertheless added the rider at the moment.        
	While Karunanidhi has chosen not to comment, sources close to him said his party would be ready to sacrifice Raja, but only if that became necessary to save the alliance with the Congress.        
	We cannot afford the Congress switching sides before next years Assembly elections since it has proved a decisive factor in winning elections in the state, a senior DMK minister admitted.        
	Jayalalithaas open offer, however, has increased the Congresss bargaining power with the DMK. We can now tell the DMK that if we do not get 70 Assembly seats in the next election, we can always go to Jayalalithaa, who would be ready to offer more, a Congress MP said.        
	What may stop the Congress from striking a deal with Jayalalithaa, though, is her past record as an unreliable ally and her unprovoked attack on Sonia Gandhis foreign origin in 1999. The AIADMK and the Congress fell out that year after the Lok Sabha elections, which the Nationalist Democratic Alliance won in the DMKs company.        
	The Congress revived its ties with the DMK in 2004  after a gap of 24 years  and has since then faced two Lok Sabha elections and one Assembly election together with Karunanidhis party.        
	Another reason the Congress may not fall for Jayalalithaas offer is that the DMK has not troubled the Congress so far, barring its demand for a high number of ministerial berths in May 2009. It has remained silent on the Congresss recent embarrassments over the Commonwealth Games and the Adarsh housing scam.        
	The Congress-DMK ties became strained only after more evidence on the spectrum scam surfaced in the public domain, and the Centre found itself under increasing pressure to sack Raja.        
	After Jayalalithaa offered unconditional support to the UPA, Janata Dal (Secular) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy pledged the support of his three MPs. Jayalalithaa is said to have drafted in the five MPs of Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) as well.        
	The Congress may not readily jump at Jayalalithaas offer of support but would definitely use it to force the DMK to ease out Raja. It will be difficult for the DMK to play the numbers game after this, observed Thuglak editor Cho Ramaswamy.

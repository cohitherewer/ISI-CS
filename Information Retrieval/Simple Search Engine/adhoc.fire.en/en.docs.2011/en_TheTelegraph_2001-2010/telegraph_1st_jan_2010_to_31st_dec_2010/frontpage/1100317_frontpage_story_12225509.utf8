	Jamshedpur/Ranchi/ Hazaribagh, March 16: The police today announced that a Maoist arrested yesterday in Chaibasa was Marshal Topno, a close aide of Kishenji, in what is a major breakthrough in the ongoing operations which DGP Neyaz Ahmed said was on the verge of being expanded to other areas of Jharkhand.        
	Considered to be the second prized catch after the arrest of Venkateswar Reddy, alias Dipak on March 2 by the Bengal police, Topno was arrested during yesterdays operations in the Posaita area of West Singhbhum district.         
	According to SP Akhilesh Kumar Jha, Topno was involved in a number of subversive activities, but refused to give details.         
	He used to operate in the jungles of West Singhbhum. The intelligence department had also given a tip-off about his movement in the Goelkera forests, said another senior district police official.         
	Today, the police also arrested five other Naxalites and recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition from them in Garhwa and Lohardaga districts, not included in the zones of the operation that has so far led to the arrest of 13 Maoists.        
	Garhwa SP, Richard Lakra, confirmed todays the arrests  two in Garhwa and three in Lohardaga. First we arrested two persons with a carbine and a double barrel gun from Bulka forest, about 35km from the district headquarters in Dhurki around 10.00am.        
	Then around noon, based on information provided by them, the police recovered some arms and ammunition from Bhagodih forest, about 4km away.        
	Lakra said those arrested were members of Tritiya Prastuti Committee, a breakaway faction of CPI(Maoist) active in Palamau and Garhwa.         
	Lohardaga superintendent of police Upendra Prasad said raids were still on. Of the three arrested, one was from the town while the other two were nabbed at Kishko, about 10km from the district headquarters.        
	At the Police Training College in Hazaribagh, DGP Ahmed talked at length on the Maoist problem and the challenges facing the security forces, but noted that the Operation Greenhunt, launched in some pockets of the state, would soon be expanded to other areas.

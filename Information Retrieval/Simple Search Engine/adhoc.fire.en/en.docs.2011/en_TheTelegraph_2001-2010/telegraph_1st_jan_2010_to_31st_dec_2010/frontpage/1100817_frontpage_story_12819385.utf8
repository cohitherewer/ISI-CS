          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 16: Bank customers are being spoilt for choice: they will now be able to opt for a floating rate deposit with a tenure as short as one year.        
	SBI, the countrys largest commercial bank, today re-packaged a nine-year-old concept that could ignite a bushfire of similar schemes from rival banks.         
	Starting September 6, SBI will offer customers the choice of a 7 per cent floating rate interest on a one-year deposit. It will offer rates of 7.25 per cent on a three-year deposit and 7.5 per cent on a five-year deposit.        
	The floating rate is linked to its base rate  the threshold interest below which the bank cannot make any commercial, retail or personal loans.        
	The base rate, which came into effect from June 30, can be revised every three months after a review. Each bank has the freedom to fix its own base rate. SBIs base rate is currently fixed at 7.5 per cent.        
	Whenever the base rate moves up or down, the floating interest rates will move in tandem.         
	SBIs floating rate deposits will return better yields than the fixed rate terms deposit, whose rates were also tweaked today. The new fixed deposit rates come into effect from Tuesday.        
	The floating rate on a one-year deposit is 7 per cent  about 25 basis points higher than the 6.75 per cent that the bank is now offering on a term deposit between one and two years. Earlier, the bank was offering 6 per cent on the same deposit term.        
	Customers will need to look closely at the rate tables to decide whether to opt for a fixed or a floating rate deposit.         
	SBI is now offering a 7.25 per cent on a fixed deposit term of 2 years to less than 3 years, which is the same as the floating rate on a three-year deposit.        
	However, the fixed deposit rate on deposit tenure between three and five years will yield 50 basis points less at 6.75 per cent.        
	Similarly, customers might prefer to go for a floating rate of 7.5 per cent on a five-year deposit rather than a fixed rate of 7 per cent on a deposit with a tenure between five and eight years.         
	Customers are likely to pick the floating rate option when the economy is booming and there is a strong upward bias in interest rates as now.         
	In such a scenario, bank depositors will lose out if they are locked into a fixed deposit rate. The only way out of such a sticky situation is to press the button for a premature withdrawal and reinvest in a higher floating rate interest deposit. The flip side is that a premature withdrawal will entail a penalty.         
	When interest rates are heading downward, customers would lose out on a floating rate deposit as the interest will automatically be marked lower whenever the base rate dips.        
	Banks have tended to offer only fixed rates on deposits even though the Reserve Bank of India had permitted them to offer floating rates as far back as 2001.         
	SBI had taken a first stab at floating deposit rates back in 2001 with little success. At that time, it had launched a long-term deposit of eight to 10 years at a rate pegged to the interest it offered on a three-year deposit (which changed more frequently). The floating rate was pegged 0.25 per cent above the three-year fixed deposit rate. In the case of the 10-year deposit, the rate was pegged at 0.50 per cent above the benchmark.        
	Indian Overseas Bank also launched a similar deposit scheme last year where the floating rate was pegged to the yield on the government securities with a similar maturity.        
	In February this year, Housing Finance Development Corporation introduced a Systematic Savings Plan  a recurring deposit  based on a floating interest rate.         
	However, SBIs new floating rate plan is expected to draw far greater response than the earlier schemes.         
	Banks now have a greater compulsion to offer floating rate deposits.        
	Earlier, they used to pay a fixed interest rate on short-term deposits. They lent the money out for longer terms at floating rates. This arrangement worked fine as long as people continued to pour their money into fixed deposits.         
	The problems started creeping when the rate of growth in bank deposits started to slow down last year. Since they were taking short-term deposits and making long-term loans, banks created what they call an asset-liability mismatch. The banks found they were repaying the deposits faster than they were recovering their loans.        
	During 2008-09, bank deposits surged by 22.35 per cent over the previous year. But the pace of growth has since slowed to just over 17 per cent in 2009-10, forcing banks to look a little more closely at the floating rate option.         
	In a rising interest rate regime, banks are hoping that people with surplus cash will prefer to park their money in floating rate deposits. When the rates start falling, bankers do not expect depositors to start yanking their money out of deposits quickly enough.        
	Other banks are already mulling their options on floating rate deposits.         
	We are also exploring the possibility of introducing floating rate deposit schemes, said a senior official of Allahabad Bank.         
	We are also trying to make our depositors understand that they should accept floating interest rates on deposits. We are examining deposit rates between one to 1.5 percentage points lower than our base rate, he added.        
	SBIs move could well be considered as the trend-setter in the domestic banking industry, said Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive officer, Value Research, an independent investment tracking firm.         
	Floating rate loans are a rage these days. But deposits fetch fixed rates. This disparity will not continue for long. However, floating rate deposits are a compulsion for banks, not depositors, Kumar added.

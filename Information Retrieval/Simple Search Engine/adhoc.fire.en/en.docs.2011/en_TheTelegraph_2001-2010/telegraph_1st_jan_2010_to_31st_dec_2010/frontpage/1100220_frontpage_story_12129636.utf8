  - Foreign policy fiasco triggers shuffle        OUR BUREAU                              Saran, Menon: Changing face				                                       
	Feb. 19: Shyam Saran, the Prime Ministers special envoy on climate change and the Indo-US nuclear deal, resigned abruptly today as part of a shake-up in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO).        
	Manmohan Singh is upset about the mismanagement of foreign policy within his office following the Afghan fiasco, in which Delhi was caught unawares by the fact that, with US blessings, dialogue has already been going on with the Taliban, sources said.        
	Neither the Americans, nor Hamid Karzai, the Afghan President, told India about the talks.        
	Two of those responsible for the mismanagement are now out: the other is M.K. Narayanan, the former national security adviser who has been made governor of Bengal.         
	The sources said the next to go will be S.K. Lambah, who has been special envoy dealing with Afghanistan and acting as the back channel for negotiations with Pakistan.        
	Although Saran was technically in charge of climate change, he was also involved in Nepal and nuclear issues  not the deal with the US, but the upcoming Washington summit on nuclear safety and the Non-proliferation Treaty review conference in New York, which have foreign policy dimensions.        
	Saran would also have found his continuance in the PMO untenable after the arrival of Shiv Shankar Menon as the national security adviser, other sources said.        
	Menon enjoys minister of state rank, whereas Saran  who was two years senior in the foreign service  remained a secretary-grade technocrat. Both retired as foreign secretary.        
	Saran was slated for another extension at the expiry of his current term on March 15 in view of the unfinished briefs he handled. However, he expressed his inability to continue in the job earlier this week and has been permitted to demit office in mid-March by Manmohan Singh, these sources added.        
	It is not known whether Saran made an issue of this perceived discrepancy, but the sources said he was unhappy with the new order in which he was required to serve.         
	There was no direct conflict between Saran and Menon, both respect each other, but the new scheme did mean Saran would function under an officer who had been his junior all life, an official said. He was quick to add that Saran was departing gracefully and with minimal bad blood.        
	The exit of Narayanan and Saran is vindication of what Menon said in a plain-speaking meeting shortly before retirement as foreign secretary about how he had been hamstrung in the pursuit of the governments foreign policy objectives by forces pulling in a different direction.         
	In the new arrangement in the PMO, Menon is expected to take charge of back-channel talks with Pakistan from Lambah while Nirupama Rao, the foreign secretary, will be the official negotiator.

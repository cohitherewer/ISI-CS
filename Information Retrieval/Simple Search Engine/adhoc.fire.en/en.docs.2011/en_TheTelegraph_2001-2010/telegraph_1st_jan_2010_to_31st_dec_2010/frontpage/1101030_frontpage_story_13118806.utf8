	Mumbai, Oct. 29 (PTI): A Calcutta model who dabbled in films and TV serials allegedly killed herself in her Mumbai apartment yesterday while her boyfriend painted walls in another room, four months after ramp figure Viveka Babajees suicide.        
	No suicide note has been found in Rinky Choudhurys home. But an officer said the 28-year-olds boyfriend, Sahil Malik, was being questioned amid claims that an ex-girlfriend of his had been calling Rinky objecting to the couples marriage plans.        
	Rinkys mother Kanisha said her daughter was suffering from a heart ailment and was depressed because of that. Preliminary medical examination has revealed ligature marks around her neck as a result of the hanging. Investigations are on, said Surendra Paithankar, senior inspector of Goregaon police station, near Rinkys Oshiwara flat.         
	The officer said Sahil had been in a relationship with Rinky for the past one year but suggested his ex-partner was under the scanner. Sahils ex-girl friend, one Shyamli Jain, who was also a model here but currently resides in Delhi, had objections to the marriage. She had been calling Rinky in the past few weeks, Paithankar said, adding Shyamli would be called for questioning.        
	Sahil was busy painting when Rinky locked herself in the kitchen. After a while, when a courier agent arrived to deliver her a letter, Sahil knocked on the door repeatedly and when she didnt respond, called on her mobile.        
	Sahil broke open the door and found her hanging. He splashed water on her face. When she didnt respond, he informed the police, Paithankar said. Rinky was declared brought dead at a nearby hospital.

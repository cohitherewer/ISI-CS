	Imphal, March 11: Tangkhul Nagas today extended their support to the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) to hold a political dialogue with New Delhi for a negotiated settlement to the Naga problem.         
	The meeting declared that the customs, traditions, identity, land and history of the Nagas should be defended and preserved at any cost.         
	It also stated that the aspiration of the Naga people for integration of all Naga-inhabited areas under one administrative roof should be upheld for an honourable solution and lasting peace.         
	The meeting was held under the aegis of the United Naga Council at the Town Hall in Ukhrul today. Its theme was Peace and Peoples Rights.        
	Village chiefs/hea-dmen/chairmen and leaders of the Tangkhul Naga Long, Tangkhul Katamnao Saklong, Tangkhul Naga Wungnao Long, Tangkhul Shanao Long, Tangkkhul Mayar Ngala Long, Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights, Naga Womens Union Manipur and the United Naga Council attended the meeting.         
	The meeting also discussed the customary practices and traditional system of land and resource management with relation to various acts and the rights of the indigenous peoples with special reference to the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Councils (3rd Amendment) Act, 2008.         
	It decided to reject the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Council Act, 1971, and the amended act of 2008, saying it did not protect and safeguard the rights of the people.               
	The meeting urged the Hill Areas Committee, comprising tribal legislators from the hills, to defer the enforcement of the act. The meeting also urged the legislators to review the act.

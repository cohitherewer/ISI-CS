          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 10: A revenue court in Vidarbha has issued orders restoring a disputed piece of land to a poor farmer who alleged that six relatives of President Pratibha Patil, including her husband Devisinh Shekhawat, had tried to illegally transfer the plot in their names.        
	Ashok Amankar, the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Daryapur, who has quasi-judicial powers, issued orders stating that the names of Devisinh, his sister-in-law Siddeshwar Lalsinh Shekhawat, her sons Bhanwarsinh, Kishoresinh and Omsinh, and his nephew Raghusinh Ramsinh Shekhawat be deleted from the records of the land belonging to farmer Kishore Bansod.         
	The verdict came in December 2009, but Bansods lawyer Sunil Gajbhiye received a certified copy of the order today.         
	Bansod, who owns the 2.55-acre plot next to a 200-acre farm of the Shekhawat family in their ancestral village Chandrapur Khallar, had filed a complaint with the SDO in June last year.         
	The farmer alleged that Devisinh had used his powerful political influence to insert the six names with the help of the local revenue inspector and the talathi, a village subordinate who maintains land records.        
	In his order dated December 7, 2009, Amankar allowed Bansods appeal and annulled the changes made in the records by the block officer pertaining to the plot  Survey No. 31/1F, Group No. 19. He ordered the land to be re-measured and restored to the rightful owner.        
	Justice has finally prevailed. Bansod was a minor in 1985 when his father had purchased this piece of land, and it is still in his possession. Without his knowledge, the Shekhawats tried to illegally transfer the land in their name. Thanks to the honest and brave work done by the sub-divisional officer, a poor farmer has got justice, said lawyer Gajbhiye, speaking from Amravati.        
	Rajinder Shekhawat, the Presidents son, told PTI in Delhi: The order was that a fresh measurement of the land will take place... there is no such issue of land-grab.

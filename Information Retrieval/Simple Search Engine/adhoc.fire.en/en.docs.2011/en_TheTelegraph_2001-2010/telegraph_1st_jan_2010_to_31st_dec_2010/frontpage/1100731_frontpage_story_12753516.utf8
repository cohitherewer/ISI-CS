  - Same temperature in two zones casts a cloud          G.S. MUDUR                                                  
	New Delhi, July 30: An unusual temperature profile observed in the Bay of Bengal this year may severely alter Indias monsoon rainfall patterns if it persists year after year, weather scientists have said.        
	Over the past two months, average temperatures across the Bay of Bengal are near uniform  a deviation from the typical monsoon feature in which the northern bay is slightly warmer than the southern bay by about 2C to 3C.        
	More than 75 per cent of Indias land area has received normal or excess rainfall this monsoon season, but in the absence of such a temperature difference no depression has formed over the bay since the start of the 2010 season.        
	Depressions deliver intense rainfall as they move north-westward across the Gangetic plains. With no depression this year, parts of eastern India  Bihar, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bengal  have received rainfall significantly below normal.        
	While weather scientists expect depressions to form during the two remaining months of the season, they said the absence of the temperature difference and depressions is an anomalous feature that needs to be probed.        
	Although three low-pressure systems have formed in the bay since the start of the 2010 season, they formed slightly southward and did not intensify as depressions, said Ajit Tyagi, the director-general of the India Meteorological Department. If this [becomes] a normal feature for the Bay of Bengal, it would be a cause for worry, he said. It may affect the entire countrys rainfall.        
	The absence of depressions has hit eastern India. Rainfall until July 28 was 46 per cent below normal in Jharkhand, 31 per cent below normal in Gangetic Bengal and 20 per cent below normal in Bihar.        
	Rainfall over northern and north-western India is primarily the result of storms from central Asia  so-called western disturbances  the effect of the Arabian Sea slice of monsoon currents and low-pressure systems from the bay.        
	The IMD has predicted August and September will be wetter than the last two months  with rainfall expected to be 7 per cent above normal. The deficit in the east may ease to 10 per cent below normal by the end of the season, Tyagi said. In an updated forecast issued today, the IMD said rainfall is expected to be normal during 2010 and north-western, central and southern peninsular regions will receive normal rainfall.                    
	Scientists point out that a low-pressure system from the bay had actually helped dramatically reduce Indias rainfall deficit from 16 per cent below normal last week to only 5 per cent below normal this week.        
	Depressions bring very intense rainfall over only small regions, but low pressure systems can mean rainfall over relatively large areas, said Damodar Pai, the director of long-range forecasting at the IMD, Pune.        
	Meteorologists said long-term weather data suggests that about seven depressions form during the four-month monsoon season. But some researchers have in the past suggested that the number may be reducing in recent decades.        
	Pai and another scientist recalled that no depression had formed in the bay during 1998, a year during which India had received normal rainfall. This is not something unprecedented, Pai told The Telegraph.        
	Its true clouds are avoiding the northern bay this year, said Sulochana Gadgil, a senior atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. But the bay is warm, and clouds are forming over the central and southern bay.        
	Gadgil had last year shown that the bay was relatively cooler than the equatorial Indian Ocean, which prevented cloud formation in the northern bay and may have contributed to the drought. But this year the situation is quite different from what it was last year, Gadgil said. The bay is warm, the temperature differences between the north and south bay need to be studied.

  - NCP strategy to dent   allys revival hopes        SANJAY K. JHA                            Sharad Pawar                                              
	New Delhi, July 17: If your friend isnt game, play spoilsport.        
	Sharad Pawars NCP is gearing up to damage the Congresss prospects in the coming Bihar elections and has worked out a plan to target Muslim voters, a segment his central ally banks on for its revival in the state.        
	Sources in the NCP said Pawar had wanted to tie up with the Congress for the polls later this year, but the UPA partner had so far shown no interest.         
	Pawar, who has been trying to create a base outside Maharashtra, is particularly keen on Bihar where he has a known face in Tariq Anwar, who hasnt so far been able to build the party in the state.        
	Pawar has now asked Anwar to pull out all stops to register the partys presence in Bihar. Sources said of the 243 Assembly seats, the NCP had identified around 40, mostly in the Muslim-dominated border districts of Katihar, Kishenganj, Purnea and Araria and a few in central Bihar.        
	The sources said even if the Congress agreed to strike an alliance with the NCP, Pawar might not like to give up his claim on these seats.        
	The NCP has decided not to have any understanding with Lalu Prasads RJD, Ram Vilas Paswans LJP or the ruling BJP-Janata Dal (United) combine.        
	Despite being an ally of the UPA at the Centre, the NCP has not desisted from joining hands with anti-Congress parties in states. While it sided with Naveen Patnaiks BJD in Orissa, it has always fought against the Congress in the Northeast. But the NCP sources said that in Bihar, Pawar had shown readiness to align only with the Congress.         
	NCP leaders insisted the Congress central leaderships revival hopes in Bihar were unrealistic for two reasons. One, Sonia Gandhi had delayed revamping the state organisation, and two, Muslim voters were still divided in the state.         
	Although the Congress has now installed a Muslim, Mehboob Ali Kaiser, as state unit president, the NCP believes Lalu Prasad still commands the support of the majority of Muslim voters.        
	Moreover, chief minister Nitish Kumar has managed to create a support base within the community despite his association with the BJP.        
	Pawar knows any further fragmentation of Muslim votes will hurt the Congress and has, therefore, decided to project Anwar in a big way. He is aware that it will be difficult to win too many seats  his partys target is to win at least 10 seats  but knows he can damage the Congresss prospects by fielding strong candidates in the 40 constituencies he has identified.         
	The Congress, also not in a position to make a dramatic impact, will seriously vie for 20-30 seats and any dent in this small scheme is bound to hurt it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lawyer quotes Gandhi, defends Hafiz
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Lawyer quotes Gandhi, defends Hafiz
                                People gather in Lahore on Friday outside the shrine of Sufi saint Hazrat Syed Ali bin Usman Hajweri , where two suicide bombers killed 37. (AFP)                            
	Should New Delhi be able to get this man on its side, it will get much closer to its pet Pakistani pursuit. But for all the love and longing he professes for India, he just wouldnt agree that Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, founder of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, is a malefactor who has, almost single-handed, nettled neighbourly ties.         
	He is his counsel, after all, the man who has made it his job to keep proving Saeed has done no wrong. Criticise India, yes, concedes A.K. Dogar, esteemed elder of Lahore High Court and president of the Pakistan Lawyers Forum. But many people in Pakistan criticise India and many in India criticise Pakistan, criticism is no crime.         
	He sits stooped in a nondescript far corner of what would have once been a stately bar hall, away from the hectic hum of litigation, waiting over a cup of canteen tea, furrowed head resting on closed palms, mulling what he might be asked next, marshalling what he will offer in answer. Aap chai lenge ya coffee? he asks, still in his lonesome head-bent reverie. He needs his responses straightened, hes played for a little more time.         
	At 74, Dogar is slow of body, but still sharp of brain. It is not for nothing that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif turns to him when he gets into a tangle, which is often. It is not for nothing that former President General Pervez Musharrafs adversaries converged on him when they thought they should put legal curbs on his powers. It is not for nothing that he is the man they have chosen to lead the campaign to corner current President Asif Ali Zardari for violating the one-man-one-post principle; he cant be President of Pakistan and president of the Peoples Party at the same time, Zardaris critics believe. Dogar is the man pushing their plea. Hafiz Saeed, of course, remains his most famous, or notorious, client and if he is taking a little time, it is perhaps only to put a little polish on his practised defence.         
	Has Saeed become what he is merely criticising India, though? Wasnt Mumbai a crime, or the violence it has peppered on India all these years? Or the menace it remains committed to? Terrible, Dogar says, with an educated shake of his head, Just terrible. Mumbai was terrible, all violence is terrible. I am agreed with you. Pakistan and India can do without this fuss and people on both sides stand to benefit. But where has my client had a part in it? I dont know him too well because I work through his agents, but from what little I know, Saeed is an old and gentle man, he runs a charity called Jamaat-ud-Dawa, as everybody knows, and it has done some very good humanitarian work. Meet him if you get a chance.         
	There wont be one, as Dogar is well aware, for Muridke, home and headquarters to Saeed and his mission, is out of bounds to visitors from across the fence, even though it is a stones throw from Lahores city limits. And Saeed isnt scheduled in town anytime soon. No cases pending, courtesy Dogar, other than two minor FIRs to which hearings havent yet been fixed. He is clean in the laws eyes, I do not know why there is this big shor-sharaba being made. You cant hang a man without being able to prove he is guilty, I am sure that is what your statutes say as well.         
	He has eased into the flow of his argument and nothing is going to get him into a flap over Saeed. Not the litany that still issues from the New Delhi, dossier upon dossier, not the voluminous record of Saeeds virulent anti-India speech-making, not all his recorded exhorts to violent jehad as fount of the Lashkar-e-Toiba.         
	Look, I am legal man, he counters, calm, almost avuncular of manner, there is nothing on my papers that even mentions Lashkar-e-Toiba. It is a banned organisation, so it cannot have a membership. That is what the law has accepted, Saeed heads a charitable organisation and he is above board. That is the legal position, the rest is politics, and I am not a politician.         
	Has he never heard, then, any of Saeeds calls for war? What Ive heard, and read, are the case documents, and there is no war in it, only allegations that could not be proved. Would I want war on India? I was born there, I came to senses there, I wish I could go there someday again. And then a sudden burst of childhood memory  train journeys from Jalandhar to Rampur, where his father was a sugar mill employee, the stops en route (he remembers all of them including Panipat and Saharanpur and Moradabad), the smell of puri and paan.         
	I wouldnt want the land of my birth bombed, he retorts, at once a little offended of tone, I am probably the only one in this court who still quotes Gandhi, often to the annoyance of some judges and lawyer colleagues. I am a man of peace, and despite what people might allege, my client has not been proved to be a man of war. Some more tea?         
	This time, its his way of calling the appointment over. There are clients closed around his corner and waiting, and he has said all he really had to. Besides just one last thing as he slowly rises to bid goodbye. Theres still a wish somewhere in me to go back where I was born and went to school, but will they give me a visa? Rhetorical question, he knew that even as he asked; but he probably had to, if only for old times sake. This man isnt coming to New Delhi, not unless he is on its side.        
	(Sankarshan Thakur was in Lahore last week)

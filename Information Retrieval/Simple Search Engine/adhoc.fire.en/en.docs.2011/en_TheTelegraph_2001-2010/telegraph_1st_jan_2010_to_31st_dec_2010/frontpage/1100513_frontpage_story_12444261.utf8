          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata at the rally. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta, May 12: Mamata Banerjee today called the Congress a party of betrayers and asked the people not to vote for it anywhere across the city during the May 30 polls.         
	Defeating the CPM in the Calcutta civic polls does not appear to be a major problem for her this time. But she seems to have set her goal on reducing the Congress, which she had accused of breaking the alliance, to an insignificant factor in the civic polls.        
	Coming a day after Pranab Mukherjee launched the Congress campaign where he had hit out at Mamata, although without naming her, the Trinamul chiefs inaugural campaign speech at the Shyambazar five-point crossing in north Calcutta underscored her strategy vis--vis the Congress.         
	Mamata, however, took care not to name either the Bengal Congress chief or his party during her Congress-bashing in her speech that lasted nearly two hours.        
	If somebody comes and tries to split the anti-Left vote by betraying us, then I would appeal to you to cast your votes in Trinamuls favour. Every vote for Trinamul is a blessing for us, Mamata said. Dont vote for those who spring into action during election time to split the anti-Left vote to strengthen the hands of the CPM.        
	But Mamata also made it clear that she was not entirely burning her bridges with the Congress, keeping in mind her compulsions of staying on in the UPA government and the advantages she can draw from being the railway minister as well as leaving the door ajar for an alliance with the Congress for next years Assembly elections.        
	I want to make it clear to you once again that the UPA is a coalition of myriad parties of which the Congress is a major one. One should not think that the Congress has made us ministers. We have our own strength in the UPA. So, I shall stay there as long as I can stay there with honour. I shall not quit until I am forcibly pushed out of it, Mamata the gathering.        
	A Trinamul general secretary said Mamata had indicated to them that a dialogue could be started with the Congress after the civic polls. We have no problem in collaborating with the Congress after the civic polls, he said.        
	Mamata time and again called the CPM her principal political adversary.        
	She said if her party was voted to power in Calcutta, the electorate would not have to wait till next year for the Assembly polls.  I am assuring you that the Assembly elections would be held within three months, the Trinamul leader said.        
	Mamata will launch her civic-poll campaign in south Calcutta at the Hazra crossing on Friday.

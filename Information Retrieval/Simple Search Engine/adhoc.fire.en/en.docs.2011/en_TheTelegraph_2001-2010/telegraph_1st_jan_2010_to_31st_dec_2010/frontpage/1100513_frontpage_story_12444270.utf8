	New Delhi, May 12: The BJP might reconsider its position on a rotational arrangement after Hemant Soren told Rajnath Singh and Ananth Kumar that the JMM would not accept a chief minister from the BJP for the coalition governments remaining tenure in Jharkhand unless the post was shared with it.        
	A highly placed source involved in the negotiations with the JMM and its constituents told The Telegraph that BJP president Nitin Gadkari had started sounding out L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Murli Manohar Joshi and other parliamentary board members on reversing the earlier decision against a time-sharing pattern for the chief ministers post.        
	He is speaking to them individually, the source said.        
	Apparently, the JMM conveyed to the BJP that its support would not be unconditional and would depend on whether the party accepted the rotational formula.        
	We cannot reject it outright. May be there is merit in their demand, the source maintained.        
	Asked if Gadkari could carry the rest of the party on the JMMs proposal, the source said, I cannot rule out any possibility. Politics is about the art of the possible. Things take time to fall in place. We have the patience to put up with it. After all, didnt the Conservatives and the Lib-Dems come together in Britain?        
	If the parliamentary board does endorse the rotation proposal, it is not clear who will have the first shot at the chief ministers post.         
	Chief minister Shibu Soren will have to demit office by the end of June unless he decides to contest an Assembly by-poll which is possible only if a sitting JMM MLA vacates his seat. So far there is no sign of that happening.        
	Hence, the BJP may get the first turn, but it is in a tangle on who its chief ministerial candidate would be.        
	Although Rajnath and other central leaders were in favour of Arjun Munda, Gadkari was against sending a Lok Sabha MP to Ranchi because of the problems involved in having him elected to the Assembly.                          
	He prefers an MLA to be chief minister, aware of the problems Soren has in finding an Assembly seat. Also, frankly nobody in our party is sure how long the government will last. If we send an MP, he might end up losing his Assembly and Lok Sabha seats if the government falls, a party leader explained.        
	Earlier in the day, Rajnath and Kumar briefed Gadkari and Advani on their deliberations with MLAs in Ranchi yesterday.        
	The BJP parliamentary board was unlikely to sit until the JMMs support letter came and Soren resigned.         
	We do not want to looking foolish again. Suppose we announce our chief ministerial candidate and the JMM ditches? We will lose face irreparably, a source said.

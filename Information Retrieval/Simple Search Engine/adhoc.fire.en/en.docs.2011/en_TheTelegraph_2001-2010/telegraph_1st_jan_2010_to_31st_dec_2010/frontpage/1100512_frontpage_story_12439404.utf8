          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            KG Balakrishnan                                  
	New Delhi, May 11: Outgoing Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan today said judges were not government servants and could not be censured or suspended.        
	He shrugged off suggestions that halfway measures  short of the long political process of impeachment that removes judges from office were needed to discipline them.        
	If the judges integrity is doubtful, you cannot censure or suspend him or tick him off. He is not a government servant. That should be the end of his career, the CJI said at his last official news conference on his last day in office.        
	However, he agreed that the impeachment process was long.        
	Justice Balakrishnan blamed much of the controversies that took place during his three-and-a-half years as the countrys top judge on the heightened public gaze on the Supreme Court.        
	If we dont do anything, we wont commit mistakes. If we do, you make some mistakes. It is not as if these things did not happen earlier. But the public gaze was not there. So anything that happens (nowadays) comes to light. Such things must have happened earlier too, but we never knew of it, he said.        
	He denied that the apex court had a problem with becoming more transparent under the RTI regime.        
	I never wanted the CJI out of the purview of the RTI. The Supreme Court has submitted the highest number of answers under the RTI. We do not have any problems sharing any information; we are giving all information, he said.        
	He, however, qualified this by saying the institutions opposition related only to a very small area. Some information lying with the CJI is of such a nature that it cannot be revealed, he said.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Idol capital shifts base

	The gods have a new address in town.         
	The much-delayed renovation of Kumartuli is finally underway with a number of its residents and workers being relocated to a temporary shelter. The first lot moved out on Poila Baisakh and demolition started on April 23.         
	They are being shifted to three godowns on the nearby Rabindra Sarani. The premises were owned by the public health engineering and the health and family welfare departments.         
	At the temporary address, the gates announce in big letters: Rehabilitation for Kumartuli Urban Renewal Project. Inside, three large sheds have been converted into working and living areas.         
	Low walls divide the work area into booths for each artisan. A thatched structure below the roof will hold smaller idols, much like the studios in Kumartuli. Each family is being housed in separate rooms. Toilets are common.         
	Initially the place was dirty and unkempt and we werent sure if we could live and work here. But the project managers have made the place habitable, said Mintu Pal, the joint secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity.         
	The Rs 22 crore project is being carried out under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, and the cost is being shared by the Centre and the state government. Residents will have to pay a part of the building cost for the dwelling units.         
	On Friday, the house of Nemai Chandra Pal  the president of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity.  was partly razed.         
	We have lived in this house for four generations. When the demolition squad started breaking the wall, we were very sad. But the moment passed and we are now looking towards the future, said Nemai Chandra Pal.         
	He added because of the proposed renovation, house owners in Kumartuli had not been repairing their homes for the past three years.        
	The place was in a bad shape, Pal conceded.        
	Kumartuli is spread across four blocks. In the first phase of the project, we are relocating residents and workers of two blocks, said Anup Kumar Ghosh , the chief engineer of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which is executing the project.        
	In the first phase, 170 families and 98 shops are being relocated. Ghosh said a space crunch at the temporary site meant that all the people could not be shifted at the same time. We are hoping to complete the entire project in three years, he said.         
	The artisans looked happy. We would have preferred to have relocated a little earlier since work for the pujas start in April, but the paperwork took time, said Babu Pal, the joint secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity.        
	He said he was now looking forward to the amenities at the renovated Kumartuli.         
	The project promises broader roads, better working and living spaces, exhibition and selling areas and a park, among other things.        
	Some of the residents said the conditions at the temporary site were better than at Kumartuli.        
	Its difficult to shift a household, but there is more space here. I am happy, said Alpana Ghosh.        
	The project has brought together the two unions at Kumartuli. We are hopeful of a better future. We will be able to work better in the revamped studios. The condition of the roads in Kumartuli had made transportation of idols difficult, said Sujit Pal of the Kumartuli Mritshilpi Samity.        
	But some others are peeved at not being consulted before the relocation started.         
	I want development too. But bustee unnayan (upgrade of living quarters) should be separate from shilpa unnayan (development schemes for the artisans). The project details should have been discussed with everyone. I own the structure where I live and work. How can I leave it, without knowing what I will get after the renovation? said Badal Pal. He felt the timing was not right either.         
	I have already started working for the pujas. My business will suffer if I shift now. After Puja, if I am convinced of the benefits of the project, I will move, he added.         
	Ghosh of the CMDA said if structure owners can prove their ownership, they will get a flat in addition to what the present tenants will get.

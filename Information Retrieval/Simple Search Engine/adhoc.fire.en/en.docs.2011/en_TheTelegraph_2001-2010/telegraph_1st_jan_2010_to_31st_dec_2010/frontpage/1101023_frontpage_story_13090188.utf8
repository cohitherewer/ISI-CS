  - Coal cash buzz dwarfs pollution concerns          OUR BUREAU                                     
	Oct. 22: The chatter in blogosphere has started to reach a crescendo.         
	Investors in Coal Indias mammoth Rs 15,000-crore maiden issue that closed on Thursday have already started counting the gains they hope to make if they cash out their investment on November 4 when the stock lists on the bourses.        
	The bet is that coal  or black gold  will be one of the biggest investment payback avenues this year.        
	Or will it?         
	The grey market  a shadow market where investors make speculative bets on the likely listing price of a new stock  is already gung-ho over the Coal India flotation.        
	The listing price for Coal India is going to be anywhere around Rs 300, says one investor who doesnt wish to be named. The buzz in the grey market is of a premium of Rs 30 to 40 per share.         
	The state-owned Coal India had offered 568.47 million shares to the public in a price band of Rs 225 to 245 a share which was oversubscribed 15.28 times. Come Sunday, the coal behemoth will announce the cut-off price for the issue.        
	If the stock is priced at the top end of the price band, retail investors will benefit from a 5 per cent discount  or Rs 12.25 less than an issue price of Rs 245. Retail investors have been making quick back-of-the- envelope calculations to tot up their expected gains.        
	Since the retail category was oversubscribed 2.31 times, they are betting that a person who invested Rs 1 lakh in the issue  the maximum permitted under the rules for retail investors  will get at least 175 shares out of the 400 he applied for.        
	The Flipper  the investor who intends to cash out on listing  is looking at a profit of Rs 8,000 to 8,500 on a Rs 1 lakh investment, going by the current grey market price.        
	Dukh bhare din beetey, re bhaiya! Ab sukh ao re (We went through one long dismal period. Now, we are ready to embrace the happy days), says one anonymous blogger at http://www.chittorgarh.com/, a specialised website that exclusively tracks initial public offerings (IPOs) and has seen a lot of excited chatter on the subject.        
	Investors have been wowed by the prospect of a 30 per cent gain on a 15-day investment that a flipping strategy in Coal India affords. Just compare this with the piffling return on a 15-day deposit with State Bank of India  a mere 4.5 per cent annualised.         
	It isnt anonymous bloggers alone who are counting their profits.         
	Arun Kejriwal, director of research firm KRIS, says most retail investors seem to have placed short-term bets and hope to take money off the table on listing. Coal India is the worlds largest coal producing company the bets have been placed just on that reckoning alone.        
	The Coal India issue is being seen as an excellent Diwali bonus, adds Kejriwal.         
	Says Kala Bhatt, a 35-year-old investor based in Mumbai who has applied for 300 shares of Coal India: I invested in the IPO for quick listing gains. I felt that the Coal India IPO is a safe way to take advantage of the recent bull run on the markets. I also factored in the fact that there will be a strong demand for coal from a number of new power projects that are coming up.        
	Others have been less savvy  preferring to follow the scrambling herd.        
	I have invested in the Coal India IPO since everyone else is putting their money here. I also read in the papers and saw the pundits on television say that all the broking firms were advising investors to shovel their money into this IPO, said Indrajit Ghosh, a retired businessman from Shyambazar. I will sell the shares on listing.         
	Manish Sonthalia, vice-president and fund manager at Motilal Oswal Asset Management, says that while many are looking to cash out the gains on listing, there are many serious long-term investors in the Coal India stock.        
	Coal India supplies 80 per cent of the coal used by a range of consumers in the country. As long as coal remains the principal source of energy, an investment in the worlds largest coal producer will pay off in the long run as well.         
	But there are a few Cassandras as well who reckon the stock will tank on listing and thats when they intend to buy from the market.        
	Says Rajesh Chakrabarty: It (Coal India) used to be a loss-making company, explaining why he has preferred to stay away. He added that he would consider buying the stock after looking closely at the way it trades.        
	No warming qualms         
	Investors have shown no qualms about betting on a company whose product is widely seen as one of the biggest polluting agents in the country.        
	Coal accounts for more than half of Indias energy consumption and will continue to reign as the leading fuel for energy-hungry India  at least over the next two decades.        
	I was initially surprised (by the response to the flotation) but I guess in the short-term there is no choice, said Jayaraman Srinivasan, professor of atmospheric sciences at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and a scientist closely involved in analysing climate change.        
	The transition to alternative sources will take decades, Srinivasan said. So, investors are probably looking at the possibility of short-term gains over the next few years while coal remains very important to India.        
	Coal is the most polluting fossil fuel, implicated in the rising levels of carbon dioxide and global warming. Coal already accounts for 65 per cent of Indias carbon dioxide emissions. It also produces black carbon, another atmospheric pollutant.        
	Energy plans show that India will remain intimately tied to coal. Indias coal-burning power plants account for more than 60 per cent of the countrys coal demand. Indias use of coal for generating electricity is expected to rise by 2 per cent each year in the coming years, and the total coal-based electricity capacity is expected to rise from 78 gigawatts in 2006 to more than 140 gigawatts.        
	India has announced a plan to expand solar energy production to 20,000MW by 2020, but energy analysts caution that renewable sources will make little dent on coal requirements during the next two decades.        
	Coal will continue to dominate but India will need to mine more of improved quality underground coal that could help the switch to clean coal technologies, said Malti Goel, a energy technology analyst and former adviser to the Department of Science and Technology. India has plans to invest in cleaner technologies, said Goel.        
	At the current levels of consumption, Indias coal reserves are expected to last for about 80 years.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                             A Sikh riot victim celebrates outside the Delhi court on Wednesday. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: A court today issued a non-bailable warrant against Sajjan Kumar in a 1984 Sikh riot case after the former Congress MP failed to comply with its earlier order to appear in person for the hearing.        
	Kumar had yesterday moved Delhi High Court seeking anticipatory bail, and the hearing is to take place tomorrow.         
	But the lower courts move today means Kumar can be arrested by the CBI anytime now. Sources say officials of the CBI, which is probing the case, will look for Kumar at his two houses in Delhi, one at Ashoka Road in the heart of the city and another on the outskirts of the capital. If he is arrested, he can apply for regular bail in the high court tomorrow. If he cannot be traced, he can hope to get relief on his anticipatory bail plea.        
	I request the high court not to give him bail and hope that the CBI will arrest him soon. Now there are no problems regarding his arrest, said H.S. Phoolka, the lawyer representing the riot victims in the case.        
	Earlier, the local court came down heavily on Kumar for not being present at the hearing. The accused (Kumar) was called to appear before the court but he chooses to challenge before (the) superior court and rightly so. He is duty-bound to honour the courts order, said chief metropolitan magistrate Lokesh Kumar Sharma, issuing similar non-bailable warrants against six others. The families of the riot victims blocked roads near the court and raised slogans against Kumar and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

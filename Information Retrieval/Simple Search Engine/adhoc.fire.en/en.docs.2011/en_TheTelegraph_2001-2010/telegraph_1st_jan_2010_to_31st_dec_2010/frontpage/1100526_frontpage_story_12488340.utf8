          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, May 25: Governor M..H. Farook sought to assert himself today amid the ongoing political uncertainty by stalling the transfers of as many 33 education officers cleared by the human resource development department headed by the JMMs Hemlal Murmu.         
	According to Raj Bhavan sources, the governor asked chief secretary A.K. Singh to stall yesterdays transfers of district educations officers and district superintendents of education keeping in mind that the Shibu Soren government had been reduced to a minority.         
	Singh then conveyed the decision of the governor to HRD secretary Sudhir Prasad.        
	Farook acted today after JVM legislature party leader Pradeep Yadav lodged a complaint with the chief secretary alleging that huge amounts of money had changed hands to bring about these transfers.         
	Interestingly, transport department secretary N.N. Pandey had also scheduled a meeting of the establishment committee yesterday at 5pm to transfer various enforcement officers.         
	However, it was postponed at the eleventh hour due to opposition from a few bureaucrats, the sources added.         
	Till recently, the transport department was headed by BJP leader Neelkanth Singh Munda.

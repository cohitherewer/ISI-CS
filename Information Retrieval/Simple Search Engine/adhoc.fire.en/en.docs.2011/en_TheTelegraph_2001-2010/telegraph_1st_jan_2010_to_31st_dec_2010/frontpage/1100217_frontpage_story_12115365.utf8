	Ranchi, Feb. 16: Income tax officials conducted nationwide raids on Madhu Kodas associates, including the private secretary of chief minister Shibu Soren, for having allegedly helped the former chief minister amass illegal wealth to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore.        
	In what is a severe embarrassment for Soren, IT officials raided his secretary, M.L. Pals houses  one in Jamshedpur and two in Ranchi  apart from conducting search and seizure operations in 70 locations across the country, including Patna, Delhi, Mumbai and Chaibasa.        
	Todays raids were a follow up to ongoing investigations into Kodas empire that was allegedly built by clearing questionable mining leases in favour of a few companies and a rural electrification contract granted to one Hyderabad-based IVRCL.        
	Pal, who is considered to be close to both Koda and Soren, is alleged to have used his position of influence to facilitate these deals that generated crores in kickbacks.        
	Also, the Koda government is alleged to have favoured some firms floated by Pals son while okaying rural electrification contracts.                                                                    
	Pal is also being probed by the CBI for having presented a forged engineering degree at CMPDI, a subsidiary of Coal India Limited, to get a job in the 70s. He was subsequently sacked.        
	IT officials had first raided Pals property on October 31 last year. But after todays action, his boss, Soren, will no longer be able to distance himself from the controversy. The law will take its own course, he told mediapersons today.         
	Apart from Pal, IT officials raided homes of Patna-based former mines secretary Jaishankar Tiwary, former chairmen of Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) V.N. Pandey, B.N. Verma and H.B. Lal and Kodas associates at Chaibasa, Gua, Badajamda, among other places.        
	Raids were also conducted at the houses of director (mines) B.B. Singh, Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) member secretary R.K. Sinha, JSEB member S.N. Choudhary and three establishments of a renowned jewellery shop in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Chaibasa.

	Guwahati, Sept. 19: For Nur, life has been a curse since birth. The boy with cleft deformities had faced humiliation in school and few wanted to be his friends.         
	Today, the eight-year-old got a new lease of life when he left for the US to undergo a surgery. The shy boy, the son of a shoe vendor of South Salmara in Dhubri district, is being taken to the US under Operation Smile India project.        
	Operation Smile is a not-for-profit medical service organisation based in Norfolk, Virginia. Founded in 1982, it provides cleft lip and palate repair surgeries to children worldwide, assists countries in reaching self-sufficiency in these surgeries and works to reduce the occurrence of cleft lips and palates.         
	Till a year ago, I considered myself the most unfortunate father in this world and started believing that Allah was not fair to make my son live with such deformities. He was the butt of ridicule in school and used to keep away from the crowd Today I am the happiest man in the world and start believing that there is delay, not darkness in the Allahs house, Hasem Ali, Nurs father told this correspondent.         
	During Operation Smiles 4th International Cleft Mission here in February, Nur was seen by the mission medical team.         
	 A beaming health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told the media that Operation Smile ran a special programme called World Care for children like Nur across the world. He said the programme was for those children who were deprived of special treatment and care for complex facial deformities.         
	 All expenses of the patient and his attendants for their travel, stay and all medical expenses would be provided by Operation Smile and its partners. He will be staying in Norfolk, Virginia, for a year and the minimum cost would be Rs 50 lakh, Sarma said.         
	 The chairperson of Operation Smile India, Ranjit Barthakur, said Nur was the first such patient who was being taken to the US. His entire cost would be borne by the mission, he said, adding the patient would require multiple surgical interventions for a prolonged period at a specialised medical set-up at Norfolk.         
	Sarma said an Operation Smile Comprehensive Cleft Care Centre at Mahendra Mohan Choudhury Hospital (MMCH) would be ready for inauguration by November.         
	 The centre, the first of its kind in the region, is a step towards building infrastructure that would provide sustained care and support to children born with cleft deformities and creating a cleft-free Assam. Hi-tech machinery and facilities will be available at the centre so that children like Nur need not have to go abroad for treatment in the future. The mission will hold another mega camp at the MMCH when 500 children with facial deformities would be operated upon free of cost, he said.         
	Sarma will leave for the US next week to be honoured with the Operation Smile Incs International award at Norfolk on September 28 for his innovative and implementation of the vision for a cleft-free Assam. The governor of Virginia, Robert F. McDonell, will confer the award in the presence of William P. Magee and Kathleen Magee, the founders of the Operation Smile Inc.

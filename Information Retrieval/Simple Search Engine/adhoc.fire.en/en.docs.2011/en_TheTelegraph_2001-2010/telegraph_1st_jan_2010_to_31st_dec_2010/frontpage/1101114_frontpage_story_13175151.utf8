          K.P. NAYAR                                          
	Washington, Nov. 13: Myanmar was one of the more contentious issues during the recent Indo-US engagement and contrary to public perception, South Block very firmly stood its ground on its dealings with Yangon despite the Obama administrations allergy to the junta there, records of bilateral meetings available in Washington reveal.        
	Hours after the release of Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi today, the Obama administration appears to have grasped the pragmatism of Indian policy towards Myanmar.        
	The crux of a statement issued this morning by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton reads like a xerox copy of an earlier statement on Suu Kyis release by external affairs minister S.M. Krishna.        
	For the usual suspects and doubting Thomases, it should be clear who copied whom: Krishna read out his statement before television cameras in New Delhi at least four hours before Clinton made her views known here.        
	Krishna said about freedom for Suu Kyi: We hope that this will be the beginning of the process of reconciliation in Myanmar.        
	Clinton nudged the junta in Yangon towards national reconciliation and a more peaceful, prosperous, and democratic future.        
	Krishna asserted: We are confident that the release of Madam Aung San Suu Kyi will contribute to efforts for a more inclusive approach to political change.        
	Clinton said: We urge Burmas leaders to break from their repressive policies and begin an inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratic and ethnic leaders.        
	At the heart of what appears to be a belated and grudging acceptance of Indias approach to Myanmar are four words in the statements by Krishna and Clinton.        
	They are reconciliation and inclusive, common to both the statements, as well as process and towards, which are key to an emerging common ground in the policies of both New Delhi and Washington towards Yangon.        
	India maintained throughout its recent, contentious discussions with the US that it viewed the elections in Myanmar as part of a process, merely as one in a series of incremental steps towards political normality.        
	The Obama administration, on the other hand, saw elections in Myanmar as an end in itself, following a familiar pattern in US policy that has contributed to instability and crisis in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq, to mention recent examples.        
	Today, Clinton moved closer to the Indian view and implicitly acknowledged that the elections, followed by Suu Kyis release, meant Myanmar was heading towards a distant but bigger national objective as South Block has been telling Foggy Bottom, seat of the US state department and the White House.        
	India believes, as Krishna said today, that the rulers in Naypyidaw, Myanmars new capital, are engaged in a process that will move towards an ultimate objective.        
	In the run-up to Obamas visit to India, Kurt Campbell, an assistant secretary of state who is in charge of Myanmar, led a delegation to New Delhi for extensive discussions with the Indian government.        
	According to a diplomatic despatch sent by Campbell on his talks, he accused Myanmar of smuggling in nuclear material and warned Indians that Yangon would become a proliferator and a nuclear threat to the whole of South Asia.        
	To which the Indians testily retorted that when a nuclear threat to South Asia was emerging to Indias west meaning Pakistan  the Americans stood by and did nothing. That argument put Campbell and his delegation clearly on the defensive.        
	This reporter has not seen Campbells secret despatch, but a source here, who has access to what he wrote, today read out its relevant contents for this story.                          
	It was typical of US immaturity and cowboy-style diplomacy in dealing with such situations that Campbell complained to India that during his travel to Naypyidaw he asked questions and did not get answers.        
	The Indians retorted that they too ask questions but the answers always come during follow-up visits. The solution, South Block said, was to keep engaging Naypyidaw and not to make one visit to the country and expect to wrap up the problem with readymade answers, according to Campbells despatch.        
	In retrospect, it is now clear in the light of the fast-changing scenario in Yangon that Indias decision not to publicly respond to Obamas criticism of Myanmar in the Central Hall of Parliament was wise and fruitful.        
	It is also clear from a briefing at the end of Obamas visit by a very senior Indian official  who cannot be named because of the rules of the media interaction  that South Block did not buckle under Obamas aggressiveness over Myanmar which has to do with the Presidents domestic political compulsions.        
	The Indian official made it clear that during discussions with the Americans they were told that we have to deal with Myanmar as an immediate neighbour.        
	When we look east, the first place we see is Myanmar, was Indias response to Obamas advice to New Delhi to engage its east.        
	At the briefing, the official was sarcastic about the US suggestions that India should shun Yangon. It is not on the dark side of the moon unlike for the Americans who were half way round the globe away.        
	The official added that we cant pretend to be brain dead as China increases its engagement of Naypyidaw.        
	After Obama referred to Myanmar in Parliament, a core group in South Block considered a public response but advised the Prime Minister after a detailed review that, unlike Pakistan on which Manmohan Singh responded to Obamas comments at their joint news conference, it was not an issue that called for a rejoinder.        
	Private diplomacy was thought to be the best response and its effectiveness was proved by events today  although, if the rulers in Myanmar mishandle Suu Kyis rally on Sunday, all of Indias good work may well be back to square one.

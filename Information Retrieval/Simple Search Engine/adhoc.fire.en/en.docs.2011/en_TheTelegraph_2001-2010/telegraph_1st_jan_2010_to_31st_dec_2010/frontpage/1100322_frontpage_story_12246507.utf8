  - Isro revelation can fuel Apollo review           G.S. MUDUR                       A Chandrayaan-1 payload                                
	New Delhi, March 21: A scientific instrument that crashed on the Moon after breaking free from the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft 16 months ago detected carbon dioxide and water in the extremely thin lunar atmosphere, Indian scientists have revealed.         
	The finding has the potential to facilitate a re-examination of debunked data collected 38 years ago by Apollo-17, the last manned moon landing mission.        
	Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) scientists say they had spotted direct instrumental evidence for water and carbon dioxide in the lunar atmosphere in November 2008, but have only now released their findings in a scientific journal.         
	Chandrayaan-1 had jettisoned a box called the Moon Impact Probe crammed with instruments for a planned suicide dive onto the lunar surface on November 14, 2008. During its 25-minute fall, an instrument called the Chandras Altitudinal Composition Explorer (CHACE) sampled the lunar atmosphere every four seconds, and identified chemicals on the basis of their masses.         
	CHACE spotted signatures of water and carbon dioxide in addition to a variety of other atoms and molecules at different altitudes in the lunar atmosphere, researchers from the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram, reported last week in the journal Planetary and Space Science.         
	Spikes in the instrument readings suggest that water and carbon dioxide are the dominant molecules.         
	A US-made instrument that had piggybacked on Chandrayaan-1 had last year detected signatures of water molecules on the lunar surface -- and scientists had speculated that heat from the Sun may kick some of these molecules into the atmosphere.         
	But space physicists say the carbon dioxide spike from CHACE is intriguing.         
	This warrants further investigation and an explanation, said Jitendra Nath Goswami, director of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, who is a senior member of Indias lunar science team, but was not associated with the analysis of CHACE data.         
	A senior Isro scientist said data from Apollo-17 of 1972 which had carried a similar instrument had suggested the presence of water and carbon dioxide during the lunar night-time. The Apollo-17 data had been dismissed as contamination -- but our observations call for a re-examination of the Apollo-17 data, said Rajagopal Sridharan, director of the Space Physics Laboratory at the VSSC, and lead author of the new paper.         
	The scientists declined to speculate on explanations for carbon dioxide in the lunar atmosphere. Their paper in Planetary and Space Science is primarily about direct evidence for water, but a graph gives away the carbon dioxide spike.         
	The relative abundance of water and carbon dioxide in the lunar atmosphere and other observations appear to rule out contamination -- molecules inadvertently carried there from Earth -- of the instruments.         
	Were continuing with detailed analysis of our data, Sridharan said. While all other recent observations are inferences based on hydrogen-bearing compounds, the CHACE results are direct evidence, he said.         
	The density of atoms and molecules measured by CHACE also suggest that scientists might need to rethink some ideas about the emptiness of the Moons atmosphere. It is an ultra-high vacuum, Sridharan said, but the amount of material there appears to be at least 100 times more than what was thought before.         
	The lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1, launched in October 2008, had suffered instrument failures last year, leading to loss of communication with the spacecraft, and prompting Isro to end the mission in August 2009. But analysis of huge amount of data sent by the spacecrafts scientific payloads is expected to continue for several years.

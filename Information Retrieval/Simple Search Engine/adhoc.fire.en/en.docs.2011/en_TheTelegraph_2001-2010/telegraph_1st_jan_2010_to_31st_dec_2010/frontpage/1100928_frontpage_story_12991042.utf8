The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Let Games... hey, its my line
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Let Games... hey, its my line
  - President or prince: India and UK locked in opener row          ARCHIS MOHAN AND AMIT ROY                            Charles and Pratibha Patil                                
	New Delhi/London, Sept. 27: Fed up with the controversies and thinking let the Games begin? The problem is, a controversy seems to have broken out over who will declare: Let the Games begin.        
	A statement from Prince Charless office, Clarence House, today said the prince would represent the Queen at the October 3 opening ceremony and declare the Commonwealth Games open.        
	Not so, its President Pratibha Patil who will declare the Games open, highly-placed Indian government officials told The Telegraph.        
	Prince Charles is attending the opening ceremony as the Queens nominee and not in his capacity as the Crown Prince. The pecking order in such a situation is clear  our head of state, the President, takes precedence, one of them said.        
	Its the British monarch who traditionally declares the Games open but Queen Elizabeth II will not be attending the event this time.        
	The Indian officials cited a precedent. The Queen had not attended the opening ceremony of the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur, and it was the Malaysian king who inaugurated the Games. Prince Edward, the vice-patron of the Commonwealth Games Federation, sat beside the king and read out a message from the Queen (who later attended the closing ceremony and declared the Games closed).        
	Similarly, the Indian officials said, Charles will read out a statement from the Queen and then President Patil will receive the Queens baton from an Indian athlete and declare the Games open.        
	But Clarence House had said: Both the Prince of Wales and the President of India will have a prominent role in the opening ceremony.... We cannot be specific about the choreography but the Prince will read out the Queens baton message, ending by declaring the Games open.        
	The Indian officials blamed the discrepancy on the time difference between New Delhi and London and claimed things had been sorted out.                          
	Yet some other sources spoke of a possible compromise formula --- a sort of Queens baton relay ---- under which Charles will end his statement declaring the Games open while the President will say: Let the Games begin.        
	The Presidents spokesperson, Archana Dutta, was unable to defuse what could prove to be a diplomatic embarrassment for bilateral relations.        
	No comments, she said, even though some government officials insisted that the Centre had informed the Presidents office of its decision that she would be inaugurating the Games.        
	The Centre is keen not to let the issue raise nationalistic passions. The BJP has already said the Presidents position should not be insulted.        
	This (who declares the Games open) should have been decided earlier. There was no need to leave the decision for this late. We should ensure there is no insult to the person and position of the President, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said.        
	The governments decision has gone down well with the organising committee, buffeted by criticism ---- from the Anglophone countries in particular ----- for its shoddy preparations. Many in the committee feel that the criticism has had racist undertones and see the decision to have the President open the Games as a sign of India asserting itself.         
	Government officials said the Centre would extend all the courtesies to Charles during his October 2-5 visit with his wife, Camilla Parker-Bowles, the Duchess of Cornwall.        
	Pakistani high commissioner Shahid Malik visited the Games Village today and praised the facilities though he added that more needed to be done.        
	There is a lot (that) needs to be done. Our concern is that when our athletes come they should be comfortable. I cant pinpoint (the problems), he said.        
	Some Pakistani officials, however, have said the facilities in Delhi are better than those at the previous Games in Melbourne.

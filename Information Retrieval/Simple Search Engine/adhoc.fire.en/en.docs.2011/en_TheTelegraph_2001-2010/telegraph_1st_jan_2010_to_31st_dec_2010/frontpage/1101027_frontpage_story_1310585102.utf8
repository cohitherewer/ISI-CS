	New Delhi, Oct 27 (PTI): In a significant step which will enable it to do nuclear commerce, India today signed the Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC), which sets parameters on a nuclear operator's financial liability, at the IAEA in Vienna.
    The Indian move is seen as an effort towards allaying concerns of American companies on account of the newly-enacted Nuclear Liability law by Parliament.
    "We can confirm that the Indian government has signed the CSC this morning," International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) press officials told PTI from Vienna.
    The international convention provides for compensation in case of trans-national implications of a nuclear accident and has been signed by 14 countries, including India.
    However, only four countries-- the US, Argentina, Morocco and Romania have ratified the Convention so far.

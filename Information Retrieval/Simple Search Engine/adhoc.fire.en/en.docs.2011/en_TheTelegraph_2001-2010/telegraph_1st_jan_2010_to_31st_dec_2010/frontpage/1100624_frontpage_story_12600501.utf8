  - Team Capello didnt play well but held together            
	Relief, at last for four days, has come to English football. After all the agonies of the past 12 days with draws against the United States and Algeria, England finally managed to win a game of football at the 2010 World Cup.        
	This was an achievement which should not be underestimated. The damage to morale and confidence  not to mention team spirit  under the pressure of failure on the pitch and fan and media fury off it was immense.        
	That was what prompted the one-man revolt by John Terry which coach Fabio Capello stifled in the bud.        
	Capello, in his swift and clear-handed resolution of that internal crisis, offered the first piece of evidence that he was getting his hands back on the tiller of Englands ship; the second piece of evidence came with the team he lined up against Slovenia.        
	He retained Terry in his team for the Chelsea captains leadership qualities and, also, as a signal that this was a new day. Yesterdays issues were dead and buried. The team had to go forward.        
	Also in that spirit Capello replaced workhorse Emile Heskey with Jermain Defoe. This was significant in pointing up Capellos decision to stop relying so heavily for goals on the out-of-form Wayne Rooney up front.        
	Heskey is a contradiction in terms, a striker who does not score goals. Defoe, by contrast, scores goals but is hardly the most generous team player. But he was the right man for a subtle change of strategy.        
	Capellos reward was an early goal for Defoe, a much better all-round performance and a victory which lifted England into the second round.                  England manager Fabio Capello (right) hugs John Terry after a 1-0 win over Slovenia, courtesy a Jermain Defoe strike, put his team into the World Cups knockout rounds. Terry had recently threatened a revolt against Capello but had to apologise publicly after the manager warned him. (AP)       
	England did not play well; they dare not get carried away. But, frankly, they are still alive at the World Cup because, unlike France, the players pulled together as a team and not as a bunch of individual egotists.        
	Also, unlike France, England have a manager who applied steady common sense and a cool head to a crisis and came through, unlike Raymond Domenech who was still fighting yesteryears personal battles in his head when he should have been managing his team.        
	Nicolas Anelka  on the spur of a high-pressure moment at half-time in the French game against Mexico  let his frustration and temper get the better of him; the French fell apart and wrecked whatever World Cup dreams remained alive.        
	Terry  on the spur of a high-pressure moment after the goal-less draw with Algeria  also let his frustration and temper get the better of him; but the English players, management and coaching staff pulled together.        
	Their reward will be walking out on Sunday in the second round in the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein where  ironically and in case the dear-departed Domenech might need reminding  the French came to grief.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Modi card in Dalmiya return 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Modi card in Dalmiya return 
  - Civil suit against veteran withdrawn, expulsion revoked          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Dalmiya in Calcutta on Wednesday night. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                
	Mumbai, Sept. 29: Its ironical that Lalit Kumar Modi, who played a significant role in ending Jagmohan Dalmiyas hold over the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and in the witchhunt which followed, actually played a hand in his rehabilitation!        
	Dalmiyas honour has been restored, with the BCCI withdrawing the civil suit filed against him and revoking the December 2006 expulsion, but Modi is today an outcast, facing the prospect even of criminal cases.         
	 Had Modi, who never really got along with president Shashank Manohar and secretary (now president-elect, too) Narayanswamy Srinivasan, not met Dalmiya at the Eden, on December 8 last year, its possible that the ruling group wouldnt have presented him with an olive tree, not just a branch.        
	That one-on-one made Manohar and Co. wary, for, despite being totally marginalised, Dalmiya still had the potential to make life a little difficult, at least.        
	One learns that senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley, who holds key positions in the BCCI, acted as the mediator between Manohar and Dalmiya. That both trust the suave politician helped, and the creation of a right environment facilitated the ending of one of the most bitter intra-BCCI battles.        
	That something was cooking had, in fact, been reported by The Telegraph this morning.         
	Shortly after noon, when it was time for miscellaneous items at the AGM, Manohar announced that the BCCI wanted to withdraw the suit, after getting the opinion of Justice (retd) Manoj Mukherjee, a former Supreme Court judge, and Soli Sorabjee, a one-time attorney general of India.        
	Both Justice Mukherjee and Sorabjee felt that the BCCI didnt have a case. The 1996 World Cup issue was really that of an accounting error, running into crores, and not embezzlement.        
	Manohar explained that with no headway being made, the BCCI was merely wasting money, energy and time. Then, other cases were being fought.         
	When Manohar sought the views of the house, nobody dissented, although Union minister C.P. Joshi, who heads the Rajasthan Cricket Association, did ask whether it meant that the BCCI had been wrong in filing the suit.        
	Dalmiya, at that point, reiterated that hed been vindicated and had no reason to apologise. He thanked Manohar who, like him, is high on integrity, and also thanked the others present in the house.        
	Some members clapped, with a few thumping the table. Till this morning, only a select few were aware of the dramatic developments. The man at the centre of it all had himself been edgy.        
	Dalmiyas rehabilitation became the biggest news coming out of the AGM at the Cricket Centre, far bigger than Modi being reduced to history and the recasting of the IPLs governing council.                           
	As had been worked out informally last night, Dalmiya gave a letter to Manohar, requesting that the expulsion be revoked and that it be put on record. Hed already got relief from court, enabling him to attend the BCCI meetings, except in the brief period when Prasun Mukherjee was heading the Cricket Association of Bengal.        
	The revoking bit was done promptly.        
	Speaking exclusively in his sixth-floor suite at the InterContinental, before leaving for Calcutta, a happy Dalmiya said: I knew I hadnt done any wrong and thats what I told the people when they came to me (in the build-up to the AGM)... I dont know whether Ill be asked to play some role. I will, of course, be happy to help.        
	A confidant chipped in: Naam clear karna zaroori tha... That has been done... His stand has been vindicated.        
	Dalmiya, the first Asian to head the International Cricket Council (1997-2000), denied that a deal had been struck. Not at all. Never in the past, not now and never in the future. Im grateful that Ive got my due from the BCCI, thats it.        
	One understands that while Dalmiya doesnt have to fear Manohar, he may choose to be cautious in dealing with one or two of the other key players in the present dispensation.         
	With well-wishers and members of the media calling him every minute, it wasnt possible to talk for a length of time. Dalmiya did, however, point out that hed been able to get men of his choice on key committees.        
	Right now, though, the million-rupee question is over the role Dalmiya could play when its Easts turn to get the BCCI presidency. That chair was his from 2001-2004.

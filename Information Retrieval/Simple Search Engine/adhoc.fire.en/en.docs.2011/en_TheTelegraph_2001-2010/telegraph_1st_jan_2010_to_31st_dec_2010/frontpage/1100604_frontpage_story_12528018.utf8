The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bonhomie, but not in Bengal
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bonhomie, but not in Bengal
          SAMBIT SAHA                             Veerappa Moily, Arun Jaitley and Yeddyurappa with industrialists in Bangalore. (Bangalore News Photos)                                   
	Bangalore, June 3: One M stood up and congratulated the chief minister for organising a convention of global investors.        
	No prizes for guessing that neither does the M stand for Mamata Banerjee nor is the chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The place was also not Calcutta but Bangalore.        
	M. Veerappa Moily and B.S. Yeddyurappa may be from the opposite ends of the political spectrum but thought little of sharing the dais at the investors meeting attended by industrialists such as Lakshmi Mittal, Azim Premji and Kumar Mangalam Birla.        
	No one batted an eyelid when Moily, Union law minister from the Congress, praised Yeddyurappa, a BJP leader, for organising the event, which yielded 400 agreements worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore, though all such promises need not come through.        
	No one, except some guests familiar with Bengal. This is unthinkable in Calcutta. I wish our politicians too learn to co-exist, said an industrialist who has business interests in Bengal.        
	A round of applause broke out when Moily said: Yeddyurappa has given a good lead and hope he does well.         
	Moily did speak about the need to develop infrastructure  Bangalores record on this count is abysmal  and remind the audience that former chief minister S.M. Krishna, the Congress leader who is now the foreign minister, had started such investor events. BJP leader Arun Jaitley and the Congresss Subodh Kant Sahay were also on the dais.        
	In Bengal, the Trinamul Congress will share a platform with the Left only if government protocol demands so. Junior shipping minister Mukul Roy of Trinamul had left the stage at a business meeting when he realised industries minister Nirupam Sen was on the dais.        
	Bangalore also poses a what-if question for Bengal. Moily is a former chief minister of Karnataka  which raises the tantalising question whether Bhattacharjee, if he has to carry the prefix former next year, will attend an investors meeting called by Mamata.

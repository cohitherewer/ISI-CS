	New Delhi, Jan. 21: Ration card holders will get an additional 10kg of rice and wheat in January and February in a move aimed at shielding them from the impact of soaring food prices.        
	The decision, which will benefit those covered by the targeted public distribution system, was taken at a meeting of the cabinet committee of prices chaired by the Prime Minister here today. The ration hike will cost the government Rs 340 crore in additional food subsidy.        
	A family now gets 35kg of foodgrain if it falls below the poverty line or is covered by the Antyodaya Anna Yojana. Above-poverty-line households get transitory allocation, depending on the availability of central stocks.         
	The move came at a time food inflation continued to remain high at 16.81 per cent for the week ended January 9  though it fell marginally from 17.28 per cent a week ago. The monthly inflation rose to 7.31 per cent in December 2009 from 4.78 per cent in November 2009.         
	Any government will be deeply concerned over the issue (price rise), urban development minister Jaipal Reddy said.         
	The spike in prices of sugar, now selling at Rs 50 in retail markets, have prompted the BJP to attack the government. Yesterday, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati had demanded agriculture minister Sharad Pawars ouster after milk producers said they would raise prices.         
	The Prime Minister has called a meeting of chief ministers on February 6 to discuss price rise.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Secretive CM plays cards close to chest
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Secretive CM plays cards close to chest
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA      
	Ranchi, Sept. 21: Chief minister Arjun Munda has learnt enough lessons from his past mistakes.         
	So, this time, when he set the ball rolling for the formation of a BJP government in Jharkhand (with blessings from party boss Nitin Gadkari), he played his cards close to his chest.         
	Except for a select coterie, not a soul knew about his backroom manoeuvres, which gathered momentum after August 15, as he initiated talks with JMM. So guarded was Munda, his close aides confide, that he struck the deal with JMM heavyweights over telephone and never met them during daytime to avoid being spotted by scribes.         
	Further, Shibu Soren was purportedly kept out of the picture  another of Mundas ploy  to dodge the media and Congress spies in particular.         
	The JMM leaders final meeting with Gadkari in Delhi began at 2.45am on September 7, hours before Munda, with 44 MLAs in tow, hotfooted to Raj Bhavan to stake claim to form the government.         
	A source said Gurujis close aides like Mathura Prasad Mahto and Haji Hussain Ansari and son Hemant Soren had already put up at various locations in Delhi. They were suddenly asked to come to Gadkaris place for final talks.         
	Meanwhile, Sudhir Mahto was asked to hold another meeting with senior party colleagues in Jharkhand and declare JMMs willingness to form an alternative government. In fact, real work in Delhi began late in the evening on that day.        
	And now with a BJP government at the helm of affairs and he the chief minister, Munda plans to follow his secretive line of action in the future too. He has decided to open his mouth only at select times.        
	Speaking exclusively to The Telegraph today, the chief minister appeared in no hurry to expand his cabinet or appoint his principal secretary. This despite the fact that a top BJP leader, who initially opposed the alternative government with JMMs support in Jharkhand, is now learnt to be mounting pressure on him to appoint her old friend as the states chief secretary.        
	Usually, people do not embark on important work in the month of Bhadrapada, which will end tomorrow. Moreover, the JMM workers convention is on in Dumka. Unless the JMM submits its list of nominees, I cant go ahead with cabinet expansion, Munda said.        
	I will be appointing my principal secretary very soon. As of now, the chief ministers secretariat is continuing its routine work normally. Merit and efficiency will be the sole criteria for appointment of officials at different positions, including the chief secretary and DGP, Munda added.        
	He is not eager to head the Unified Command either, meant for wiping out Naxalism. In BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh, the Unified Command is headed by the chief minister. But in Jharkhand, it is under the chief secretarys wings.         
	Munda was also non-committal about introducing police commissioners in cities like Ranchi and Jamshedpur.         
	But he is clear about one thing  he will definitely set targets for every government department and ensure that they complete work on time.        
	After cabinet expansion, I will take a close look at the real functioning of the Unified Command. If its functioning efficiently under the chief secretarys leadership, I am not going to disturb it, he said.                     
	Similarly, I cannot promise to appoint police commissioners in Ranchi and Jamshedpur only because the population of these cities has increased. I first need to find out how the new system is going to benefit the common people. But accountabilities of individual officials will be fixed and they will have to achieve their set targets on time, he added.        
	Although the heavy showers recently have come as a great relief for drought-hit Jharkhand, the chief minister stressed he was committed to evolving effective measures to prevent recurrence of such a situation in the future. Assured sources of water in every village and smooth supply of foodgrain to all, especially those living below the poverty line, top his priority list.        
	The water resources department has proposed nearly Rs 35 crore for repair and reinstallation of non-functional irrigation projects. The drinking water and sanitation department has come up with proposals worth over Rs 1,117 crore. But groundwork has not begun due to paucity of funds. The state is expecting central assistance to the tune of Rs 3,000-3,500 crore to carry out drought relief work.        
	We are not going to wait for release of funds by the Centre. We will begin work from our own resources. The corpus of contingency fund has already been raised from Rs 150 crore to Rs 750 crore. Let me settle down first. Positive results will be seen soon, Munda signed off.

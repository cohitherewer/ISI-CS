	Thimphu, April 29 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today met his Pakistani counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani for the first substantive dialogue in nine months during which he is understood to have conveyed India's deep disappointment over Islamabad's inaction to punish perpetrators of Mumbai attacks.  
	 Singh and Gilani met in this picturesque Bhutanese capital on the margins of the 16th SAARC Summit, their first meeting after their controversial engagement in Sharm-el- Sheikh in Egypt in July last year.  
	 Before beginning their meeting, which began almost 40 minutes later than the originally scheduled time, Singh and Gilani shook hands and greeted each other warmly.  
	 Ahead of their today's meeting, 77-year-old Singh and 57-year old Gilani had shook hands twice yesterday during the opening day of the Summit and took a stroll together at the insistence of other leaders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Archbishop Williams saves his best for the last 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Archbishop Williams saves his best for the last 
          MOHUA DAS                            Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams interacts with children at Bishops College on Monday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	The Archbishop of Canterbury left town for Ranchi on Monday evening, signing off with an inspiring footnote to a goodwill mission marked by his extraordinary ability to connect with everyone from the schoolgirl to the scholar.        
	Day 3 of Rowan Williamss stay in the city was mostly spent at Bishops College on AJC Bose Road, where an assortment of students and teachers of theology, bishops and scholars heard him hold forth on two passages from the Bible  The Coming of the Kingdom and Judgement on Corrupt Rulers, Priests and Prophets.        
	I really commend you for the way you handled the text. When you took it up, I had wondered: What on earth is he going to say? But it was remarkable, gushed Aruna Gnanadason, former head of the womens programme for the World Council of Churches, during an interaction with the Archbishop later.        
	James Massey, the director of the Centre for Subaltern Studies in Delhi, couldnt stop raving about how Williams had used the footnotes. We had never done that. Today you gave us theologians that freedom, he said.        
	 Yes, a footnote can be inspiring, quipped the Archbishop, trademark smile in place.        
	Williams, the principal leader of the Church of England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion, is not only revered for his position but also respected for his erudition.        
	Sundays sermons at St Peters Church in Behala in the morning and St Pauls Cathedral in the evening may have provided enough evidence of that, but it was Mondays scholastic footnote that left those interested in theology floored.        
	 For someone like me who is training to become a theologian or pastor, it was a blessing to attend a lecture by such an eminent scholar. I have been waiting for this day for a long time, said 24-year-old Varghese Paul, a final-year student of divinity at Bishops College.         
	Williams unveiled a book on the history of Bishops College, written by Bishop Talibuddin from Delhi, and launched the college website with a click of the mouse before settling down for a seminar on contextual theology.         
	Drawing on his longstanding involvement with social issues, Williams provided an insight into topics as diverse as current trends in Dalit theology, the challenges faced by indigenous peoples in Asia, inter-faith relations and the plight of women in Indian society.        
	Issues of trafficked women and children are very acute in this part of the world while the rise in honour killings reinforces the trend of instrumentalising women. At the grassroots level in situations of deep deprivation, its the women who have often been the agents of change, and that should not take our attention away from passing on the human vision of providing health care and education. Change matters at a basic level, said Williams.         
	The Archbishop had earlier voiced his opinion on the Ayodhya dispute and capital punishment in schools.        
	Mondays speech also had a message that could find an echo in Bengal. Citing examples from his teenage years in Wales when people of the Claerwen Valley were evicted to make way for a reservoir, Williams said the struggle over land and its ownership is a serious and insoluble issue in the politics of the 21st century. He reminded the audience that we are guests and not owners of the holy land.         
	Williamss outspokenness carries forward a long tradition of the archbishops of Canterbury speaking out on contentious issues at the risk of courting controversy. He has previously shocked conservative Anglicans with his support of gay clergy and a move to allow women to serve as bishops.

  - Delhi sets extensive rules   to ensure fair play        K.P. NAYAR                                          
	Washington, Dec. 22: The exceptional civility between Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Wen Jiabao while discussing contentious issues in New Delhis Hyderabad House last week was in stark contrast to the attrition by some of their aides who dealt with Sino-Indian economic relations in parallel dialogues in the run-up to and during the Chinese Premiers three-day visit.        
	India, which has triggered more World Trade Organisation anti-dumping investigations in Geneva against China than any country in the world, alleging artificial export prices, is determined to bring some balance in their bilateral trade which is now heavily in Beijings favour.        
	Much more than on the now-famous omission of one China in the joint communique or on resumption of defence exchanges, it is on bringing this balance and ensuring fair trade with New Delhis biggest commercial partner that Wens visit has prompted quick Indian action.        
	Even before the Chinese Prime Minister returned home via Pakistan, India initiated a series of measures which will make it difficult for Chinese companies to engage in unfair trade practices and boost their exports to India.        
	According to new rules governing Sino-Indian trade which went into effect yesterday, Indian companies have been effectively banned from placing orders with Chinese companies listed on Business-to-Business (B2B) sites in both India and China.        
	A commerce ministry official in New Delhi said that while the government cannot prohibit Indian companies from doing such business electronically, an advisory issued to this effect is expected to kill such transactions.        
	The advisory, which is to be immediately circulated through Indias national and regional trade associations, will drain banking support for B2B transactions because of the ban, the official calculated.        
	The wide-ranging advisory, which covers the entire gamut of a flourishing trade between China and India is believed to be the most extensive guidelines to businesses ever issued by New Delhi.        
	An Indian company seeking to do business with China must now run a complete credential check on the prospective Chinese partner with the Indian embassy in Beijing or its consulates in Shanghai or Guangzhou.        
	Although India has a consulate in Hong Kong, the approach is expected to be more liberal there because of Hong Kongs history of commerce and the long-standing ties between Indian and Hong Kong enterprises which go back to the times when Hong Kong was a British Colony.        
	The Indian embassy in Beijing announced yesterday that it provides credential checking services for businesses. There are also a number of business service companies in India and China which conduct credentials checks and provide reports on the health and reliability of the Chinese companies, the embassy announcement said.        
	Indian firms transacting business with China have also been asked by the government not to make any advance payments. If at all there is a need for advance payment, both the parties should operate through an escrow account or bank guarantee route, the advisory urged. The Indian company should insist on guarantee before making advance payment to its Chinese partner.         
	In addition, Indian companies have been asked not to release LC (letter of credit) without inspecting the actual product in the consignment that arrives in India. A provision must be incorporated in the agreement that provides releasing LC only after the Indian company is satisfied with the quality of the product in the consignment.        
	All contracts entered into with Chinese companies must henceforth need an arbitration clause and proof of existence such as company registration documents which will have to be certified by the embassy of India or a relevant Indian consulate.        
	Besides, the quality and quantity of any product to be imported from China is to be physically certified by the Indian company either by visiting China or by appointing an agency for this work.        
	The Indian embassy in Beijing has also effectively blacklisted Hebei (Shijiazhuang), Henan (Zhengzhou and Luohe) and Tianjin by warning that Indian companies desirous of doing business with companies located in these places are advised to be cautious.        
	The mission said Indian companies had reported having faced problems while doing business in these areas.        
	During Wens visit the Indian side took up 26 unresolved trade disputes between Indian and Chinese companies this year alone and cited them as the reason for tightening up business practices. In addition, 24 disputes which cropped up last year continue to fester.        
	During Wens visit five years ago, the two sides had set a target of $30 billion in bilateral trade by 2010. That target has not only been exceeded but has actually doubled with Indias deficit equalling the total exports by the country to China.        
	India, therefore, reckons that trade can be an effective diplomatic weapon in New Delhis hands to bring China into line on other issues of contention.        
	China has consistently used its economy to extract concessions from the US. With its steady growth, India now hopes to replicate that experience with Beijing. A shrinkage in the market for Chinese goods in the US and Europe on account of the global economic crisis has enhanced Indias ability to twist Beijings arms using trade for that purpose.        
	No one in New Delhi will admit, though, that India is taking this route, and cite mounting complaints from business about malpractices by Chinese companies as the rationale for the new guidelines.        
	But privately, they are hopeful that as a result of the pain from a hardening of Indian positions on trade, results will be quickly visible on other fronts.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ramesh under attack: PM pulls him up, BJP demands action
                                        
	New Delhi, May 10 (PTI) : Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh was in the eye of a storm today with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pulling him up for his comments against the Home Ministry.Opposition BJP is demanding action against him.              
	Singh told Ramesh not to comment on functioning of other ministries when he spoke to the Minister soon after his return this morning from Beijing where he made the critical remarks.              
	During the telephonic conversation, Singh told Ramesh that it was advisable for Cabinet colleagues not to make comments on the functioning of other ministries, especially with regard to relationship with important neighbours like China, the PMO sources said.              
	The Prime Ministers blunt message to the Environment Ministry came two days after Ramesh said in Beijing that the Home Ministry was overly defensive and alarmist in its approach towards entry of Chinese companies in India.              
	There is no confusion in our policies towards China and we continue to strive for constructive engagement with Beijing, Singh told Ramesh.              
	Ramesh, while talking about the India-China warmth developed during the Copenhagen Summit on Climate Change, had suggested that the Home Ministry needed to be much more relaxed in its approach to Chinese investments in India.              
	He had said that the security establishment was putting needless restrictions on Chinese investments in India as we are imagining demons where there are none.              
	The Home Ministry also snubbed Ramesh, saying, It is wrong to say that the security establishment was biased against the Chinese companies.              
	Chinese companies are already present in India in a big way. They are working in a variety of sectors, including in telecommunications sector. I dont think there is any discrimination happening from the governments side, Home Secretary G K Pillai said.              
	The Congress is also unhappy over Rameshs remarks, with a senior leader saying, An adverse comment against the policy and functioning of a ministry as sensitive as Home Affairs, that, too in a foreign land, cannot be justified.              
	BJP slammed Ramesh and asked the Prime Minister to take action against him.              
	The comments of Ramesh in a foreign country which were critical of the Government are highly objectionable...it is unbecoming of a Union Minister. The Prime Minister owes an explanation the internal squabbling within ministers and take action against him, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar told reporters here.               
	When asked whether BJP will seek Rameshs resignation for his comments, Javadekar said definitely, if the PM does not act (against him).

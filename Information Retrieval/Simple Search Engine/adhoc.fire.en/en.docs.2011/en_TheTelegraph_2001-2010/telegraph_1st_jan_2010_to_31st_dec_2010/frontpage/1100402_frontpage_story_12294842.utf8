	Calcutta, April 1: Trinamul Congress MP Kabir Suman continued his anti-party tirade today, prompting his mother-like Mahasweta Devi to almost regret that he hadnt heeded her advice, given less than 24 hours earlier, to stop such outbursts.        
	You cannot remain in a party until you become a dala das (servant of the party). You have to bury your conscience and abide by the party diktat, the Jadavpur MP said today, without naming Trinamul.        
	The rebel MP appeared to suggest he would stick to his decision to resign from the Lok Sabha and the party. After seven days, I may have to look for a job, he told a street-corner meeting organised by students of Jadavpur University, which falls in his constituency, to protest Operation Green Hunt against the Maoists.        
	Mahasweta, who had last night told Suman at her Golf Green home not to speak against his party and wait seven days before sending his resignation to the Lok Sabha Speaker, said she was worried.        
	I heard that Suman had targeted his party again today. This was undesirable. I had told him not to speak against the party publicly, but he did not listen. This really worries me, Mahasweta told The Telegraph tonight.        
	The writer said she hadnt got an opportunity to talk to Mamata Banerjee and apprise her of last nights meeting with Suman although the Trinamul Congress chief was at her Kalighat home the whole of Thursday.        
	Mahaswetas overtures to Suman appear to have created a rift among the biddyadjan (artistes and singers) loyal to Mamata. Artist Suvaprasanna today came out publicly condemning Sumans public outbursts against his party.        
	Suman has betrayed the party. We all did a lot for him but now he is speaking against party leaders and workers. He should no more be indulged, he added. Suvaprasanna claimed he had already spoken to Mamata about Suman.        
	However, an actor close to Suman differed with Suvaprasanna. I dont agree with Suvada. Suman may be a Trinamul MP but he cannot forget his identity as a singer. So he is right to air his views, he said.        
	Mamata had made it clear to her aides in Delhi on Tuesday that she would rather have the MP out of the party than let him cause further embarrassment. Today, party leaders echoed the sentiment.        
	Suman has no takers in the party. The sooner he leaves, the better for us. Sumans resignation could put an end to the embarrassment he has brought the party ever since he became our MP, a key Trinamul functionary said.

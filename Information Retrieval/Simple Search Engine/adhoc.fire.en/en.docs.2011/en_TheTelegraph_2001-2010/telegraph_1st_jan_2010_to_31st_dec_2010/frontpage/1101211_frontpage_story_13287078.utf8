          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Shashi Tharoor                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Twitter might have contributed to Shashi Tharoors exit from the government, but he lectured his former ministry today on the merits of social networking tools.        
	The occasion was a seminar on public diplomacy organised by the external affairs ministry, which invited the MP from Thiruvananthapuram to open it.         
	In my brief stint as minister, I used to argue that foreign policy is too important to be left to the ministry alone, he said, criticising the government for what he described as apathy to public diplomacy.         
	Tharoor cited the examples of the US, Canada and the UK whose foreign ministries are exploiting social networking tools like Web 2.0 to get their message across. They also encouraged their diplomats to blog, he added, sounding like he was still smarting from his ouster as junior minister in April.         
	The Congress MP who has nearly 9 lakh followers on Twitter  possibly the most for an Indian, ahead of Shah Rukh Khan with 7.27 lakh followers and Amitabh Bachchan with 5.33 lakh followers  said US President Barack Obamas itineraries are posted on the site but the Indian Prime Ministers programme is seldom shared with the public.         
	Tharoor welcomed the ministrys efforts to widen its public diplomacy outreach but said it has a long way to go. The MEA is on Twitter and Facebook, though the extent to which transparency is encouraged remains quite limited.         
	Not deploying social media tools effectively is to abdicate a channel of contact not only with the millions of young Indians who use Facebook, Twitter and Orkut, but also to the huge Indian diaspora that wields a disproportionate influence on international perceptions of India, he said.         
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao also advocated the use of social media, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Web 2.0. She cited several instances of Indias development efforts that have not been publicised, such as the revival of an irrigation project that has doubled Senegals rice output and made the country self-sufficient in rice for the first time in a generation.         
	We have traditionally tended to adopt a fairly conservative approach towards publicising our own work and this, almost by default, leaves the field open for negative stories of which there is never a dearth.         
	The ministrys public diplomacy division was set up four years back.

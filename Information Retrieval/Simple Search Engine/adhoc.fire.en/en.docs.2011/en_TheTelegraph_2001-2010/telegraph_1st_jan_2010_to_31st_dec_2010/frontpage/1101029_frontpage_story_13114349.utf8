	Calcutta, Oct. 28: Nearly 10 lakh Bihari migrants living across the Northeast are hoping that the Assembly elections back home will cause a turnaround of fortunes and spin enough jobs for them to return.        
	As 48 constituencies go to the polls today, a large part of the migrant population is already in Bihar to cast its valuable vote  the rest are thirsting for every piece of news emanating from their homeland.        
	Though many are missing the trip to Bihar because of unavailability of transport, thousands are back home and will only return after the declaration of results, said Swaminath Prasad, a Bihari businessman who lives in Gangtok and is involved with several associations of migrant Biharis. Siliguri, he says, is the gateway to the Northeast for the Bihari migrants.         
	Every year, thousands of people travel through Siliguri to different states in the Northeast. This is the first time I have seen so many people travelling back home for the election. The common belief is that its not long before there will be jobs back home. We are getting to know that things are improving at home. It is important that the process continues and that is why this election is crucial, he said. Even those who could not make it for the elections are hooked.         
	Bikas Kumar, who is from Bhagalpur and heads the Purbottar Hindustani Samaj, an association of Biharis across the Northeast, said, The elections back home is the topic of discussion every time the members of our community meet here. Those who could not make it for the election are in touch with their kith and kin back home.         
	He is enthusiastic about the performance of the Nitish Kumar government and hopes that he will take up the issue of security of Biharis away from home seriously. This was unthinkable in Bihar a few years back. My family members say they can now travel safely at night, he said.         
	But we are pained with the fact that the security concern of Biharis away from home is not given priority. At the risk of being politically incorrect, I have to say that we are looked down upon everywhere we go. Somewhere it is political parties getting popular mandates who chase us out while at other places it is militants who are after our lives. We have petitioned the Bihar government earlier and have asked our family members back home to vote for the party which takes the issue of our security away from home seriously, he added.         
	Amidst praises for shining Bihar and its architect there are some who are sceptical about the recent moves of the government.         
	Rajesh Sharma, a Guwahati-based businessman who has come from Hajipur and is also a highly-placed member of the Purbottar Hindustani Yuvak Samaj, is worried about the bataidari (share cropping) bill, which, if implemented, would give legal recognition to the land tillers.         
	This land distribution drive popped up recently in Bihar politics followed by the formation of Kisan Mahapanchayat, a non-political platform led by the leaders of the landed castes.         
	I hope that the campaign about the bill being implemented is a gimmick. It is unnerving to know that I will lose out on my property for no reason.

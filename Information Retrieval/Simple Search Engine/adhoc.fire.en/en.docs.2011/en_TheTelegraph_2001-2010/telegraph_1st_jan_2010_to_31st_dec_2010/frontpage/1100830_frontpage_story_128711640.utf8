	Hyderabad, Aug 30 (PTI): Small portion of one of the minarets of the historic Charminar fell off following heavy rains in the city, officials said today.
    The incident occurred at around 2230 hrs (IST) last night, a senior official of Archaeological Survey of India said, adding the portion of the debris fell on the nearby temple abutting the massive structure in view of heavy downpour in the old city area here.
    "The damage on the minaret can be repaired. It will take at least one week to make the necessary repairs," the ASI official, who inspected the damage portion, said.
    The official further said there was no danger to the structural stability of the monument.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dilemma on deemed admissions
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dilemma on deemed admissions
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, March 13: The human resource development ministry is trapped in a dilemma: how to warn students against seeking admissions to 88 deemed universities found unfit in a central review but without risking earning the Supreme Courts ire.        
	Many institutions are aggressively advertising to seek students for the coming academic year despite the threat of losing the deemed tag that allows them to grant degrees but the ministry cannot publicly counter them.         
	The Supreme Court, hearing a case on deemed universities, has ordered the government to maintain status quo  which means that the institutions can at present legitimately conduct admissions for the 2010 session.        
	But the ministry is worried that the status quo could allow the institutes to attract tens of thousands of students this year into courses that the court may ultimately order action against.        
	The 88 substandard deemed universities include extremely popular institutions in Pune, Tamil Nadu, especially around Chennai, and some well-known government institutions.        
	We are effectively having to sit and watch, knowing that thousands of students could jump into an extremely uncertain academic future, a government official told The Telegraph.        
	The ministry has now uploaded the findings of the review, including the list of substandard and fit deemed varsities on its website. Officials are hoping that all students seeking admissions into deemed universities will first verify whether the institute they are applying to risks losing the deemed tag.        
	If the court upholds the HRD ministrys plan to withdraw deemed status from substandard institutions, students studying at these varsities will have to shift to other recognised institutions to receive legitimate degrees.        
	The Centre and state governments will assist students in identifying recognised institutions offering similar courses and in convincing these institutions to admit extra students.         
	But the students may need to appear for a qualifying test as the institutions they are applying to may want to ensure that their standards do not drop by admitting students from a substandard institution.        
	Close to 4 lakh students are already studying at the 88 deemed universities found substandard by the HRD review ordered by minister Kapil Sibal.        
	The review panel recommended that the government immediately withdraw deemed status from 44 at the bottom of the pile. It suggested that the government give the remaining 44 three years to try and improve.        
	An institution which loses its deemed university status can reapply for the tag after improving its standards.

          OUR BUREAU                                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: Jairam Ramesh today vetoed Vedantas bauxite-mining project in Orissas Niyamgiri hills, citing multiple law violations and rejecting an appeal by chief minister Naveen Patnaik.         
	The Union environment and forests minister asserted that the vetoing of the Vedanta project was not in any way linked to Poscos proposal for an integrated steel plant in Jagatsinghpur, which requires 1,253 hectares of forest land and is currently being examined by a special committee.         
	There was no deal, Ramesh said. There was no deal linking Posco with Vedanta. A committee has been set up to look into Posco. Ive asked the committee to expedite the submission of its report, he said.         
	Naveen, who arrived in Bhubaneswar this afternoon, expressed surprise and suggested that Ramesh had not given him any hint of what was coming. He never mentioned this yesterday, the chief minister said.         
	I just came to know about the decision. We will certainly examine the order and take appropriate steps. I hope this is not politics.        
	Asked whether his government would move court, Naveen said: Let me see the order first.        
	The Orissa chief minister had met Ramesh yesterday and requested him to issue a final approval as the Supreme Court had already granted in-principle sanction subject to certain conditions that had been met by the state government.         
	I merely listened, smiled and did not say anything, Ramesh said today.        
	A spokesperson for Vedanta Resources Plc said the company reconfirms that there has been no regulatory violations of any kind at the Lanjigarh Alumina refinery.        
	Vedantas refinery at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi will not shut down because of the clampdown but it will be crippled by the denial of access to the rich bauxite reserves of the Niyamgiri hills. The refinery now runs on supplies from other states, which are also under the glare of the Centre.        
	Ramesh said he was aware that the Posco project involved different issues. It involves the single-largest FDI in India... and we have strategic ties with east Asia, but Ive only asked the committee examining this issue to expedite their report.

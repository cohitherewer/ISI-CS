          JENNA WORTHAM                      Steve Jobs with the new iPad in San Francisco on Wednesday. (Reuters)                          
	San Francisco, Jan. 27: Steven P. Jobs has finally given Apple fans exactly what they have been asking for  a new iPhone-like tablet computer called the iPad starting at $499 in the US.        
	We want to kick off 2010 by introducing a magical and revolutionary product today, said Jobs, Apples chief executive.        
	The base price is far below the $1,000 some analysts were expecting. The most advanced model will cost $829 with 64 gigabytes of memory and connection to a 3G cellphone network.        
	Jobs described the iPad, which is larger in size but similar in design to Apples popular iPhone, as so much more intimate than a laptop and so much more capable than a smartphone with this gorgeous, large display.        
	Some models of the product will be available in 60 days in the US, he said.        
	Jobs appeared energised but gaunt as he unveiled the iPad at a media event in San Francisco today.        
	The iPads features and specifications, which have been grist for the Internet rumour mill for months, are finally sharply in focus: It will feature a 9.7-inch screen and a full virtual keyboard. It is half-inch thick and weighs 680gm. In addition, the iPad screen is multi-touch, meaning content on it can be manipulated with swipes and taps of the fingers.        
	The iPad is outfitted with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Internet connectivity, and is powered by a 1-gigahertz Apple A4 chip and has 16 to 64 gigabytes of flash storage.        
	During the event, Jobs demonstrated the iPad as a platform for watching video, streaming music, reading e-books, browsing photographs and playing games. The company also said third-party applications would be a big draw on the iPad.        
	The iPad will run virtually every one of the current catalogue applications for the iPhone, numbering around 100,000, virtually unmodified, Scott Forstall, a senior vice-president, said.        
	People have been willing to pay to customise devices with a large pool of third-party tools, called applications, turning them into video game machines, compasses, city guides and e-book readers.                    The New York Times website on the iPad. (Reuters)    
	Forstall also noted that developers could modify their apps to take advantage of the large touch-screen display, just as Apple did with its calendar, iTunes, email and YouTube apps. The iPhone SDK, a set of programming tools for developers, will be enhanced to support development of the iPad.        
	We think its going to be a whole other gold rush for developers as they build apps for the iPad, Forstall said.        
	Among the partners at the San Francisco event that showed off new software compatible with the iPad: Gameloft, a game developer, which demonstrated a first-person shooter game on the iPad; Electronic Arts, and The New York Times.        
	Apple has been working on such a tablet computer for more than a decade, according to several former employees. But early prototypes, which used PC microchips, quickly drained batteries, and Apple executives could never figure out how or why people would want to use such a device, which lacks a traditional keyboard and computer mouse.         
	Other companies, such as Microsoft, have sold tablet computers for years, but the category has never caught on with consumers.        
	But advances in technology have since made tablets more feasible. Battery technology has improved. Jobs said the iPad would have 10 hours of battery life, enabling a user to take a flight from San Francisco to Tokyo and watch video the whole way.        
	Traditional QWERTY keyboards have also, to many people, become expendable. In 2005, Apple acquired Fingerworks, a company founded by two researchers at the University of Delaware to develop gesture-based computer interfaces. Their work has been integrated into the iPhone and, now, the iPad. At the same time, an expanding class of smartphones like Googles Nexus One and the BlackBerry Bold have abandoned keyboards altogether.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Looks like Mamata, speaks like...

          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Lalu Prasad had gone to Harvard Business School and made Indian Railways turnaround a case study in B-schools, but Mamata Banerjee today outperformed her predecessor in Rail Bhavan with her use of management jargon.         
	Her two-hour budget speech was peppered with B-school lingo and loaded with carefully crafted strategies, leaving observers hazarding a guess on the invisible hand behind the budget.         
	Was it Amit Mitra? Mamata has been relying heavily on Mitra, the Ficci secretary-general she had drafted into her ministry as the chairman of the experts committee on railways.        
	The mark of Mitra, an economist and one of the favourites of India Inc, in Mamatas budget was difficult to miss.         
	What is not viable today, if connected, will become viable tomorrow. I believe, railways cannot ignore this responsibility of making investments for future growth, said Mamata at the beginning of her budget speech.         
	Donning the hat of a marketer, Mamata tried to convince the Planning Commission to clear the projects not meeting the viability criteria. But the Trinamul Congress leader  with her eyes firmly set on Writers Buildings  was not just canvassing for funds to see the projects through.         
	Even if the Planning Commission rejects some of the proposals, Mamatas image doesnt take a beating. She could always claim that she tried, said a senior marketing professional with a fast-moving consumer goods company.                       
	As marketing exercises are incomplete without a long-term plan, Mamata backed her pitch with a Vision 2020 statement for the Indian Railways with focus on creating an efficient and customer focused transport solution with the help of committed and satisfied employees and cutting-edge technology.         
	Trying to prove her customer focus, she promised multi-modal door-to-door service to freight customers, offering more services, to retain customers, said a senior railway official.         
	Her repeated stress on her pride with the 14-lakh-plus railway employees and announcements on offering better deals for them bore signs of human resource planning.         
	Following the basics in management principles, Mamata talked about breaking her goals into short, medium and long term ones, setting a target to add 25,000km of new lines in the next 10 years with the help of innovative financing models.         
	Maintaining her penchant for three letters  CPM in case of the Trinamul Congress chief  the railway minister avatar of Mamata relied on PPP, public-private partnership, to fulfil her promises.         
	The time has come for the business community to come and join hands to build partnerships with the railways, said Mamata, seeking to leave behind the Singur controversy that forced Tata Motors to beat a retreat from Bengal.         
	The speech was also an indication that Mamata has picked up skills beyond management textbooks as she thanked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi several times for their guidance and support.         
	MBAs learn while working that keeping the boss happy is very important It seems Mamata has learnt that as well, said a business development manager with a consulting company.         
	But she failed to show her finesse in one area  managing finances, despite proposing to shift to an accrual-based accounting system  giving her opponents in the CPM the chance to question the feasibility of implementation of her ideas.         
	Not just the Marxists, Mamatas proposals did not appear to have enthused the markets either. The BSE sensex settled at 16,255.97 points, a loss of 30.35 points over the previous close.        
	Clearly, talking business and walking it are two different things.

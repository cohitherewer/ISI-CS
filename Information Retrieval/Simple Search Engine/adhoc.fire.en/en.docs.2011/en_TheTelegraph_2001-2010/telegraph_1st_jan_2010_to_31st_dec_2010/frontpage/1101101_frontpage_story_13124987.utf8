  - diwali wish to hindu brothers          CITHARA PAUL                                                     
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: The Vatican has wished Hindu Brothers a joy-filled Deepavali and called for greater harmony and trust between the two religions.         
	The Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue, the Vaticans top body for promoting religious dialogue, has sent a letter to the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI) asking them to send it to Hindu leaders in the country.         
	Titled Christians and Hindus: Toward Enhancing of Mutual Respect, Trust and Cooperation, the letter bears the signature of Archbishop Pier Luigi Celata, secretary of the pontifical council, and repeatedly underlines the relevance of strengthening friendship and co-operation between Hindus and Christians.         
	It calls for reflection on how best we can do that by mutually ensuring and enhancing respect and trust.         
	Mutual respect, the message reads, is one of the fundamentals for peaceful and harmonious co-existence as well as progress in society. Trust, on the other hand, nourishes every genuinely human relationship, both personal and communitarian.         
	The unusually warm letter from Rome is just one indication of the Churchs increasing proximity towards Hinduism.         
	Earlier, on October 18, Pope Benedict XVI wrote to Catholic seminarians stressing the need to learn about different religions, which won him applause from Hindu religious leaders. The need for a basic introduction to the great religions is as important as knowing various Christian denominations, he wrote.         
	Fr Christopher Lobo, a CBCI representative, said: The Church has always had great regard for Hindu religion. But it is true that the Vatican has been taking a great deal of interest in Hindu culture of late. All these are expected to nurture a stronger bond between Hindus and Christians.

	Ranchi, July 5: Jamshedpur and its fringe areas will have an integrated solid waste management system, while Dhanbad can expect to see computerisation of basic services at its corporation with Governor MOH Farook clearing two JNNURM projects at a high-level meeting today.        
	The ambitious Rs 41.22 crore project for Jamshedpur, under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, would cover smaller civic bodies of Mango, Adityapur and Jugsalai, while the area under Tata Steel, within the Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC), would also be integrated into it to utilise services being provided there by Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company (Jusco).        
	The e-governance proposal worth Rs 23.96 crore for the newly formed Dhanbad Municipal Corporation plans to speed up delivery of day-to-day services like issuing birth and death certificates, payment of holding tax, registration and redressal of complaints.        
	Todays approval at a high-level steering committee meeting held at Project Building paves the way for the state to approach the Union urban development ministry to sanction 50 per cent of the Jamshedpur project costs, which works out to Rs 20.61 crore.        
	The state would have to bear 20 per cent, while the urban local bodies need to arrange the remaining 30 per cent for the first of its kind solid waste management project to be executed in Jharkhand that promises scientific solutions to all aspects  i,e., collection, transportation and disposal.        
	 The meeting, chaired for the first time by Farook, was attended by adviser V.S. Dubey, chief secretary A.K. Singh, development commissioner S.K. Choudhary, finance secretary Sukhdev Singh, urban development secretary P.K. Jojoria and others.        
	According to a Raj Bhavan press communiqu, the governor issued a directive to all departments to speed up the execution of all JNNURM projects set to expire by 2012.

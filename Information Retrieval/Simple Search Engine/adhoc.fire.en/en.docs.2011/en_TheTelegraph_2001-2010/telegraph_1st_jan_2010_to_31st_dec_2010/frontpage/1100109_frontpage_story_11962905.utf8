The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wanted: A chair for a room
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Wanted: A chair for a room
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Advani (right) greets Vajpayee on the latters birthday at his residence in December. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: One chair gave L.K. Advani and his party elbow room; another may give him a room.        
	The BJP is considering designating Advani the working chairman of the National Democratic Alliance with the mainly logistical motive of finding him an office at Parliament House.        
	If he gets the post, of course, Advani can convene and preside over NDA meetings when the House is in session.        
	Advani lost his room after stepping down as leader of the Lok Sabha Opposition, following which his party gave him his first chairmanship  of the BJP parliamentary party.        
	That post, devoid of constitutional authority, was meant to spare the veteran leader a ride into the sunset and ensure he continued to play a role in the evolution of the partys parliamentary strategies.        
	Its likely that if Advani is made working NDA chairperson, he will function from a room carrying the nameplate of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.        
	Vajpayee continues to be NDA chairperson despite not being an MP, but cannot function as one because of age and illness. The spacious office allotted to him is never used by anybody given the hallowed position the BJPs only Prime Minister enjoys in the party and the Sangh parivar.        
	So (since Vajpayee is ill) we are thinking of making Advani the working chairman. By Gods grace, Atalji will be with us for several years. As long as he is around, his nameplate will not be touched, a key BJP decision-maker said.        
	The leader added that Vajpayee would be sounded out first, and then the NDA allies.        
	Janata Dal (United) leader and NDA convener Sharad Yadav said: Nobody has sought our opinion so far. Its an internal matter of the BJP. If there is need for a change, I imagine we will be consulted.        
	He refused comment on whether he would accept Advani as working chairman.        
	Sources said when the Jharkhand poll campaign was on, Sushma Swaraj and Rajnath Singh had casually told Dal (United) leaders about the proposal, but they had been non-committal.        
	Advani was initially reluctant to accept an NDA-related post for fear it might trigger the usual speculation about his equations with Vajpayee, sources said.        
	At first, the BJP wanted the acting chairman nomenclature. But some leaders apparently felt the designation gave the impression that Vajpayees term was over and that it was just a matter of time before Advani took over officially.

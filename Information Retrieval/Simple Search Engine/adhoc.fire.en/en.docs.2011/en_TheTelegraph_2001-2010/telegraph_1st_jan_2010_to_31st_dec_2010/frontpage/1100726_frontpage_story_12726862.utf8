The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chatterjee churn in CPM
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Chatterjee churn in CPM
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	New Delhi, July 25:The memories of the misadventure of 2008 have returned to torment Prakash Karat, gift timely ammunition to the Bengal CPM and afford Manmohan Singh a chance to suppress a chuckle as he heads to what looks like a stormy monsoon session.        
	The countdown to the release of the memoirs of Somnath Chatterjee, who was expelled from the CPM for refusing to toe Karats line and quit as Speaker of the Lok Sabha, is set to intensify the clash between the Bengal unit and the central party leaders ahead of an extended central committee meeting in Vijayawada.         
	The southern meeting from August 7 to 10, where the strategies for the Assembly polls in Bengal and Kerala are to be finalised, will precede the August 21 release of Chatterjees book by the Prime Minister. But leaks and the former Speakers confirmation of some of the contents have ensured that the pot will now start boiling.        
	Chatterjee today confirmed that his book referred to controversial decisions taken by Karat and his arrogance, the disquiet over which burst through the iron curtain when the then Speaker defied the party boss.        
	Asked why he considered the CPM general secretary arrogant, Chatterjee told The Telegraph: What else can I say? I was expelled from the party without a notice. How is that possible? Thats why I have talked about Karats arrogance in my memoirs.        
	Chatterjee also stood by an assertion that the late Jyoti Basu had advised him against stepping down before the confidence vote in the Lok Sabha, which was necessitated by the CPMs withdrawal of support to the Congress-led UPA I.        
	Jyotibabu wanted me to preside over the confidence motion as I was the Lok Sabha Speaker. I had conveyed to (Sitaram) Yechury what Jyotibabu had told me. So, I am not going back on that. I have written in my book, Memoirs of a Parliamentarian, about my 40-year experience in parliamentary politics and the happenings during my political career, Chatterjee said.        
	Sources said the disclosures had already unsettled the party with divisions re-emerging between AKG Bhavan, the CPM headquarters in Delhi, and Alimuddin Street, where the Bengal party office is located.        
	The central leadership wanted the Bengal unit to issue a rejoinder to Chatterjees claim that Basu had asked him not to resign as Speaker. But the state unit, which holds Karats aggressive anti-Congressism largely responsible for uniting the Opposition at heavy cost to the Left, is learnt to have resisted the pressure.        
	Later in the day, an effort was made to issue a statement from the central leadership on behalf of the state party but it was dropped. The CPM now plans to come up with a detailed response after the book is released.        
	Karat, who ironically was in Calcutta over the weekend for a party meeting, said this evening: I am not reacting, my party will respond.        
	But some Bengal leaders were hardly able to hide their glee at Karats discomfiture. A state secretariat member said: The Bengal line is to go soft on the Congress in order to drive a wedge between it and Trinamul. Somnathda didnt want the withdrawal of support to UPA I. The withdrawal united the Congress and Trinamul and that led to our poll reverses. So, his remarks vindicate our stand.        
	But politburo member M.K. Pandhe, who was one of the five members at the politburo meeting that decided to expel Chatterjee, put up a spirited defence of Karat.        
	He denied Chatterjees claim that the decision to expel him was not unanimous and that Basu had asked him not to resign. Jyoti Basu had never defied the party in his life. How can he ask Somnath to defy the party? Pandhe told The Telegraph.        
	Pandhe denied that he was against Chatterjees expulsion. It is baseless. I was very much with the party decision, he said.         
	The Citu leader suggested that the CPM would seize on the Prime Minister releasing the book to question Chatterjees political ambitions. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will release the book. This clearly shows Somnath Chatterjees political realignment, Pandhe said.        
	But Chatterjee said: I am actually and officially retired. Moreover, I am not interested in politics any more, particularly because of my age.                    WITH INPUTS FROM ANINDYA SENGUPTA AND J.P. YADAV

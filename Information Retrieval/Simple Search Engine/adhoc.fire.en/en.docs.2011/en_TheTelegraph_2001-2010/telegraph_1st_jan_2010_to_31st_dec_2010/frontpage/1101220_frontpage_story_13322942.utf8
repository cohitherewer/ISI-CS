	Jamshedpur, Dec. 19: No celebrity visits or satellite banking system? Never mind, bring on suppat.         
	Unlike Doba, three other villages of Lohardaga district may not have been lucky enough to get Reserve Bank of Indias smart card based satellite-banking system. But they have a suppat surprise up their sleeves.         
	Suppat or super in tribal dialect, is also the name of a rural chain of mom-and-pop stores initiated by a private party, Dynamic Tarang Pvt Ltd, and Lohardaga Gram Swarajya Sansthan, which is heralding a quiet rural retail revolution.         
	Take 25-year-old Taramoni Oraon of Harmu village in Lohardaga, for instance. The rural homemaker is now Suppat didi, thanks to the Sheetal Suppat Stores in her village. She manufactures certain products, sells a lot more over the counter and manages the store.         
	Using the corporate wisdom that growth lies at the bottom of the pyramid as the springboard, the initiative  now some days and three stores old  attempts to start production and retail units in 100 villages in Lohardaga through womens self-help groups, with women as wealth-creators and store managers.         
	As a pilot project, three Sheetal Suppat Stores have been inaugurated at villages Malangtuli, Chalo Mahuari and Harmu, between November 22 and December 8.                           
	Initially, villagers had to travel around 3km to the town to get necessary items of daily use. But since December 8, when our store started, villagers come to us instead of spending money on commuting. We women have a chance to earn well too, said Taramoni.         
	Stores will stock grocery items, toiletries and snacks. A three-tier management system, comprising a consumer services division, a district supply unit and Suppat Stores will manage logistics and community mobilisation. One store will cater to 250 households or a population between 1,000 and 1,500, while the profit-sharing ratio between the self-help group and Dynamic Tarang is pegged at 52:48.         
	The two-way supply chain will cater to both rural and urban buyers. Products like tamarind and lac are rural produce, but consumed mainly in cities, while toothpaste and biscuits are manufactured in cities but consumed by villagers also. But both populations consume rural produce such as flour, turmeric and ginger.         
	The Suppat Stores have increased rural employment based on local skill and interest. Surveys on consumer behaviour and community preparedness survey have been done in villages to gauge market potential. The second survey was supported by Nabard, said Manish Kumar, Dynamic Tarang chairman-cum-managing director, adding that the firm has also approached Nabard, Jharkhand, to extend the rural retail project.         
	The project design is excellent and a unique opportunity to increase rural employment. The funding budget is around Rs 1 crore. I have sent details to my head office and they are under consideration, said Nabard (Jharkhand) general manager M.V. Ashok.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Preity meets BCCI bosses on stakes
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Actress Preity Zinta at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, May 2: Kings XI Punjab is ready for a huge stake sale with all promoters  except Preity Zinta  looking for a complete exit.        
	Preity and co-promoter Mohit Burman visited the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai today to discuss sale-related details, a source in the cricket board said.        
	The source said a working committee meeting was on, so the actress and the Dabur scion had to wait for a while before they could meet two top BCCI functionaries.         
	A BCCI working committee meeting was on when Preity and Mohit Burman visited two of our senior office-bearers to keep them posted on the changes in shareholding of Kings XI Punjab that may ensue after the franchise sale, a BCCI working committee member said.        
	The Punjab team has been scouting for buyers for some time. Bought at a price of $76 million (roughly Rs 350 crore) the teams promoters  Ness Wadia, Preity, Karan Paul and Burman  are reportedly looking at a sale price of nearly Rs 1,000 crore despite suffering a loss of Rs 70 crore so far.        
	A significant portion of stakes owned by the original promoters is up for sale. Ness Wadia and Karan Paul are looking at a complete exit from the franchise while the Burmans may be significantly paring their holdings or contemplating an exit depending on how this IPL controversy ends, a team source said.        
	Burmans brother Gaurav  suspended IPL commissioner Lalit Modis stepson-in law  is also a stakeholder in the Punjab team.         
	Preity will hive off two-thirds of her stake. After the sale, she and the new buyer will emerge as the majority stake-holders, the teamsource added.        
	The source said Preity would keep at least one-third of her 22 per cent stake in the franchise.        
	Mohit Burman, however, described his visit to the BCCI headquarters as a courtesy call.        
	There is no stake-sale right now. When there is one, we will announce it. Investment bankers keep getting in touch with us for all these things all the time. There is nothing to talk about yet, he told The Telegraph.        
	A team official said a UK-based sports retail company and a Malaysia-based energy major were on the final shortlist of buyers. The UK company has a cricket accessories retail business which it expects to leverage through its IPL association.        
	Sundays hour-long BCCI working committee meeting was dominated by discussions on the charges levelled by the board against Modi.        
	The members agreed with the charges. (Board president) Shashank Manohar laid the entire case threadbare before the working committee. Many other issues, including questions on IPL expenditure, were raised by CAB boss Jagmohan Dalmiya, the board source said.        
	Modi is expected to file his reply to the boards charges against him within a week.

  - City office in place,   classes to begin in Dec.        AMIT GUPTA                                                       
	Ranchi, Oct. 25: After initial hiccups typically Jharkhand, the National University for Study and Research in Law has finally dropped anchor in the state capital, getting things in order aggressively to recruit students and faculty to begin classes from December 15.        
	The start, albeit low-key, was witnessed last week when the law university, the 14th in the country, opened its city office here near Jharkhand High Court.         
	Operating out of the three-room quarters situated opposite Central School in Doranda was a noble start, felt vice-chancellor Autar Krishen Koul (67), a name of national and international repute in legal studies fraternity.         
	The university will admit 50 students for the first batch for a five-year integrated law course slated to start from mid December, a month latter than the proposed deadline of November 15 arrived at after the initial schedule of June-July couldnt be met.        
	Classes will be held at a building at BIT, Mesra, which will ultimately host the law university once construction of a separate wing on land inside the campus is complete.        
	Its a sort of take-off for us after much waiting. Courses will start from December 15. We will admit only 50 students in the first batch, given the facilities at the temporary building at BIT, Mesra, premises, Koul told The Telegraph.        
	As for faculty, the university has appointed Alok Gupta, an MA and PhD with LLB and LLM degrees with considerable experience in teaching law and political science. The university is expected to advertise posts of six to eight other faculty members who would be inducted soon.        
	The state government has appointed Ajit Kumar as officer on special duty. Besides, two personal assistants have also been appointed for the university secretariat which was officially inaugurated in April by former chief justice of Jharkhand High Court Gyan Sudha Misra.         
	Out of 50 students, 25 would be from Jharkhand, the vice-chancellor confirmed. We have written to authorities to provide us with a list of 200 students as per the merit list  those who took the combined legal aptitude test (CLAT) but could not qualify in any other national law university, he said.        
	Koul, who joined as vice-chancellor last month after returning to India from the US where he was on a teaching assignment, said construction (of a permanent campus) on the land provided by BIT, Mesra, would start soon. Funds will not be a problem, he added.        
	Koul, who had earlier expressed his displeasure at the slow pace of work in Jharkhand to get the project off the ground, had a few words of advice for the present government.         
	I am an aggressive person and want the things done in a professional and fast manner. Slow motion frustrates me and the government and people of the state should really pull up their socks to better things here, said Koul, who was earlier vice-chancellor of a similar institute in Jodhpur (Rajasthan).

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Midnapore, Dec. 26: A mob of 500 village women today prised from the joint forces grasp two men detained in the Maoist zone, retaliating with bamboo sticks to a baton charge.        
	The 6.30am skirmish in West Midnapores Pukuria village, about 5km from Jhargram town, showcased the Maoist policy of pressing women into battle with police, though this is the first time the women have dared a joint forces team.        
	We were forced to give up the two detained men as we were outnumbered (there were about 150 personnel) and had to show restraint by not using our guns, additional superintendent of police (operations) Mukesh Kumar said.        
	In the afternoon, the women won another small victory, police sources said. About 1,000 women from the Nari Izzat Bachao Committee, affiliated to the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, marched to Jhargram police station and got officers to promise to leave the two freed men alone in future.        
	During the morning battle, the sticks and stones of a 600-strong mob, which included 100 men, had left three policemen and three women constables injured. Three male villagers and nine women too were hurt and one of them, Hanshi Mahato, was admitted to hospital with head injuries.        
	The joint forces raid, however, had led to the seizure of five powerful landmines in the jungles near Panchami, a village neighbouring Pukuria, about 35-40km from Lalgarh town.        
	They were packed with 60kg of explosives, enough to blow up tanks, let alone anti-landmine vehicles. Around 50kg of raw explosives too were found, Kumar said, adding that the quantity indicated that Maoists were behind the stash.        
	Yesterday, a Maoist landmine blast had killed a jawan of the elite force Cobra force in Purulia.        
	The Jhargram police had launched todays pre-dawn raid along with personnel from Jamboni police station and the central paramilitary on a tip-off. While returning on foot with their haul, they picked up Barsha Hansda, 35, and Gorachand Hansda, 32, near Panchami.        
	The news spread fast and a stick-wielding mob from Panchami and Pukuria gathered on the road to Jhargram and stopped the personnel, claiming the two detained men were innocent.        
	The verbal duel led to a scuffle, stone-throwing and then a battle of batons against bamboo before the police team was forced to release their captives.        
	When the women marchers approached the police station in the afternoon, a large force barricaded the road. After bouts of demonstrations, five villagers were allowed in to meet officers. An understanding was reached and the protesters left around 3pm.        
	Barsha later said he had gone to the fields to relieve himself when the forces grabbed him. I have no idea where the explosives came from, he said.        
	Mobs of women had earlier snatched detainees from the police in Dohijuri and Kolaboni in Lalgarh, but that was before the areas recapture by the joint forces 18 months ago, police sources said. One of the triggers for the Lalgarh agitation was the polices alleged atrocities on women, and the Nari Izzat Bachao Committee was a fallout.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cong speaks, riddle lingers
  - Party breathes easy on Rajiv, pressure mounts on Arjun          SANJAY K. JHA AND RASHEED KIDWAI                                                     
	June 10: Congress leaders have started speaking out on former Union Carbide chief Warren Andersons flight from India, a signal that the party has finished its homework and is more or less certain that the trail will not lead directly to the late Rajiv Gandhi.        
	But party leaders do not rule out the complicity of some elements in the then central government and the then Madhya Pradesh government headed by Arjun Singh.         
	Pressure is mounting on Arjun, who was Madhya Pradesh chief minister when the Bhopal gas tragedy occurred, to reveal the identity of the person who requested him from Delhi over the phone to ensure the release of Anderson in 1984.        
	Arjun had called on Sonia Gandhi on Monday evening, the day a Bhopal court delivered the two-year jail sentence that triggered the current uproar. Arjun apparently narrated his side of the story to Sonia.        
	BJP leader and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan directly appealed to Arjun through a letter to come clean and tell the nation who influenced him to let Anderson escape. Seventy-two hours have passed and all citizens of the state want to know the truth from you.                                       
	Chauhan also said he would consider setting up a state-level commission to get to the bottom of the issue.        
	As details surfaced of how Anderson was virtually escorted out of India on a government aircraft, the Congress remained mostly silent for two days as nobody wanted to run the risk of making any comment because the then central government was headed by Rajiv Gandhi.        
	But AICC media cell chief Janardan Dwivedi today said every question should be answered and accountability be fixed. Congress sources later said the party would not have spoken up and sought answers to the uncomfortable questions without ascertaining the facts and getting fully assured that Rajiv Gandhi could not be put in the line of fire. Dwivedi, despite being the chief spokesperson, rarely speaks without clearance from the top. His emphatic assertion initially puzzled many senior leaders who presumed this kind of posturing might bring the heat on the Nehru-Gandhi family.        
	An overnight text message from Digvijay Singh in which he suggested that Anderson could have been allowed to leave under US pressure added to the confusion. But other sources pointed out that the full text message in response to a journalists question  I dont know as I was not in Bhopal at the time of gas leak. It could be under US pressure but I am not aware of the facts  suggested that Digvijays primary objective was to protect himself rather than implicate someone else.         
	Digvijay, who held the irrigation portfolio in the Arjun cabinet in 1984, was Madhya Pradesh chief minister in 1996 when the Supreme Court dropped the culpable homicide charge against the accused Indians. Complaints had arisen then that the state government did little to get the charge restored.        
	Digvijays remark prompted another AICC general secretary, Satyavrat Chaturvedi, to throw a protective ring around the central leadership. I think all the decisions were taken by the state government and there was no involvement of the Centre, said Chaturvedi, who hails from the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh and is known to oppose both Arjun and Digvijay in their home state.         
	Later in the day, other Congress leaders like Ambika Soni and Vasant Sathe spoke out in a clear indication that the green signal had come from the top. Most of these statements were primarily aimed at addressing insinuations that the Congress had a lot to hide. The high command thinks the damage has already been done and the better option is to get over with the controversy by fixing accountability once and for all.         
	The heat now seems to be piling on Arjun, who has fallen foul of the leadership since the last Lok Sabha polls. Who else than Arjun Singh needs to explain? The state government arrested him (Anderson), released him after managing the bail and lifted him out of Bhopal in the state plane. Why are you bringing Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress party into this? a senior leader asked.        
	But another Congress leader conceded that a chief minister alone could not manage such an operation without the active involvement of very influential persons at the Centre, although he contested suggestions that it had to be the Prime Minister.        
	A senior leader who is also a minister in the Manmohan Singh government said: Rajivji had just become the Prime Minister and he had not become a major player in the corridors of power by then. The Americans must have had many established channels of communication at that time. They could have activated those channels instead of talking to a Prime Minister they hardly knew. Rajiv Gandhi was not only the Prime Minister at that time but had also kept the external affairs portfolio, persisting with the arrangement that existed when Indira Gandhi was assassinated.        
	His ministers of state in the foreign ministry at that time were the late Ram Niwas Mirdha and Abubakar Abdul Rahim. Rajiv gave up the foreign ministry in September 1985, bringing in Baliram Bhagat.        
	Vasant Sathe, the information and broadcasting minister at that time, said today: Collusion between the Madhya Pradesh government and some people in the Centre had allowed Anderson to escape.        
	Asked to identify the person at the Centre, Sathe said he could not make a guess but only Arjun could answer the question.        
	Rajiv Gandhis team then included Arun Nehru and Arun Singh but both have not shed any light on the allegation that someone important had phoned Arjun to ensure the release of Anderson.        
	The question now doing the rounds is whether Arjun, ailing and in political wilderness, will respond to Chauhan or use the opportunity to get back a toehold in the party.

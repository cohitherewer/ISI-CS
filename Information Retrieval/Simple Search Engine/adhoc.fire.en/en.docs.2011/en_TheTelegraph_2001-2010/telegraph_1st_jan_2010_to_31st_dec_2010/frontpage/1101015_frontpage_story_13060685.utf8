	New Delhi, Oct. 14: The presence of the most powerful woman and man in the country could not turn the tide in favour of the Indian mens hockey team which lost to Australia 0-8.        
	However, as the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi watched the hockey team settle for silver, Manmohan Singhs wife Gursharan Kaur chose wisely and turned up for the womens badminton events in which Saina Nehwal won the singles gold, while Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa picked up the doubles gold.        
	Gursharan is not alone. Sociologists too are betting on the legion of Indian girls who shone at the Commonwealth Games to generate a long-lasting ripple effect across sections of society, touching domains outside of sports.        
	The riveting images of the women and girls beaming, tightly clutching medals and savouring the adulation could turn them into agents of change.        
	I think these Games will have some unintentional but positive consequences, said Rajesh Gill, chairperson of the Centre for Womens Studies at Panjab University, Chandigarh.        
	These medals are reinforcing the message that parents can take pride in their daughters. Thats something very significant for India, she said.         
	Over the past 11 days, Indian women have bagged medals in archery, badminton, the discus, the 400x4m relay, shooting and wrestling.        
	Some of these winners are from small towns and low or middle-income households. Archery gold winner Deepika Mahatos father drives an auto-rickshaw in Ranchi while the father of Prajusha Maliakaal, who took the long jump silver, is a cook. Kavita Raut, who grabbed a bronze in the 10,000m run, once used to fetch water from a river in her village in Maharashtra.              
	It would have been a long, difficult struggle for such girls to defy traditional pressures and take up sports, Gill said. But having taken that path, to come out victorious would be much more important to such girls than it would be for Indian men in sports. After fighting social norms, women would be likely to struggle extra hard to secure respectability for themselves, Gill told The Telegraph.         
	A veteran sports medicine specialist who has observed Indian men and women playing in international tournaments since the 1980s said the women appear willing to put in extra effort.        
	Theyre more sincere during their training periods they appear willing to take up greater training load, said Ashok Ahuja, former head of sports medicine at the National Institute of Sports, Patiala. They deliver sustained efforts lasting years  sometimes longer than men, he said.         
	But, according to Ahuja, the recent trend of exposing both men and women from India to even the smaller international tournaments may also have contributed to the tally of medals.        
	In a nation where female foeticide is rampant, where girls are encouraged to take up certain career options but discouraged from others, where the pursuit of sport for girls is still a struggle, such medals turn into strong symbols of change, the sociologists said.        
	Medals mean pride and prestige  not just for their families but for the nation. This may change peoples perceptions of what women can achieve, said Medha Nanivadekar, director of the Centre for Womens Studies at Shivaji University in Kolhapur, Maharashtra.        
	The medals, Nanivadekar said, will accelerate and expand a process that began in India decades ago in other fields. We have had women role models in the film industry, in police, in medicine, in politics. These medals may now stir parents into encouraging their daughters to take up sports.

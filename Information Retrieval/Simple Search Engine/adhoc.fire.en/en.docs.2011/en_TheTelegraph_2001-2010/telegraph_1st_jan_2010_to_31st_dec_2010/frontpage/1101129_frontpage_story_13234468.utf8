  - Hindu group campaigns to highlight debt to faith          PAUL VITELLO                            Who owns yoga?                                        
	New York, Nov. 28: Yoga is practised by about 15 million people in the US, for reasons almost as numerous  from the physical benefits mapped in brain scans to the less tangible rewards that new age journals call spiritual centring. Religion, for the most part, has nothing to do with it.         
	But a group of Indian-Americans has ignited a surprisingly fierce debate in the gentle world of yoga by mounting a campaign to acquaint Westerners with the faith that it says underlies every single yoga style followed in gyms, ashrams and spas: Hinduism.         
	The campaign, labelled Take Back Yoga, does not ask yoga devotees to become Hindu, or instructors to teach more about Hinduism. The small but increasingly influential group behind it, the Hindu American Foundation, suggests only that people become more aware of yogas debt to the faiths ancient traditions.         
	That suggestion, modest though it may seem, has drawn a flurry of strong reactions. Deepak Chopra, the new age writer, has dismissed the campaign as a jumble of faulty history and Hindu nationalism.         
	The question at the core of the debate  who owns yoga?  has become an enduring topic of chatter in yoga web forums, Hindu American newspapers and journals catering to the many consumers of what is now a multibillion-dollar yoga industry.         
	Organisers of the Take Back Yoga effort point out that the philosophy of yoga was first described in Hinduisms seminal texts and remains at the core of Hindu teachings. Yet, because the religion has been stereotyped in the West as a polytheistic faith of castes, cows and curry, they say, most Americans prefer to see yoga as the legacy of a more timeless, spiritual Indian wisdom.         
	In a way, said Aseem Shukla, the foundations co-founder, our issue is that yoga has thrived, but Hinduism has lost control of the brand.         
	For many practitioners, including Debbie Desmond, 27, a yoga instructor in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the talk of branding and ownership is bewildering. Nobody owns yoga, she said, sitting cross-legged in her studio, Namaste Yoga. Yoga is not a religion. It is a way of life. We were taught that the roots of yoga go back further than Hinduism itself.         
	The effort to take back yoga began quietly enough, with a scholarly essay posted in January on the website of the Hindu American Foundation, a Minneapolis-based group that promotes human rights for Hindu minorities worldwide. The essay lamented a perceived snub in modern yoga culture, saying that yoga magazines and studios had assiduously decoupled the practice from the Hinduism that gave forth this immense contribution to humanity.        
	Shukla put a sharper point on his case a few months later in a column on the On Faith blog of The Washington Post. Hinduism, he wrote, had become a victim of overt intellectual property theft, made possible by generations of Hindu yoga teachers who had offered up a religions spiritual wealth at the altar of crass commercialism.        
	We started this, really, for our kids, said Shukla, a urologist and a second-generation Indian-American. When our kids go to school and say they are Hindu, nobody says, Oh, yeah, Hindus gave the world yoga. They say, What caste are you? or Do you pray to a monkey god? Because thats all Americans know about Hinduism.

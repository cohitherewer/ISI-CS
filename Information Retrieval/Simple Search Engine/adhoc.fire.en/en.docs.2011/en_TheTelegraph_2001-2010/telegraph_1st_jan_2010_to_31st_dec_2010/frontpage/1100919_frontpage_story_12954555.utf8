  - AASU clamps economic blockade on nagaland          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Nagaon/Jorhat, Sept. 18: Normal life came to a grinding halt following the 12-hour Golaghat bandh called by the Brihattar Asomia Yuba Mancha from 5am today in protest against the caning of school students by Nagaland armed police for blocking the highway.        
	Golaghat superintendent of police Madan Chetia said the bandh passed off peacefully. The AGP, too, called a 12-hour bandh in protest against the lathicharge on the students on Wednesday.         
	Road communication between Upper and lower Assam remained suspended today. Long-distance buses and trucks plying on National Highway 37, which connects Upper and lower Assam, remained off the road during the day. The stretch between Rangamati to Bagori, about 80km, passes through Golaghat district. Shops, financial and educational institutions remained closed.        
	The All Assam Students Union (AASU) today started its economic blockade against neighbouring Nagaland from 3pm, demanding the handing over of the accused officials of Nagaland armed police to Assam.        
	More than 300 AASU supporters gathered at Rangajan and Merapani this afternoon to stop plying of goods vehicles to the neighbouring state through National Highway 39.        
	We want justice. The accused officials must be handed over to the Assam government and punished according to the law of the land. They must apologise for the misdeed. Our blockade will be lifted only after that, said Golaghat AASU unit president Raju Phukan.        
	The AASU activists blocked Dhodar Ali at Mariani and Titabor in Jorhat district to prevent plying of vehicles to and from Nagaland. Nearly 100 AASU activists blocked Dhodar Ali in front of Gomti Devi Girls High School near Titabor Tiniali in Jorhat district since 8am. Two Nagaland forest department vehicles coming from Dimapur were sent back by the protesting students. A police patrol was on standby to keep a watch on the situation.         
	Similarly, since 11am, over 80 AASU activists blocked the Mariani-Mokokchung road near the Nagaland State Transport Corporation office at Mariani. Trucks carrying commodities to the neighbouring state were stopped. AASU general secretary (Jorhat district unit) Dhruba Jyoti Hazarika told The Telegraph that the students would continue the blockade until the culprits responsible for the brutal attack on the students were brought to book.         
	AASUs Golaghat unit general secretary Ranjit Bora said, On Thursday, deputy commissioner H.N. Bora assured us that he would call an immediate joint sitting with his Dimapur counterpart. But till now it remains an unsettled matter. We request him to consider the matter very seriously.        
	Principal secretary (labour and employment) K.K. Mittal reached Golaghat today to inquire into the matter. Chief minister Tarun Gogoi had ordered a probe into the incident.         
	After an hourlong conclave with senior Golaghat administration officials at the circuit house, Mittal visited the site where the students were lathicharged. He later talked to representatives of local organisations.        
	The Golaghat deputy commissioner said a chief secretary-level discussion on the issue was being held in New Delhi.        
	Of the three seriously injured students who were shifted to Jorhat, Karabi Bhuyanand Jayanti Gogoi returned home this evening. Lotamoni Bhuyan is still in Jorhat Medical College.        
	In a separate development, the organising secretary of the Golaghat unit of the Yuva Parishad, the youth wing of the AGP, Ritu Moni Das, was injured following an altercation with the business community at Merapani in Golaghat district. Das, along with other Yuva Parishad activists, had gone to enforce the bandh called by the AGP today.

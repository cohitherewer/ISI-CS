  - Tax slab changes to help middle and higher-income groups; incentive for infrastructure bonds           SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 26: If you count yourself an aam aadmi  that indefinable entity to whom Pranab Mukherjee dedicated his budget today  you need to earn more than Rs 3 lakh a year to benefit from his income tax slab changes.        
	Those who earn Rs 8 lakh or more a year stand to gain the maximum  they can save Rs 51,500 in the new financial year. (See chart)        
	In the budget proposals for the 2010-11 financial year, Mukherjee increased the income slabs for different tax brackets without increasing the basic exemption limit on annual income.         
	The upper limit of annual income for the 10 per cent tax bracket has been raised to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 3 lakh. For the 20 per cent tax bracket, the ceiling on income has been lifted to Rs 8 lakh from Rs 5 lakh.         
	This means that there will be no tax benefit for people earning Rs 3 lakh a year or less.         
	 Reductions in tax corresponding to different income slabs are, however, the same across all categories of taxpayers: men below 65 years of age, senior citizens and women below 65 years.        
	While savings can be made in tax outgo because of the change in income slabs for different tax brackets, the finance minister has also widened the scope of deduction a taxpayer can claim by investing in specified instruments. The infrastructure bonds notified by the Government of India will qualify as tax-saving investments.         
	The budget proposes that taxpayers can avail themselves of an additional deduction of Rs 20,000 by investing in these infrastructure bonds on top of the Rs 1-lakh limit set under Section 80C.         
	Till now, a person with an annual income of Rs 10 lakh could save Rs 30,900 on tax by making use of the deduction benefit of Rs 1 lakh under Section 80C. In the next financial year, the tax will reduce by a further Rs 57,680 if the person takes the benefit of the enhanced limit of Rs 120,000 under Section 80C.        
	Expectations were high in the run-up to the budget that the finance minister would raise the threshold above which income tax would apply. Many were expecting the floor to be raised to at least Rs 2,00,000 from Rs 1,60,000. But Mukherjee kept the basic exemption limit at the same level as the current financial year.         
	He may raise the level next year when the proposed direct tax code will be implemented. The draft direct tax code had suggested a 10 per cent tax on annual income up to Rs 10 lakh. Hence, the change in the income slabs for the different tax brackets in this budget could be viewed as a step in that direction.

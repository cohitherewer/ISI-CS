The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP salivates at Soren bait

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, April 29: A vengeful BJP has taken the unusual step of putting on hold its withdrawal of support to the Jharkhand government, the rethink following a promise by chief minister Shibu Sorens son to hand over the reins to the national party.        
	The uncertainty is not over but if the BJP decides to swallow the betrayal of Soren in the Lok Sabha and the humiliation of having to revoke its own parliamentary boards decision, the four-month-old alliance government in Jharkhand may yet survive.        
	In a letter sent to former BJP chief Rajnath Singh, Sorens son Hemant pleaded with him not to break the alliance as his father was ready to step down for voting against the NDA on the cut motion in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.        
	Following the entreaty, the BJP directed its Jharkhand leaders to put off their appointment with the governor. The meeting with the governor, originally scheduled this morning to formally convey the decision to withdraw support to the state government, was put off more than once during the day as BJP leaders in Delhi conferred among themselves and with the state units.        
	However, with the terms of a deal yet to be firmed up, the BJP is moving cautiously. A source close to Rajnath said the party leaders would insist on a promissory note from Soren stating he would accept a BJP chief minister, pledge allegiance afresh to the NDA and apologise for his act of betrayal.        
	The BJP leaders have also asked the Jharkhand unit to brief them on the mood in the JMM after reports of an impending revolt against the second dalliance with the BJP.        
	A late-evening meeting of BJP president Nitin Gadkari, Lok Sabha Opposition leader Sushma Swaraj and Rajnath decided that if Soren delivered on the expected promises either tonight or by Friday morning, their parliamentary board would meet to reverse the decision to withdraw support.        
	Their sense was that the Jharkhand government must be saved but on their conditions, a source said.        
	On Wednesday night, Soren wrote a quasi-apology to Sushma, claiming he mistakenly voted against the NDA because of an illness.        
	The missive did not move the BJP leaders as he hadnt said anything about forfeiting chief ministership. Hemants more attractive offer of relinquishing the claim to the top post prompted the rethink.        
	Hemants olive branch prompted cheerleaders of at least two Lok Sabha MPs  Yashwant Sinha and Arjun Munda  to project them as chief ministerial candidates.        
	 Some sources said deputy chief minister Raghubar Das was the likely choice but a factor working against him was he was from a backward caste and not a tribal.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Uma Bharti watches TV in Bhopal on Thursday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Television channels across languages today tempered their coverage of the Ayodhya verdict, patiently waiting for the court order to be available and focusing on panel discussions in deference to appeals from the government and the mood in favour of peace.        
	If voices from the street were not reflected through the studios, it was because most channel managers were walking the tightrope, trying to decide what news would be palatable  not only to the public at large but also to the government. But journalists are also wondering whether self- censorship  as one editor put it  serves a good purpose in the long run.        
	STAR News, NDTV, CNN-IBN, Aaj Tak, Sahara and even India TV intermittently put out appeals for peace that tugged at heartstrings or showcased  as in one case  the diversity of beliefs by drawing religious leaders from all faiths into the studio.        
	Anchors Arnab Goswami (Times Now), Rajdeep Sardesai and Sagarika Ghose (CNN-IBN) and Barkha Dutt (NDTV) repeatedly told viewers that they would wait till the courts order was available. They even interrupted reporters who risked anticipating what the verdict might contain.        
	This was in sharp contrast to the mood in the media and among some journalists in Uttar Pradesh in the early 1990s and in Gujarat in 2002 after the Godhra train attack.         
	In Uttar Pradesh then, Hindi papers had exaggerated the toll in rioting  in Gonda for example, they reported 50 had been killed when actually one mans body had been found. In Gujarat, the regional language press cried blue murder in their headlines, inciting passions and provoking violence that fed the pogrom in Narendra Modis regime.        
	A big reason for the exceptional restraint shown through today was an appeal by the News Broadcasters Association two weeks back. This was possible because the Ayodhya verdict was expected first on September 24 and the media had the time to prepare adequately.        
	The powerful and wide impact of the information disseminated by the media on formation of public opinion makes it incumbent on us in the media to take extra care in the dissemination of news and opinion relating to sensitive matters, the NBA had said.        
	All channels across the board waited not only till the verdict was delivered but also till hard copies were available before going on air.        
	But around 4pm, there was a flutter because the BJPs Ravi Shankar Prasad, also often the spokesperson for the party and a familiar face with the Delhi media, came out of Allahabad High Court and gave his impression of the verdict that was largely a reflection of the views of just one judge  Justice Dharam Veer Sharma.         
	He also insisted that the verdict had put a judicial stamp on the Ram Janmasthan, where the Babri Masjid stood.

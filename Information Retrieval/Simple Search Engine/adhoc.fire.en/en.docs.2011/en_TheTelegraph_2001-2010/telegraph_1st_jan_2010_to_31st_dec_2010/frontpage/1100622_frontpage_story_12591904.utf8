                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                State plays agony aunt to mega investors
          AMIT GUPTA                            The review meeting at Nepal House in Ranchi on Monday. (Prashant Mitra)                                  
	Ranchi, June 21: Dogged by pending clearances and perennial land issues, mega investors today poured forth their grievances to the state administration, indicating that nothing really had changed in politically unstable Jharkhand.        
	At todays review of MoUs by industry secretary A.P. Singh  a similar meeting was held on Saturday to identify and terminate proposals that hadnt taken off  as many as 18 companies, including biggies like Tata Steel, ArcelorMittal, JSW Steels and Jindal Steel amp; Power Limited (JSPL), listed reasons for failing to make a headway on proposals.        
	Among the most common gripes were pending forest clearances and land acquisition hurdles, issues the companies had cited two years ago, and failing law and order aggravated by Jharkhands unpredictable political climate.        
	We are were trying to identify the problems of each and every company. We will work towards solving them based on the merit of the investment proposals and the seriousness of the players, said Singh.         
	Little progress has been made by most investors barring JSPL which has managed to start production at its Balkudra (Patratu) plant acquired after a Jharkhand High Court-facilitated bidding process.         
	ArcelorMittal, plagued by land acquisition hurdles, has been forced to scale down its initial investment plans of over Rs 40,000 crore for a 12 MTPA plant to a 3 MTPA plant at an investment of around Rs 3,000 crore. It has, only now, managed to initiate a dialogue with villagers of Petarwar and Kasmar in Bokaro where it is scouting for land.         
	We have been allotted iron ore and coal mines. But while the forest clearance for iron ore mines is pending with the state, the coal mines clearance is pending with the Centre, said R. N. Choubey, the regional director of JSW Steels that is setting up a 10 MTPA steel unit with an investment of Rs 35,000 crore.        
	He said the iron ore lease allotted to them at Ankua in the West Singhbhum region came under reserved forest category. Hence the state must intervene for its clearance, said, conceding the company wasnt getting adequate support from the state on the question of acquiring land in Sonahatu.        
	A senior representative of Hindalco Industries, that is investing about Rs 30,000 crore for an alumina smelter plant and captive power unit, claimed that at todays meeting the state asked them to first buy private plots at their proposed site in the Sonahatu area of Ranchi district.                                             
	The state, indications were, would step in after that .        
	Awinash Prasad, the chief resident executive of Tata Steel, said all aspects of the companys expansion project _ from 5 MT to 10 MT and the 12 MT Greenfield project at the Tontoposhi area in Seraikela-Kharsawan district were discussed at todays meeting.        
	But land records arent available with the district administration which is why the company is unable to expedite the process of land acquisition at the Tontoposhi area, he said.        
	Moreover, he clarified that Tata Steel had not been allotted an iron ore mine for its Greenfield project.         
	The GM (mines) of ArcelorMittal, P.S. Prasad, said they used the opportunity to brief the state about the progress it had made on land requirements. We have been able to break the ice with villagers of Petarwar-Kasmar (Bokaro). The state promised us every help in our effort, he added.

          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                            Michelle Obama at the National Handicrafts and Handloom Museum in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: At times, even the worlds most powerful man has to blink first.        
	Michelle Obama today said the President always says sorry first after a fight at home between the US First Couple.        
	The candid comment came in response to a question from a 13-year-old.        
	If you have a fight with your husband who apologises first? Manpreet Kaur had asked Michelle.        
	I make sure he (Barack Obama) says sorry first, Michelle replied smiling.        
	A day after shaking a leg with schoolchildren in Mumbai, the US First Lady was quizzed on personal matters by 17 underprivileged girl students at the National Handicrafts and Handloom Museum in Delhi today.        
	Michelle seemed at ease as she interacted with the kids, all between 10 and 13.        
	What are your hobbies? one of the children asked her.        
	My hobbies are my children and their hobbies, she replied.         
	What is your dream? asked another.         
	My dream is to do everything possible to ensure better life for children like you, Michelle said as the girls clapped.         
	After the 30-minute session with the kids, Michelle went on a shopping spree, visiting each of the 23 stalls put up by artisans from across the country, including Bengal.         
	By the time she left, she had bought bangles, cushions, pillow covers, dupattas, a Kashmiri shawl, wooden toys, kantha bedspreads and a Gujarati yogi thaila, a cloth bag with sequins and heavy embroidery.         
	Dressed in a green skirt and black top, Michelle reached the museum at Pragati Maidan around 10.50 this morning after visiting Mahatma Gandhis memorial at Raj Ghat with her husband.        
	She picked up several items but liked a necklace and some artificial jewellery and asked me to pack it. I wanted to gift her the items but she insisted on buying them and paid me Rs 600, said Md Mustaqim.         
	Alima Khatoon, from Birbhum in Bengal, said Michelle bought two kantha bedspreads and two dupattas from her stall.         
	She paid the entire amount, Rs 30,500, for the four items. We hope that more foreigners will come to the museum after her visit, she said.         
	These craft works are lovely and are ideal gifts for Christmas, Michelle said. Before leaving, she stopped to listen to folk songs sung by a five-member team from Bengal.         
	Michelle visited the folk and art gallery, accompanied by the museums chairperson, Ruchira Ghose.         
	The first room Michelle visited was a hand-carved Rajasthani haveli. She stood for a while before a giant statue of Durga and asked Ghose what it stood for. It is the image of Durga, a powerful Hindu goddess and destroyer of evil, Ghose replied.         
	Michelle paused a while, then said with a smile: Women and power.         
	She was amazed to see a giant chariot and was all praise for it. One girl told her Obama would look good if he was put on the chariot. She smiled and walked down, Ghose said.

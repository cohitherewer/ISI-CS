          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 8: The parents of Anindyee and Ankik Dhar have sold their Salt Lake flat and moved elsewhere.        
	Shilpa Goenkas father and mother are soldiering on with an education foundation in her name.        
	Rajeev Agarwalas father, a lawyer, knows that the case faces a long haul in the courts.        
	Can my hurt ever be healed? asked Rajeevs father N.K. Agarwala at Girish Park. Rajeevs mother only sobbed.         
	It is only another piece of news for us, nothing will repair our loss, Shilpas father said in Lake Town, reacting to the arrest of the alleged mastermind of the German Bakery blast in Pune.        
	All four victims from Calcutta  siblings Ankik, 23, and Anindyee, 19, Rajeev, 23, and Shilpa, 23  were former students of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan School in Salt Lake.         
	At Jamuna Circle in Lake Town, Rajesh and Neelam Goenka have set up a trust named after their daughter to ensure education to those without means. Shilpa had studied engineering at BIT, Mesra, before joining Japanese finance firm Nomura in Mumbai.         
	The Shilpa Goenka Foundation Trust was started with the young executives savings and generous help from her parents. She loved studies. So, wed love to help anyone who wants to study but does not have the means, said Rajesh, a businessman.        
	He has not yet got either the Rs 5 lakh promised by the Maharashtra government after the tragedy or the Rs 2 lakh offered by the Centre. I dont need the money for myself. But it would have gone a long way in helping the foundation, said Rajesh.         
	He has written several letters to officials in Pune and even received assurances but the money has not been given yet.        
	Every object in the Goenkas living room is precisely placed but there are no photographs of Shilpa. All her pictures have been stashed in an almirah in what used to be her room, Neelam said.        
	Shilpa had gone to Pune on a weekend and caught up with her schoolmates. The year had begun on such a happy note. After four years, we celebrated her birthday  January 8  together, said Neelam.        
	Rajeev died four days before his 24th birthday. He was supposed to return home for his birthday, said his mother Madhu.        
	The law student died on February 21, fighting for life for over a week. We had so many plans for his birthday, said his sister Radhika.        
	Rajeevs father N.K. Agarwala spoke of the long drag across the courts that will follow. They have just been arrested. The verdict is a long way off.

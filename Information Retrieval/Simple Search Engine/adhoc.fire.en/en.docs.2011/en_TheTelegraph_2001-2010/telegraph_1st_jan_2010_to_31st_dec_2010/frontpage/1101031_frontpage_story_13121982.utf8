The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tirath plays name game 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tirath plays name game 
  - Anganwadi kids told to mark Indira death anniversary        CITHARA PAUL                            Indira Gandhi (top), Krishna Tirath                                      
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: On Sunday, children aged one to six will be dragged to anganwadis across the country and subjected to lectures on Indira Gandhis contributions  apparently to help minister Krishna Tirath keep her job.        
	The embattled women and child development minister has found a new way to express her loyalty to the family after ministers were asked this month not to name every other government scheme after the Nehru-Gandhis.        
	Tiraths ministry has asked all anganwadis to mark October 31, the day Indira was gunned down by her bodyguards in 1984, as Day Against Violence and Terrorism.        
	A communiqu to the secretaries in charge of the Integrated Child Development Schemes in the states says: It will be befitting to pay a rich tribute to the late Prime Minister on October 31st at each anganwadi centre by remembering her contribution to the cause of development of women and children.        
	Anganwadi workers expressed helplessness. What can we do but follow the order? We dont know what to tell the little ones about Indira Gandhi. What do they know about violence and terrorism? asked an anganwadi helper who did not want to be quoted as her survival depends on the babus sitting in Delhi.        
	But even a ministry babu said: This kind of circular is unprecedented. Ideally, the ministry should have organised an official function.        
	Child rights activists have dubbed the circular a ridiculous political move        
	Rakesh V. Kamath of the NGO Bachpan said: The minister is trying to prove her loyalty at the expense of the poor kids. The Congress leadership should not allow this kind of sycophancy.        
	Kamath suggested that Tirath was trying to save her berth ahead of the upcoming cabinet shuffle. The government observes (Indiras death anniversary) every year at Shakti Sthal  but that will not help you score individual points, he said.        
	Tiraths job has been hanging in the balance after a series of goof-ups and accusations of rigging Doordarshan appointments to favour her daughter. Last month, Sonia Gandhi had asked her about the delay in preparing the Prevention of Offences Against the Child Bill, 2009  a move seen as a rap.        
	Since then, Tirath has been on what many see as a sycophancy overdrive.

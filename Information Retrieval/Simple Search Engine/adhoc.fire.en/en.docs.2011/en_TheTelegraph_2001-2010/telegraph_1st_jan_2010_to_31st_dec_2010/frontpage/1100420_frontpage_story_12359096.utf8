  - Season ends with Dada buzz           PRATIM D. GUPTA                            Ganguly waves to the Eden crowd after the match on Monday. Pabitra Das                                        
	Calcutta, April 19: One question buzzed around a nearly packed Eden Gardens at tonights dead game: Would Dada feature in IPL IV?        
	And if he does, would it be for some other team given that the icon-player concept will now be history, freeing him from the need to represent the Kolkata Knight Riders?        
	Hopefully I will come back for the Knight Riders next year and give it one more shot in the next IPL, Sourav Ganguly said with a smile after the Knights nine-wicket win over the Mumbai Indians that couldnt earn them a semi-final berth.        
	Hope the Eden crowd comes back too and we will be better prepared, he added.        
	The man on whom it all depends chose to stay back in Calcutta tonight for the last league game of IPL III. Was that to make sure he witnessed the last time Sourav turned out in the Knights colours? Well know in due time.        
	Not that Shah Rukh Khan has ever wanted Dada out of his equations. He can play as long as he wants has been SRKs stance all along.        
	While midway in the tournament he had criticised the captains excuses after back-to-back losses, the Khanspeak has been: He has batted like a champion.        
	Souravs performance has obviously changed things a bit. His tally of 493 runs puts him behind only Sachin Tendulkar and Jacques Kallis at the end of the league stage.        
	His strike rate, of course, has been just about 118 every 100 balls but he has no longer looked a liability on the field, having snapped up a couple of dream catches.        
	Shah Rukh tonight took Souravs daughter Sana with him to the team dugout for the first time, the duo surprising Dada with an ovation as he walked back after a 36-ball 42.        
	For now, all seems well between the Boss and the Skip.

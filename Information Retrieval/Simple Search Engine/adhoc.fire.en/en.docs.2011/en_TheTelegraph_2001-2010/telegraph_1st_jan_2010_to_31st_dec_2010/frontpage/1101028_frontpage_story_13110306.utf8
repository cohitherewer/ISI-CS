The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Party bump in Rahul democracy drive
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Party bump in Rahul democracy drive
          SANJAY K. JHA                            Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: Rahul Gandhis ambitious project to democratise the Congress could face resistance at higher levels.        
	Although he is implementing the initiative in the partys frontal bodies  the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India (NSUI)  he could run into problems if he takes the drive further.        
	Entrenched forces in the leadership structure are determined to preserve the nomination culture as long as possible.         
	The opposition to the democratisation process is so strong that AICC members from Madhya Pradesh held an emergency meeting yesterday and adopted a resolution asking Sonia Gandhi not to hold elections to either the Congress Working Committee (CWC) or the Central Election Committee (CEC).         
	The CWC is the partys highest policy-making body and the CEC decides candidates for parliamentary and Assembly elections.        
	A schedule for the CWC election to be held at an AICC meeting on November 2 has been announced, but the majority opinion is that the AICC members should authorise the party president to constitute the highest body as she chooses.        
	But the Madhya Pradesh AICC members decision to pre-empt that possibility and take the lead in ensuring that no election takes place has surprised many in the party. They now suspect other states will follow suit.         
	Such resolutions have been passed by state units for appointing their chiefs, never for the CWC. It is not known whether the Madhya Pradesh leaders move was prompted by the high command but it will be difficult for other state units to ignore the resolution.         
	Elections were held at the 1997 Calcutta AICC session when Sitaram Kesri was party chief but Sonia constituted her CWC without elections since she took over the reins in 1998. The party constitution says that 12 of the 24 members of the CWC would be elected.        
	But the current leadership has often found ways to violate the constitution by resorting to provisions or special clauses. For instance, the Congress plenary has to be held after every three years but it has taken place only after five years in the recent past.         
	Now, to legitimise the delay, the party has set up a committee to amend the constitution, and extending the three-year rule to five years is under consideration. This will ensure the election to pick the party chief will also be held only after five years, instead of three.         
	Even the AICC is supposed to meet at least twice a year but hasnt. The Congress is more methodical and serious about organisational elections than other parties  except the Left  but the process of selection is so complex that the AICC members list is still not ready in more than half of the states. The members form the electoral college for the CWC.        
	Sources said a proposal was put forward to conduct the November 2 AICC meeting with old members but the partys election authority head, Oscar Fernandes, objected.         
	But some states, such as Bihar where Assembly elections are under way, will have to wait for their AICC members. This can be treated as an excuse to avoid elections to the CWC. Such excuses ultimately become more powerful than Rahuls desire to hold elections to the top body.        
	But Rahul, too, could relent as he knows many members of Sonias inner coterie do not have the political wherewithal to get elected. They need nominations to stay afloat.

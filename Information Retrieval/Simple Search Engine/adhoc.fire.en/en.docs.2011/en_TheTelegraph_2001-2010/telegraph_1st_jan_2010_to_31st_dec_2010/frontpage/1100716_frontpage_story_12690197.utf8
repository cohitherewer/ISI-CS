	The government will also reimburse any course fee paid to any recognised coaching institute in the country upto Rs 20,000, provided the candidates submit the receipts and the admission letter, among other documents, to authenticate their claims to the director, higher and technical education (DHTE).         
	If the candidates pass the civil service (main) examination, they will get an additional amount of Rs 10,000.         
	Besides, they will be entitled to a one-time airfare (the cheapest mode of air transport available at that point of time) from their address to New Delhi and back for the purpose of appearing for interview before the UPSC.         
	According to the guidelines of the scheme, the chief ministers secretariat will allot the necessary funds from the special scheme on requisition to the DHTE and the power of sanction and disbursement of amount will be delegated to the DHTE.

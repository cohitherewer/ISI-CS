          G.S. MUDUR      
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: Call it chicken curry versus Birds Nest.        
	If the nest-like stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics set an architectural and technological benchmark for the 21st century, India earned the oh-so-cliched praise from Commonwealth Games visitors for its cuisine and hospitality.        
	At a time the largely glitch-free completion of the October 3-14 Games has sent the nation into self-congratulatory mode, veteran sports commentators caution that the event doesnt even come close to the Beijing Olympics. Neither in Indias organisational capability nor in its achievements in the Games sporting arenas.        
	The only benchmark India set in New Delhi was for itself  the country bettered its medals tally at any Commonwealth Games ever, winning 101 overall, including 38 golds (about half of what Australia won). At Beijing, China beat all other countries out of sight by bagging 51 golds, far ahead of US (36) and Russia (23).        
	In the stands in New Delhi, the fans fell far short of the sports etiquette expected from them, as Englands archers learnt to their cost.        
	A few spectators who had been silent when the Indian archers were shooting began shouting slogans like Bharat Mata ki jai when the English archers turn came, a senior sports commentator said. Archery demands intense concentration, and it was really unfair to the English archers.        
	The English did complain and the world archery body, Fita, threatened to stop the competition if the behaviour was repeated.                  
	Poor sports knowledge showed up also during the India-Australia hockey final. When an Indian player shot the ball into the opponents goal from outside the D, which does not merit a goal, some of the spectators shouted angry slogans against the referee for disallowing the goal.        
	Brand specialists, however, said the turnaround after the poor early preparations for the event would bolster Indias image. But it could be argued that the turnaround, which has been the Games principal feel-good story, basically amounts to the country cleaning up the mess it had itself created at the outset.        
	For all Indias prowess in information technology, the 2010 Games website was slow and cluttered, a sports analyst said.        
	Overall, it was more like a gamble that worked than like the well-planned organisation China displayed years, even decades, ahead of the Olympics, said Novy Kapadia, a sports commentator who has covered football World Cups, Asiads, several Commonwealth Games and the 2008 Beijing Olympics.        
	Beijings success, sports analysts and commentators said, sprang from three decades of planning. For instance, in 2001, even before it had got the hosting rights to the 2008 Olympics, the city held a bidding process to select the best stadium design. The model approved by a professional panel was then exhibited for the public and once again selected as the top design.        
	China learnt from others mistakes and took precautions. For instance, after a roof collapse at Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, Beijing did not hesitate to scrap one of the highlights of its stadium design  the retractable roof.              
	The same planning and sustained effort brought China the medals in 2008.        
	Kapadia recalls a Chinese visitor to the 1982 Asiad in New Delhi saying his country wanted to conquer step by step. First reign as the leader in Asian Games (which happened in 1982), then work towards becoming the top Olympic medal-winner in 30 years. China may thus have beaten its own deadline, topping the Olympics medals table in 26 years.        
	Although the stadiums in New Delhi remained intact and no snakebites or mosquito bites were reported from the Games Village, sports analysts said the event could have been organised more efficiently.        
	Tickets were far more easily available during Asiad 1982, a veteran sports analyst said. The volunteers, most of them college kids, appeared poorly trained and the 2010 Games website was cluttered and too slow. Finding results quickly was very difficult.        
	Marketing experts, though, believe the event has bolstered Indias brand. I think this satisfactory outcome, despite the initial concerns, will contribute to positive perceptions about India, said Prafulla Agnihotri, professor of marketing at IIM Calcutta. Such perceptions could have impacts over time, perhaps an increased influx of tourists.        
	Papri Dev, head of consumer marketing practice at Genesis Burson Marsteller, said: Such large events can turn perceptions either way. They can build a brand or bring it down. And when things turn out well, theyre always discussed with pride.

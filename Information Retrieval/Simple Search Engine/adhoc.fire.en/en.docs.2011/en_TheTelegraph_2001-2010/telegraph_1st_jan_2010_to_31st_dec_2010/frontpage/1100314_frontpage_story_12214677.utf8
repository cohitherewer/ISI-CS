The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Leonardo the new hero
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Leonardo the new hero
          ANITA SINGH                            Action-packed                                  
	March 13: He was an artist, inventor, scientist and visionary. Five hundred years after his death, Leonardo da Vinci can add another string to his bow: Hollywood action hero.        
	In one of the most unlikely movie projects since Pride and Prejudice was earmarked for a zombie makeover, Warner Bros has announced plans to recast Leonardo as an Indiana Jones-style adventurer.        
	Leonardo da Vinci and the Soldiers of Forever will pit the Renaissance man against supernatural enemies in a swashbuckling tale involving Biblican demons, secret codes, lost civilisations and hidden fortresses.        
	If that sounds a bit like the Da Vinci Code, it is probably no coincidence, although the film is being touted as a cross between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Clash of the Titans.        
	Leonardo will deploy a fearsome arsenal of weaponry in the movie, based on his real-life inventions. His 15th century designs for the helicopter, parachute, car and submarine may never have progressed further than the pages of his notebook, but they will be gloriously realised in the film.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Disillusioned Buta ready to pack bags
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Disillusioned Buta ready to pack bags
          RASHEED KIDWAI                             Buta Singh: Back to hometown                                  
	New Delhi, July 4: Buta Singh, who prided himself as a Rajiv Gandhi loyalist and in many ways symbolised the politician who papered over grey areas with the impregnable shield of loyalty, is now a disillusioned man and sees little option but to quit politics.        
	The 77-year-old Buta told The Telegraph he was returning to his hometown in Jalandhar, Punjab.        
	Speaking at his 11A Teen Murti Road residence, the former AICC general secretary and Union minister said: I am disillusioned. Loyalty is no longer at a premium. I fought many battles, built the party, did everything to ensure that its flag remained high. But now I feel I am no longer relevant.         
	Buta said he had a lot to say about the circumstances under which former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Arjun Singh let then Union Carbide chief Warren Anderson leave India on December 7, 1984, four days after the lethal gas killed thousands in Bhopal. I know the exact role played by Arjun Singh. But why should I say anything? Is anyone going to listen to me? he asked.        
	Buta would not say why he was feeling let down by the Congress high command but sources pointed out two immediate factors.        
	His son Sarabjot Singh has been under the CBI scanner since August 2009 for allegedly demanding a Rs 1-crore bribe exploiting his fathers position as chairperson of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Pressure had mounted on Buta to quit but he managed to save his post by pointing out that he was heading a statutory commission whose objective was to serve the Scheduled Castes.        
	But Butas five-year term as commission chief has now ended and his bid to protect Sarabjot has come to a naught.        
	More important, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have ruled out any further reward of office for him.        
	Buta is a former Akali. Before that, he was a Marxist who did his MA in history from Mumbais Khalsa College. When Josef Stalin died in 1953, he is said to have wept bitterly.        
	Hailing from an extremely modest background, Buta had a penchant for going for the kill regardless of the consequences. When he was barely seven, his uncle had shown him a beehive full of honey. Two days later, Butas sister heard him screaming. He had tried to reach the hive, got attacked by the bees, fell from the tree and broke his leg.        
	Before entering politics, Buta had worked as a sub-editor with Akali Patrika. The Shiromani Akali Dal fielded him from the Ropar reserved seat in 1962. When the Akalis split, Buta broke away and joined the Congress.        
	During the Rajiv era, he functioned as a virtual No. 2 in the government, upstaging two senior ministers, P.V. Narasimha Rao and P. Shiv Shankar. He had more access to Rajiv than any other minister.        
	Buta loved his reputation as Rajivs axe man. Between 1985 and 1989, he toppled so many state governments as the Union home minister that Rajiv told him in jest, Buta Singhji, ab aap kirpan andar rakhiye (Buta Singhji, now please sheath your kirpan).         
	But he changed loyalties too fast, joining the BJP and then returning to the Congress.         
	He was made the governor of Bihar but his old habit landed him in trouble. Buta recommended the dissolution of the Assembly in 2005 but the Supreme Court ruled that he had misled the Union cabinet because he did not want Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United) to form the government with the BJP.        
	On January 26, 2006, Buta faxed his resignation to the President. Once the dust settled down, Sonia and Manmohan appointed him chairperson of the commission, according him a cabinet berth and a palatial house in Delhi.         
	In 2000, Buta was convicted of bribing MPs to vote in favour of Narasimha Raos minority Congress government. He was cleared of the charges in 2002.        
	In the 2009 parliamentary polls, Buta contested as an Independent from Jalore in Rajasthan and lost.        
	Buta insists he has been with the Congress all along. He was among those who stood by Indira after the party split in 1977-78. Amid an acute resource crunch, the then AICC general secretary used his clout among taxi operators to let the party use a fleet of cabs, mostly for free.        
	I have many, many memories but nobody cares for loyalty, Buta said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Modi caught in web of charges   Under scanner: bids to behaviour
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Modi caught in web of charges 
  Under scanner: bids to behaviour          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                    
	Mumbai, April 26: From being the alleged recipient of kickbacks to rigging bids for new franchises, Lalit Kumar Modi has been charged with just about everything by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).        
	The allegations are grave and the BCCI has to take the rap for allowing Modi to function like an autocrat with a capital A. Not that throwing collective responsibility (and, by extension, accountability) into the Arabian Sea has made it look much better.         
	If the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, is to be believed, all the blame has to be placed at Modis door and that of the International Management Group.        
	Without taking Modis name, Manohar made the point that there had been a massive betrayal of trust.         
	A charge also relates to the January 2008 bids of the Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab, Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises where Modis relatives acquired stakes after the bidding process was completed.        
	Another allegation concerns Modis behavioural pattern, particularly the complaint from Team Kochi that he tried to arm-twist them out of the IPL.        
	Kochi and Pune are the new franchises and will debut in IPL IV, next year.         
	As for the rigging bit, it was detected by Manohar himself, which is why the March 8 tenders were cancelled and retendering ordered. The auction for the franchises was then held on March 21.        
	Modi, it seems, had laid it out very nicely for friends of two Union ministers. But he hadnt taken into account Manohars smartness in reading between the lines.        
	Suspended from all posts and activities of the BCCI, including the IPL, Modi has 15 days to reply to the chargesheet emailed to him shortly after last nights Chennai Super Kings versus Mumbai Indians final in Navi Mumbai.        
	Moving court is an option for Modi, but his stand wasnt known till late this evening. He didnt respond to text messages.        
	Life has, indeed, come a full circle for Modi  three-and-a-half years ago, hed taken the lead in getting Jagmohan Dalmiya expelled from the BCCI. Dalmiya made a quick comeback, but the Modi script doesnt make for good reading. At least, not now.        
	The BCCI will, if necessary, hold an inquiry once the reply is received. Should the suspended IPL chairman and commissioners answers be to the satisfaction of the three-member disciplinary committee, the proceedings will be dropped.        
	Manohar and two vice-presidents, Arun Jaitley and Chirayu Amin, are on the disciplinary committee.        
	Suspension is not a punishment, its to allow the inquiry to be free and fair, Manohar, who is on a clean-up drive, pointed out.        
	Amin, who heads the Baroda Cricket Association, has been named the interim chairman of the IPLs governing council. Manohar, though, will be calling the shots. Former BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah remains the vice-chairman.        
	Interacting with the media after the nearly two-hour governing council meeting, at the Cricket Centre this morning, Manohar said that the BCCIs chief administrative officer, Ratnakar Shetty, would look into the missing IPL-specific documents.        
	The Telegraph learns that while some contracts-related papers havent been located at all, a few originals and copies have been found in the IPL office at the Cricket Centre, the BCCIs HQ.        
	Word was that the IPL office may be sealed in order to allow the BCCIs internal probe into the missing documents to go ahead without any hindrance.        
	According to sources, former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra, Modis ally for a number of years, argued in his favour during the governing council meeting. Bindra didnt leave a dissenting note, so to say, but spoke up sufficiently for Modi. Nobody else did so, a source said.        
	Apparently, the three cricketers on the governing council  Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri  didnt say too much.        
	Two members  Union minister Farooq Abdullah and BCCI treasurer Mohinder Pandove  were absent.        
	Better late than never. We needed to end this business of only being a council to ratify, instead of governing. Modi would present us with deeds done and wed be helpless, said a governing council member, speaking exclusively.        
	Well, expect decentralisation.        
	One learns that the IPLs CEO, Sundar Raman, will also be hauled up. For questionable expenses (hes understood to have hired a chopper for a trip out of Dharamshala!) and appalling behaviour.        
	The IPL staff behaved like their superior, Manohar said, indicating just how cut up he was with the goings-on in the worlds most successful T20 tournament.        
	Manohar clarified that, to the best of his knowledge, no relative of predecessor and Union minister Sharad Pawar had a stake in any of the failed bids during last months auction for the franchises.        
	Eyebrows could be raised at that clean chit, but Manohar is known to go public only after being clear about the factual position.        
	Significantly, with Modi being suspended, it became easy for the Manmohan Singh government to turn down the Oppositions ferocious demand for a joint parliamentary probe.        
	Footnote: Asked if the BCCI was worried over Modis threat to reveal the names of those wanting to hurt the game, Manohar shot back: Not at all. If there are other people whore guilty, then we will sack them and take the same action.

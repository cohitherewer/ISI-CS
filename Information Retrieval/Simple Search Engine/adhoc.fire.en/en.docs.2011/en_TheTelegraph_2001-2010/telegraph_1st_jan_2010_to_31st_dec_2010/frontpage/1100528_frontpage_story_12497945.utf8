                  New Delhi, May 28 (PTI): In a surprise move, Jaya Bachchan has turned down her nomination for the Rajya Sabha by Samajwadi Party, which announced the candidature of its national spokesman Mohan Singh for the seat.  Party sources said today that Bachchan has refused to contest the Rajya Sabha election citing quot;family reasons quot;.  The party leadership was surprised at her decision as she was renominated after being consulted, they said.

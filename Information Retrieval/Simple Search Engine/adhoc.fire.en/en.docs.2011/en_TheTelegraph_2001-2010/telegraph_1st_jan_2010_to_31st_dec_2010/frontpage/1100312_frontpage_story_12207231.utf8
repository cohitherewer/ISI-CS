          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                      CRPF director-general Vikram Shrivastava (right) arrived in Ranchi on Thursday with special DG Vijay Raman to give the ongoing operation against the Naxalites further teeth and impetus. Soon after their arrival, the CRPF brass held a closed-door meeting with state DGP Neyaz Ahmad and other senior officials. Picture by Prashant Mitra                          
	Bokaro, March 11: Flushout operations in Jhumra hills of Bokaro, on since Sunday, has yielded some early results with the security forces nabbing four Maoist big guns and seizing 1.6 tonne explosives and cash to the tune of Rs 4 lakh from hideouts deserted by fleeing rebels.        
	Operations are on in a 120 sqkm area from Jhumra in Gomia and adjacent to the Konar river touching Hazaribagh. Security forces have also fanned out in Nawadih Uparghat area.        
	Three companies of CRPF, led by 26th batallion commandant V.S. Sharma and deputy commandant Jagdish Yadav, besides four companies of JAP, and more than 200 district policemen are taking part in the operation.        
	The Jhumra zone includes over 145 villages and the CRPF led by Sharma are working simultaneously to win over the local population  numbering thousands  by helping out with water supply, medicines and telephone facilities.         
	Jhumra hillock, which is about 23 km uphill from Rehawan village, houses more than 80 villages where more than 20,000 people live.         
	Till the CRPF and Jharkhand Armed Police camps were set up, the villagers who make a living by growing vegetables, had to go down to Rehawan to sell their farm and dairy products.        
	But now the security forces are readily buying their produce saving them an arduous daily trek. This has helped us open up channels of communication with the villagers, said Sharma.         
	The result is that often villagers, mostly women, come up to the camps to use their phones and even discuss their problems.         
	We have asked Bokaro DC Satyendra Singh to intervene and ensure the construction of a pucca road connecting Jhumra with Rehawan 24km downhill, he added.        
	The CRPF has also set up medical camps in several villages. In a rare gesture that has helped the CRPF win over the local villagers, it organised special treatment for the wife of Maoist leader Devdayal Mahto. She is suffering from a serious kidney ailment and has been admitted to Apollo Hospital in Ranchi at the behest of the CRPF.         
	Alongside these confidence building measures, RPF has ensured there was no let up in their primary mission  that of pursuing Maoists.         
	Our men have literally taken over the entire zone from Lugu Pahadi (touching Purulia in Bengal) along with Jhumra Pahad, Nawadih belt, Uparghat zone along with Konar and Vishnugarh in Hazaribagh district and Dumri and Parasnath hills in Giridih district, said Sharma.        
	The Bokaro police said following Tuesdays arrest of area commander Pandu Manjhi, they had also nabbed dreaded Maoists Bhuvneswar Mahto, a sub-zonal commander, Qutubuddin and an arms supplier from Bengal.        
	The police also recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition from the three and Rs 4 lakh in cash which the rebels had collected as levy from various businessmen.         
	Ammonium nitrate and other chemical explosives adding up to 1.6 tonne from the jungles of Uparghat were recovered yesterday.

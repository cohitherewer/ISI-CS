          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                        Gauri Khan at a Mumbai multiplex on Friday. (AFP)				       hats off to all heroes: srk to fans                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 12: Mumbaikars today thumbed their nose at the Shiv Senas ominous threats and spontaneously queued up in thousands to watch My Name is Khan.        
	After days of uncertainty, the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer hit the screens across Mumbai as theatre owners mustered the courage to defy the Sena diktat, encouraged by the citys legendary passion for cinema and the heavy security deployment.         
	It was the second time in a week that the Senas strong-arm politics, which once ruled Mumbai, had failed to make a dent. Last Friday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi sent a symbolic message that he could criss-cross the city in its local trains without a problem on Sena turf.        
	As the clock ticked this morning, crowds of Mumbaikars, most of whom had a holiday owing to Mahashivratri, began assembling outside the plexes to see if the film was on. The theatres, which had been hesitant until about noon about screening the film, decided to open the gates. Most single-screen theatres soon followed suit.         
	Shah Rukh, away in Berlin, was quick to express gratitude to the people of Mumbai. ...i am just a film hero...u all in the theatres r the real deal, he tweeted.         
	The superstar also sent a message  which he later clarified was to his fans only  that appeared conciliatory: once again my fellow countrymen, if anything i have said wittingly or unwittingly to have disturbed any sentiments.... i sincerely from the bottom of heart regret having hurt so many.         
	Sources in the distribution network said last night the government wanted the film to release at all 63 multiplexes and single-screen theatres in Mumbai, but the owners were nervous as it would mean less security for each hall.         
	It was Shah Rukhs idea that we go for a limited release and sense the response before going any further. He also assured us that if an attack still took place, he was willing to compensate the losses, said a source.         
	Police sources said they were expecting the Sena to call off the agitation after Shah Rukh tweeted regret. However, Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray remained closeted with the senior leaders, including son Uddhav, Manohar Joshi and Sanjay Raut, for the next three hours.         
	Thackerays statement issued late tonight did not clearly state if the Sena would continue with its agitation tomorrow, but appeared to be a climbdown from the partys earlier insistence on an apology from the star.        
	Thackeray said his party was not opposed to My Name is Khan but to Shah Rukhs pro-Pakistani statements and insulting Hindustan.                     
	We did not insist that he apologise to Shiv Sena, but our perspective was that he should apologise to the nation. The nation is supreme. Our opposition to Khan was for the love of this country! If patriotism is a crime, then Shiv Sainiks will do this crime again and again. Those who are mature will understand, Thackeray said.        
	Maharashtra home minister R.R. Patil and his deputy Ramesh Bagwe went to see the film at INOX multiplex at Nariman Point for the noon show. Some Congress leaders like Sanjay Nirupam were present at the noon show at Fun multiplex in Andheri.         
	Shah Rukh fans had gathered outside both multiplexes on their own since morning. As the bookings opened, the seats disappeared in a flash.         
	Groups of Shiv Sainiks did shout slogans and throw stones, but they were quickly rounded up by the police. Over 2,700 Sena activists had been arrested till this evening.         
	After watching the film, Patil assured theatre owners they need not fear any disruption. We cannot guarantee protection for every poster of the film but we can assure security to everyone who comes to watch it, he said.         
	Bollywood also did its bit to support the film. Actor Kabir Bedi and his model-daughter Pooja Bedi arrived at Fun multiplex to purchase tickets for the noon show, but were greeted with the sold out display. Shah Rukhs wife Gauri also caught a late afternoon show at Fun multiplex.        
	By 5pm, the film was playing at all 63 cinema halls, said Rajesh Thadani of the Theatre Owners Association.        
	Screening was normal in the rest of Maharashtra, except Pune and Nashik, and in Gujarat.

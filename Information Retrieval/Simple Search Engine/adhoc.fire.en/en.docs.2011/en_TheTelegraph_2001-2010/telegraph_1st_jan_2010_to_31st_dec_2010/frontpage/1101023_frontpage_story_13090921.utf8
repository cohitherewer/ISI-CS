The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Derailed this time: Metro boss   Mamata cites   health grounds
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Derailed this time: Metro boss     -  Mamata cites   health grounds
          SANJAY MANDAL                                                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 22: The Metro Railway general manager has been relieved of his post on health grounds, two days after a derailment that was described by Mamata Banerjee as a chhoto ghatana (minor incident).        
	The transfer of Amar Nath from the oldest underground system in the country is the first top-level change that has followed an untoward incident since Mamata took over as railway minister. Several railway tragedies have occurred under her watch, but few senior officials have been shunted out.        
	P.B. Murty, the general manager of Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, has swapped places with Amar Nath who has spent less than a year at the helm of Metro Railway.        
	 This is a routine reshuffle and one shouldnt read much into it, a railway ministry official said.        
	However, a top official said: Such was the urgency that Murty was at Metro Bhavan (the utilitys headquarters on Jawaharlal Nehru Road) even before the transfer order could reach Nath. Murty was at Metro Bhavan by 2pm but the transfer order from Rail Bhavan reached only after 3pm.        
	After leaving office around 6pm, Amar Nath  described by colleagues as a gentleman  went to Trinamul Bhavan on Topsia Road, where Mamata has been camping since the derailment. According to a Trinamul official, Amar Nath was with Mamata for over 20 minutes.         
	He wanted to be relieved from Metro on health grounds, Mamata said. Amar Nath echoed her and said that he was thankful to the minister for her support.         
	Sources in the railway ministry and Trinamul said the transfer reflected Mamatas concerns on her home turf.         
	Metro Bhavan insiders told The Telegraph that Mamata was not interested in a shake-up earlier as she had described the derailment as a minor incident and hinted at possible sabotage.         
	She did not remove any senior railway official after the Jnaneswari tragedy and the Sainthia incident as she was convinced that the accidents took place because of sabotage, said a railway ministry official.         
	The Jnaneswari tragedy took 150 lives while the accident at Sainthia station killed around 70 people.         
	Mamata had also ignored repeated demands for her resignation from CPM leaders, although civil aviation minister Praful Patel had offered to step down after the Air India Express crash in Mangalore.        
	Although the Metro derailment did not claim any life, it did embarrass Mamata. The Trinamul leader appears to have revised her initial stand after gauging the public mood in Calcutta. Once she made up her mind on a reshuffle, the Railway Board swung into action to ease out Amar Nath.        
	A senior Trinamul leader said it was felt that some action was needed as Metro Railways was earning a bad name because of recurring delays and snags.        
	The underground chaos during Puja also prompted her to mull some action, he added.        
	CPM leaders did not miss the opportunity to renew the demand for her resignation. Mere removal of the Metro GM wont solve the problem. Mamata herself should be removed, instead of the Metro GM, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said.

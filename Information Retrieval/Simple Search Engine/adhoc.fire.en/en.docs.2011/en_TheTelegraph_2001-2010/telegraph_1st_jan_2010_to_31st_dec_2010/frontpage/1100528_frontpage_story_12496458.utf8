          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 27: Air India has sacked 58 employees, derecognised two associations and sealed their offices in the most decisive action in recent memory by a state-run utility against militant trade unionism.        
	The dismissals, including that of 15 engineers who went on strike soon after the Mangalore crash and crippled 130 flights, and suspension of 24 more employees were greeted by a repeat strike from June 12.         
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel cleared the series of penal actions after the strike, termed illegal by Delhi High Court, was called off yesterday. The government has given the airline a free hand.        
	Civil aviation ministry officials said in private that the tough action was not just a punishment for misdeeds, but could also help prepare the ground for unions to accept a host of changes Air India needed to implement to be back in the black after losing more than Rs 10,000 crore in two years.         
	The Air Corporation Employees Union and the All India Aircraft Engineers Association, which together claim to represent over 50 per cent of the ground staff, have been derecognised for participating in an illegal strike, disrupting flights and approaching the media.        
	The dismissals have been carried out under the little-used Rule 13 of the Air India service book, which allows the airline to sack workers in whom it has lost confidence.         
	The sacked employees, who predictably includes some in Calcutta airport, are nursing hopes that they would eventually be taken back. They have threatened another strike next month but are most likely to approach courts if the dismissals are not revoked.        
	The engineering associations general secretary, Y.V. Raju, served notice for a strike from any time after June 12.         
	But the crackdown has spread alarm among the employees. A regional secretary of a union said: My fingers are crossed. We will need to fight this legally.        
	Union leader J.B. Kadiyan claimed that Air India was trying to instigate the workers to go for action and then declare a lockout.        
	The unions so far have not received much political support probably because the two unions have not cultivated too many parties. Some employees on strike were seen holding red flags but the unions are not directly affiliated to any party. In contrast, pilots have built contacts in many mainstream parties.        
	The CPM was the only party that issued a formal statement today against the dismissals and the derecognition, holding the management and Patel responsible for the state of affairs.

  - Combined engineering and medical tests          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Kapil Sibal                                
	New Delhi, June 18: Indias largest engineering and medical entrance tests will be merged from the next year, sparing students undecided between the streams from having to appear for two separate examinations.        
	The move was announced by human resource development minister Kapil Sibal today as part of his agenda for the coming year, after a meeting here with the education ministers of all the states.         
	Over 9.6 lakh students appeared last year for the All India Engineering Entrance Examination, more than twice the number that appeared for the IIT Joint Entrance Examination.        
	The National Institutes of Technology and other central engineering colleges admit students on the basis of their AIEEE scores. All state engineering colleges also admit 50 per cent of their students through the AIEEE, which tests candidates in physics, chemistry and math.        
	The All India Pre-Medical Test  for which about 2 lakh students appear every year  admits students to many central medical colleges and to some seats in state medical colleges. The examination tests physics, chemistry and biology.        
	By merging the AIEEE and AIPMT, we will reduce the number of examinations students need to appear for, Sibal said. Engineering aspirants can sit for physics, chemistry and math, while aspiring doctors can appear for biology instead of math. Candidates can also sit for all four subjects and decide later.        
	The move is a part of Sibals plan, unveiled earlier this year, to replace the multiple college entrance examinations conducted by the Centre and the states with a single test similar to the US-based Scholastic Aptitude Test.        
	This single examination  cutting across streams of study  will not test a students knowledge of specific subjects but his raw intelligence, according to Sibal. Weight will be given to Class XII board exam marks during admissions to incorporate a students knowledge of specific subjects into his eligibility.         
	But the move for a SAT-style test cutting across the Centre and states and across institutions and streams is already facing opposition. Merging the AIEEE and the AIPMT is, however, in Sibals hands because both are conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education.        
	Sibal also announced an ambitious plan for housing and insurance for all schoolteachers, and plans for the countrys first quality benchmarks for vocational education.        
	The HRD minister also announced that the government would set up a National Institute for Assessment and Evaluation to help school boards improve their curricula.        
	Sibals meeting with the states was not all smooth sailing, though. Most states objected to a rule linking the Centres partial compensation for pay hikes for college teachers to mandatorily raising the retirement age for teachers to 65.

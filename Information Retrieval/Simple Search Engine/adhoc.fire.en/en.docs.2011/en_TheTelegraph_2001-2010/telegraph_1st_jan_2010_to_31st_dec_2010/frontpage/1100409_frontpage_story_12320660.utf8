          OUR BUREAU                                              
	April 8: For Dr Mohit Saha, candles are as indispensable as the stethoscope.        
	For the past three days, there has been no power from 7pm to 9pm and I am examining my patients in candlelight, Saha said this evening.        
	Saha lives on the outskirts of Bolpur town in a place called Sian.         
	Had he been living in Salt Lake, he would still have had to light candles, probably for longer hours.         
	Salt Lake, once immune to the Calcutta invention called loadshedding, today went through eight hours of rolling power cuts. So did large swathes across Bengal on a day heatwave-like conditions added to the agony.         
	The usual blame chain  no power because no coal, no coal because no railway rakes to ferry the fuel to power plants  has again been wired together by officials.         
	But a closer look throws up a cocktail of lack of foresight, reluctance to remove bottlenecks, inability to be proactive to take rapid action and confront law and order hurdles.        
	Every summer since 1996, India has had to share water with Bangladesh from the Ganga at Farakka. This lowers the water level and affects generation at a nearby NTPC plant, which supplies power to a tongue-twister called WBSEDCL (the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd). This time, it has reduced generation by 350MW.        
	The water is meant to be shared every year  it is not a surprise lurking around the corner. Neither is the low generation at Purulia, which has a water-based plant, and levels are expected to go down in summer.        
	However, no attempt appears to have been made to prepare for these certain adversities, which together have taken out of circulation 800MW.         
	Coal shortage has been a litany sung by most entities and officials concerned every year.         
	One option to tackle this would have been to buy more coal  Coal India is expected to fulfil the needs of state-run power plants but poor quality means that the quantity offered is never enough.        
	Purchase of more coal involves taking part in an online auction. Many power utilities are reluctant to fall back on the e-auction because of two factors: higher price and longer time lag in delivery.        
	First, the coal is more expensive. So we wont buy unless it is a crisis. When we buy during a crisis, it usually takes 15-30 days. As a result, power plants are not buying through this route, said an executive of a power utility.        
	There is another option: imports. Power companies whose requirements are to be met by Coal India by a long-term contract can import coal but not more than 10 per cent of their total consumption.        
	But rarely is even this low limit used up by the state-run entities, though private companies import regularly.        
	Governments do resort to imports when sugar and wheat shortages occur but are reluctant to do so when power crises unfold  perhaps because they view it as an affront to the much-vaunted claims of self-sufficiency. Better to let countless people suffer than hurt national pride.        
	Poor coal is another spoiler. Sources said that if quantity of coal is a problem, so is its quality. Adulteration with stones and sand is prevalent at loading stations. Private companies send emissaries to keep watch, state-run utilities let matters run the way they are.        
	Low-quality coal slows down generation and often leads to plant breakdowns. Most plants in Bengal are now running below capacity, apparently because of low supply of coal but officials are not saying if quality of the fuel has anything to do with the lower generation.        
	Then comes an all-too-familiar feature in Bengal: mob power. A tongue-twister cousin  WBPDCL (the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd) in charge of generation in the state  has a mine at Borjor in Birbhum, which is supposed to send two rakes of coal every day.        
	But in the past nine months, when over 500 rakes of coal should have been sent, only 22 could be managed.        
	The problem: looting. The solution: Section 144 has been imposed 10 days ago.         
	If only there can be a Section 144 against suffering.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State asks Delhi to defer hill talks
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                State asks Delhi to defer hill talks
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, July 19: The Bengal government today asked the Centre to defer the tripartite talks with the Gorkha Janmutki Morcha. The home ministry, as a result, is unlikely to convene the negotiations on July 24, a date announced earlier by Delhi.         
	A fax from Writers Buildings has requested the ministry to defer the talks, sources told The Telegraph.         
	The probable postponement comes in the wake of evidence collected by Bengal police, which could nail top Morcha leaders in the Madan Tamang murder case. Phone conversations between Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri and cadres were reportedly recorded by the police before and after the murder on May 21. We told the Bengal police to arrest (them) if they have the evidence, said a home ministry source.         
	The Bengal governments predicament is that it would be difficult to take action against Giri and others, who could be accused in the Tamang murder case, after sitting across the table with them. Moreover, the Darjeeling unit of the CPM  the party that heads the Left Front government in the state  is opposed to the talks. In Delhi, officials believe that Bengal would not like to go ahead with the meeting before the Assembly elections.                     
	The meeting was to discuss the Centres proposal for an interim authority for the Darjeeling hills on the lines of the DGHC, which earlier was an elected body.         
	For the Morcha, the fear is that the interim body could be equated with the Sixth Schedule status proposed by GNLF chief and former chairperson of the DGHC, Subash Ghisingh.         
	Right now, it is the internal dynamics of the Morcha and the Bengal governments worries that are important, said a source.         
	Voice transcripts are admissible in court after tests at a forensic lab. But for the CPM-led government, elections are a priority and the talks may be conveniently pushed over to next year. North Block, however, would ideally like to continue its engagement with the Morcha, the source said.        
	SC on highway        
	The Supreme Court on Monday again directed the Centre and the Bengal government and parties agitating for and against Gorkhaland to stop blocking NH31A, the highway that links Sikkim with the rest of the country.         
	The top court order came just days ahead of a proposed 24-hour bandh by the Morcha on July 25. The court was acting on a PIL filed by .P. Bhandari, a resident of Sikkim, who said bandhs cut off the landlocked state completely, snapping supply of essential commodities.

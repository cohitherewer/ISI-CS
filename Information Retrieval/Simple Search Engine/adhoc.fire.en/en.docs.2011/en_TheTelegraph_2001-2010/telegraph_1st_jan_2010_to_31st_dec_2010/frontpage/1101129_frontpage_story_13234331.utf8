	Nov. 28: Prince William has quashed speculation that he could become the next king in place of Charles, the Prince of Wales.         
	In an attempt to end the debate over the issue of succession, Prince William has signalled that there is no question about whether his father will be the next monarch, despite his surge in popularity following his engagement to Kate Middleton.         
	Royal aides insist that Prince William has no desire to climb the ladder of kingship prematurely, following two recent polls by ICM and YouGov that found that most people believe he would make a better king than his father and think that Prince Charles should stand aside for his son.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Vision in mission, please   All set for Obama but little hint of a big idea
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Vision in mission, please     All set for Obama but little hint of a big idea
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                      
	New Delhi, Nov. 5: He isnt lame-duck yet but he arrives a little lamed by domestic reverses and, on the evidence of the run-up, could well deliver a duck.        
	US President Barack Obama brings to India the burnished trophy of himself, inscribed with unprecedented personal and political history, but probably little else.        
	Smartly, he has made to pre-empt the prospect of anti-climactic discontent floating up in the wake of his departure on Tuesday. He thinks Indias claim to a permanent seat in the UNSC too tough and complicated for Washington to consider in the current world order.        
	He cant countenance dismantling economic protectionism to calm the clamour of Indian industry because that will only spur the rippling disaffection back home. He has displayed no inclination, beyond the rasp of his famed stage rhetoric, to build on foundations George W. Bush laid with Manmohan Singh.        
	Considered conjecture in South Block corridors is Obama is unlikely to reach into his breast pocket mid-speech to commit to paper the trick of his lofty lip-service.        
	Bush and Singh ribboned the civil nuclear pact with a promise on long-term strategic partnership. Obama was meant to have run afield with the baton  what they call Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) in diplomatese.        
	But he appears to have too much else on his hands at the moment to care for that baton. Or, as former ambassador Deb Mukharji, bluntly says: For all of Bushs other failings, he had a certain vision and idea for India, Obama might be a more global President, but he just does not have it for India. Having called India the cornerstone of Asia, he must show how and why. If you say you cannot deliver any of what we want, Im sorry, it does become difficult doing business, I think one of our problems is that we still cannot get up and say, look, this is our bottom line.        
	To many in the foreign office, the thin end of that bottom line is an explicit framework for a blueprint for the future, as the NSSP has come to be called.         
	In broad ideological and geopolitical terms, Indian expectations from such a blueprint would entail, essentially, two things: comprehensive de-hyphenation from Pakistan to a degree that Washington recognises New Delhi as de facto suzerain of South Asia, and, insulation from being expected to play pawn on the Sino-US chessboard.         
	No such vision is anywhere on the deep horizon, an Indian diplomat told The Telegraph. In fact, there is no blueprint in the works yet, which is why we have worked to lower expectations and call this visit part of a continuum. The Obama administration has just not shown the kind of interest or mindspace for India as the predecessor government. Nothings wrong with ties but nothing spectacular is happening either. People would have expected that with Obama, beyond his politics, for sheer reasons of his larger than life persona, but that has not come to play yet with India.        
	Former foreign secretary Salman Haider, disagrees, though. I think we are overstating things by this so-called lowering of expectations, he says. We have known for a long time there is no bonanza on the way. This is, may I say for the nth time, a continuing and improving relationship and nobody should discount a visit by a US President, that has its own substance.        
	In essence, no big bang. But a whimper?         
	Words fairly out on the nearly zero-sum prospects of the visit that has just got under way. The message pouring forth from Indian  and global  listening posts is that should all go well, the Obama visit would be over without any down-pegging of Indo-US ties, a trip seen off in pleasant symbolisms  much of which reside in the personas of the President and the First Lady  rather than measured in the substance of what it achieved.        
	Informed of pre-visit atmospherics from both sides, The Economist wrote this week in a leader titled A Damp Squib: Under his predecessor, relations between India and America improved hugely. George Bush saw democratic India as a counterweight to China; Indias Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, also wanted closer ties. The result was a 2005 civil nuclear co-operation agreement, which conferred longed-for respectability on Indias hitherto pariah nuclear programme. That is a lot for Mr Obama to live up to. To the disappointment of many in both countries, moreover, this budding friendship has failed to kick on.         
	That assessment has found a resonant echo in India on at least two issues that exercise opinion: Americas resumed, and enhanced, arming of Pakistan on grounds of fighting terror, and the post-Obama raising of economic barriers vis--vis India in the name of protecting American jobs and business interests.         
	It is an angst that industrialist Rahul Bajaj voiced full-mouthed recently. I am a greater admirer of America and the American people, and I understand some of the measures they have taken, he said in the context of Obamas arrival. But it is time we told the US that we have our own interests to look after, we are not running a charitable institution, we too are a nation with a people full of expectations and need, what are we getting out of it? They want but they do not want to give, how is that to happen?         
	As hosts, Indian officials have been more circumspect. But even they have found it required to spell out the Indian position point-blank on some issues.        
	On US protectionist barriers, for instance, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao was curt and unwilling to accommodate US concerns: Everybody knows we keep thousands of American jobs in place.         
	New Delhi has also been concerned about arms supplies to Pakistan  a $2-billion package announced just last month  and raised fears about the arsenal posing a threat to India. Who is to ensure these weapons, especially state-of-the-art fighter jets and mountain terrain choppers, will not be used against India? a senior official asks.         
	Haider, though, again strikes an understanding note. The situation has changed vastly in Pakistan-Afghanistan, the US is trying to cope with a perplexing situation there, there is no getting away from it and I think there is a recognition of that in New Delhi too. We should not let this come in the way of handing President Obama a fulsome welcome.         
	Thats not in danger; going by arrangements being put in place, effusive will probably fall short as a descriptor of how the Obamas are received in India.        
	What probably is in some peril is that Prime Minister Singh may not be able to tell this President what he told his predecessor: The whole of India is in love with you.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Crash swallows Polands top order
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Crash swallows   Polands top order
                                            
	Moscow, April 10: A plane carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski and dozens of the countrys political and military leaders crashed in heavy fog in western Russia today morning, killing all 97 aboard.        
	The crash in a bare forest near Smolensk was laden with tragic irony as the President and the others were arriving to commemorate one of the saddest events in Polands long and complicated history with Russia: the murder of over 20,000 Polish officers by the Soviet secret police.        
	Officials said air traffic controllers had recommended the Presidents jet land at another airport because of poor visibility, but the crew decided to land anyway. The plane was a Tupolev Tu-154, designed by the Soviets in the mid-1960s.        
	The crash wiped out a large swath of Polands leadership (see chart). In the numb hours after the crash, leaders in Warsaw evoked the horror of the massacre at Katyn, which stood for decades as a symbol of Russian domination.        
	It is a damned place, former President Aleksander Kwasniewski said. It sends shivers down my spine. First, the flower of the Second Polish Republic is murdered in the forests around Smolensk, now the intellectual elite of the Third Polish Republic die in this tragic plane crash when approaching Smolensk airport. This is a wound which will be very difficult to heal.        
	Foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Prime Minister Donald Tusk was in tears. The leader of the Lower House  now acting President  has 14 days to announce elections.        
	Kaczynski, 60, often argued passionately that a stronger Nato would keep Russia from reasserting its influence over eastern Europe.         
	 The President, seen by the Kremlin as less friendly, was not invited to a joint Russian-Polish ceremony on Wednesday. Instead, he had decided to attend a Polish-organised event in Katyn today.

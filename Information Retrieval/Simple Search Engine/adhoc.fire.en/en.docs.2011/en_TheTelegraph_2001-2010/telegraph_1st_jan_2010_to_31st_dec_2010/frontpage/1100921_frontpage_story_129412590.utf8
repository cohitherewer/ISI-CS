	Srinagar, Sept 21 (PTI): Eleven members of the all-party team today visited a hospital here to meet people injured in the ongoing unrest in Kashmir Valley but were met with protests by relatives and attendants of patients 
    The team, which included BJP leader Sushma Swaraj and CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury, interacted with the injured persons admitted in the the SMHS hospital.
    The visit of the delegation members to the hospital was kept out of bounds for the media persons and a large contingent of police and paramilitary CRPF was deployed around the hospital and adjoining localities to maintain law and order.
    However, the relatives and attendants of the injured persons raised slogans in protest against the security forces and the government, forcing the delegation members to cut short their visit, according to hospital sources.

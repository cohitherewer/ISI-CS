The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gurjar tried to veer off 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Gurjar tried to veer off 
  - Mamatas escort car   driver recalls crash        KINSUK BASU                                           
	Calcutta, Aug. 13: Gurjar Singh, remanded in police custody on the charge of conspiring to kill Mamata Banerjee, probably made a last-ditch attempt to steer his truck away, the driver of the escort car that took the hit and shielded the railway ministers vehicle told The Telegraph today.        
	I feel the driver probably realised that he was about to slam into my car from behind and made a last-ditch attempt to steer away. As a result, the truck didnt hit my car in the middle but at one of the rear ends, said Utpal Das Mahapatra, who drove the Intelligence Branch escort car that was tailing Mamatas convoy on her way back from the Lalgarh rally on Monday.        
	Gurjar, a truck driver from Punjab, was arrested on the charge of rash driving and released on bail the next day, only to be re-arrested and sent to 12 days police custody after the Trinamul Congress alleged a conspiracy to kill Mamata.        
	Gurjar was not supposed to take that road  a transgression he blamed on faulty brakes and meant to avoid a busy flyover.        
	Officers of Bengal police had said in private that preliminary investigations suggested it was an accident. But Utpals account is the first from someone who was in the direct path of the oncoming truck.        
	Utpal, who bore the brunt of the crash, said that as he was flung away from his seat on impact, he couldnt recollect which side of the car he was driving got hit.         
	I blacked out after the collision and so I cannot remember the exact sequence of events. But I think the truck hit my Bolero in the left corner and it was an accident, said the 35-year-old constable who had undergone commando training in Hyderabad in 2001.        
	Utpals medical reports indicate he had suffered injuries on his left ear lobe and doctors have advised him seven days rest following severe trauma. Mamata, who suffered injuries on her chest and back, has also been advised seven days rest. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is expected to call on her tomorrow. ( )         
	No Trinamul leader has so far visited Utpal. The party said its workers had taken him to a nursing home but it had no plans to felicitate him.        
	Not that Utpal is complaining. No one from the party has got in touch with me since the accident. But, honestly, I didnt expect it either. Its my duty to be always behind the VVIP whom I am escorting, said Utpal, who hails from Egra in East Midnapore.         
	I believe I tried to perform to the best of my abilities in this case So this injury doesnt matter, Utpal added.        
	An officer of the CID, which is probing the case and has brought Gurjar to Calcutta, said that there is no doubt that the truck would have hit Mamata Banerjees vehicle had the Bolero not come in the way.        
	Gurjars elder brother Bir is said to be on his way to Bengal. One of Gurjars lawyers, Arijit Maity, said: We will hold a discussion with his brother regarding an appeal in the high court and possibly take a decision on Monday.        
	Fighting a case in the high court will not be easy for Gurjar, a father of two earning Rs 3,000 a month.         
	The lawyer felt that the police should have monitored the route and stopped Gurjars truck before it reached so close to the convoy.         
	Asked if Gurjar was being victimised, Sujato Bhadra, a spokesperson for the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, said: At this juncture, we would not like to comment as the truck driver is in police custody.         
	The police said they were verifying the antecedents of Gurjar. We have got the truck documents but now we are verifying their authenticity. We will check his antecedents, DGP Bhupinder Singh said.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Memory of a 9pm tug, anxiety of new KBC 
  - Big B recalls how jaya reminded him of show time          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            Amitabh before the unveiling of the new KBC in Mumbai (above) and The Telegraph report in July 2000 that mentioned Jayas 9pm tug to remind Amitabh it was time for the show                                       
	Mumbai, Sept. 28: He remembers her tug but wants to keep away from it this time. At least, for the season opener.        
	During his first innings as host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, when Amitabh Bachchan changed the brand value of television in India, wife Jaya used to tug at his shirt every night at 9 so that they could go back home and watch the show. As the Big B returns as quizmaster of the evergreen show on his 68th birthday (October 11), this time on Sony, he admits he is nervous about the reaction from Jaya and the rest of the family (Abhishek and Aishwarya).        
	I actually want to keep away because I am too scared to see how they react, Bachchan told The Telegraph at the JW Marriott hotel, moments after he formally unveiled the new look (and rules) of the show. I would retire to some corner of the house where I cant hear or see anybody and wait for the report to come in from the rest of the family.        
	The same family had advised him not to take up TV back in 2000 when Bachchans career was all but over thanks to a series of flops and all his home productions biting the dust. It was this desi adaptation of the blockbuster international format Who Wants To Be A Millionaire that got Bachchan back in (show) business.        
	I myself wasnt sure film stars didnt do TV at that time but then I was flown to London and saw how they do the original version. That did it for me, said Bachchan, who ironically again finds himself with few films in hand as he settles in the black KBC chair.        
	Bachchan has already shot for the first few episodes of the new season  on floor number 16 at Film City  almost five years after he had last faced the arclights for KBC Dwitiya. It was better than going back home, he said. What has changed between 2000 and 2010? Apna chashma, he joked.        
	And the money! If it was just about winning Rs 1 crore in the first KBC, this time the jackpot is Rs 5 crore, the highest ever.         
	So what are the new words from the Big B for what is being billed as Kaun Banega Crorepati 2010? Tez, teekha aur tabadtod.         
	Not to mention the other T  the tug, if he pulls it off again.

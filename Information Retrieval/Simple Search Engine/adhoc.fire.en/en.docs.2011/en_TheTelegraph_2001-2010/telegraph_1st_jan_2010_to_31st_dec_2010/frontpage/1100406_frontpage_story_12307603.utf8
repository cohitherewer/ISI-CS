  - Oh, PC! You aint politically correct        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Calcutta, April 5: P. Chidambaram and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee are now locked in a trans-Atlantic brawl: Your American clich versus My British clich.        
	Mind your language, the chief minister today advised the Union home minister who had yesterday repeatedly reminded Bhattacharjee that the buck stops at his table.        
	The chief minister, who was addressing a media conference on the events to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, was initially reluctant to react to Chidambarams comments. After Rabindranath, please dont ask me to speak on this. Please dont ask me to stoop so low. What a fall! Thats what I will be forced to do if I say anything on this.        
	But once Bhattacharjee got started, the issue took on a life of its own.        
	Asked whether he would say Language, please to Chidambaram, the chief minister dipped into his quiver and came up with an arrow popularised by a British television comedy. I will say, Mind your language, Bhattacharjee said (see chart). I know that the responsibility for maintaining law and order is mine.        
	He added: But the language is not good. Its slang. Theres no doubt about it. Such language is not generally used by politicians. Generally, you will never find such words in politicians speeches. Its unusual.        
	The chief minister is on a sticky wicket on two counts. The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary does not classify buck as a slang but describes it as informal. At most, the buck stops here can be termed colloquial. The parent coinage  passing the buck, from which the buck stops here originated  was once considered a slang, but both phrases are now regularly used in the mainstream media.        
	Contrary to what the chief minister said, politicians do use the phrase in speeches. President Barack Obama, the epitome of political correctness whom Bhattacharjee is unlikely to consider ungentlemanly, had said the buck stops with me in an address from the White House as recently as January 7. President Harry S. Truman had also placed a sign bearing the phrase on his office table.        
	The chief ministers reservations appeared also to stem from the phrases association with poker (a card game), something which many families still frown upon.         
	Do you know what poker is? Are you aware of it? Bhattacharjee asked.        
	The chief minister may have been referring to pass the buck, which originated from the game of poker. The Telegraph, quoting a dictionary, had published today the history of the phrase that means shifting responsibility to someone else.        
	Asked whether it was in bad taste to use such language, Bhattacharjee said: I wont say its in bad taste. But politicians generally dont use it.         
	On law and order in the state, Bhattacharjee said: I told him that I know my responsibilities. But the Opposition should behave properly.... He mentioned some areas and stated his position. I also mentioned some pockets where there were problems and gave my assessment on the difficulties we faced.        
	But the chief minister did not let the dust settle on the language debate. I have to do my work. There are some who like to play with words. I dont accept the statements he made to the press, Bhattacharjee said. Let him discharge his own responsibilities. I will discharge my responsibility.        
	The chief minister did not smell any ideological slant but CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim spotted evidence of Chidambarams pro-US positions. He borrowed the American expression perhaps because of his affinity with American economic policies which were evident during his stint as finance minister, Salim said.

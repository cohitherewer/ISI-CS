          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 9: Ratan Tata today advocated the need to investigate all spectrum allocations since 2001 when the NDA was in power, saying in an unusually blunt letter to a former telecom rival that many of the flip-flops in the telecom policy occurred during the BJP regime.        
	Tatas seven-page open letter to Rajeev Chandrasekhar, an industrialist elected to the Rajya Sabha with the support of the BJP, sought to draw attention to what he felt were issues that had been glossed over so far.        
	The letter was in response to a similar one made public by Chandrasekhar three days ago and came a day after the Supreme Court said what happened in 2001 needed to be looked at. Tatas strikeback also coincided with a government announcement that a retired judge would examine the telecom procedures that were followed between 2001 and 2009.                    
	The crux of Tatas case is an assertion that some operators had been subverting the telecom policy and were continuing to do so behind a smokescreen. He suggested that these operators were against a technology-agnostic or technology-neutral policy to prevent more players from entering telecom.         
	Tata also said that the recent policy had broken the cartel that had been holding back competition.        
	Making a direct allusion to Chandrasekhars political ties, Tata said: Your affiliation to a particular political party is well known and it appears their political aspirations and their endeavour to embarrass the Prime Minister and the ruling party may well have been the motivation behind your letter.        
	Chandrasekhar had fired a broadside at Tata through an open letter on December 6. He charged Tata with resorting to hypocrisy by pretending to be a victim of a warped policy when the Tata group was the biggest beneficiary of former telecom minister A. Rajas out-of-turn spectrum allocation policy.        
	The founder of BPL Mobile  which once held the licence for the prestigious Mumbai circle that he sold in 2005 to the Ruias in a roughly $1.1-billion deal  accused the Tata group of unethically jumping the queue to emerge as one of the biggest beneficiaries of Rajas largesse.        
	Chandrasekhar, an independent MP representing Bangalore and Karnataka, is widely regarded as a loose cannon who has been involved in several skirmishes in the past, including a battle with his father-in-law T.P.G. Nambiar over the control of BPL Communications.         
	The Tata group chairman said the Vajpayee governments sudden change in the telecom policy in 1999, when loss-laden telecom operators were allowed to switch to a benign revenue-sharing arrangement with the government, had resulted in a loss of Rs 50,000 crore to the exchequer if the same notional yardsticks were used as the CAG had done in its recent report on 2G spectrum allocation.        
	In his letter to Tata, Chandrasekhar had said 575 applications had been received for 2G spectrum by the cut-off date: October 1, 2007. Raja had used an arbitrary cut-off date  September 25, 2007  and chosen to process only 122 applications.        
	Chandrasekhar claimed that the Tatas had submitted their application for dual technology spectrum on October 22  three weeks after the original cut-off date of October 1. This was possible because Raja had framed a dual-technology policy which allowed Tatas to jump the queue and grab scarce spectrum, he said.        
	Tata asserted that his group had been discriminated against during the spectrum allocation. He said the Tatas were still waiting for spectrum in Delhi and 39 key districts for about three years.         
	Tata said his company was the only operator that returned spectrum when demanded by the telecom department. He pointed out that the CAG report indicated which of the powerful GSM operators are holding spectrum beyond their entitlement free of cost.        
	Chandrasekhar was quick to respond, saying Tatas letter was intensely personal, attributes feeble motives and (was) most unbecoming of the house of Tatas. He added: I particularly find your self-appointed defence of the Prime Minister and the government very irrelevant.

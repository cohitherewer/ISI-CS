  - Study says return to jobs soon after birth can adversely affect children          TIM ROSS                      NEWBORN BEFORE WORK                                
	London, Oct. 16: Middle-class mothers who return to work too soon risk turning their children into unruly pupils who perform badly at school, research suggests.         
	But women from poorer backgrounds who take jobs soon after giving birth tend to benefit their children by providing positive role models and bringing in extra income, the University of California study found.         
	However, for higher and middle-income families, the benefits may be outweighed by the emotional disruption that leaving children at nursery can have, says the report.         
	Academics reviewed 69 studies conducted over 50 years in the US for the research, published in the American Psychological Associations Psychological Bulletin.         
	Rachel Lucas-Thompson, who led the research, analysed the behaviour and school results of children whose mothers returned to work either part-time or full-time within three years of giving birth.         
	She found that pupils from more affluent, two-parent families whose mothers returned to work before their first birthday tended to fare less well academically.         
	They were also found to be slightly more aggressive and their teachers were more likely to report behavioural problems.         
	Dr Lucas-Thompson said for higher-income families, its possible that alternative care arrangements may not be as emotionally supportive as the childs mother.         
	The findings indicated that politicians should consider encouraging employers to allow more generous maternity leave.         
	If parents could postpone work or if they were allowed to work fewer hours during that first year, I think it could only have positive effects on children, said Dr Lucas-Thompson.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gadkari patience pill for Uma
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Gadkari patience pill for Uma
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                             Nitin Gadkari,   Uma Bharti                          
	New Delhi, July 14: BJP president Nitin Gadkari assured Uma Bharti that she was as good as a party member and her formal re-induction was a matter of time, a source close to him said.         
	The assurance was given when Uma met Gadkari last Saturday in New Delhi. He explained to her that her re-entry could have taken place this week but for some lingering opposition from the Madhya Pradesh BJP, the source said.         
	It is learnt that Gadkari emphatically said he and veteran leader L.K. Advani supported her 100 per cent and if anyone in the central BJP attempted to thwart Umas re-entry, he or she would be told off.         
	Uma also has the support of RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat, although the Sanghs general secretary, Suresh Soni, has serious reservations.         
	Soni, who belongs to Madhya Pradesh, has always had a big say in the states BJP politics and often vets crucial organisational appointments.         
	Gadkari apparently claimed he had neutralised much of the resistance to Umas comeback. But Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Chauhan and state BJP president Prabhat Jha oppose her return. That, too, will be settled to everyones satisfaction, said the source close to the BJP president.         
	Gadkari told journalists at a dinner he hosted on Tuesday night that Umas return was inevitable but might take a bit of time.         
	Gadkari advised Uma  given to speaking aloud her mind  to lie low and avoid the media. She has set on a gupt navratra (secret nine days) pilgrimage to lesser-known religious places and will be out of reach even to her aides.         
	Neutral observers in the BJP felt the sudden show of dissent in the Madhya Pradesh BJP was calculated to corner Chauhan and eventually blunt his intransigence towards Uma.         
	Two of Chauhans senior cabinet ministers  Babulal Gaur and Kailash Vijayvargiya  openly campaigned for her return as did veteran MPs Sumitra Mahajan and Kailash Joshi.         
	Gaur had threatened to quit but was stopped by the chief minister. He warned Chauhan not to take things lightly.

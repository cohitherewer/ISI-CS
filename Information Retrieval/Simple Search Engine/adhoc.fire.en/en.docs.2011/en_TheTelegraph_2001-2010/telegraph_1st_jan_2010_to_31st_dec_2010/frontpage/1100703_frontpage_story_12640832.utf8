          AMIT GUPTA                             MP Nathanael (centre) in Ranchi on Friday. (Manik Bose)                                  
	Ranchi, July 2: CRPF inspector-general (operations) M.P. Nathanael arrived in Ranchi today in an attempt to strengthen the paramilitary apparatus in Jharkhand in the wake of the latest Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh.         
	Nathanael, who takes charge in Jharkhand in a post specially created by the CRPF for Maoist-hit states, will look after the 12 battalions  with six companies in each  deployed in Jharkhand to counter the rebels.         
	 This apart, a battalion  18 units with 30 personnel in each  of the Cobra has also been pressed into services while another battalion is to be deputed soon.        
	Nathanaels posting will be beneficial for our anti-Naxalite strategies that have proved to be successful so far. We are working in tandem and will move the forces, including the CRPF and the state police, according to specific needs, DGP Neyaz Ahmed told The Telegraph.         
	 He, however, maintained that there was no specific instruction from the Centre on redeploying forces.         
	 According to CRPF sources, the state police top brass, including two DIGs and 14 commandants, would make a presentation on Monday to Nathanael about the states Naxalite corridor.         
	As expected, he did not speak to the media after arriving at the Birsa Munda airport at 4 pm.         
	The CRPF has already posted two DIG-ranked officers, Bhanu Pratap Singh and B.K. Sharma, in Jharkhand to oversee anti-Naxalite operations in the southern and northern parts of the state described as the epicentre of Left-wing extremism by home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	DIG (CRPF) Alok Raj has been repatriated to his original IPS cadre in Bihar, confirmed senior CRPF sources.         
	In another administrative change, Punjab cadre IPS officer Arun Oraon, with roots in Jharkhand, is likely to hold charge as inspector general (operations) of state police in place of D.K. Pandey, who, along with other senior officials, is leaving for a training programme.         
	We are careful and act on pin-pointed intelligence inputs. Here in Jharkhand the situation is different from Chhattisgarh. Forces are sufficient in number while armed squads of Maoists are apparently not getting the support of the masses, said a senior CRPF official.

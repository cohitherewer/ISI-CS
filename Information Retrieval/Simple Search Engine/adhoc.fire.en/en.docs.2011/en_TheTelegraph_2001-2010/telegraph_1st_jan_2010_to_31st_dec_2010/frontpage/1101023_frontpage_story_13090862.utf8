          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Stefano Allievi                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: When Italian academic Stefano Allievi heard about Allahabad High Court upholding the disputed site in Ayodhya as Rams birthplace, he was surprised.        
	In Italy, courts have no right to rewrite or interpret history... (they) can only judge specific empirical claims, said the sociology professor at Padua University who specialises on the presence of Islam in Europe.        
	Allievi, who was in Delhi to attend a seminar on Cultural and Religious Pluralism that sought to compare the conditions of the Muslim minority in India and Europe, said the ownership of a religious place would not be a legal issue in Europe.        
	In Spain, for instance, the La Mezquita or Great Mosque of Cordoba, built in the eighth century after the Moors conquered the country, was converted into a cathedral when Christian armies reclaimed the place in 1236.        
	With the number of Muslim immigrants now growing in Spain, there have been demands that it be reconverted into a mosque, but the issue hasnt gone to court. The courts can only judge whose property it is now, Allievi said.        
	He, however, admitted that the same laws did not always apply equally to churches and mosques in Italy.        
	In northern Italy, it is difficult to open a mosque. They have been closed on the basis of safety regulations but there is a selective application of laws. The same laws may be flouted by churches and schools but they are not touched, he said.        
	Asked how he viewed Hindu-Muslim integration or the lack of it  in India, he said: Its completely different from European models. Muslims have been in India for centuries; they (Muslim immigrants) are relatively new to Europe, three decades or so, even less in Italy.        
	In India, Muslims are part of the nation... in Europe, they are not. In Italy, most immigrants are not citizens, they cant vote. Even today, politicians can say the worst things about Muslims and get away with it. It would be unacceptable to say the same things about Jews, he said.

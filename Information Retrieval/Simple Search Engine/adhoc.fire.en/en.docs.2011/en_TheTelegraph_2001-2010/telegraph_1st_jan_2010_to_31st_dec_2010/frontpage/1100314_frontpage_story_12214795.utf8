          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, March 13: Naga village chiefs of Manipurs Senapati district today echoed their counterparts in Ukhrul district while demanding the integration of all Naga-inhabited areas and extending support to the ongoing peace talks between New Delhi and the NSCN (Isak-Muivah).         
	The declaration was made in a consultative meeting held at Taphou community hall under the aegis of the United Naga Council (UNC).         
	The meeting was attended by Maram, Thangal, Chiru, Kharam and Zeliangrong Senapati zone tribal leaders, village chiefs, headmen, chairmen and Naga organisations like the UNC, All Naga Students Association, Manipur, Senapati District Students Association, Senapati District Womens Association, Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights and the Naga Womens Union, Manipur.        
	Any settlement which excludes unification of Naga territories will not be honourable nor bring lasting peace, the declaration said.         
	It urged the Centre to demonstrate political will to resolve the Naga issue in a manner honourable to the Nagas.         
	The UNC is likely to hold such consultative meetings in the other Naga-dominated districts of Manipur as well.        
	At the meeting held in Ukhrul district on Thursday, Tangkhul Nagas had extended their support to the ongoing peace talks. However, they had stressed the integration of all Naga-inhabited areas for an honourable solution to the Naga issue and lasting peace.

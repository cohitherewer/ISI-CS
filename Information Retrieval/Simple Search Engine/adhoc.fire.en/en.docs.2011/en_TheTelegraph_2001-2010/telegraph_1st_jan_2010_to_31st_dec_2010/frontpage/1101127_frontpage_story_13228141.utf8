          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                     
	Ranchi, Nov. 26: The state governments decision to transfer a number of administrative and police officers yesterday has invited the displeasure of the State Election Commission, which today said the major rejig violated the model code of conduct in place for the panchayat elections.        
	The commission shot off a letter to chief secretary A.K. Singh and said the state should refrain from transferring superintendents and deputy superintendents of police and other officials directly or indirectly related to electoral work.         
	The state government yesterday transferred 15 IPS officers, including Dhanbad SP Suman Gupta, Pakur SP Md Nehal and Jamtara SP M.P. Lakra, and five DSPs. It also transferred and gave additional charge to a dozen IAS officers. We have not named any official to be kept out of the purview of transfer as we did not have a list from the government. We have taken suo motu cognisance of the reports about the transfers as they appeared in various newspapers, commission secretary M.K. Jha said, adding that SPs and DSPs were directly involved in electoral work.        
	If they are necessary on administrative grounds, the government should take the concurrence of the commission before effecting transfers, Jha said.        
	According to the model code of conduct issued by the commission, the state government cannot transfer officers, including district election officials, implying the deputy commissioner, panchayat officers, returning or assistant returning officers, directly related to the electoral process.        
	The government will also require the permission of the commission to make transfers of officers of other departments as their services may be required for electoral work, the model code stated.        
	The government could transfer such officers under special circumstances or on administrative grounds after taking the permission of the commission, the code added.        
	The five-phase panchayat elections, which begin tomorrow, will be over by December 28, when the counting for the final phase will end.         
	The chief secretary later said the commissions letter had been sent to the personnel as well as the home departments for compliance. Personnel secretary Aditya Swaroop said the transfers would not be stayed. We will seek the concurrence of the commission, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CBI steps in to probe Koda
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CBI steps in to probe Koda
  - Agency agrees to Governor Farooks request          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                     
	Ranchi, July 11: The CBI has agreed to take over the probe into the multi-crore money laundering scam involving former chief minister Madhu Koda and others after a gentle nudge from Governor M..H. Farook.        
	Confirming the development, governors adviser V.S. Dubey told The Telegraph that we had written to the CBI to know about its readiness to take up the cases.         
	Generally the CBIs hands are full. So, we wanted to first seek the investigation agencys opinion. Now that the CBI is ready to take up the case, we will take a decision on the issue soon.        
	The Shibu Soren government had turned down the plea for a CBI probe on the grounds that the state Vigilance Bureau as well as the IT and Enforcement Directorate were competent enough to investigate the cases against Koda and his cabinet colleagues, embarrassing ally BJP no less as it had all along campaigned against the Congress-backed former chief minister for having allowed corruption to flourish.        
	While the IT probe is nearing end, EDs investigations are still on.                                 
	The Vigilance Bureau has also filed a primary chargesheet against Koda and Co who t include former ministers Hari Narayan Rai, Anosh Ekka, Dulal Bhuiyan, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Kamlesh Singh and Bandhu Tirkey.        
	Koda, who is at the centre of the multi-crore money laundering scam, has been in jail since November 30 last year after his arrest by the Vigilance Bureau.         
	According to sources, a demi-official letter, written by the CBI directorate, seeks the Jharkhand administration to fully assist the agency in carrying out the probe.        
	Senior BJP leader Saryu Roy, who has been fighting for a CBI probe, said that the Governor should immediately hand over the case to the CBI so that the powerful gang behind the scam was brought to book and international ramifications of the scam were unearthed to recover the money.        
	He said information gathered by the IT and ED in the course of investigations give sufficient indication towards the criminal angle of the scam.

          PULLOCK DUTTA                                          Alka with her twins.   Picture by Sushil Daila      
	Guwahati, Dec. 15: If you are wondering how Manmohan Singh is bearing the burden of governance and scandals, spare a thought for Alka, who is also domiciled in Assam like the Prime Minister.        
	Well, Alkas burden  far more pleasant than that of Singh, no doubt  became a bit lighter last night when the elephant delivered twins at Orang National Park in central Assam. The female calves are doing fine.        
	Twins are very, very rare in the domesticated world of elephants (Alka is part of such a herd in the park), though not unheard of. I have never heard of an elephant giving birth to twins but I am not an expert in the field. Maybe it has happened elsewhere, chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Suresh Chand said.         
	Let us hear out an expert then. Elephants are like human beings and birth of twins can take place. But this is very, very rare, said elephant expert Bhupen Talukdar.        
	Talukdar, who has done extensive research on elephants for decades, said he had not come across such an incident in Assam in the last 30 years. I cant say whether births of twins have taken place in wild herds but in domesticated elephants, this has not happened in the last three decades in Assam.         
	What about Bengal? Atanu Kumar Raha, principal chief conservator of forests, Bengal, expressed surprise at the twin births. Is that so? I have never come across an elephant giving birth to twin calves, at least not in our state, during my career as a forester. It is indeed a rare event.         
	Down south in Kerala, which takes pride in its elephants, the news evoked the same reaction but probably with some neighbours envy. K.C. Panicker, a professor and secretary of the Thrissur-based Elephant Welfare Association, said: It has not been recorded in Kerala. But the latest in south India was at Mudumalai wildlife sanctuary in Tamil Nadu, where twins were born 10 years ago. Bharani and Aswathi, brother and sister, are doing fine.        
	Keralas neighbour Tamil Nadu seems to be having something going for it. There was another pair, 25 years back, at Top Slip sanctuary near Parambikulam on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border  Sujai and Vijai, both males, Panicker added.        
	The 30-year-old Alka already has a four-year-old calf. The park has 23 domesticated elephants and five calves were born this year.         
	Wildlife scientists say twin births among elephants are rare because a large-bodied animal would have to invest significantly higher effort to obtain nutritious food for twin foetuses. It is more likely to occur in wild elephants who have access to both wild food as well as cultivated crops which are more nutritious, said Binod Choudhury, a scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehra Dun.         
	Choudhury said in recent years wildlife scientists have observed a slight increase in the frequency of twin births among large herbivores such as the nilgai or the black buck, particularly when the mammals have had access to cultivated crops.        
	But the last word should go to Bengals Raha, who thoughtfully pointed out: Elephants are large animals and carrying two calves by one mother should be very difficult.

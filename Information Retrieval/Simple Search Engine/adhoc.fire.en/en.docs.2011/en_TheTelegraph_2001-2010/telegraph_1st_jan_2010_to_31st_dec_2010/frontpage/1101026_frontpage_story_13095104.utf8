                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                East West loses sense of direction
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                            East West Metro work in progress in Salt Lake, near the site of the proposed City Centre station. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                      
	The East West Metro, one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects taken up in the city, has lost steam with the state government accusing the railways of non-cooperation and traders refusing to vacate land for the project. A Metro guide to the proposed rail link across the city and the problems that are keeping it from becoming a reality.        
	Project plan        
	Calcutta Metro Railway Corporation (CMRC), a joint venture of the central and the state governments, is the implementing authority of the project, which will cover 13.7km from Salt Lake Sector V to Howrah Maidan. Around 100ft of the stretch, between Mahakaran and Howrah stations, will be under the Hooghly.         
	Half the 12 air-conditioned stations  Sector V, Karunamoyee, Central Park, City Centre, Bengal Chemical depot and Salt Lake stadium  will be elevated. The others  Phoolbagan, Sealdah, Central, Mahakaran, Howrah station and Howrah Maidan  will be underground.        
	The Rs 4,874-crore project was started on February 20, 2009. The deadline for the stretch between Sector V and Central is October 2013 and for the rest of the route is October 2014.        
	Traffic trouble        
	CMRC officials claimed commuters would not be inconvenienced as tunnel-boring machines that only need to be installed at specific locations will be used. Traffic will need to be diverted only near the sites where stations would be constructed following the cut-and-cover method.        
	Status report         
	The elevated stretch: Construction of pillars and girders are in full swing. According to CMRC officials, about 70 per cent of the civil engineering work has been completed and the remaining work will be completed by early next year.                        Problems between the state government and the railway minister have held up work at Howrah station				     
	Subhas Sarobar: Talks are on with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for diversion of underground sewage and water pipes. We have got the preliminary clearances from the civic body and will shift the pipelines as soon as we get the full clearance. The CMRC will fund the diversion, said an official.        
	Phoolbagan: Traffic will be disrupted on a part of CIT Road from early next month as a tunnel-boring machine will be installed.        
	Howrah Maidan: Area demarcation for construction of passenger interchange terminals has started.        
	Under the Hooghly: The tunnel will be dug at a depth of 25 feet over a 100m stretch under the Hooghly. At other places the tunnel will be 15ft deep. Work has not yet started in this section, said a CMRC executive engineer.        
	Problem points         
	Sealdah and Howrah: Non-co-operation by the railways has stalled work at Sealdah and Howrah stations, said CMRC officials. The East West Metro authorities need about 15,000sq m each at Howrah and Sealdah stations and had paid Rs 5 crore of the total Rs 30 crore bill for the land. According to the CMRC, the railways has not handed over the land.        
	Howrah Maidan: About 50 traders, who support the Trinamul Congress and own over 140 stores at Shree Market in Howrah Maidan, where the proposed terminal is scheduled to come up, have refused to vacate the market and shift to temporary stalls around the Howrah stadium.        
	Possible solution        
	If the Left Front government and the railway ministry, headed by Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, works in conjunction many of the problems can be ironed out.        
	Railway version        
	Calcutta police, the CMC, railways and the CMRC are involved with the construction at Sealdah. We have been trying to hold a meeting involving the parties concerned to discuss certain issues but it has not been possible. Once the issues are decided we will give the relevant permissions, said a senior official.        
	At Howrah station, preliminary permission has been granted but the CMRC officials have not been able to find a spot to dig a 30ft deep hole necessary for further construction, he added.

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                       Pranab: Development man                          
	New Delhi, May 23: The government will push ahead with development work in the Maoist-affected regions of eastern and central India to try and end tribal alienation.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told The Telegraph in an interview on the occasion of the first anniversary of the UPA government: We have to step up development projects in Naxal-affected tribal areas.        
	To an extent policy makers are to blame for not being able to address the issue of tribal alienation, he added.         
	Mukherjees statement stressing the need for development and addressing tribal alienation puts in focus the thinking in the government that the Maoist insurgency can be fought only if the food bowl accompanies the fire.        
	Within the government and the ruling Congress a debate has been raging, often in public, over which should take primacy: a military or a development strategy.         
	The finance ministers statement seems to indicate that development work cannot stop for counter-insurgency operations. That is not to say that Mukherjee believes in going soft on firepower. He has himself spoken of giving more powers to the home minister, if required, to tackle insurgency.         
	The Naxalite-affected districts of Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar are among the poorest in the country, reporting the lowest literacy rates and the highest incidence of under-nourishment. Studies show that 85 of the countrys 100 poorest districts are in the so-called Red Belt.         
	We should not take it for granted that tribals are only concerned with ethnic exclusivity; they too have to gain from the fruits of the economic growth which India has been experiencing. We cannot have a dichotomy in our approach to various parts of India, Mukherjee said.         
	Through their violent methods, the Maoists have grabbed national attention for a region where a third of the population lives below the poverty line.         
	Roads, schooling, jobs, healthcare, sanitation programmes have to be brought to these districts even though bringing them in an atmosphere of militancy will be costlier and difficult, said the minister, who runs virtually every cabinet sub-committee.         
	 The delivery mechanism and monitoring of development work has to be improved people in poorer areas cannot be made to wait development there is a must.         
	Although the minister did not spell out how much funds would be set apart to woo the tribals back into the mainstream, officials in his ministry said enough money was available under central schemes. But these could be enhanced and more money granted as these are difficult areas, they said.         
	The Maoists, who started out as Naxalites in Bengal in the 1960s, saw a huge resurgence from 2002 when the forested tribal areas witnessed a surge in mining.         
	The rebel menace increased alongside the jobless mining boom of 2002-06, when employment in the mining industry dropped by 30 per cent. This was accompanied by allegations of low compensation for land and use of strong-arm tactics to get tribals to vacate mineral-rich areas.        
	Mukherjee said: For people to believe in the Indian state we have to increase the feeling of oneness.         
	Although the insurgency-ridden areas produce minerals worth over Rs 99,000 crore a year, the areas suffer from what economists call a resource curse  rich in resources but poor in social indicators and income levels.

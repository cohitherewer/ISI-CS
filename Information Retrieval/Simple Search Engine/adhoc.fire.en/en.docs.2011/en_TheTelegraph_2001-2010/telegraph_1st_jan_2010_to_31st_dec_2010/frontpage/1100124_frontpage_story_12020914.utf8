The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sports to return to Valley stadium
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sports to return to Valley stadium
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                             The Sher-e-Kashmir Indoor Stadium                                  
	Srinagar, Jan. 23: Kashmirs only indoor stadium will be thrown open for sports after 20 years with the CRPF vacating the installation.         
	The CRPF has vacated the place and sports-loving youth can soon go back to the stadium, central Kashmir police chief H.K. Lohia said.         
	The CRPF had occupied the Sher-e-Kashmir Indoor Stadium, with a capacity of 5,000, at the peak of militancy in 1990, dealing a blow to sports in the Valley.         
	The stadium had been inaugurated in 1983 by then chief minister Farooq Abdullah and for years it had been the only source of recreation in winter.         
	Our sports minister, R.S. Chib, had taken up the issue with the Prime Minister when he last met him. It is an outcome of those efforts, Shameen Ahmad Laharwal, director-general, youth service and sports, said.         
	Laharwal said the government was planning to restore the stadium. It is in a shambles. We are hiring an architect to prepare a project report for its restoration. An amount of Rs 1 crore has been earmarked for the purpose, he said.         
	The CRPF, has however, not entirely left the stadium campus. They have occupied the adjoining Saifuddin Hall, which used to host billiards matches. We were told that they will leave the complex completely but this is fresh occupation, Laharwal said.         
	The hall, which also housed the passport office, had been partially burnt in a fidayeen attack a few years back.         
	Two rooms in the hall are with the CRPF. You need to provide security to a number of installations nearby. So forces cannot completely leave the place, police officer Lohia said.         
	The CRPF will be using the backyard as a parking bay but this a temporary arrangement. That also will be vacated when some alternative place is found, he added.         
	The stadium is one of several important facilities vacated by the troops in the past two years. A few months back, the hostel building of the Institute of Hotel Management at Rajbagh was vacated for the students.

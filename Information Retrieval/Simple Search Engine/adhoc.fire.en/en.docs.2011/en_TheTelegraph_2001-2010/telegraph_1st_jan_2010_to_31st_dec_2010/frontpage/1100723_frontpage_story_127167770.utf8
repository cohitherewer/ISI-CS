	Gandhinagar, Jul 23 (PTI): Gujarat's junior Home Minister Amit Shah, a close aide of Narendra Modi, today sought more time to appear before the CBI for questioning in connection with the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case but his plea was turned down by the probe agency.
    Shah was given time till 1 PM today to appear before the CBI after second summons was sent to him yesterday when he did not respond to the first summons to show up before the agency.
    Shah's lawyer Mitish Amin, who went to the CBI office here, said a request was made to the agency to request for more time and consider the option of handing a questionnaire to the Minister to respond to their questions.
    However, CBI has turned down the request to give a questionnaire, Amin said.

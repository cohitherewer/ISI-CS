          OUR CORRESPONDENT                             Ujjwal Choudhary                                
	Ranchi, March 30: Jharkhand High Court today made it clear that director (income tax investigation) Ujjwal Choudhary, who is probing the multi-crore scam allegedly involving former chief minister Madhu Koda and his associates, would continue in his current post till further orders.         
	On the question of handing over the probe to the CBI, the court asked the income tax department and the Enforcement Directorate to explain if their investigations would be hampered if the central agency was asked to take over and asked them to file an affidavit by April 8 when the case would come up for hearing again.        
	The courts observations were made on the basis of two separate PILs filed by Durga Oraon  one on February 19, the day Choudhary was transferred unceremoniously along with 28 other senior income tax officials and the other in September 2008 seeking a CBI probe into the alleged disproportionate assets cases against Koda and his former ministers.        
	The court, while hearing Oraons February 19 petition, stayed Choudharys transfer on February 23 for three months and sought an explanation from the income tax department for shifting him while investigations were underway.         
	The income tax department filed an affidavit on March 23 justifying the transfer, adding that his shift would not affect investigations into the DA case of the former ministers.                                             
	Today, with the court admitting the original petition, it was clear that Chaudhary would remain in the saddle till the case was disposed.                                      
	In response to the courts query of December 2009, the state government had said in its affidavit of January 28 that no CBI investigation was required as the vigilance bureau was competent to investigate the matter on its own.        
	On March 23, the court asked the state government again on involving the CBI. But it was yet to file a reply.        
	Both the IT department and ED have also filed separate status reports and informed the court that investigations against the tainted former ministers were progressing well.        
	Many documents had been recovered from their possession, they said, indicating they had accumulated assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.

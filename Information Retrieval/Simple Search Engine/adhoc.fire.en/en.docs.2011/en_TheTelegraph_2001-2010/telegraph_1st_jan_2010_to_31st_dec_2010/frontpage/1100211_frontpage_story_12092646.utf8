          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: The special cell of Delhi police arrested the finance chief of the Manipur-based militant outfit, Peoples United Liberation Front (PULF) here today.        
	Acting on a tip-off, the police arrested Sheikh Sadik Hussain alias Nazir, 40, from South Delhi this afternoon.         
	The development comes two months after the arrest of Rehauddin, the self-styled commander-in-chief of the outfit in Guwahati.         
	Sources said intelligence inputs from the Manipur police led to the arrest of the PULF rebel.         
	A graduate from Imphal University, Nazir had resided in the national capital for the past two years and is suspected to be the heading the finance department of the banned organisation, the police said.         
	Nazir, who claimed to be a businessman, was staying in a rented accommodation in the Hauz Khas area here with his wife, children. His two sisters, one of whom works as a nurse in a hospital here while the other is a teacher in an engineering college in Faridabad, also live with him.         
	The militant also claimed that his only link to Manipur was a recent tender that he won regarding an educational institute that is yet to open in the northeastern state.         
	The police said Nazir was wanted in at least four cases, including an attempt to murder. He was also charged under the Arms Act and Explosives Act.         
	A court has granted five days transit remand for the Manipur police.         
	The PULF, founded in 1993, claims to represent the interests of the Pangal (Muslim) community in Manipur. While other Islamist outfits in Manipur have disintegrated, the PULF survived and has been bolstered following the May 30, 2007 merger with the Islamic National Front.

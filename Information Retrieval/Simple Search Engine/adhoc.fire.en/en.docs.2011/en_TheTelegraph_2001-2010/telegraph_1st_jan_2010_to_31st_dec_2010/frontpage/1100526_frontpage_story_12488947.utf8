          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Biman Bose   File picture      
	Calcutta, May 25: Bengal CPM chief Biman Bose today desisted from ruling out a Siliguri experiment after the elections, keeping open the theoretical possibility of a rapprochement with the Congress.        
	In Siliguri, the Left had offered outside support to the Congress to initially deny the Trinamul Congress a chance to form the municipal board. The Congress and Trinamul eventually mended fences in Siliguri.        
	Boses guarded comments on the post-poll scenario came a day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh suggested that he wished for  but did not expect  the structured support of the Left. Singh had also emphasised the left-of-centre aspects of his government and made a broad appeal to parties that support inclusive growth.        
	Bose was understandably cautious in making any overture to the Congress as it would buttress Mamata Banerjees exclusive claim to the Opposition space in Bengal at a time the CPM was pinning its hopes on a split in the Opposition votes.        
	We have not discussed such possibilities. Earlier, we had never formed a civic board with Congress support. I dont think such a situation will arise this time. We will form boards on our own. But it would be different if a situation like Siliguri recurs, Bose said, keeping the door ajar for support from outside to keep the Trinamul Congress at bay.                                                        
	The CPM has been officially trying to insist that the Congress and Trinamul still have a ground-level alliance. However, the anti-Trinamul thrust of the CPMs campaign has been unmistakable with both chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Bose making a distinction between the two parties.        
	At campaign meetings, the two CPM leaders criticism of the Congress was limited to the Centres failures to curb price rise and its pro-rich economic policies. But the Trinamul chief was portrayed as a violent, irresponsible politician hungry to grab power with the help of armed Maoists and separatists in north Bengal.         
	Prime Minister Singhs renewed assertion that the Maoists were the biggest threat to internal security and the caution against public debate among cabinet members on how to deal with the guerrillas helped Bose harp on Mamatas disconnect with the Centres policies.        
	Without naming Mamata, Bose stressed on the behavioural differences of the Left and Trinamul as coalition partners of the Congress.        
	 We have not discussed about the UPA (in its second avatar). But one thing is clear that the Lefts opposition was based on principles and policies. We were never erratic, we raised issues on merit and remained consistent in our position. We didnt change our days position at night, Bose said, almost echoing several Congress leaders who concede that life was far less rocky when the Left was their ally.        
	But Bose took care not to stretch the point, knowing well how divided his own party is over its relationship with the Congress at the Centre.        
	The Prime Minister did not speak of opening any dialogue with the Left. How can we react on what he did not say? Bose asked, without cold-shouldering Singh but lobbing the ball into the Congress court.        
	As the state CPM chief, Bose also tried to accommodate the views of the central leadership which feels local factor were more responsible for the Lok Sabha poll debacle than the withdrawal of support to UPA-I.        
	We have reviewed all the factors. Its true we could not convince people about the withdrawal of our support since the common man didnt understand the ramifications of the nuclear deal. But we should factor in our failures in convincing the people about the state governments initiatives (on industrialisation) and the Oppositions role, Bose said.         
	If the support withdrawal was the sole factor for our poor results, how can we explain our losses in panchayat polls in 2008 when we were still with the UPA? Bose asked.

          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: A female live-in partner can claim maintenance only if the relationship meets certain conditions and does not amount just to a one-night stand or a few weekends together, the Supreme Court held today.        
	It set out the four conditions, the last of which rules out maintenance if either live-in partner is married to someone else at the time of the relationship:        
	 The couple should have presented themselves before society as akin to man and wife;        
	 They should have lived together under one roof and in a shared household for a significant period;        
	 Both must have attained the legal age to marry;        
	 Both must have been eligible to marry legally (so they must have been unmarried, among other things).        
	Merely spending weekends together or a one-night stand would not entitle the woman partner to maintenance, the bench of Justice Markandey Katju and Justice T.S. Thakur said.        
	Nor would a mans relationship with a servant, or with a keep whom he maintains financially and uses mainly for sexual purpose, qualify.        
	The task before the court was to interpret the phrase relationship in the nature of marriage in the Domestic Violence Act of 2005, which expanded the scope of maintenance, till then the exclusive right of a mans legally wedded wife, children and dependent parents.        
	The act gave the right also to any woman in a domestic relationship, saying this included not only marriage but also any relationship in the nature of marriage. But it left the last expression undefined.        
	We think it necessary to interpret because a large number of cases will be coming up before the court(s), the bench said.        
	It added: No doubt the view we are taking would exclude many women who have had a live-in relationship from the benefit of the 2005 Act, but then it is not for this court to legislate or amend the law. Parliament has used the expression relationship in the nature of marriage and not live-in relationship.        
	Nor did the judges rule on the case of women who live in with a married man under the mistaken notion that he is single. This issue has been referred to a larger bench by another apex court bench, which felt that extending the maintenance rights too much could undermine the rights of the legally wedded wife and encourage claims from women in short-lived relationships.        
	Todays ruling came as the court set aside the judgments of a Tamil Nadu family court and Madras High Court, both of which awarded maintenance to a woman live-in partner even though the man claimed he was married to another.        
	The apex court sent the case back to the family court to decide whether the couple had lived together long enough in a shared household, and whether the man was at the time married to another.

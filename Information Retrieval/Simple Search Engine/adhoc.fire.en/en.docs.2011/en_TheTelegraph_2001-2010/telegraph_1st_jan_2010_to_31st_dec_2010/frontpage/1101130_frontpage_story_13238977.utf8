The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Voda versus Tata (plus Anil)
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Voda versus Tata (plus Anil)

	New Delhi, Nov. 29: Ratan Tata has set the radio waves crackling as a fresh war of words broke out today over his charge that some telecom titans have hogged extra spectrum without paying a dime for it.        
	Vodafone Essar rubbished Tatas implicit charge that some GSM players had been hoarding spectrum in violation of rules.        
	Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a technology that came out of Europe and is the standard used by 80 per cent of the worlds mobile networks.        
	In an interview aired on NDTV on Saturday, Tata had said the government needed to deal with people who have excess spectrum. They should pay for it or return it. They have deprived others of the spectrum.        
	It is ridiculous to imply that the incumbent GSM players are hoarding spectrum, Vodafone Essar said in a statement today.        
	There has been no violation of licence conditions in the allotment of additional spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz. No spectrum in excess of what was permissible has been granted to any mobile operator, Vodafone added.        
	Spectrum is a stack of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation necessary to offer any form of wireless services, including mobile telephony. The Tatas use code division multiple access (CDMA) technology as well as GSM.        
	However, Tata found an unlikely ally in Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications (R-Com)  another telecom player that largely uses CDMA technology  which also accused the old GSM operators of snagging spectrum for free between May 2008 and March 2009.         
	They (the old GSM operators) did not even pay for excess spectrum at the old rates. Reliance Communications and the Tatas have consistently raised this issue with the department of telecommunications, the Anil Ambani group company said.        
	R-Com was also taking a sideswipe at the comptroller and auditor generals recent report which said that some of the new telecom players had bagged spectrum out of turn by paying prices that had been fixed in 2001.         
	Swan Telecom  one of those new telecom entities  initially had R-Com as one of its shareholders. On Monday, telecom minister Kapil Sibal referred its case to the ministry of corporate affairs to unveil its true antecedents.        
	Bharti Airtel  Asias largest mobile service provider which claims a subscriber base of over 200 million in 19 countries  chose to remain silent even as the furious debate polarised players along the fault lines of technology.        
	At present, GSM and CDMA operators get 4.4 MHz and 2.5 MHz of start-up radio frequencies, respectively, when they pay the licence fee. The allotment for GSM operators rises to 6.2 MHz on attaining a certain subscriber threshold.        
	However, in some circles, including Mumbai and Delhi, Vodafone and Airtel were granted as much as 10 MHz of spectrum in order to provide fault-free services to a very large subscriber base.        
	India has allotted 100 MHz of spectrum to GSM players  25 MHz spectrum in the 900 MHz band and 75 MHz in the 1800 MHz band. In contrast, it has allotted only 20 MHz in the 800 MHz band to CDMA players.        
	Airtel has 168.8 MHz in the 22 circles in which it operates  giving it the largest share of radio waves in the country. Vodafone has 143.6 MHz in the same number of circles.        
	Reliance has 97.5 MHz in the 800 MHz CDMA band while the Tatas have only 80 MHz. Both also have some spectrum in the GSM frequencies after they decided to straddle both technologies.        
	Since the radio band allocation is restricted to a telecom circle, there is multiple counting of the same band when toting up a players total allocation of radio frequencies.        
	GSM players, who started operations in the early nineties, have often been accused of being inefficient users of spectrum. Most studies show that CDMA, which entered the country almost a decade later, is a far more efficient user of the radio waves.        
	Vodafone today tried to twist the efficiency argument on its head.        
	The CDMA spectrum has the capacity to serve at least 4 to 5 times more subscribers than GSM. It is the CDMA operators who are under-utilising spectrum as they are using it at levels far below the efficiency of the GSM players, said Vodafone.         
	The Tatas have always maintained that they were deprived of spectrum in the crucial Delhi circle even though they should have got priority over R-Com in the allocation of spectrum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nightmare on fast-track artery 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nightmare on fast-track artery

	The EM Bypass becomes a death trap for motorists at night with truck drivers tossing traffic rules out of their cabin. The men in uniform, who are supposed to keep them in check, cite lack of manpower to plead helplessness.         
	Forty-eight hours after three young lives were lost when a truck driver mounted a car between Parama island and Chingrihata, Metro drove the 19.5km length of the Bypass post midnight to identify the problem points.        
	Dark danger        
	On several kilometres of the Bypass, including the stretches between Baghajatin flyover and Patuli crossing, Ajoynagar and Prince Anwar Shah Road connector crossing, Ruby rotary and Ambedkar bridge and Ultadanga and Kadapara, the headlights of vehicles were the only source of illumination.         
	Bricks, sand, stone chips and even sewerage pipes were kept by the side of the road in several places, increasing the chances of mishaps. Last month, a vehicle moving at a high speed had lost control after skidding on a pile of sand and rammed into a truck from behind. Two passengers were injured, said the owner of a shop near the Tiljala crossing.        
	Project peril        
	Half the width of the artery has been blocked near Mani Square and Science City for work on the East-West Metro and construction of a flyover. After midnight, one of the flanks near Mani Square is shut down, forcing vehicles moving in opposite directions to share the other one, which is partially encroached by construction materials. There were no road signs or human beings to alert drivers of the switch.         
	The other day, I was driving at about 80kmph down the stretch, when I suddenly found vehicles speeding towards my car down the same flank from the opposite direction. I almost lost control and hit a truck. The authorities should definitely put up warning signs, said Abhinaba Dutta of Baguiati.        
	Terror trucks        
	Overloaded trucks often move along the Bypass at well over the speed limit of 60kmph with little regard for even the most basic traffic rule. The goods vehicles make sharp turns and switch lanes suddenly, endangering lives. Metro spotted a truck making a U-turn through a gap in the median divider.        
	Many trucks had one or both headlights switched off or were parked illegally by the side of the road.        
	Some truck drivers are so reckless that if we try to stop them for a road-rule violation, they try to run us over. Many often deliberately knock down guard rails meant to slow down vehicles, said a constable of Beleghata traffic guard.        
	Cop crunch        
	Absence of cops allows the truck drivers to break rules with impunity. Metro did not spot a single cop or a police patrol van on the stretch. Guard rails were unmanned, police booths at vital intersections deserted and traffic lights set on red or yellow blinking mode.               
	Official word: I did not know that construction agencies were not putting up proper road signs. I will ensure that they do so and ask officers to take steps to remove construction materials piled on the road. We have no plan to deploy cops on the Bypass at night, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee.

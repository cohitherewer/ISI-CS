          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, March 6: Stung by the ongoing teachers agitation, the Gauhati University (GU) administration today started preparations for a contingency plan to prevent disruption of the three-year degree course examinations.         
	A university official told The Telegraph that with the GU Teachers Association (GUTA) deciding to intensify its agitation from Monday and threatening to disrupt the ongoing degree examinations, the university administration did not want to take any chances.         
	The official said that vice-chancellor Okhil Kumar Medhi had already instructed the controller of examinations P.K. Deka to keep a contingency plan ready for smooth conduct of the examinations in case of a prolonged teachers agitation.         
	The teachers are resorting to total non-co-operation against non-implementation of the sixth revised new payscales approved by the UGC in 2008.         
	While the Part II examination is already under way, Parts I and III of the same degree course will start from the third week of this month.         
	The degree examinations will conclude by April and the semester examinations of post-graduate courses will start in May.         
	 Under the contingency plan, GU will hire retired teachers and extra manpower for various examination duties. The university will send the question papers to various colleges and examination centres much in advance.         
	If the situation arises, the university may request the state government to provide adequate security personnel for smooth conduct of the examinations. The details of the contingency plan will be worked out next week, a source said.         
	The university conducts the examinations at more than 200 colleges affiliated to GU.        
	The vice-chancellor today again had a discussion with the agitating teachers and appealed to them to spare the examinations from the purview of their agitation. Medhi also discussed the matter with the Assam College Principals Council (ACPC).         
	However, GUTA general secretary Jogen Chandra Kalita reiterated that the state government would be responsible if the teachers were forced to disrupt the examinations.         
	Till this date, we are sparing the examinations from the purview of our agitation. But teachers may lose patience to take extreme steps like disruption of examinations in case the government fails to make time-bound commitment to implement the revised pay, he said.         
	Representatives of AASU, Assam College Teachers Association and ACPC met the teachers on Friday evening and extended full support to the agitation.         
	AASU general secretary Tapan Kumar Gogoi said the demands of the GUTA were justified and that it was a shame the state government could not fulfil the teachers demands.

	New Delhi, Aug 31 (PTI): The Supreme Court today issued notices to all the accused in Bhopal gas leak case on a petition by the CBI seeking to restore against them the stringent charge of culpable homicide, which attracts a maximum punishment of 10 years' jail term.
    In in-chamber proceedings, a bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices Altamas Kabir and R V Raveendran sought response from the accused on the curative petition filed by the probe agency seeking recall of the apex court's 14-year-old judgement that had diluted the offence.
    The court listed the matter for hearing after the completion of the service.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 5: Five elite institutions tasked with bolstering science education will now admit students on the basis of Class XII board examination scores, being fed up with receiving leftover students from among IIT aspirants.        
	The Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER) so far admitted students from the IIT-JEE merit list apart from recipients of the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana scholarships offered by the department of science and technology.        
	But we found we were receiving applications only from students who rank lower down on the IIT merit list and fail to get the course they want at the IITs, a senior administrator at IISER Calcutta said.        
	So, for the first time, the science institutes will this year directly admit students with high scores in their Class XII boards, hoping to attract those genuinely interested in science. The IISERs were conceived by the scientific advisory committee to the Prime Minister, which was concerned that most bright students of science in school went on to choose engineering over the pure sciences.        
	The first two IISERs were started in 2006, in Calcutta and Pune, while the rest came up over the next two years in Bhopal, Mohali and Thiruvananthapuram. The institutes offer a five-year integrated masters-in-science (MS) programme that aims to motivate students to pursue further education and research.        
	We are changing our admissions policy (to attract) students for whom we are the first choice, IISER Bhopal director Vinod Singh said.        
	The IIT-JEE merit list includes those likely to receive seats, but low-ranking students often take admission to other engineering colleges to get a stream of their choice, thus wasting IIT seats. To avoid seat wastage, the IITs now release an extended merit list that includes many who would bag seats only if several students ranked above them opt out.        
	IISER administrators say the IIT aspirants lack of interest in pure science is such that even those low down on the first IIT merit list ignore the science schools. Its students from the extended list who mainly apply  if they fail to earn IIT seats.        
	The IISERs have decided they will not admit students from the IITs extended list this year. Those on the original merit list will stay eligible, and Kishore Vaigyanik scholars too can apply.        
	The large chunk of seats earlier filled by those from the extended IIT list will now be filled by students with high scores in their Class XII board exam. The science schools are working out a formula that will allow them to compare the scores of students from different school boards, some more generous than the others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | After Obama, Sarko security a cakewalk
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                After Obama, Sarko security a cakewalk
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                            Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: A French President is thriller fictions most celebrated assassin target: Charles de Gaulle in the tantalising crosshairs of Frederick Forsyths Jackal.        
	But Delhi police are suffering no anxieties as the current resident of the Elysee Palace, Nicolas Sarkozy, prepares to arrive on a four-day visit from Saturday, Carla Bruni on his arm.        
	Security is barely even being stretched. A top police officer said with palpable relief that compared with the high-tension ride President Barack Obama put the force through, the Sarkozy visit would be a breeze.        
	There is a sense of relief this time because the security arrangement will not be on the grand scale that it was during Obamas visit in early November, the officer said.        
	Unlike Obamas tour, this one is more of a private visit. Sarkozys plans include a romantic break with Bruni at the Taj Mahal, which the Obamas skipped.        
	On December 4, Sarkozy will arrive in Bangalore, where he will visit the Indian Space Research Organisation. The next day he will leave for Agra with Bruni.        
	The French President will be in New Delhi on December 6 where he will meet President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He will leave for Mumbai the next day before returning to Paris.        
	Sarkozys visit will lack the power and outreach that were on display during the Obamas stay in the capital from November 7 to 9. An official recalled how 500 FBI and Secret Service officers oversaw the US Presidents security and were in complete charge of the arrangements inside the ITC Maurya.        
	Some security personnel will accompany Sarkozy but the number will be much lower than that of the US security officials (during the Obama trip). French security officials have been in touch with us, and we have already given them the security plans, said a senior officer who is part of the security arrangement.        
	Sarkozy and Bruni are scheduled to stay in the Taj Palace (hotel) and we have made elaborate security arrangements there, he added.        
	The officer said Delhi police were not even allowed inside the ITC Maurya during the Obamas stay; they were in charge only of the security arrangements outside the hotel.        
	But this time our elite commando unit will be posted inside the hotel, he said.        
	During Obamas visit, snipers were posted atop residential complexes along the 10km route from the airport to the ITC Maurya, and at strategic locations. We may deploy snipers at some places this time too, but not atop residential buildings, the officer said.        
	A day before Obamas arrival, Delhi police conducted a rehearsal that was monitored by senior officers from the police, the Intelligence Bureau and the paramilitary forces.        
	There is no rehearsal this time. But it should not be construed as laxness in security. We have made elaborate security arrangements inside and outside the hotel and at places that Sarkozy and Bruni are scheduled to visit, the officer said.        
	According to him, everybody is more interested in Bruni. We are yet to learn whether she would visit some places (alone) as Michelle Obama had done, the officer added.

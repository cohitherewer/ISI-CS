The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dear Industry, from Mamata
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dear Industry, from Mamata
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 2: Business chambers and industrialists based in Calcutta received unfamiliar tidings on this New Years Day: a letter from Mamata Banerjee wishing them a prosperous 2010.        
	 It is an inspiring letter. After wishing us well, she has called for joining hands to build a better future, said D.P. Nag, the secretary of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	The letter, printed on a railway ministry letterhead, does not make any specific mention of Bengal, which goes to what is expected to be game-changing Assembly elections next year. Many industrialists had kept the letter in their office and it could not be accessed today because of the weekend holiday.        
	The letter has been marked to the chamber president. This is the first time we have received such a communication from her, said an official of the Merchant Chamber of Commerce.        
	One recipient said Mamata had sent him a letter on another New Years Day when she was member of Parliament but not a minister. But most others The Telegraph contacted said Fridays letter was the first they had received from Mamata.        
	A senior Trinamul leader said Mamata herself had chosen the content and design of the letter. It has gone to every chamber head and important businessperson without looking into which camp they belong to, the Trinamul functionary said.        
	The public relations exercise is being seen as an extension of Mamatas efforts to reassure industry, which had been rattled by her campaign tied to Nandigram and Singur.        
	She had held a meeting on August 29 at the headquarters of South Eastern Railway with all the Calcutta-based chambers of commerce.         
	If the industrialists had then gone back with a little more confidence in her, the New Year letter seems to have made some of them less circumspect.        
	I am pleasantly surprised. The possibility that she could be the next chief minister of Bengal makes the letter even more significant, said an industrialist who, however, chose to hedge his bets by requesting anonymity.        
	Stations renamed        
	Mamata said Baranagar station would be renamed Swami Vivekananda station. The station at Noapara will be called Ma Sarada station.        
	The two stations will be part of the first phase of expansion of Metro Rail from Dum Dum to Dakshineswar, the foundation stone for which was laid today. She said the names were being changed on the request of Swami Suvirananda Maharaj of Belur Math who was at the venue.

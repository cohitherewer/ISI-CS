          G.S. MUDUR AND ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                              
	Feb 26: Pranab Mukherjee has proposed a Rs 400-crore plan in the budget to extend the green revolution from the once-arid northwest that is now the countrys grain basket to the underperforming east, including home state Bengal.        
	Mukherjee said the initiative, which comes four decades after the seeds of the green revolution were sown elsewhere, needed the active involvement of farmers from all six states  Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and eastern Uttar Pradesh  to succeed.         
	The finance minister didnt elaborate but M.S. Swaminathan, the architect of the green revolution in Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh, said he thought it can be done, just as it was in the northwestern states, in five years.        
	 Ive always seen eastern India as a sleeping giant in agriculture, said the scientist who helped bring high-yielding wheat varieties to the northwest during the late 60s. We will need five important ingredients to take the green revolution to the east, he told The Telegraph, pitching for a soil health card for every farmer in the east.         
	A soil card would assess the conditions in each field, determine the nutrient and fertiliser requirements and allow farmers to manage different crops better.         
	Gujarat has already introduced soil health cards in a bid to increase the efficiency of fertilisers, Swaminathan said.        
	Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta welcomed the finance ministers proposal, terming it a statement of positive intention. Agriculture minister Naren De said his department intended using the money  as and when it comes  on increasing land productivity and implementing a slew of irrigation schemes.         
	For this, both canal irrigation and rain water harvesting will have to be done. A survey by the land department found around 11 lakh small ponds and water bodies spread across the state. We will try to increase their depth by five-six feet so that rainwater can be stored and used for irrigation. If this is done, land productivity will increase and help raise the output of vegetables and paddy in our state. But we have yet to know how much of the Rs 400 crore will come to our state, De added.        
	Apart from the promise of a green revolution, the budget held good news for Bengals coastal region in the form of a proposal to set up an alternative port facility on Sagar island. The state government had been planning to set up a deep sea port either in East Midnapore or Sagar island.        
	Schemes for the protection of embankments along the Bhagirathi and Ganga in parts of Murshidabad, Malda and Nadia have been brought under the purview of the centrally-sponsored flood management programme.        
	Funds have also been earmarked for the Keleghai-Kapaleswari-Baghai basin drainage scheme in West Midnapore and the Kandi master plan irrigation and drainage scheme in Murshidabad.        
	The agriculture-specific proposals in the budget include a Rs 300-crore plan to increase the productivity of dry-land farming areas through water harvesting and better soil management. The budget has also proposed a Rs 50,000-crore increase in the bank credit target for farmers to Rs 3,75,000 crore.         
	Swaminathan warned against accepting a suggestion by the finance minister that wastage in storage and the existing agricultural food supply chain could be reduced by opening up retail trade. Mukherjee had said in his budget speech that opening up retail trade could help reduce the difference between farm-gate, wholesale and retail prices.         
	A policy to open up retail [for farm products] should not be introduced without a study of the impact of such a move, Swaminathan said, calling for an employment impact analysis to assess the possible fallout of such a policy.         
	We should not do anything to create more unemployment, he said. Opening retail trade to large companies, whether national or multinational, needs to be taken up only on the basis of an employment analysis impact, he said, arguing that mini-retail and small-holder farming make up the largest employment enterprise in the country.

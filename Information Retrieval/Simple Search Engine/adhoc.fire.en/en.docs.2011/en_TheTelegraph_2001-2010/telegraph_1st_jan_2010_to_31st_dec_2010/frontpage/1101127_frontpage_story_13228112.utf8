The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Reunion after rath detour 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Reunion after rath detour 
          NALIN VERMA                            Parveen takes oath                                  
	Patna, Nov. 26: Mr Amanullah called out, Mrs Amanullah stepped forward and the charioteer in winter watched in silence.        
	A moment inconceivable in the divisive nineties unfolded in New Bihar this afternoon as Nitish Kumar was sworn in for a fresh term.         
	Among those who took oath as ministers was Parveen Amanullah (49), the daughter of Advanis chief ideological adversary, Syed Shahabuddin.        
	The man who called Parveen to take the oath was her husband, Afzal Amanullah, the IAS officer who mapped out the arrest of the BJP leader during his Ram rath yatra in 1990.         
	On one corner of the dais was Advani. If the momentous days of that fateful rath yatra flashed through his mind, Advani, who had since said December 6, 1992, was the saddest day of his life, did not show it.        
	As the principal secretary to the governor, Devanand Konwar, and the cabinet, Afzal was conducting the swearing-in proceedings on the dais.        
	Parveen, in a way, represents how Nitish has increased his acceptability among the Muslims, guarding his secular image even while staying with the BJP. Her presence also underscored Nitishs success in making the BJP behave the way he wants it to in the state. Not a single chant of Jai Shri Ram went up while the swearing-in was in progress.         
	Parveen, however, did not want to be dragged into ideological issues. I work for the cause of the poor people. Let me remain a simple social and political worker, Parveen told The Telegraph.        
	Parveen won from the Sahebpur-Kamal seat in north Bihars Begusarai district, about 140km from here. Her law graduate son, Azmat, and management graduate daughter, Rahmat, accompanied her during the campaign.        
	Parveens father Shahabuddin, the then chairman of the Babri Mosque Action Committee, had ferociously opposed Advanis Ram rath yatra in 1990.         
	Then posted as the deputy commissioner of Dhanbad in united Bihar, Afzal had charted out Advanis arrest when the rath crossed the states boundary through Dhanbad. The Lalu Prasad government had arrested Advani, which eventually led to the fall of the V.P. Singh government.

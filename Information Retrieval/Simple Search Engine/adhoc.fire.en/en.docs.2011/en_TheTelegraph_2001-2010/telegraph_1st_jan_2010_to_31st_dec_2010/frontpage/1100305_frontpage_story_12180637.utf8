  - Mamata publicly asks Pranab to withdraw service tax          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata Banerjee, Pranab Mukherjee                                
	, New Delhi, March 4: Railway minister Mamata Banerjee today expressed displeasure in Parliament over finance minister Pranab Mukherjees decision to impose service tax on goods transported by train, a rare instance of a cabinet minister questioning her governments move in public.         
	The service tax would rob the railways of key resources required to fulfil a slew of promises Mamata had made in her rail budget, the Trinamul Congress chief told the Lok Sabha, sitting barely three metres from Mukherjee.         
	Trinamul had yesterday assured Mukherjee it would not embarrass the government by opposing in Parliament the hike in fuel prices the minister had announced while presenting the budget proposals.         
	But today, Mamata made it clear that she was unhappy with the governments decision to levy the service tax, which the railways didnt have to pay earlier.        
	Without requesting Mukherjee to waive the tax, Mamata told the House: I am sure the honourable finance minister will withdraw the service tax as he had done last year. Mukherjee, seated a row ahead of Mamata, continued to look straight ahead.         
	New projects need Rs 80,000 crore. The pending projects are there. If there is service tax it will be very difficult to implement them, Mamata told the Lok Sabha.        
	Sources close to the Trinamul chief said she had decided to question the service tax after an internal analysis revealed that it could hurt the railways.         
	She wants to make it clear that if she fails to deliver on the ambitious promises she has made in the rail budget, the blame will lie at least in part on the finance minister, a source said.         
	Mamata had said in her budget that the railways expected to earn Rs 62,489 crore from freight in this financial year.         
	Sources said the rail ministry had planned to set aside Rs 3,000 crore for development projects promised by Mamata.         
	But Mamatas plans suffered a setback with the government announcing a 10 per cent service tax on goods  barring a few exempted items  transported by train. The railways have to pay this tax to the finance ministry.         
	The list of exempted goods includes defence and railway equipment, postal mail bags, luggage of train passengers, relief material, foodgrain, petroleum products and select essential commodities.         
	Calculations by the railway ministry have revealed that it would need to collect over Rs 1,000 crore as service tax.         
	The railways could raise freight rates, passing on the burden of the service tax to the consumer, but such a move could make trains unattractive for transportation of goods, the sources said.         
	Such a move would also embarrass Mamata who has chosen not to raise passenger or freight rates, ignoring advice from sections of the government. But if the railways decide to absorb the impact of the service tax without increasing freight rates, it will reduce balance earnings that were to be used to meet budget promises.

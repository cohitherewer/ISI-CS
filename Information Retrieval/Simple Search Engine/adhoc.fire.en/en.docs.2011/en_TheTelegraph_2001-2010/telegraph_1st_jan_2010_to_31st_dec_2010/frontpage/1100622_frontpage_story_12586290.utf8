	In the first of a series of interactive artist talks and sessions to be held every month till December 2010 at Studio21, Tapati Chowdhury took the gathering at the Dover Terrace address through an intimate journey of her creative expressions on Friday evening.        
	Presenting her drawings, paintings, sculptures and installations through a slideshow of photographs, the reticent Tapati  by her own admission bored of working in the same medium for too long and always searching for expressions through new media  offered a window into her visual aesthetic.        
	In the process, she also traced its evolution, from her undergraduate days at Kala Bhavan in Santiniketan almost a decade back to her post-graduation stint at Syracuse University and till more recent times.        
	From her fascination with wounds  both in a physical sense and as a metaphor  in her earlier work in the aftermath of the Godhra riots to her site-specific installation work in Denmark and Kushtia in Bangladesh last year, Tapatis art reflects an incessant exploration for an individual language.        
	In her paintings with wounds as the central theme, Tapati explored contours of the surface to replicate cicatrix; the immediacy of hurt or the lack of it reflected in shades of crimson.        
	Reacting to her environment or the larger picture, Tapati worked in varied media at Syracuse, ranging from drawings to sculptures in resin to synthetic sponge to full-blown installations with wires, mesh, nails and board. An effect of the largely industrial backdrop at the town? Perhaps. But once she was done with her take on the violence of machinations and phantasmal net-creatures, there emerged drawings that were a throwback to childhood.        
	Given her strong base in drawing, forms and figures mutate in abundance, perhaps best witnessed in the very interesting site-specific installations with earth, sand, stone and even a small patch of grass island in Footprints Along The Coast, an artists-in-residency bi-annual festival at Marbaek and Hjertting, Denmark, where Tapati worked in 2008.        
	The sea would wash away what you created within a few hours, so we had to keep in mind the site where we would work and also the rise and fall of the tide, explained Tapati.        
	The inconsistency of the creation, the very fact that it wouldnt be for keeps, that it would become one with nature: all of it added to the moment and the art.        
	She also worked with fishnets at the Blavandshuk lighthouse, creating swirling shadowscapes along its high staircase replete with sounds of children and their parents counting the steps.        
	A similar experience was recounted when Tapati worked with another group of artists at Kushtia in end-2009, creating installations at a fishery with cut mirror glass, strings and fishnets, all encompassing the reigning deities of the mystic bard Lalan Fakir at the site.        
	In the falling evening light, the work, called Arshi Jhola, resembled the aarshi nagar (mirror town) celebrated in one of Lalans legendary songs.        
	This art spoke in whispers; in muted tones and often overlapping lines that create shadows and reflections and an ambience of intimacy. It could be Tapatis abiding visual language. Till the next change.

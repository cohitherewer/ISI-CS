	Darjeeling, May 25: Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung today led a convoy of 100 cars to Darjeeling, virtually trying to bulldoze the stirrings of defiance in the hills after the daylight murder of Madan Tamang.        
	A day after severing links with the Morcha, two prominent persons in Kalimpong, Harka Bahadur Chhetri and L.B. Pariyar, took back their decisions. Sources said both leaders had decided to return to the Morcha fold under tremendous pressure from the leadership.         
	Gurung also announced a mammoth rally in Darjeeling on Sunday to demonstrate the support that the Morcha enjoys in the hills.        
	The flurry of action suggests that yesterdays display of defiance by mourners  egged on by some residents  in Tamangs funeral procession has rattled the Morcha leadership enough to flex its muscles and reinforce the fear factor that has helped it lord it over the hills.         
	It took 20 years for Subash Ghisinghs hold to be broken, that too by a strong-arm party like the Morcha. Yesterdays outpouring was a beginning but cannot be expected to change things overnight, a hill resident said.        
	In the face of the show of strength by the Morcha whose writ ran unchallenged till the other day, the public display of dissent today was restricted to a blockade put up by supporters of the second-largest party in the hills, the CPRM.        
	Unlike the 5,000-strong mourners who took out their anger on the Morchas flags and banners and raised slogans against Gurung yesterday, only 50 CPRM supporters were at hand to enforce the blockade at Ghoom, 9km from Darjeeling, which stalled the convoy from Kalimpong for around five minutes.        
	The protesters stepped aside after hundreds of Morcha supporters threatened to step in to disperse them.         
	Fearing that Gurungs return may stoke violence in the town, the administration had clamped Section 144 in Darjeeling. This prohibited more than five people from gathering at one spot but as has been the norm in the hills for quite some time, Morcha supporters ignored the restriction.        
	Defying the administration, Morcha supporters walked in a procession from Ghoom, shouting slogans that warned a handful of people who were trying to politicise a funeral procession.         
	Although police managed to push back Morcha supporters from Chowk Bazar by citing the prohibitory order, Gurung addressed his supporters who had thronged the motor stand area in Darjeeling, about 300 metres from the spot where Tamang had been hacked to death.        
	The administration was granted a concession: Gurung did not use a microphone.        
	Bharati Tamang, the widow of Madan Tamang, was today appointed the president of his party, the ABGL. Earlier in the day, Bharati, accompanied by her son Sanjyog, met Bengal governor M.K. Narayanan in Darjeeling to demand a CBI inquiry into the murder of her husband.

	 Lucknow Sept 28 (PTI): The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court will pronounce the verdict on the 60-year old Ayodhya title suits on Thursday.  
	The Officer on Special Duty in the High Court, Hari Shankar Dubey said that the three-judge special bench comprising Justice S.U Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and D.V Sharma would pronounce the verdict on Septemer 30 at 15.30 hours.  
	The announcement came shortly after the Supreme Court rejected a special leave petition moved by Ramesh Chandra Tripathi, a former bureaucrat, seeking deferment of verdict.  
	Tripathi had made the plea that another chance should be given for reaching a settlement on the issue through reconciliation and had also sought the postponement apprehending law and order problem.  
	Tripathi had approached the apex court after the special bench in the High Court had rejected his similar plea on September 17 by two-one majority and imposed a cost of Rs. 50,000 on him.

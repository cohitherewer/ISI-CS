The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nitish, the Chanakya who wins Bihar hands down
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nitish, the Chanakya who wins Bihar hands down
										      
	Patna, Nov 24 (PTI):Often called Chanakya for his political astuteness, Engineer-politician Nitish Kumar blended his secularist ideology with pragmatic politics and combined the development plank with innovative social engineeering equations in Bihar to bask in glory yet again.
    Doing an encore after today's landslide victory, the 59-year-old chief minister with his trademark kurta pyjama and grey stubble has become RJD strongman Lalu Prasad's nemesis single handedly contributing to the electoral meltdown of RJD-led Secular Democratic Front for the second time in five years.
    Beating the anti-incumbency factor, the JD-U leader, a socialist of Ram Manohar Lohia mould and a product of the JP movement in the seventies, has been the mascot of NDA's fight against the 15-year Lalu-Rabri rule in Bihar ending their reign in 2005.  
	Results at a glance  
	The Nitish Kumar-led JD(U)-BJP alliance today bagged 135 seats, 13 more than the simple majority, and was ahead in 70 other places in the 243-member Assembly.
    On the other hand, RJD-LJP alliance suffered major reverses bagging only ten seats and leading in 16 other places against its tally of 64 last time.
    Congress too suffered a setback winning three seats and leading in three compared to nine seats it had won in 2005.
    The CPI won one seat and others 2.

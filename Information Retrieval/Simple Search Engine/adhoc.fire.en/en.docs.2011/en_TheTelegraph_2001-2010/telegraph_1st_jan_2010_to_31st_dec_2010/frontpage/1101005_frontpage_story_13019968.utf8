                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pawar skips, jokes apart 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: When Team Manmohan lined up for the Commonwealth Games opener yesterday, one heavy hitter was missing: Sharad Pawar.        
	International cricket boss Pawar, whose contributions to the country include fellow sports-politician Suresh Kalmadi, preferred to be in Mohali where India is playing a Test against Australia.        
	Pawars absence from the Games ceremony was particularly noticed as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi had wanted all the ministers to be present at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Sunday evening.        
	Sources said Pawar had to stay back in Chandigarh in the evening as the Punjab Cricket Association had organised an event to felicitate him on becoming the International Cricket Council chief. Sources in Pawars party, the NCP, denied allegations that the food minister skipped the Games because it was a Kalmadi show.        
	But other sources could not resist pointing out that Pawar had said barely a week ago that the CWG had become a joke and had never planned to attend the opening ceremony because of his antipathy towards Kalmadi. The one-time disciple and mentor had drifted apart over a turf tussle in Maharashtra.        
	These sources said Pawar had referred to some CWG jokes  plenty were flying as text messages  at a public rally in Pune last week.        
	Kalmadi got a chance to settle scores today. In the first issue of the Village News, a community newspaper brought out by the Games Organising Committee, Kalmadi said in his message: In a cricket-crazy nation, we need such celebrations of sport to make everyone sit up and take note of rich variety of champions from other sport.        
	If that did not send the message across, a big report on the back page screamed: CWG pushes cricket down under  The Delhi Games have put even a high-voltage Australia series in shade. A few other ministers, like Pawars friend Sushil Kumar Shinde, were not present at the stadium. Shinde has gone abroad.        
	Pranab Mukherjee was a silent spectator as there were no vexed political problems to solve. Mamata Banerjee, too, attended the ceremony to abide by the Prime Ministers wish.        
	Singh had personally telephoned L.K. Advani and the BJP veteran attended with his daughter. BJP president Nitin Gadkari was also present. Buta Singh, who played a vital role in the Delhi Asian Games, cut a lonely figure in the galleries this time.        
	Although most ministers enjoyed the cultural extravaganza, many complained of poor mobile network inside, probably because of jamming by the SPG. Ministers like Mamata are known for constantly sending text messages.        
	One minister said: Many of us were trying to make important calls but that portion of the stadium was worst in terms of network facilities, probably because the SPG had jammed the lines. Although some SMSes came and went out, we could not make any calls.         
	Another said he could not recall a day when ministers were unable to use their cellphones freely for three hours.

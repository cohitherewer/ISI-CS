          AMIT ROY                            A 1972 Munich Olympics poster (top) and Sir Mark Jones, the director of Victoria and Albert Museum                                
	London, July 31: Sir Mark Jones, director of the Victoria amp; Albert Museum, looked on last night in Delhi as Britain and India signed a memorandum of understanding on cultural cooperation.        
	 One of its first goals will be to hold an Anish Kapoor exhibition in India.        
	 Jones, who had come as part of David Camerons delegation, was seated next to the director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, and Dame Lynne Brindley, chief executive of the British Library  thereby comprising almost the holy trinity of British culture.        
	 With Cameron and Manmohan Singh sitting at the top table in an air-conditioned tent pitched in the grounds of Hyderabad House, James Hunt, the British culture secretary, signed on behalf of Britain, while India was represented by Jawahar Sircar, the culture secretary.        
	 It was apparently Sircars idea to push for an MOU with the UK, since India has similar agreements with 161 other countries.        
	 Some would argue that since so much is going on anyway between the artistic communities in Britain and India, the UK is arguably the one country with which India does not need to sign an MOU.        
	 From my point of view it seems to me that it does no harm and it may do some good, Jones told The Telegraph.        
	 The V amp;A is undertaking a number of initiatives itself but some attractive promises were made by the two governments.        
	 One is that Anish Kapoor, the most successful sculptor in the world  and most probably the richest  will hold his first ever exhibition in the land of his birth.        
	 That will take place in Delhi and Mumbai.        
	 A play based on the life of the Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan, called A Disappearing Number, will tour India  again it will not come to Calcutta but be staged in Mumbai and Hyderabad.        
	 The Hay Literary Festival will be held in Thiruvananthapuram in November.        
	 Plans are being made in Britain to mark Tagores 150th birth anniversary but most of the groups involved have limited resources. It is possible the Indian government will offer financial help since the MOU stated both sides welcomed plans by the concerned Indian agencies for the manifestation of the year long celebration in the UK of the Tagore anniversary.         
	 In November there will a contemporary art photography exhibition at the Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai. In January the same venue will display between 70 and 80 original Olympic posters. The latter ought to go down well with those who have Olympic aspirations for India.        
	 The governments seem to think that culture can be used to boost business.         
	 The response of Jones to this thesis is: We dont do what we do internationally because we want to promote the British economy  that would be fine, I am not in any way against it but that is not our purpose. Our purpose really is first of all to sustain the link between the V amp;A and India which help us to make sense of our Indian collection.        
	 It is very interesting seeing the posters for the Nazi Olympic games in 1936  it reflects Nazi values very strongly, Jones commented.        
	 One of the V amp;As most successful ventures of recent years has been the Maharaja exhibition which will go to America and also to Beijing.        
	 One display that will not bypass Calcutta will be of Kalighat paintings. That is something we are doing with the Victoria Memorial Hall in Calcutta and also the Indian Museum in Calcutta  the exhibition will draw from the collections of the V amp;A, the Victoria Memorial Hall and the Indian Museum and it will be shown in the Victoria Memorial Hall.        
	 Jones is also considering a project involving chintz.         
	 It has been formative in the history of taste in England. There is nothing more English than chintz and there is nothing more Indian than chintz.        
	 Jones also revealed: We are working with the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad on an exhibition called Indian Design Now which we are going to show in London in 2013  it is going to be every aspect of design in India but contemporary. We hope that we might show an exhibition of British design in India.        
	 Ultimately, India could follow the example of France and Britain in improving the image of brand India.        
	 Lets say we look at France, commented Jones. I do believe that French brands and particularly French luxury brands are attractive partly because France itself is a strong brand. To an extent thats true elsewhere as well but France is very good at promoting itself as being a highly cultured highly civilised country.

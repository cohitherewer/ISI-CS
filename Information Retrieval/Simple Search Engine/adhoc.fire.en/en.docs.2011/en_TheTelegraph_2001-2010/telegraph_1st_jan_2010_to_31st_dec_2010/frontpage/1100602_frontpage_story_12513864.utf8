          The results of the Calcutta Municipal elections are out and the red citadel has now been stormed by the Trinamool Congress. We asked a few people about their reactions to the change.      Kamalika, is a first time municipal voter.   ldquo;I am not happy, because I am a true communist. But as a responsible citizen in a democratic country I think the results are fine. We need a competitor to realise our drawbacks and failures. If there is no competition we become over confident, which isn rsquo;t fine in a democracy. rdquo;   Jayanta Bhowmick works with a leading bank in Calcutta.   ldquo; It rsquo;s a great feeling. This change should have come even earlier. If TMC do not perform to the expectations of the people then next time it will be thrown away. This change should be there to have better governance. rdquo;   Sudhir Chatterjee is a retired resident of Calcutta.   lsquo;The Lefts were ruling for a long time and caused a lot of disturbances to many people. They played with the sentiments of many people. No commoner must have voted for them. Only a few committed voters Leftists must have been by their side, so they could not make it this time. Moreover I think elections were conducted in a more fair manner than the past few times. rdquo;  Jayasree Patra, is a resident of the North Dum Dum area.   ldquo; I think change is required and so it happened this time. If there is no change, we continue living with a monotonous life. The right candidate with the right attitude towards development from TMC has won in my constituency, and I am very happy about it. rdquo;   Dyutika Bishnu, is a house wife.   ldquo;I think in a democracy it is essential to give various political parties the chance to work. And it is good therefore that TMC has won. If we continue adding years to the 32 year old legacy then it will turn into a dictatorship, and democracy will die. Its good that change has taken place. rdquo;

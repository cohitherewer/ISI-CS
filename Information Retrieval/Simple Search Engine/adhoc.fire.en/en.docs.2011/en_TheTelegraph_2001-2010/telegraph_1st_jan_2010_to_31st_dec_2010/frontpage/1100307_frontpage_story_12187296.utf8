The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State steps up heat on Maoists
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                State steps up heat on Maoists
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, March 6: Maoist rebels in Jharkhand are facing the heat.        
	Armed with six new battalions of central paramilitary forces, the Jharkhand government has intensified anti-Naxalite manoeuvres at several places, with full-fledged operations expected to begin in the coming weeks.         
	With the state expecting another paramilitary battalion from the Centre soon, and five battalions in place from before, the total battalion strength will soon stand at 12. The BSF too has agreed to open its sector office in Jharkhand.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, director-general of police Neyaz Ahmed confirmed that internal operations had begun.         
	Dont ask me to name the places where these operations are being carried out. We are using our available resources, he added.        
	At present, the forces are concentrating on making their presence felt in the Red Zones. And if the proposed peace talks with the rebels fail to make any headway soon, the anti-Naxalite offensive would be intensified further.        
	Anti-Naxalite operations so far have been concentrated in difficult areas like Saranda, Midnapore-Ghatshila border in East Singhbhum, the sensitive pockets of Latehar, Lohardaga and Gumla districts, Jhumra Pahar in Bokaro district, Giridih and Chatra.        
	The latest crackdown started after Jharkhand and Bengal Police agreed to carry out joint operations.         
	DIG rank officials of both states recently met in Jamshedpur and Purulia, where joint action plans were discussed extensively.         
	While the Jamshedpur meeting was held about a fortnight ago, the meeting in Purulia took place three or four days ago.        
	Justifying the timing of the offensive, a senior official of IG rank said: The onset of summer is the ideal time to launch operations in areas covered by dense forests. Visibility is good and air surveillance fetches better results. There are also a lot of dry leaves on the ground which make a lot of noise when someone walks over them at night.                                      
	With both the Prime Minister and Union home minister making it clear that there would be no talks with the rebels until they shunned violence, the coming days are expected to be eventful. It is believed that in Jharkhand, Dalbhumgarh BDO Prashant Kumar Layeks abduction and release by the rebels was a turning point of sorts, with both sides getting a better idea of the others might.        
	Special Branch inspector Francis Indwar was killed after being abducted. But in Layeks case, we were certain from the very beginning that he would not be killed. In fact, we had surrounded Layeks abductors and the only fear was that the hostage could have been killed in the operation. Meanwhile, the government struck a deal with the abductors and any deal has to be honoured in the larger interest of society. But the state government too did not accept their unjustified demands. Also, the last Maoist bandh on February 27 failed to evoke any response, said another IG.

	Dec. 6: Couched in a joint statement with France, India today flagged what can become its strategy when it joins the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member three weeks from now.        
	With the French Presidency of the G20 which has just started, Indias dual participation in the G20 and the Security Council for the 2010/2011 timeframe presents an historic opportunity to step up joint work in these two bodies, said a joint statement issued after the talks between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	The operative words  step up joint work in these two bodies  offer clues to how India will approach the ticklish issue of voting in the Security Council.        
	Both the Left and the BJP will be keeping their eyes and ears open to spot any perceived tilt towards the US, not to mention Washington itself which has grudgingly accepted that India does deserve to become a permanent member eventually.        
	Todays joint statement suggests India has opted to go along with the broadly independent, multilateralist positions adopted by France on the international stage.        
	Few can then fault India because France has a large following of 50-odd Francophone countries in the UN.        
	This is also reinforced by the second paragraph of the joint statement which says: Reaffirming their shared vision and values inspired by multilateralism, justice, freedom, equality and fraternity, France and India reiterated their determination and confirmed their commitment to work together towards peace and global security.        
	In principle, India and France are both against the unipolar world that came into being after the Cold War. In fact, that was what prompted then President Jacques Chirac to reach out to India and extend the very first invitation to a G8 meeting, in Evian, which eventually led to the creation of G20.        
	The joint statement added that France and India would like to work together to make the G20 as effective as possible and help it find its place within an international system that will better reflect todays world and challenges.         
	The statement suggests that India wants to be more active in G20 and use its presence there as a link to New Delhis traditional constituency of G77. France has just taken over the G20 presidency.        
	The Manmohan Singh government will try to use the French presidency as a window for this because that strategy was not viable under US presidency or the Koreans who are American allies.        
	Sarkozy today touched upon a familiar concern, asking Pakistan to fight terrorism determinedly and going well beyond President Barack Obama. They (Sarkozy and Singh) expressed concern at the continuing existence of safe havens and sanctuaries for terrorist groups beyond Afghanistans borders and resurgence of terrorist groups, the joint statement said.

          SANJAY K. JHA                            Manmohan Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The government appears determined not to bend further to accept a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on 2G spectrum allocation, contending that the Opposition demand is unreasonable as an investigation is going on and the telecom minister has already resigned.        
	The government will, however, reassess the situation if the parliamentary deadlock continues beyond Monday. It will also keep an eye on the differences of opinion within the BJP.        
	Sources said the government felt that the continued Opposition campaign was largely political in nature and would end after the last phase of elections in Bihar on Saturday. The Congress core committee took stock of the situation this afternoon and decided to wait for a while.         
	Some leaders did talk about the possibility of a JPC if the BJP agreed to the terms of reference covering the developments in telecom during the NDA phase between 1998 and 2004.        
	But government sources said no formal proposal had been given to the Opposition till Thursday night.        
	But the majority view is that the Congress should not yield to pressure tactics after ensuring the exit of telecom minister A. Raja and Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan, and initiating a comprehensive probe into the Commonwealth Games scandal.        
	This section feels that the party should have been more assertive in responding to the Opposition campaign. Murmurs about the lack of robust crisis-management abilities among key players in the government have begun in the Congress.        
	Many leaders privately express dismay at the continuing deadlock.        
	The Congress has been talking of a counter-offensive for the past few days and its spokespersons have been trying to shift focus to the Karnataka land scandal, but a joint Opposition has so far succeeded in keeping the spotlight fixed on the government.         
	We had been succeeding in breaking Opposition unity in lesser crises but now we appear completely helpless when the trouble is so big, with the heat reaching even the Prime Minister, a senior AICC functionary said.        
	While the absence of a fire-fighting mechanism in the PMO has always been a handicap for this government, the task of resolving day-to-day complications is largely being handled by Pranab Mukherjee.         
	Both Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Ghulam Nabi Azad used to do this job effectively as parliamentary affairs minister, with the assistance of their deputy Suresh Pachauri. But there is no live contact with the Opposition now under the reticent Pawan Bansal.        
	Former law minister H.R. Bharadwaj, who is now governor of Karnataka, used to be at hand with skills to manage crises whereas his successor Veerappa Moily prefers a hands-off policy.         
	Sources said the Supreme Courts observations on the Prime Minister had angered senior ministers who felt the governments law officers could have come up with a stronger defence on that day. The overriding feeling is that Subramanian Swamy has no locus standi in the case and the Prime Minister is not at fault at all.        
	The sources said this situation had arisen because both the government and the party had been lackadaisical in anticipating and managing problems.         
	In addition to big parties like the BSP and the Samajwadi Party, even the Left feels the government should have maintained better relations with the Opposition, at least for parliamentary strategies. Some leaders in these parties feel the government could have done a lot to isolate the BJP by taking them into confidence.

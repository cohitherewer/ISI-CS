The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Airlines: Lithium-ion batteries terror threat 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Airlines: Lithium-ion batteries terror threat 
          GARY STOLLER                            An iPhone and its lithium-ion battery                                  
	Aug. 16: Worried about a possible terrorist strike, American Airlines flight attendants confiscated 58 cellphones, lithium-ion batteries and charging devices from a passenger on a June 23 New York flight to Buenos Aires.        
	In April, Tokyo police and fire officials rushed to a baggage area at Narita airport after a curling iron powered by a lithium-ion battery caused a passengers checked-in bag to burst into flames as it was being shuttled from an American Airlines jet to a connecting flight.        
	Lithium-ion batteries the rechargeable energy source for cellphones, laptop computers and an increasing number of other portable electronic devices  are becoming a growing concern for airlines in passenger cabins and cargo holds. Non-rechargeable lithium metal batteries like those in cameras and flashlights are a concern, too.         
	When a lithium battery short-circuits or overheats, it can catch fire or explode. The fire it causes may not be as easy to extinguish as a normal combustion fire.        
	FAA data show that from March 20, 1991, through August 3, 2010, batteries and battery-powered devices were involved in 113 incidents with smoke, fire, extreme heat or explosion on passenger and cargo planes.         
	The data are for lithium and non-lithium batteries and are not a complete list of such incidents.        
	In January, the transportation department proposed stricter rules for companies that ship lithium batteries in cargo holds. The frequency of incidents, combined with the difficulty in extinguishing lithium-battery fires, warrants taking strong action, Jerry Costello, chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, said of the proposal.        
	Lithium-battery experts, security analysts and flight attendants wonder, though, if stricter rules are also needed in airline passenger cabins to prevent fires or worse: a possible attempt by a terrorist to bring down a plane by rigging a large number of batteries together to start a fire.        
	Right now, there is no limit to how many small lithium-ion batteries a passenger can carry aboard a flight. A transportation security administration spokeswoman said the agency has studied the matter.

          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 20: A Metro train tripped on a slice of its own ageing equipment and derailed this morning, plunging about 2,000 rush-hour passengers into darkness and dread in smoky compartments stuck in a tunnel lit only by sparks flying from below the carriages.        
	Never before in the 26 years of Calcuttas beloved symbol of pride has such a near-disaster unfolded, though railway minister Mamata Banerjee felt it was a minor incident (chhoto ghatana).         
	The derailment left Metro crippled in the heart of Calcutta for 11 hours from 9.20am. The full service resumed at 8.15pm, and trains are scheduled to operate as usual on Thursday.        
	Hundreds of passengers banged on doors and mulled whether to try and break open an exit or wait before rescue teams reached the mishap site, a few metres before Central station on the Tollygunge-bound line, around 9.40am. Central, which falls between MG Road and Chandni Chowk stations, is chosen by commuters bound for Dalhousie and the rest of the central business district.        
	No one was grievously injured because the Metro tunnel does not provide room for a coach to overturn. But many passengers were carried to the station gasping for breath and almost unconscious after they fell on each other and spent 20 minutes in the smoke-filled coaches.         
	Two of them had to be hospitalised for first aid. Doctors at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital said they had suffered from suffocation and trauma.        
	The train was moving quite fast when there was a violent jerk around 9.20am. Such was its impact that I felt as if the coach would be torn from the train and fly away in another direction, said Santanu Das, an insurance agent who was travelling from Dum Dum to Jatin Das Park.        
	A Metro official said there could have been a major disaster had the train hit the edge of the platform packed with waiting office-goers.        
	Although the railway minister described the incident as minor, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee expressed deep concern over passenger security. He has asked chief secretary Samar Ghosh to convene a meeting on the incident.                    
	The driver, Pritimoy Roy, had slammed the emergency brake to stop the train immediately after he felt that the jerk had resulted from a serious problem.         
	A metal cap, which is fixed to the outer side of the wheel and covers the train axles accessories, apparently got unhinged from the first coach and came under the wheels of the second, resulting in the derailment.         
	Tracks over a 50ft stretch were mauled. There was a cloud of smoke and sparks flew as the train hit the third rail. Immediately, the lights inside went out and the passengers started to panic.         
	Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel arrived around 9.40am and entered the train through the drivers cabin.         
	The initial rescue efforts, minus basic equipment like ladders and torches, laid bare Metros lack of preparedness for an emergency.         
	The passengers had to jump out of the train into the tunnel and walk through the dark before they could climb up the platform.         
	There were people gasping for breath and a number of them were in a semi-conscious state and held up by co-passengers, said an RPF jawan.        
	The rescue team had no oxygen mask to help those in need and the station had no washroom. The shoddy rescue efforts scared me more than the incident, said a passenger in her mid-50s.        
	The railway minister, in Calcutta through the day but nowhere near Metro, said in the evening: It is a minor incident. Why are you panicking about it? People die in plane crashes, people die on roads. These things happen but we cant say we will not use them.         
	At the news conference, called to announce her party programmes, Mamata also sowed the conspiracy theory like she had after most train crashes in the past. We will have to probe whether this happened by accident or someone was behind it. You know what happened in the Jnaneswari crash.        
	Sources in Metro suggested the ailing rakes were bearing the brunt of the haste to expand the network without upgrading equipment. The rakes are ailing and overstretched. We need 25 rakes to keep up with the schedule, but we are running on 19. Two of them, the AC rakes, are not yet fully operational, an official said.        
	The rakes are over 20 years old and need immediate replacement. The 17 rakes now ply an additional 9km after the extension up to New Garia and the non-AC ones barely get a look-after since the arrival of the AC rakes, the official added.        
	Mamata had unveiled the AC trains and opened the New Garia stretch of Metro on Mahalaya as a Puja gift to the city.        
	Today, the first of the two accident relief trains arrived at the spot two hours after the near disaster, around 11.30am. The battery-operated train brought hydraulic jacks, ladders, generators, cutters and other equipment to put the train back on track.         
	The job was done around 4.30pm. The rake was pulled to the Noapara carshed for repairs.        
	The Metro authorities said they would conduct a probe to find out the exact reason for the derailment. A high-powered inquiry committee has been told to submit its report within 10 days, said a spokesperson.        
	Metro services on the entire Dum Dum-New Garia stretch resumed at 8.15pm, 11 hours after the incident. Truncated services  between New Garia and Maidan from 9.40am and Dum Dum and Girish Park from 12.45pm  left the roads above clogged. Harried commuters ran after taxis and struggled for a toehold on buses.

	Calcutta, Nov. 28: Moderate Hurriyat chief Mirwaiz Umer Farooq today had a chance to enjoy Calcuttas famous sweets but not perhaps another of the citys vaunted trademarks: tolerance for dissent.         
	At a seminar at the Academy of Fine Arts, speaker after speaker from diverse backgrounds rounded on the separatist after he denied that Kashmir was a part of India and argued for the azaadi cause.        
	The critics included retired army chief and former Rajya Sabha member General Shankar Roychowdhury, ex-mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, businessman Sishir Bajoria and IIM Calcutta professor Surendra Munshi.         
	Asked by Roychowdhury if he considered Kashmir a part of India, the Mirwaiz said: No, Kashmir is disputed land.        
	It evoked a strong reaction, appearing to unite his fellow panellists at the discussion Kashmir  The Way Out, organised by a city NGO, the Centre for Peace and Progress.        
	No part of Jammu and Kashmir will be allowed to secede. Staying within India, within the framework of the Constitution, ask for anything, Roychowdhury said. He accused the Hurriyat of provoking innocents into joining street protests, causing 115 deaths since June 2010.        
	Can he (the Mirwaiz) name a single Hurriyat leader attacked in these protests? Pakistan is funding this. They want revenge for Bangladesh, an agitated Roychowdhury said as the Mirwaiz fixed his gaze on the ceiling.        
	If the generals attack was frontal, the lawyer Bhattacharyya questioned the rationale behind the azaadi demand. You clearly say you do not want development or peace. The only thing you want is so-called freedom. Are you living in a colonised state?        
	The Hurriyat chief, who was accompanied by fellow Kashmiri leader Bilal Lone, had earlier said: The core issue... is not development, not economic packages, not peace. Its the sentiment of azaadi.        
	When the Mirwaiz was leaving the venue, a small group of waiting BJP youth activists threw an egg at his car but missed. Police said 22 people were arrested.        
	Later in the afternoon, as he set off to check out the sweets of Calcutta, the Mirwaiz told The Telegraph he had found the concerted criticism extremely unfortunate.        
	Asked if he had expected this of Calcuttas civil society, he said: People in Calcutta, I would like to believe, are humanists and democrats.        
	Its possible the opinions heard today were a reflection of the popular mood prevailing since 26/11, heightened by Pakistans inaction against the plotters and the recent pro-azaadi comments by author Arundhati Roy. The Mirwaiz and other Kashmiri separatists have recently evoked more violent reactions in Delhi and Chandigarh during tours to explain their stand.        
	On Thursday, some Kashmiri Pandits had roughed up the Mirwaiz and Lone in Chandigarh. Last month, a Pandit had hurled a shoe at Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani at a Delhi seminar where he was sitting next to Roy. Yesterday, a Delhi court asked the police to file an FIR for sedition against Roy and Geelani.        
	I strongly condemn the action against Roy, the Mirwaiz said today. It is time for India to get out of this denial mode.        
	But his fellow panellists at the seminar contended that it was the separatists who were in denial, fomenting unrest with barely a thought for Kashmirs poor.

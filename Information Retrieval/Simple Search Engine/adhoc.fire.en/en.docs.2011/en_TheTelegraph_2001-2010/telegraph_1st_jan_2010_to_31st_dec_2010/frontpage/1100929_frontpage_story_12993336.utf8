	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Sept. 28: Ongoing operations and telephone intercepts have established that CPI(Maoist) formed a company of 100-odd armed guerillas who moved in a single group carrying sophisticated weapons and explosives aimed at security forces scouring the forests of Saranda.        
	We have gathered information during these raids that rebels formed a military company of over 100 personnel and made Saranda their home, CRPF DIG Bhanu Pratap Singh told The Telegraph, pointing out that earlier they would operate with smaller squads of 10-20 armed guerrillas.        
	The security forces comprising 25 companies of CRPF, Jharkhand Jaguar and COBRA and state police have also stumbled upon banners related to Maoist training camps during the ongoing operations, considered the biggest ever against Naxalites well-entrenched in the forests of Saranda.                    
	Telephone intercepts of Maoist conversations have indicated that rebels had designated in Tirulposi in Manoharpur in West Singhbhum, about 50km from Rourkela in Orissa, as a capital where they would gather from Orissa and Bihar regularly to chalk out strategy.        
	Today, the fourth day of the operations, forces recovered four more landmines from the buffer zone of Saranda, namely Tirulposi, Digha, Thalkobad and Jeraikela.        
	With this, the landmines count has gone up to 20.         
	CRPF DIG Bhanu Pratap Singh revealed that the recovered IEDs were being exploded in the Saranda forests.         
	Two bomb disposal squads have been pressed into service since last evening. But, since the number of recovered bombs is so large that will be futile to get the squad to defuse each one of them one by one. Instead, we are triggering explosions at a safe place in the forest, he told The Telegraph.        
	A Cobra commandant, who led nine units (30 men in each) of the special force, said Saranda was an extremely difficult terrain. Our jawans are still fighting inside the forests. Apart from carrying their usual weapons, they use deep search metal detectors and are dependent on compo rations (ready to eat food packets) and water bottles to sustain themselves, he said.        
	Use of wireless and satellite phones was restricted in the jungles, making their task more difficult. We have had to trek distances of 30km at a stretch from the base camp at Kiriburu, Digha, he added.

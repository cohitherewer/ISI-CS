                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rule violation glare on IIT-K law school
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                       IIT Kharagpur                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: A reply to a Right to Information query has revealed details about qualifications of eight IIT Kharagpur faculty and administrative officials that hint their appointments violated government regulations.        
	Evidence with The Telegraph suggests irregularities in the appointment of at least five assistant registrars and three assistant professors in the last 15 years.         
	The RTI query had sought the qualifications of T.K. Bandyopadhyay, Padmavati Manchikanti and Archana Chugh, all assistant professors at the Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law (RGSIPL) in the IIT, as well as the marks obtained by S.K. Poddar, S. Mitra, T.K. Mukherjee, T.R. Maity and T.K. Ghosal, who were all assistant registrars between 1994 and 2000.        
	The three law school assistant professors do not hold an LLM degree, the masters in law which is a requirement according to the regulations of the Bar Council of India (BCI). The BCI oversees legal education in the country.         
	In reply to the RTI query, the bar council said full-time teachers of law, including the principal of the college, shall ordinarily be holders of masters degree in law and where holders of masters degree in law are not available, persons with teaching experience for a minimum of five years in law may be considered.        
	Neither of the three assistant professors holds a masters degree in law, they have degrees in science and technology.         
	Bandyopadhyay has done his masters and PhD in metallurgical and materials engineering, Manchikanti has a PhD in plant sciences with an MSc in biotechnology. Chughs PhD was in plant molecular biology after an MSc in biotechnology.         
	The law school, the first to be started by any tech college in the country, offers a three-year residential LLB course with specialisation on intellectual property rights.         
	On the appointments of the assistant registrars, IIT Kharagpur seems to have violated human resource development ministry rules that require at least 55 per cent marks at the masters level for the post. An order issued by the ministry on March 27, 1990, said that the minimum qualification for recruitment of assistant registrars and their equivalent will be masters degree with 55 per cent marks. But the RTI reply has revealed that S.K. Poddar, S. Mitra, T.K. Mukherjee, T.R. Maity and T.K. Ghosal scored lower than 55 per cent.         
	Ghosal was appointed deputy registrar in 2006 and is now the officiating registrar of IIT Kharagpur.         
	Ghosal is also under the radar for another scam. He allegedly issued an ID card with the IIT emblem on it to a man who ran a fake institute on the campus.         
	When contacted Amit Basak, the dean, faculty, of IIT Kharagpur, said the institute had done no wrong regarding the appointments. All the appointments have been made as per MHRD guidelines. The guidelines say that for the appointment of assistant professors at RGSIPL, the candidate needs to have PhD with first-class degree in the preceding examinations in appropriate branches, he said.         
	Asked how the three were appointed assistant professors without an LLM degree, Basak said the three were not teaching pure legal subjects.         
	This course has certain aspects on patenting and intellectual property. They are teaching the related subjects. They are not teaching subjects such as constitutional law, Basak clarified. He claimed the human resource development ministry has allowed the institute to recruit people without LLM degrees as assistant professors.         
	He said the ministrys guidelines had been followed while appointing the assistant registrars.

	Ranchi, May 9: After wrangling the chief ministers chair from the JMM, BJP contenders for the states top post stepped up lobbying ahead of the partys parliamentary board meeting tomorrow.        
	A dozen of the 18 BJP MLAs, including ministers Baidyanath Ram and Barkuanr Gagrai, besides presidents of a number of district units made their way to the national capital today, accompanied by Speaker C.P. Singh.         
	Those headed for Delhi were opposed to deputy chief minister Raghubar Das as chief minister, a post they felt should go to Jamshedpur MP Arjun Munda, who was emerging a major contender for the job.         
	We are also ready to accept C.P. Singh if the leadership insists on a chief minister from among the MLAs only, said a BJP legislator, requesting anonymity.         
	The other top contender was senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who had the support of party chief Nitin Gadkari. Transport minister and a close associate of Lok Sabha deputy speaker Karia Munda, Neelkanth Singh Munda, was being touted as a dark horse.        
	BJP MP P.N. Singh, party state vice president Dineshanand Goswami and senior party leader and Das arch rival, Sarayu Roy, also left for Delhi, as did MLAs Ram Chandra Baitha, Uma Shankar Akela, Amit Yadav, Harekrishna Singh, Mangal Singh Soy, Arun Mandal and Kamlesh Oraon. Kunti Singh and Maneka Sardar will reach the national capital tomorrow.         
	We want to apprise the leadership of our stand before they choose the chief minister, Gagrai said, while Singh insisted that the peoples sentiments should be respected.         
	Ironically, the state BJP had scheduled a meeting of district unit presidents tomorrow to chalk out the partys campaign against political use of the Central Bureau of Investigation and strategy to fight civic polls on June 18. We will go ahead with our programme, said general secretary Ganesh Mishra.         
	Not to be left behind, the aides of Das tried to persuade Shibu Soren and his son Hemant to insist upon Das as chief minister before the BJP leadership, only to be turned down by the Sorens. Das has the support of a few members of the BJP parliamentary board.         
	Lobbying for the top job intensified after the BJP central leadership indicated that it was not averse to handing over the baton to a non-tribal, a strict no-no so far in Jharkhand.        
	Political parties have religiously stuck to the unwritten rule of giving the state a tribal chief minister. The tradition was set in motion by RJD chief Lalu Prasad who had declared in the Bihar Assembly that he would support the statehood bill to create Jharkhand only if the ruling parties elected a tribal chief minister.                                
	Meanwhile, chief minister Shibu Soren began the exercise to contain a revolt within the party spearheaded by two MLAs  Simon Marandi and Paulus Surin  over the decision to allow the BJP lead the government. While Guruji discussed the issue with Simon, Hemant along with HRD minister Hemlal Murmu and agriculture minister Mathura Mahto rushed to Simdega to persuade Paulus not to precipitate the issue.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph after the meeting, Simon said he would not raise the banner of revolt when Guruji himself approved of the deal.         
	The JMM has summoned a meeting of party legislators tomorrow and a conclave of the partys central executive committee to vet the power- sharing formula. Significantly, the invitation letter to the MLAs was signed by Shibu Soren.        
	Meanwhile, Ajsu chief and deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto, who attended the Delhi meet, cleared the air over the power sharing formula, stating that the BJP had not agreed to share the chief ministers chair for 28 months each on rotation basis. The JMM proposal will be discussed by the BJP parliamentary board tomorrow, he told The Telegraph.         
	The BJP had remained silent over the issue yesterday after JMM leaders, including Shibu Soren, told newsmen in Ranchi that the chief ministers chair will be shared equally by the two parties for the remaining tenure.

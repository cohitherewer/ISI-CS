                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mamata counts rail losses
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata Banerjee                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Mamata Banerjee today told Parliament that railways had taken a Rs 1000-crore hit because of Maoists but refused to react to her alleged sympathies for the rebels saying she would fight her political battle outside the House.        
	You can (try to) provoke me, but I will not be provoked. I will fight my political battle outside (Parliament) not inside. I (will) maintain dignity (of the House), the railway minister said amid cries from the Opposition benches that the rebels were responsible for several of the accidents, blockades and hold-ups.        
	Mamata, facing the allegations since she dubbed the encounter death of Maoist leader Azad a murder at her Lalgarh rally last week, sought to deflect the criticism by urging the rebels not to target the railways.         
	 I appeal to them (the Maoists) that this (attacks and disruptions) should not happen, she said during question hour in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Some Opposition members asked her whether those responsible for the May Jnaneswari Express accident were present at the Lalgarh rally. She did not respond.        
	When the BJPs Balbir Punj wanted to know whether the accident in Bengals rebel hotbed West Midnapore was a case of sabotage, Mamata appeared to avoid a direct answer.         
	 Let me deal with the issue impartially and not politically. Prima facie, the mishap looks like a case of sabotage... bomb blast. The CBI is probing the matter.         
	The BSPs Ganga Charan wondered why trains were increasingly being attacked by Maoists when she (Mamata) holds a soft corner for them. Mamata did not react to this jibe, either.        
	The Rs 1000-crore loss covered the past several years. The minister recounted 217 disruptions by Maoists and said 11 per cent of the delays were because of blockades and sabotage. Yet in 75 per cent cases, punctuality is maintained, she said.         
	In 2009-10, 100 accidents took place, killing 64 people and damaging railway property worth Rs 54 crore. Seven of these were caused by blasts, the minister, who has also been criticised for a rash of accidents, said.        
	The figures came with the suggestion that it was up to the states to check crime on the railways.         
	Policing on railways is a state matter and prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law and order is the statutory responsibility of the state police, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP) of the state concerned, the minister said.

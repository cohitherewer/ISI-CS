  - Rebels blast tracks, derail goods train in Palamau           OUR BUREAU                            Railwaymen at work to clear the tracks after a Maoist blast derailed a goods train in Palamau on Tuesday. (Saikat Chatterjee)                                        
	Ranchi, Jan. 5: A Maoist legal eagle was arrested from a village near Ranchi today, but the rebels made their presence felt by blowing up tracks and derailing a goods train in Palamau, disrupting railway services in the district and its neighbouring areas.        
	The police recovered explosives, woollen clothes and police uniforms from a cave in Raghoi Hill on the basis of information provided by CPI(Maoist) legal cell in-charge Kalicharan Munda and fellow rebel Krishna Mahto, who were arrested from Tirilpiri village, about 40km from the district headquarters, under Bundu police station area.        
	Speaking to the media, SSP Praveen Kumar said Munda was responsible for killing four persons, including a minor girl, on August 28 at Bundu.         
	But Mundas main job was to keep track of cases pending against extremists in different courts. He looked after the cases of rebels detained in Ranchi, Khunti and Chaibasa jails. It was he who decided how much was to be paid as legal expenses for each rebel in jail, Kumar said.         
	Munda also supplied explosives, clothes and provisions to Maoist squads operating in the jungles.         
	The SSP said Munda was constantly in touch with the brother of Kundan Pahan, the custodian of levy collected from different sources. In order to protect his identity, Munda associated himself with a frontal organisation of the Maoists, Krantikari Kisan Committee (KKC), and regularly visited the capital, while Mahto used to collect levy from tractor drivers carrying sand from riverbanks.         
	Hours before the arrests rebels blew up railway tracks near Mohammadpur station, disrupting train services between Garhwa Road and Sone Nagar stations. Services resumed only in the afternoon.        
	The CPI(Maoist) had called a 24-hour bandh in Palamau commissionary today to protest against the alleged custody death of Rajendra Yadav, a resident of Tiladi village in Chattarpur. The bandh affected life in three districts Latehar, Garhwa and Palamau. Yesterday, an FIR was lodged against some police personnel allegedly involved in Yadavs death.         
	Palamau deputy inspector general of police Prashant Singh confirmed that the second post-mortem carried out on Yadav at Ranchis Rajendra Institute of Medical Science suggested external and internal injuries as cause of death.         
	We have appointed an investigating officer who will probe the personnel involved in the case, said the DIG.         
	Yadav was picked up from his village by the Chattarpur police on December 30. On December 31, he was reportedly sent to Daltonganj for questioning. He died in custody at the Daltonganj sadar police station on January 1.         
	The police informed the family about his death only after a hurried post-mortem at the local district hospital.        
	On January 2, hundreds of villagers demonstrated at Daltonganj, demanding a second post-mortem at RIMS, FIR against the policemen involved and compensation for Yadavs family.         
	Palamau superintendent of police Jatin Kumar Narwal has already suspended officer-in-charge of Chattarpur police station, sub-inspector Kamlesh Paswan.         
	Giridih firing         
	Maoist rebels fired on a long range patrolling team at Dumarjhar village under Bhelwaghati police station areas of Giridih district this morning. The area is about 90km from the district headquarters, on the Bihar-Jharkhand border.         
	Members of the patrol team returned fire and the shootout lasted for nearly four hours. No casualties were reported.

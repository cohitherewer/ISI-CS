                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                BJP loses appetite for dinner, not pact 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Narendra Modi in Patna on Saturday. Picture by Deepak Kumar                          
	Patna, June 12: The BJP declined Nitish Kumars dinner invite after his public snub to Narendra Modi but scrambled to deny any rift between the two NDA allies.        
	Party spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain dismissed reports that Arun Jaitley and M. Venkaiah Naidu had rushed to meet Nitish and pacify him. He (Nitish) is not upset, Hussain said.        
	Sources, however, said Jaitley and Naidu had been prevented from going to Nitish by the BJPs Bihar MLAs. The MLAs apparently said that if the leaders decided to humour Nitish on this point, they might as well merge the BJP with the Janata Dal (United).        
	Hussain claimed the party had decided to give the dinner a miss because the leaders wanted to prolong their discussions at the national executive, which began here today.        
	Our meeting is far more important than any dinner. It would have been a waste of time to curtail the session and leave the hotel. So we are going to sit late tonight and have a working meal. The nations reconstruction is more important than a dinner, he said.        
	The BJP decision seemed to have suited Nitish fine and he promptly cancelled the dinner without citing any reason.        
	A Dal (United) leader close to Nitish said the chief minister had been uncomfortable all along with the idea of having Modi as a guest but could hardly tell the others that while they were welcome, Modi was not. The advertisements purportedly funded by the Gujarat government showing Modi as a role model for Nitish became the perfect excuse for the Bihar chief minister.         
	The BJP got the hint. But there was no way they could have told Modi Dont come but the rest of us will go, the Dal (United) leader said.        
	It helped that Nitish had not sent out formal invites. We were informally sounded out on the dinner and scheduled the proceedings accordingly, a local BJP leader said.        
	Asked about Nitishs palpable dislike for Modi, Hussain said: The BJP has a galaxy of leaders and all of them are committed to one philosophy, one worldview. (And) when we deal with our allies, we are not dealing with individuals but negotiating on a common agenda.        
	Asked why the Modi advertisements had been so patronising, Hussain said: Modi has no dearth of fans. People are ready to die for him. His fans put out these advertisements, what can he do? Our Bihar BJP workers regard him and Nitish as their icons because both of them are committed to development.        
	There were six prominent absentees from the national executive: Yashwant Sinha, Vasundhara Raje, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Hema Malini, Kiron Kher and Vani Tripati.

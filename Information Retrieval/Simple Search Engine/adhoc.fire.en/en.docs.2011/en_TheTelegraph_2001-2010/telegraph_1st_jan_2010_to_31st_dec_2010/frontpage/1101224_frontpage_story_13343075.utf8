The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Haldia warriors talk as verdict looms

          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 23: The sparring promoters of Bengals showcase project Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd are back at the negotiating table to sort out their long-standing ownership dispute, two persons with direct knowledge of the deal being worked out said.        
	Representatives of the Chatterjee Group and the Bengal government have met several times in recent weeks to thrash out an explicit understanding that state agency West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation will exit in favour of Purnendu Chatterjee.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen confirmed the talks. We are ready to sell but the states interest has to be kept in mind. The issue is how and when we will get the money.         
	The heightened activity comes at a time the court case pitting the state against Chatterjee has reached the last lap. The Supreme Court has completed hearing both parties.        
	Expectations are that the verdict will be given in early 2011, deciding who occupies the drivers seat in Bengals biggest industrial venture that makes polymer used in plastics and chemicals.        
	Sources privy to the development said the two sides were trying to work out a method to value the company in a transparent manner. With Assembly elections round the corner, the government is keen that the price must stand up to public scrutiny.        
	One of the big four international accounting firms could be entrusted to do the valuation to keep it above board.        
	This is not the first time the partners are talking a deal. In January 2005, Chatterjee shook hands with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the Writers Buildings on taking management control. Seven months and at least 50 meetings later, the attempt fizzled out as Chatterjee failed to mobilise funds.        
	The state scrapped the agreement and Chatterjee went to the Company Law Board, kicking off a five-year legal dispute. In the meantime, Chatterjee made several overtures to reopen the dialogue but the talks have gained momentum only now with the verdict, holding the threat of breaking the back of one of the parties, looming. Chatterjee is showing lot of seriousness, said a source.        
	Sen recalled the unsuccessful attempts at resolving the dispute and wondered if it would be possible to do a deal before the verdict. Legal experts said it was possible to present a settlement even after a hearing had been completed.         
	Chatterjee did not return calls or reply to a text message left on his mobile.        
	The government holds 51.67 per cent in the company while the Indian Oil Corporation and Tata Sons own 8.19 per cent and 2.46 per cent, respectively. Chatterjee holds 37.68 per cent, according to the registered records, but has disputed the shareholding pattern.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        Chidambaram at the Writers rsquo; on Saturday evening. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)      
	Burdwan, April 3: Alleged CPM supporters barged into a railway station and forcibly turned the signal red, putting lives of passengers at stake on a day home minister P. Chidambaram reached Bengal.        
	The station rampage by alleged supporters of CPM veteran Benoy Konars son unfolded in Burdwan, a district Chidambaram could not visit today because poor weather forced him to extend his stay in the Northeast and reach Calcutta late. Chidambaram, who is scheduled to visit Lalgarh on Sunday, is expected to visit the state again to tour Burdwan and some other places.        
	The protest was apparently intended to avenge a perceived slight to CPM leaders at a railway flag-off event which was originally inaugurated by Mamata Banerjee in Burdwan.        
	Around 100 protesters barged into the cabin of the station manager of Memari railway station, about 80km from Calcutta, around 8pm, and switched on the red light. The change in the signal triggered a chain reaction, holding up at least 10 local trains.        
	An official said the unscheduled signalling changes could have caused accidents.        
	The protesters took control of the public address system for around two hours.        
	Mamata Banerjee today inaugurated the Memari-Howrah Passenger from Burdwan while her party leader Mukul Roy flagged it off from Memari station. We felt humiliated as we were not invited. We tried to inform the residents by stopping trains and announcing it over the PA system, said Avijeet Konar, the vice-chairman of the Left-run Memari municipality.        
	Burdwan railway police said they were not alerted.

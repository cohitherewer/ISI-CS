          BIRESWAR BANERJEE                            Mueller on Sunday. (AP)                                  
	Siliguri, June 28: Bapan Bera. Ring a bell, Herr Mueller?        
	A year and a half before you stunned England with two goals at the World Cup yesterday, Bapan had felled you  in a stadium named Kanchenjungha, in a place called Siliguri.        
	A fate worse than that of England awaited Bapans team  its a bit of a twister for German and other tongues Siliguri Mahakuma Krira Parishad XI on January 21, 2009. Thomas Muellers FC Bayern Munich beat the Siliguri XI 6-0.        
	If the defeat tasted bitter 18 months ago, it turned sweet last night. A thrilled Bapan watched on television the quick and powerful German scoring twice at Bloemfontein. I was thrilled to see him score, said the young forward, who now plays for Eastern Railways in the Calcutta Premier Division League.         
	Bayern, accompanied by German football legend Gerd Mueller, had gone to Siliguri as part of a promotional tour. The Bavarian club selected six under-15 players for training in Germany.        
	Mueller, then 19, scored once in the first half, like his Bayern teammate Holger Badstuber, who sat out yesterdays match against England.        
	Shown photographs of the 2009 match, Jayabrata Ghosh, who coached the Siliguri team, confirmed that Bapan had indeed felled Mueller.        
	 Bapan doesnt remember the exact moment he had tackled Mueller. I was too excited, he said. I was playing against Bayern Munich and I gave everything I had.        
	He wanted a copy when told of the picture of him and Mueller on the ground. Wow! Ill frame it, he said. Its a lifetime achievement.        
	Bapan remembers Muellers advice at the post-match dinner. He told us to look after our physique and increase stamina.        
	For some, realisation dawned in front of television. Said Gopal Pal, a member of the Siliguri XI: I watched Mueller score last night, then suddenly realised I had played against him. I am proud.

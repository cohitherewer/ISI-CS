	Dibrugarh, Aug. 20: Unidentified persons from Arunachal Pradesh opened fire on Assam police camps at Charaipung in Sivasagar district of Upper Assam this afternoon, less than 24 hours since representatives of the two states met in the conflict zone and promised to take up confidence-building measures to restore normality.        
	The goons, backed by Naga militants, crossed the boundary into Assam and launched the attack from Naharani, a hamlet about 200-300 metres from Charaipung village, where the Assam police camps are located, around 2.30pm. Charaipung is about 30km from the sub-divisional headquarters of Sonari.        
	Three constables were injured while running for cover as the attackers caught the Assam side totally off-guard. Constable Nareshwar Terang of 11 Assam Police Battalion was injured as he fell while running for cover and is being treated at the Borhat primary health centre. Two other constables of the battalion sustained minor injuries while running from one post to another, a police official said.         
	A group of four tea labourers, who were plucking leaves in a small garden owned by Nurul Hussain in Naharani, said they managed to escape narrowly. We were plucking leaves when we suddenly noticed movements in the tea bushes and jungles. All of a sudden, the firing started. All four of us fell flat on the ground and somehow managed to save ourselves. We will never go to the area again, one of them said.         
	Sivasagar superintendent of police Akhilesh Singh tried to play down the incident by terming it a minor one but villagers alleged that the Assam police were lax and the goons from across the border took advantage of it. People are making such comments only because we had to exercise maximum restraint since there were a lot of civilians in the area. The Arunachali side withdrew only after our men fought back with courage, he said over phone.         
	However, locals alleged that the Assam side has always been meek in dealing with the issue, resulting in escalation of attacks from the Arunachal side to such an extent that many villagers had been forced to flee, leaving behind all their belongings.         
	That the policemen got injured during the attack only exposes the lack of preparedness of the Assam side. If the policemen cannot defend themselves, how can the people expect security from them? said Robin Hondique, a villager.         
	Assam IGP, Eastern Range, L.R. Bisnoi, said, We had a very fruitful discussion yesterday and the priority was to restore normality. But I am afraid that there had been no sign from the Arunachal side showing that it is interested in controlling these miscreants and militants.         
	The Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad and the All Assam Students Union today burnt effigies of Assam law minister Pranob Gogoi at Charaipung and Bimalapur villages in the Charaipung area, alleging lax attitude on part of the minister in settling the problem in the area.

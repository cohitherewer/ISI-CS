  - Assam convention asks Ulfa and Centre to end three-decade-long bloodbath amp; sort conflicts          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, April 24: Assam today took another crack at peace as a daylong convention made a case for unconditional and early talks between Ulfa and the Centre to end the decades-long bloodbath in the state.        
	The convention, organised by the Citizens Forum at the ITA Centre for Performing Arts at Machkhowa here, was attended by representatives of several social bodies, student organisations and political parties.         
	Among those present on the dais was writer-activist Mamoni Raisom Goswami, who had initiated a peace process several years ago and even had the mandate of Ulfa. But the process had died down midway. She appeared slightly reluctant to voice an opinion on the new effort, saying she had come only to listen and not to speak.        
	But she did address the packed auditorium  according to the organisers nearly 1,500 delegates from across the state arrived for the convention  and expressed regret that the initiative taken by the Peoples Consultative Group (PCG) to find a solution to the issue had failed, despite the fact that the outfits leader Paresh Barua was directly co-ordinating with the organisation. The PCG was formed by Ulfa to prepare the ground for talks between the outfit and the Centre.        
	Two notable absentees at the function were journalist Ajit Bhuyan and lawyer Arup Barbora, both of whom were members of the PCG. Bhuyan said he could not attend the convention because of personal reasons. Barbora was not available for comment.        
	Hiren Gohain, president of todays convention, said the conclave was not a platform of the pro-talks or anti-talks group of Ulfa but the spokesman for the people of Assam. Through the convention we are conveying the message of the common man to both Ulfa and the government so that the peace talks start soon, Gohain said.         
	He said the state had witnessed 12,000 deaths of Ulfa cadres while 18,000 civilians and security personnel had been killed in the over three-decade-long insurgency, and added that it was time that both Ulfa and the government sorted out their internal conflicts and sat for a dialogue. There should be no pre-condition for talks, he said. The convention observed a minutes silence in memory of the martyrs and common man.         
	Gohain said the PCG had failed because of internal clashes and the rigidity of the government. Delhi and Dispur should remove their differences in the approach to the Ulfa issue to carry forward the peace process, he added.         
	Ulfas commander-in-chief Paresh Baruas recent statements to the media were only hampering the peace initiative taken up by the convention, Gohain felt.         
	Former minister and a veteran CPI activist Promode Gogoi said if the Centre could hold talks with the NSCN and the Mizo National Front on the sovereignty issue, why not with Ulfa?         
	AASU adviser Sammujal Bhattacharyya said unconditional talks should be held between Ulfa and the Centre and that too, immediately. He said it was total neglect from New Delhi that insurgency raised its ugly head in Assam. What we got from New Delhi after Independence is just political injustice and economic exploitation.         
	Manoj Baruah of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad said the term sovereignty should not be the hurdle for peace talks and the process should start soon.         
	Bhadra Kanta Goswami of the Asam Satra Mahasabha said talks between Ulfa and the Centre was a must for peace and development of Assam.        
	The convention announced seven draft resolutions, which would be finalised within a week by a core committee. The resolution includes:        
	 Unconditional talks at the highest level, involving the government and Ulfa immediately        
	 Immediate release of the jailed Ulfa leaders and suspension of all cases pending against them till a solution to the issue is arrived at. Ulfa should also take the opportunity to hold the central committee meeting immediately and the suggestions made during the convention should be considered or adopted        
	 There should be no time-wasting tactics by both the parties  government and Ulfa  and the talks should be aimed at finding an immediate solution        
	 Once talks are held: Government should not treat Ulfa as an insurgent group and should treat the outfits cadres cordially and Ulfa should give up the arms movement if they get a positive hint from the government        
	 A nine-member committee of the Citizens Forum has been named as the decision-making body and it would be the main decision-making body        
	 Three or four members of the committee will go to Delhi and submit the peace proposal         
	 Various ethnic groups that took part in the convention today would visit their areas for a public mandate and should inform the decision-making body

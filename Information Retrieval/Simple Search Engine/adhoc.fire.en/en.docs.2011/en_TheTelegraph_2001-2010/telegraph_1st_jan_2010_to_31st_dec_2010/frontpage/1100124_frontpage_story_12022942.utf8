The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Home ministry denies walkout
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Home ministry denies walkout
                            
	The Union home ministry has issued the following rejoinder to a report published in The Telegraph on Friday under the headline The untold walkout.        
	We are deeply disappointed that the above news story has crossed all bounds of fair reporting and propriety. The following incidents reported in the story are pure figments of the imagination:        
	 That Shri M.K. Narayanan (the former national security adviser) walked out of a meeting addressed by the home minister. The fact is that, at the conclusion of the meeting, Shri Narayanan told the home minister that he had another appointment and would not be able to stay back for the tea and excused himself.        
	 That the UPA chairperson summoned the home minister and gave him instructions on allocation of work to the minister of state. The fact is that no such meeting took place and no such instructions were given.        
	If these two so-called facts are knocked out of the news story, the very basis of the story itself is demolished. While you are entirely free to make your own interpretation of events and comment on the same, it is hoped that you will respect the well-established principle of fair journalism that facts are sacred.        
	K.P. Nayar, The Telegraphs chief diplomatic editor who wrote the report, responds:        
	It is necessary to put the sequence of events at the Intelligence Bureau Centenary Endowment Lecture on December 23, 2009, into proper context to iterate that Narayanan did walk out of the function and not tamely excuse himself from tea.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram reserved his thinly veiled attack on the national security adviser for the very last para of his 10-page, A-4-size, single-spaced, typewritten text of the lecture. The tea followed the lecture.        
	Narayanan showed his displeasure soon after Chidambaram criticised him in public. There was obviously no need for Narayanan to walk out before Chidambaram made it known to the audience, which included many of Narayanans peers and juniors in the intelligence community, what he thought of the national security adviser.         
	The home ministrys assertion that at the conclusion of the meeting, Narayanan told the home minister that he had another appointment vindicates what this newspaper stated in its story.        
	This correspondent has personally known for several decades that Narayanan is a stickler for telling in advance  and not at the conclusion of a function  if he has to leave midway. This correspondent most recently witnessed in Washington and in Port of Spain that Narayanan had not given up this habit of excusing himself in advance if he had to go elsewhere.        
	Walkouts have been part of Indias public life folklore for so long that they have produced some of the best after-dinner stories. When Brajesh Mishra was charge daffaires in Beijing in the years after the Sino-Indian border war, he used to walk out of functions in the Great Hall of the People so frequently that the Chinese started proposing toasts  in which India was the target  only after dessert was served, not after the entree, as was the norm. So that Mishra did not miss his dessert.        
	Narayanans walkout on December 23 may not have become an issue if he had not made it one himself. At this years Army Day, in a remarkable display of the understated humour that Narayanan is capable of even when he is down, the national security adviser referred to it and remarked that he was being got rid of.        
	It is possible that Sonia Gandhi may not have summoned Chidambaram for any meeting with the one-item agenda of allocating work to the minister of state for home.         
	Those who know Sonia say she is more graceful than to do that in her engagement of senior ministers.        
	But it is an open secret within the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee that Mullappally Ramachandran started getting files only after he expressed a desire to the UPA chairperson to be relieved from the cabinet.         
	Senior home ministry officials have told this correspondent that recent instructions to them are that Ramachandrans orders on matters allocated to him are to be implemented independently, without reference to the home secretary or the home minister. This is a rare gesture in the Indian system that hitherto applied only to ministers of state holding independent charge.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had called all the ministers of state as a group for a rare meeting on Tuesday and mollified them about not being allocated work by their senior ministers.

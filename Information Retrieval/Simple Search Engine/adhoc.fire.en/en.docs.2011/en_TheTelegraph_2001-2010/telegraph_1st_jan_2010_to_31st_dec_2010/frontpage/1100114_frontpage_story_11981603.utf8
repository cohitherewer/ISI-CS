                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Soren cool to Ajsu tantrums
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, Jan. 13: Feasting over chicken and fish, Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto went into a huddle with his ministers and MLAs at a holiday home in the outskirts of the capital to plan their strategy in a move to highlight their unhappiness at being denied the home portfolio.         
	We have been subjected to a raw deal by the government, Mahto said without naming the real target of his attack  chief minister Shibu Soren. The departments earlier promised to us have not been allocated. We are weighing the pros and cons to continue with this government. We will open our cards soon, he added.        
	If Mahto was hoping to ruffle Soren by going into a sulk, then his plan didnt seem to have worked. For, the chief minister was unperturbed. Sources close to him revealed that all he did was ask deputy chief minister Raghubar Das of the BJP to talk to Mahto.        
	The chief minister, the sources added, was of the opinion that the distribution of portfolios was done in a balanced manner and there was no question of handing over important portfolios like home and mines to the Ajsu.         
	Today, Mahto along with Chandra Prakash Chaudhary and Umakant Rajak, two Ajsu ministers, and MLAs Ramchandra Sahis and Kamal Kishore Bhagat spent the day at the holiday home on Kanke Road weighing their options and thinking of ways to bargain with Soren on the issue of better portfolios.        
	The menu for the day comprised chicken, fish, tadka, naan and friend rice, said a party source. Later, Ajsus Navin Jaiswal, who lost the elections from Hatia, and a businessman from neighbouring Bengal joined them.        
	Das met the Ajsu leaders in the evening and tried to talk it over with them. Its a case of misunderstanding between alliance partners. The matter wll be resolved by tomorrow. I will convey their grievances before Soren, he said.        
	The JD(U) minister, Sudha Chaudhary, too, had a problem with her portfolios, namely, tourism, social welfare and women and child development. I will meet the chief minister and ask him for a review of my portfolios, she said.         
	On their part, both the JMM and the BJP didnt resort to any public overtures to the disgruntled ministerial colleagues of the Ajsu and the JD(U). After spending the morning on official business at his Morabadi residence, Soren remained indoors for the rest of the day.        
	The JMMs confidence, if any, stems from the way the numbers are stacked in its favour. Needing the support of 41 MLAs to survive, the coalition managed 45 during the confidence vote.        
	Together the JMM, BJP and JD(U) have 38 MLAs, including the Speaker. At least three others, Mandar MLA and former minister Bandhu Tirkey, Bishunpur MLA Chamra Linda and Independent MLA from Panki Bidesh Singh have already voted in favour of the government.         
	Also, Nirsa MCC MLA Arup Chatterjee and two jailed MLAs, Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai, could back the government if push came to shove.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Friendship without deal fizz
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Friendship without deal fizz
          SUJAN DUTTA                            Barack Obama                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: Barack Obamas November 6-9 visit to India will showcase the breadth and scope of the India-US relationship but the fizz that marked George W. Bushs March 2006 trip is missing in the run-up because big-ticket deals have been practically ruled out.        
	The visit is also in the backdrop of the announcement of a $2-billion security aid package for Pakistan, despite consistent voices from New Delhis security establishment rejecting the US notion that Islamabad was acting satisfactorily to counter terrorists.        
	The military agreements are central to the India-US relationship that revived over the last six years. A huge expansion of friendly engagements between the two armed forces was also translating into commercial deals.        
	But without three foundational agreements being signed, the US says it cannot transfer sensitive and high-tech military hardware and American companies risk losing out on billions of dollars worth of Indian defence orders.        
	A senior US government official today said three defence pacts that have been pending  the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA), the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) and the Basic Exchange and Co-operation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation (BECA)  are still on the table.        
	India has had more friendly military exchanges in the last six years  exercises, study courses and conferences  with the US than with any other country, including its largest supplier, Russia.        
	But defence minister A.K. Antony gave little indication of a move forward on the foundational agreements in the strategic partnership that New Delhi and Washington claim to be forging. Antony also said defence deals were unlikely to be signed during the visit, stymieing speculation that the Indian Air Forces decision to buy 10 C-17 Globemaster III heavy airlifters for an estimated $ 5 billion would be contracted to Boeing through the US government when Obama is in New Delhi.        
	But a senior US government official claimed that our relationship is not transactional and that the focus in the relationship  since the last visit of a US President (Bush in 2006)  was shifting from civnuke (the civilian-nuclear deal that was the highlight of the Bush-Manmohan Singh summit) to showcase partnership on multiple fronts.        
	There is hope that Manmohan Singh and Obama will strike a rapport that would give a push to the pending agreements. The two have met eight times in the last 18 months  a record for meetings between a US President and an Indian Prime Minister -- and Manmohan Singh was the first state guest of the Obama administration last November.        
	The discordant notes were evident today. While the senior US government official said that there was an entire basket of issues on the agenda, the discrepancy between the Indian and the US stands on Pakistan was quite glaring.        
	The US official said Washington was giving the $2-billion aid package to Pakistan because Islamabad was seriously countering terrorists, including outfits such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba over which India was concerned.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has also been wanting the US support for Indias candidacy for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.        
	But Washington was maintaining its stand that India will be a central part of any reform of the UNSC without committing to back New Delhi.        
	The US official said Indias concerns over American curbs on business outsourcing was also in the basket of issues. India wants the US to lift the restrictions. But the Obama administration is legally committed to protecting jobs in the US that are under threat of being lost to the cheaper Indian market.

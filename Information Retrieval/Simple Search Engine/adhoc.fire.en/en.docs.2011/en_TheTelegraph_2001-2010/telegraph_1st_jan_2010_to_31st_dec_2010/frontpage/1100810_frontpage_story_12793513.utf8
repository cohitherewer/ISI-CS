	Tamluk, Aug. 9: The Congress today played the complementary ally to Mamata Banerjee but not before its state chief sent an unambiguous message: you need us to oust the CPM.        
	At a rally in Tamluk that coincided with Trinamuls Lalgarh event, the Congress sought to dispel perceptions that the timing of the meeting was aimed at slighting the ally.        
	We are against violence, so is Mamataji. We want peace, so does Mamataji. Our mission is the same. Our rally was organised to complement the one at Lalgarh by our alliance partner, said K. Keshava Rao, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, underscoring the similarities in outlook between the two allies.        
	Rao, who had skipped the Lalgarh rally despite an invite from Mamata so that he could be at the Congress event, told the Tamluk meeting: There is neither competition nor animosity between us. We will together oust the CPM through a peaceful movement.        
	If Rao fulfilled the role of an ideal partner in public, state Congress chief Manas Bhuniya did not mince words.         
	Without the Congress, it is not possible for a single party to oust the CPM from Bengal. An alliance is the need of the hour, said Bhuniya.        
	He was also critical of a section of Trinamul leaders who are out to corner the Congress in East Midnapore, within which Tamluk falls. Party sources said Bhuniya was referring to the attack on him and Youth Congress leader Usha Naidu by alleged Trinamul supporters in the district last month.         
	Bhuniya said he was pained by misinterpretations that the Congress rally was being held to counter Mamatas meeting. We are here to pay homage to our martyrs, who were killed in the 1942 (Quit India) movement. Mamatadi has done her bit in Lalgarh. There is no clash between us, he told the rally.        
	Bhuniya, who has shown a proactive streak, announced a party march from College Square to Hazra on August 20 to mark Rajiv Gandhis birth anniversary.         
	Trinamul leaders smelt politics in the move. South Calcutta is Mamatas bastion. Manass plan to lead a procession there is aimed at making inroads into her stronghold, a Trinamul MLA from south Calcutta said.

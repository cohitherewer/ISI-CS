  - Medieval relics for Ramesh, RU orders 3600           AMIT GUPTA                            Jairam Ramesh in the barbaric gown. File picture                                        
	Ranchi, April 13: Union forest and environment minister Jairam Ramesh may feel convocation gowns are barbaric colonial relics, his thoughts are definitely not shared by Ranchi University (RU) students who are making a beeline for the formal robe, to wear on April 17, the day of the 24th convocation.         
	With only three days to go for the big gathering, vice-chancellor A.A. Khan has been inundated with requests from students and guardians alike for gowns to wear to the ceremony, but to little effect as the last date to apply for one was March 31.         
	We have already placed orders with a Delhi-based firm for 3,600 gowns on rent. These would be for students who applied on time with a refundable amount of Rs 500 per gown. We cannot order more now, said Khan, even as a mother-son duo pleaded with him to arrange one more gown. Khan added that similar requests were pouring in everyday, but his office was unable to increase the number of students who would be conferred their degrees at the convocation ceremony last held in 2007. On April 2, Ramesh had triggered a controversy by stating that the convocation gowns were barbaric colonial relics while addressing students at the seventh convocation of the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM).         
	Why do we have to come dressed up as medieval vicars and Popes? he had asked, before taking off his robe in Bhopal.         
	Christian organisations, hurt by Rameshs comments, had asked the government to decide whether graduates should wear the robes or formals.         
	On Saturday, as many as 3,587 students will collect their degrees at the Ranchi ceremony against approximately 90,000 students who have studied in the university between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008.        
	 As many as 120 gold medals would be conferred on toppers of different examinations at the ceremony.        
	 For the students who will attend the ceremony, the gowns would be distributed between tomorrow and Friday.

  - Democratisation raises questions on quality of soccer           
	In what one might term the old days, before commercial and financial awareness changed the nature and value of sporting achievement, the World Cup finals began with a group stage in which teams felt their way into form and then knockout matches which produced outstandingly memorable matches.        
	Now, however, the pressures have reversed the pattern. Thus the better football is seen in the group matches when players are more relaxed knowing there are more games to come  and the fear-infested stuff is thrown up in the showdown games with something specific at stake.        
	Brazil proved the point with their poorest display of the finals in their last group game  a goalless draw with Portugal. Spain followed up by giving up on trying to score goals against the 10 men of Chile after about the hour mark and crawling through by 2-1.        
	Statistics underline the fear factor effect. This tournament is on course to generate the poorest average of goals per game of any World Cup. So far the average is 2.1 compared with the worst overall of 2.2 at the 1990 finals in Italy.         
	Further evidence comes from the goals per match day. Some 25 goals were scored in the first round of 16 games, 42 in the second round of 16 (but including seven in one game by Portugal against North Korea) and 34 in the third round.                  Luis Suarez after scoring his second goal in the match against South Korea, which sent his team Uruguay to the quarter-finals for the first time in 40 years. (AFP picture)       
	Obviously, it is invidious to compare standards and goal ratios too closely with the 1930s and 1950s, totally different eras in terms of fitness, match preparation, professionalism, television hype and worldwide pressure. But this writers own observation in his 12th World Cup is that the more teams there are in the finals (16 to 24 and now 32), the lower the quality of the football.        
	Here in South Africa, the fans have seen some very poor teams, exemplified by Greece which  from the manner of their football  arrived only to make up the numbers.                     
	Just being here was their World Cup victory and, happily, they have gone home. Not fast enough.        
	One more fascinating piece of data is that only six European nations enter the knockout second round compared with 10 in Germany four years ago.        
	England, Germany, Holland and Portugal are the European nations who have progressed in both 2006 and 2010 but the European contingent in the quarter-finals here will be cut by half to three because the pre-ordained draw means they all now play European opposition.        
	The other 10 nations battling it out are five from South America, two each from Asia and Central/North America and a highly disappointing and embarrassing one from host continent Africa (Ghana again). Four years ago, the finals presented a knockout start with three nations from South America and one each from Central/North America, Asia/Oceania and Africa.        
	This has been acclaimed as a welcome democratisation of the game and evidence of progress in Asia in particular, yet the quality of football, supported by the statistics, is depressing.        
	That raises some fundamental questions about the games balance of power: has European football at its ultimate, elite level been taken over by the Champions League? Have the clubs seized power at the expense of the national teams?        
	More people than ever around the world are watching these matches  says Fifa, so it must be right -- and following them on the Internet.        
	Brazil and Spain, hardly impressing in topping their groups, are the two teams to whom these billions look to raise the quality of the football to the level Fifa claims for the World Cup. Thats a mighty responsibility.        
	They will have to play better than they did on Friday.

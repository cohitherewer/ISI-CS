          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Jan. 8: The Jharkhand government shifted four IPS officers, including Palamau SP Jatin Narwal, in a bid to defuse the tension brewing in the Maoist bastion over an alleged custody death.        
	Narwal, at the centre of the controversy since the January 1 death of Rajendra Yadav, will be the new SP of the Special Task Force (STF), Ranchi.         
	Ramgarh SP Anup T. Mathew will replace Narwal in Palamau, while Ranchi SP (rural) Hemant Toppo has been shifted to Ramgarh. According to a notification issued by the home department on Friday, SP (CID) Mohit Bundas will be the new Ranchi SP (rural).        
	Sources said Shibu Soren decided to shift Narwal in an attempt to bury the controversy, especially because the two-member team probing the custody death allegation was understood to have finalised an adverse report.        
	This was one incident which the Maoists were using to the hilt to gain sympathy, said an aide, referring to the January 5 bandh called by the Maoists in Palamau.        
	Sources claimed the team, comprising energy secretary N.N. Pandey and DIG (special branch) Murari Lal Meena, had found the SP and other police officials guilty in the custodial death of Yadav, a resident of Tiladi village in Chattarpur in Palamau district.        
	Apart from constituting a high-level probe team, Soren ensured a second post-mortem at RIMS. The report established both external and internal injuries as the cause of death.

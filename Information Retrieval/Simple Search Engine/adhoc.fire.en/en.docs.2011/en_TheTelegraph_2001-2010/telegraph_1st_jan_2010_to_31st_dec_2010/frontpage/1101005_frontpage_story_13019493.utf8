	New Delhi, Oct. 4: The Indian Air Force has a shortage of nearly 600 pilots and half its equipment is obsolete but the trend is reversing, Air Chief Marshal Pradeep Vasant Naik said here today.        
	It is not as though we are incapable, he said. For nearly 10 years there was little money available but now that is not the case.        
	Fewer pilots are opting out of the force  lured by private airlines  than they were, and in five years the obsolescence rate of equipment would be down from 50 per cent to 20 per cent, Naik said.        
	The IAF will celebrate its 78th anniversary this Friday. The date is observed as Air Force Day every year.        
	There was a shortage of between 550 and 600. But the attrition rate has been positive for some time now, he said, meaning that more pilots were being inducted into the force than were leaving it.        
	But with the IAF expanding its flying fleet  Airborne Early Warning aircraft (AWACS) have joined this year and  the demand for pilots in the helicopter, transport and fighter streams is set to go up manifold.         
	The IAF is now in the middle of choosing 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA). Depending on the selection, these aircraft could be single or twin-seaters. In the event of the choice being a twin-seater, the IAF will need more fighter pilots than ever before.         
	Naik said the IAF had submitted its evaluation report on fighter aircraft trials to the defence ministry. It was now up to the government to down select from the list of six competitors for what is the worlds single-largest defence contract right now.         
	The six competitors are the F-16 Super Viper, the F/A-18 Super Hornet, Gripen NG, Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and the MiG 35.        
	Naik said plugging the gaps in air defence was topmost on his list of priorities as the IAF seeks to address technological obsolescence. Acquisition of sharper radars, surface-to-air missiles and a missile-defence system are high on the shopping list.         
	There is also a shortage of about 50,000 personnel below the officer rank (PBOR). He said that in two years, the IAF would recruit 30,000 additional staff.         
	Naik said the IAF was planning to buy between 200 and 250 Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA). The FGFA programme is a joint venture with Russia. It is still on the drawing board. If the developers abide by the schedule, the induction of these fifth-generation fighters could start in seven years from now.

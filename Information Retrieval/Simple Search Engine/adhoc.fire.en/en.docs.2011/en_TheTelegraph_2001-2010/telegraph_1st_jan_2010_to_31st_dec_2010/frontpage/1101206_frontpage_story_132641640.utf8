	Kolkata, Dec 6 (PTI): La Martinere student Srijan Banerjee, who was denied re-admission after he failed twice in Class IV, today returned to school after the Supreme Court asked its authorities to take him back and grant him promotion on humanitarian grounds.
    "Srijan has joined school today. He has been promoted to Class V in keeping with the orders of the Supreme Court," secretary of the school Board of Governors Supriyo Dhar said.
    Nearly seven months ago, Srijan's father Partha Banerjee moved the Calcutta High Court after his class teacher Sanjay Smart allegedly demanded a laptop to promote him to Class V.
    The high court had ordered that Srijan be re-admitted in the school.
    The school had initiated proceedings against Smart and suspended him. He was subsequently arrested by the police.

          G.S. MUDUR                                                    
	Hyderabad, Aug. 19: The worlds biggest mathematical event opened here today providing glimpses of a powerful yet contrasting sweep of an intellectual discipline that has yielded works deeply esoteric as well as tricks for digital movies and faster modems.         
	The quadrennial International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), hosted by India for the first time, kicked off with an awards ceremony for a set of six achievers for unparalleled feats in the subjects frontiers and an octogenarian mathematician for a lifetime of achievements.         
	A 36-year-old long-haired French mathematician, Cedric Villani, was among four who bagged the Fields Medal, an award that carries the prestige of a Nobel Prize. Villani, who wore a burgundy neck band and a spider brooch on his jacket, received the award for, among other results, tackling a 138-year-old mystery involving the behaviour of gas molecules trapped in a bottle and abruptly set free.         
	You never know how difficult a problem is until youve solved it  and then it looks easy, said Villani, who also said that he had waited for an email confirmation to make sure the phone call he had received about his selection was not a hoax.         
	Ngo Bau Chau, born and raised in Vietnam and now at the Universite Paris-Sud in France; Elon Lindenstrauss from Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel; and Stanislav Smirnov at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, also received the Fields Medals. Each winner gets a medal of pure gold and a cash prize of Canadian $15,000 (Rs 6.7 lakh).         
	Chau has provided a proof of a long-standing mathematical conjecture using novel geometrical techniques, Smirnov delivered an all-important missing step in another mathematical idea, and Lindenstrauss advanced a mathematical theory that can be used to describe dynamical systems such as a billiard ball richocheting around a frictionless, pocketless billiard table.        
	The Field Medals are only awarded to mathematicians below 40.         
	But 85-year-old Louis Nirenberg, from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York, received the new Chern Prize ($250,000) given for the first time at ICM 2010. Nirenberg is hailed in mathematical circles as a creator of new ideas in geometry and other fields, and for mentoring a generation of young researchers. A Princeton University mathematician, Joseph Kohn, once wrote that aside from mathematics, Nirenberg has taught all of us the enjoyment of travel, movies, and gastronomy.        
	These awards show that mathematics wasnt completed during the 17th and 19th centuries  it is still a very live subject, and were still getting very important results, said Laszlo Lovasz, a Hungarian, and the president of the International Mathematical Union.        
	All the Fields Medals achievements this year deal with long-standing problems, said Madabusi Santanam Raghunathan, a mathematician at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and chairman of the executive organising committee of ICM 2010.        
	The language they use may be common, but even Fields winners find it difficult to fathom the significance of each others work. We know there are connections between (our) fields, but no one really understands exactly what the other is doing, said Lindenstrauss.        
	But research by Daniel Spielman, a computer scientist at Yale University, who won the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, and Yves Meyer, a 71-year-old mathematician at the Ecole Normale Superieure, France, who won the Gauss Prize, have yielded real world applications. Both these awards carry a medal and a cash prize of 10,000 euros.        
	Communication engineers have relied on Spielmans techniques for correcting errors to develop fast and secure communications across computer networks. Spielman, 40, and his co-workers have designed efficient methods of coding and decoding that provide an efficient way to transfer information over the Internet.        
	Meyers work has, among other things, led to a standard tool kit for image compression that may be used for the transmission of digital movies, said Ingrid Daubechies, a mathematician at Princeton University.        
	Scientists have also harnessed a method of image processing that Meyer developed for an instrument aboard a space observatory launched last year that will be used to look for the oldest and coldest stars in the universe.        
	More than 2,500 delegates from over 40 countries have arrived at ICM 2010 where mathematicians will discuss the latest and most significant results in the myriad branches of the discipline. Conference presentations will range from the applications of mathematics in science and technology to the history of mathematics to outstanding problems in pure mathematics.         
	The International Mathematical Union, which organises the event, said ICM 2014 would be held in South Korea. After the first ICM in 1897 and the second one in 1900, ICMs have taken place every four years  except during the years of the World Wars.

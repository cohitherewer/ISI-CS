                                Anthony   Bamford                                  
	London, May 30 (PTI): The House of Lords vetting body has blocked Anthony Bamford, chairman of the JCB construction equipment firm, from becoming a peer, apparently expressing concerns over his tax affairs.         
	Bamford, 64, who has substantial business interests in India, had his nomination rejected by the House of Lords Appointments Commission after the tax authorities failed to support it.         
	Earlier, the Conservative-led coalition government in Britain was rocked after chief treasury secretary David Laws resigned over his expenses scandal.         
	The rejection of Bamfords application comes as a blow to Cameron who had personally recommended him for ennoblement. It will raise further questions about the funding of political parties and the rewarding of donors with honours.         
	Days before the list was published on Friday, Bamford wrote to Cameron withdrawing his name from the process. He said he wanted to concentrate on running his company. A spokesperson denied his withdrawal has anything to do with his name being vetoed by the appointments commission. He said he was unaware that any concerns had been raised about his tax affairs.         
	The Bamford family has donated generously to the Tories. His firm has given the party 1.5 million, while Bamford has donated 86,000, including 10,000 worth of helicopter rides to Cameron.         
	The businessman, whose wealth is 950 million, according to the Sunday Times rich list, was awarded a knighthood in 1990.         
	A spokesperson for Bamford said: Sir Anthony was approached by David Cameron six months ago to be a working peer with a brief for manufacturing and engineering.         
	However, he has decided he would not be able to devote the time to the House of Lords and feels that he still needs to commit full time to the affairs of the JCB group.

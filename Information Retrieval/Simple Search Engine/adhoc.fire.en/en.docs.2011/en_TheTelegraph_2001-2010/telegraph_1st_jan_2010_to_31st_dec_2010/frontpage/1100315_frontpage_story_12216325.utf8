          PAUL RICHTER                            Hillary Clinton                                  
	New York, March 14: Beginning as a spat over a single housing project, a dispute this week between the Barack Obama administration and Israel has ballooned into the biggest US-Israeli clash in 20 years, adding to months of strain between Washington and one of its closest allies.        
	Israels decision to move ahead with 1,600 new housing units in East Jerusalem, announced during a visit by Vice-President Joe Biden, drew criticism from Washington in language rarely directed at even Iran or North Korea.        
	Secretary of state Hillary Clinton said Israels announcement was an insult to the United States.        
	In a 45-minute telephone call on Friday to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hillary upbraided him and demanded that he take more steps to show his nations commitment to peace.        
	A senior US official described the administrations objection to the project as the first time the US has really pushed back hard.        
	The Israeli government, stunned and perplexed by the US assault, tried to regroup this weekend. Netanyahu convened seven members of his cabinet yesterday to consider their response, and his office said a committee would investigate the timing of the housing announcement.        
	Underlying the diplomatic fracture are complicated political calculations by both governments. Hillarys criticism, authorised by Obama, was aimed at trying to obtain concessions from the conservative Israeli government at a moment when Netanyahu might be politically vulnerable, officials said.        
	The US goal is to win Israeli agreement to back off the housing project and to forgo announcements of additional Jewish construction in East Jerusalem, officials said. America also wants Israel to agree to discuss substantive issues in the peace talks that could begin in coming days, US officials said.        
	US officials hope that the Israeli concessions might enlist support for the talks from the Palestinians and the Arab states, which have been wavering since the Israeli announcement on Tuesday inflamed Arab opinion.

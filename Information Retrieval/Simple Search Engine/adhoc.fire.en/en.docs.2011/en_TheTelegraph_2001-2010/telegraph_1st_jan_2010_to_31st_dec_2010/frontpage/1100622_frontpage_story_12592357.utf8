	Mumbai, June 21: An 11- year-old girl crippled during the Mumbai attacks, whose emotional but unshakeable testimony in Ajmal Kasabs trial had given her national fame, has allegedly been turned away by a private school that doesnt want to risk trouble by admitting a 26/11 victim.        
	Slum child Devika Rotawan had appeared in the court on crutches, her right leg shattered by the Pakistani gunmens bullets, and later earned praise from the judge for her testimony that helped nail Kasab.        
	But the terror attack that has changed her life for ever now threatens her future, her father Natwarlal told The Telegraph this evening.        
	Natwarlal said he had been dreaming of admitting both his children to New English School, located near his tiny chawl room in Bandra East, where he lives with Devika and son Jayesh, 13.        
	First they (the school) said, Get a letter from the police and I submitted a letter from the crime branch. I was called again today at 2pm, when school principal Rathod told me they could not admit Devika as they feared trouble because of her 26/11 background, Natwarlal said.        
	The 46-year-old father, who is originally from Rajasthan and sells dry fruits and saffron for a living, said he was heartbroken. My daughter did a service to the country by helping identify convict Kasab. After she bravely stood in the courtroom and identified Kasab, everybody including the judge told me she was a bright child and I should educate her. But if a school refuses, what can I do?        
	The family prefers New English School because its at a walking distance from their home at Sant Dhyaneshwar Nagar slum.        
	Till Kasab is actually hanged, there may be a threat to Devikas life. Thats why I prefer this school  so she doesnt have to travel much, Natwarlal said. He added that the Tata Group had offered to sponsor Devikas education.        
	The New English School management could not be contacted. But crime branch officer Vilas Jamawane, who had given a letter on behalf of Mumbai police requesting the school to admit Devika, said: I had visited the school with Devikas father and requested them to admit her.        
	He added: We had met the vice-principal. She told us the final decision would be taken by the trust that runs the school. I am not aware of what transpired today but I hope Devika gets admission because she is a bright and brave girl.        
	On the night of 26/11, the Rotawans were waiting at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to board a train to Pune when Devika was injured by Kasabs bullets. Her right leg broke into two and doctors put a rod in her leg. The doctors said she wouldnt be able to walk properly for at least three years. Today she walks slowly without crutches, but it hurts, Natwarlal said.        
	On June 10 last year, however, a hobbling Devika had left the entire courtroom deeply impressed. What happens if you take an oath and lie? judge M.L. Tahaliyani had asked her in Hindi.        
	She replied it was sinful to take an oath in the name of God and lie. Minutes later, she identified Kasab as one of the two gunmen she saw at the terminus. When Kasabs lawyer Abbas Kazmi accused her of lying, Devika replied: Bhagwan ki kasam khakar main jhoot nahin bolti (I dont lie after swearing by God).

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Punamiya and Vyas in Ranchi on Thursday. (Prashant Mitra)                          
	Ranchi, Aug. 12: Two close aides of former chief minister Madhu Koda  Manoj Punamiya and Arvind Vyas, both hawala operators and alleged kingpins of the multi-crore money laundering scam  were today remanded in 14 days judicial custody by the special Enforcement Directorate (ED) court in Ranchi and lodged at Birsa Munda Central Jail.        
	Their arrests are being seen as a major breakthrough in unearthing the Koda scam.         
	The two were brought to Ranchi this afternoon. They were produced before the special ED court of G.K. Singh, who remanded them in 14 days judicial custody. It is now up to ED officials investigating the scam to take them on remand for interrogation, senior public prosecutor S.R. Das told The Telegraph. Punamiya and Vyas were arrested in New Delhi yesterday.         
	Punamiya, a close associate of the former chief minister, was detained by immigration authorities at Mumbai airport on July 26 on his arrival from Dubai. A red corner notice had been issued against him earlier, though he had successfully given immigration officials the slip on at least five occasions, while flying to Dubai (thrice), Switzerland and the US. The ED is now probing how he left the country despite the lookout notices.        
	Punamiya was later taken to Delhi for questioning by ED officers. The hawala operator, who is also CEO of Mumbai based Balaji Bullion, is said to be the kingpin of the money laundering business involving Koda. He reportedly provided the import-export cover every time money was smuggled out of the country through the hawala route.        
	Vyas, another Mumbai-based hawala dealer, was nabbed by immigration authorities on June 3 while trying to flee to Dubai.         
	He is accused of colluding with Sanjay Choudhary, who oversaw Kodas Dubai operations. Choudhary has been evading arrest for the last nine months.        
	The duo was accompanied from Delhi to Ranchi by ED additional director D.N. Poddar.         
	A list of charges giving the grounds of arrest of both Punamiya and Vyas was produced by the ED before the special court. While Punamiya is said to have sent Rs 272 crore out of the country, Vyas is said to have transferred a whopping Rs 672 crore out of the country through hawala for investments in Dubai, Thailand, Indonesia, Sweden, Liberia and elsewhere.

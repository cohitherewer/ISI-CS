                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ulfa mulled talks after 9/11 amp; return of Awami League in Bangladesh
          DIPANKAR ROY                              
	Nalbari, Dec. 13: First 9/11 and then the return of Awami League to power in Bangladesh last year. The two events had already set the Ulfa mulling negotiations when its leaders taking shelter in the neighbouring country were apprehended.        
	Speaking exclusively to The Telegraph, Ulfas deputy commander-in-chief Raju Barua said, 9/11 had already redefined the worlds response to revolutions and freedom struggles and there was apprehension internationally that the hand of Laden could also reach out to Southeast Asia where several such movements were taking place. When the Awami League returned to power with apparent help from India, we realised we needed to do some fresh thinking on our strategy and started contemplating talks with the government.         
	The interview was interrupted occasionally by a stream of visitors, who, since Baruas release from jail, have given his residence at Charia the look of one belonging to an elected representative and turned an I-am-the-reticent type person into a more expressive one.        
	Interestingly, all the discussions among the Ulfa leaders in Bangladesh on the subject  from the changed situation in Bangladesh and globally  were recorded in a laptop that security agencies found on Barua. To an extent, it worked to our advantage because the government now knew our mind that we were willing to hold talks, he said.        
	Barua said the arrests in Bangladesh had not come as a great surprise to them. We were expecting some kind of action. Our sources also kept warning us of such a possibility but by the time we could take any evasive action they had arrested us.         
	Eventually, several other Ulfa cadres also came over from Bangladesh and some of them, in fact, have now made their deputy commander-in-chiefs residence their home, building temporary accommodation made of bamboo on its premises.        
	The last word though may not have been heard on the issue of talks. Barua, who has been with Ulfa for 25 of its 31 years, said the leaders who were and are still in jail had only expressed their willingness to hold talks, but the formal decision would only be taken by the executive council.         
	We have only expressed our willingness to hold talks... the decision in this regard has to be taken by the executive council, he said. Its a formality that could make a big difference to possible negotiations.        
	Barua said a meeting of the council could take place only when all the leaders were out of jail and could meet in a conducive atmosphere. That is what we have been telling the government, he said.        
	Barua, however, is hopeful. Ninety-five per cent of the response has been favourable and hopefully by the time the executive council meeting is held, the scenario will improve further. Barring the 27 battalion, all other battalions have extended support. We are expecting a statement from the 27 battalion soon, too, he said.        
	Barua did not appear too bothered about all the speculation with regard to the stand that the outfits commander-in-chief, Paresh Barua, might take, saying he had never opposed the proposal to hold talks.         
	The Ulfa deputy commander-in-chief said opposition to any decision of the executive council by anyone would be a counter-revolutionary act since no individual was above the organisation and its constitution. We have after all sworn by Ulfa constitution, he said.        
	The Ulfa leader said there had been no contact with Paresh Barua or another executive council member, Jibon Moran, who is said to be in Myanmar, ever since the process for holding talks started and whatever they have come to learn of was from media statements.         
	We will call them for the executive council meeting through some means, he said, adding that it was too early to talk about safe passage because it would amount to seeking a ceasefire. Well wait and see, he said.        
	However, he also made it clear that even without them (Paresh Barua and Moran) and three others, including general secretary Anup Chetia, the 13-member executive council would still have the required quorum to take a decision.         
	While Chetia is in a Bangladesh jail, the three others, Ashanta Baghphukan, Benning Rabha and Robin Neog, had gone missing in the wake of Operation All Clear in Bhutan in December 2003.

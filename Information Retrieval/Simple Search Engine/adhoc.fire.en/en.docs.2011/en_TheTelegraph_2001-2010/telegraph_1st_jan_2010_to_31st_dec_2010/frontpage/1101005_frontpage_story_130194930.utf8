	Srinagar, Oct 5 (PTI): More than 20 years after a disproportionate assets case was registered against a former Jammu and Kashmir Minister, authorities are yet to grant sanction to prosecute him.
    The case against former minister Jagjivan Lal of National Conference is among 664 corruption cases registered by the State Vigilance Organisation and Crime Branch against public servants including several IAS officers.
    This was stated by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah in a written reply in the House to a question of CPI(M) MLA M Y Tarigami, who wanted details of officers and ministers involved in corruption cases, inquiry conducted and action taken against them..
    The case against Lal was registered by SVO in Jammu in 1989 but he is yet to face trial even after 21 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dutch set up European final
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dutch set up European final
                            
	Third time lucky for the Dutch? Few prizes for guessing who they will want in Sundays World Cup final in Soccer City: Germany.        
	The heart has its reasons: the Netherlands have nurtured the will for revenge ever since Johan Cruyffs total football outfit of 1974 were defeated by Franz Beckenbauers hosts in Munich; older, more cynical, Dutchmen may grumble that it goes further than that.        
	Goals from the reliable Gio Van Bronckhorst, from the outstanding Wesley Sneijder and from the explosive Arjen Robben brought the Dutch through 3-2 but all credit to Uruguay for holding their nerve, despite their personnel problems, right to the end.        
	Uruguay boss Oscar Washington Tabarez, early in these finals, had forecast that his side could go a long way but only if they played their very best in every game and were fortunate with injuries and suspensions.        
	The Celeste had fortune on their side at the end of extra time in their dramatic quarter-final against Ghana. But the cost of that game was measured in injury to defensive pillar and skipper Diego Lugano and the suspensions of outstanding left-back Jorge Fucile and even more outstanding spearhead Luis Suarez.        
	The finger of football fate decided that the semi-finals were as far as they deserved to go and a month ago, in truth, that was further than they had dreamed and than anyone else had expected.        
	Hopefully, they will be consoled, in time, by the knowledge that in Diego Forlan, they had one of the most outstanding and committed individuals of the finals. His wholehearted effort in every minute in his every game should shame super-hyped failures such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Wayne Rooney.        
	Uruguay go on to the third-place play-off in Port Elizabeth on Saturday while the Dutch progress to Sundays final against Germans or Spaniards who now shake down their own soccer dice in Durban.        
	This is a fascinating repeat of the Euro 2008 final which had been, one might term, a one-goal massacre. Spain deserved to win by two or three clear goals. That they did not was all down to German spirit and resolve.        
	This time, we have the youthful pace of Germany against the creative steel of Spain; Germany will miss suspended youngster Thomas Mueller while Spain miss the fullyfit edge of Fernando Torres; Germany boast 13 goals in five games while Spain have struggled to score just six; Germanys Miroslav Klose is one goal off Ronaldos all-time record tally of 15 in World Cups while Spains David Villa is five-goal leading marksman this time around.        
	What is certain is that Sunday will see only the eighth all-European final. If its the Netherlands versus Spain, it will mean a new name on the World Cup.        
	But the Dutch want Germany. Not out of disrespect to Spain but because they have a score to settle. It matters not that the Netherlands beat Germany in Hamburg in 1988 on their way to the European title.        
	What matters still is the indelible memory of 1974: how the Dutch took the lead inside two minutes before a German had even touched the ball and yet lost 2-1.        
	Arrogance undermined them that day; the very weakness which current coach Bert van Marwijk had sought to exorcise since the start of his managerial reign two years ago.        
	Now, remarkably, he is within one game of succeeding where mentor Rinus Michels failed, where Johan Cruyff failed and, along with them, legends such as Arie Haan, Rudi Krol, Johan Neeskens, Wim van Hanegem and Robbie Rensenbrink.        
	For once, tonight, most Dutch fans may be cheering on Germany.

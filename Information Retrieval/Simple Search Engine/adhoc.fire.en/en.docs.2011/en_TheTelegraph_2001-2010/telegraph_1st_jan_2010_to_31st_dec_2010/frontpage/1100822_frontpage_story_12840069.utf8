  - Kashmir decision likely by end of Ramazan

	New Delhi, Aug. 21: The conclusion of the Amarnath yatra on Tuesday might signal the onset of a comprehensive political and administrative overhaul in strife-torn Jammu and Kashmir but despite widespread demands, the Centre is likely to continue backing chief minister Omar Abdullah.        
	Key among them are a cabinet shuffle to bring in fresh faces and a top-level shake-up in the police and civil service. Sources said both chief secretary S.S. Kapoor and director-general of police Kuldip Khoda might lose their jobs if only to give the government a new look.        
	And although both Omar and Union home minister P. Chidambaram have categorically denied any plans to lift the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from the Valley, proposals to either amend it or take certain areas off its purview are on the table.        
	The Centre has long been promising to make the locally loathed AFSPA more humane, but the security forces remain averse to changes arguing they will impact anti-insurgency operations.        
	It could well be, sources said, that some key districts including Srinagar, Budgam and Kulgam will be taken off the AFSPAs jurisdiction. These are among various options being considered and you may see a decision before the end of the month of Ramazan, an Id gift to the people if you like, a source said.        
	Major revamp efforts are being put in place keeping in mind the end of the Amarnath yatra, which will not only relieve thousands of paramilitary and police jawans of logistical duties but also see most pilgrim-tourists out of the Valley. It is significant that while Kashmir has been in bloody tumult, not a single untoward incident has visited the elaborate yatra.        
	The beleaguered Omar, who has grappled haplessly with unrelenting street violence that has left more than 60 dead since mid-June, was twice close to quitting in exasperation but was persuaded to stay on by New Delhi and, more expressly, by his father and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah.        
	Former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra recently added his voice to those demanding Omars dismissal as a first step to urgent corrections in Kashmir. In addition to the Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP, an influential section of the provincial Congress too has been lobbying behind-the-scenes for Omars sacking.        
	But neither the Congress high command nor the Centre appears moved yet. The Centres argument has been that Omar represents a credibly elected government and is the best face to put at the forefront of the campaign to neutralise an offensive backed by secessionist elements in Kashmir and Pakistan.        
	Farooq, a Union minister who has weathered previous storms in the Valley, has been telling his son that by abdicating office at this juncture, Omar might well be jeopardising the political future of the National Conference.        
	Psychological factors are also weighing on the Congress high command; it wants to avoid pulling the rug from under Omars feet and risking a repeat of the bitter political history between the Abdullahs and the Nehru-Gandhis. Down three past generations, the two clans have sporadically played friends and foes.        
	There is a new equation between Omar and Rahul Gandhi and the latter is keen not to repeat past patterns, a senior Kashmiri Congress leader said. Even if a decision on a change of guard has to be taken, it will be done in consultation with the Abdullahs, not behind their backs.        
	Therefore, despite glaring and recurrent administrative and policing lapses in the Valley, Omar has not merely been exhorted to stay in harness but been promised redoubled political and logistical backing from New Delhi.        
	On his part, the relatively novice chief minister has invested greater time and commitment to the task at hand than previously  often skipping customary weekend trips to New Delhi to be with his family, often venturing into the Valleys interior for mass contact  but many Kashmir watchers believe that tempers and emotions have run beyond political overtures by the incumbent.        
	During a recent visit to a Srinagar hospital to meet those injured in police action, for instance, Omar was lavishly harangued by their relations and had to cut his visit short. A sign of his insecurity with the public mood was also that he travelled the few kilometres from his official residence to the central Srinagar hospital in a chopper rather than by road.        
	The burden of recent political and intelligence inputs from the Valley have begun to suggest that Omar may not be the best man to have there if the violent tide has to be turned, or even muted, in the Valley.        
	Over the last month, Omar has come to symbolise a lot of what the angry street wants changed in Kashmir, a top government source said. We are aware that getting him off the scene will solve very little, but it may go some way in calming tempers; it might give the angry boys a sense of victory.        
	The source was keen to emphasise, though, that any decision to remove Omar will necessarily be political and taken at the highest level in the UPA. As things stand, the source said, Omar still enjoys unstinted backing from UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Rahul.

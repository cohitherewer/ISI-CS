          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 12: The Centre is planning to make provisions of a bill to fight sexual offences more stringent, laying down a new definition, expanding the reach of the law, setting a time limit for trials and allowing arrests without warrants.        
	The changes have been mooted against the backdrop of a spurt in sexual offences in a country, and at least one provision seems to have been prompted by the furore over the Ruchika Girhotra molestation and suicide case.        
	According to a sub-section of the Sexual Offences (Special Courts) Bill, 2010, whoever, with sexual intent, touches, directly or indirectly, with a part of the body or with an object, any part of the body of another person, not being the spouse of such person, without the consent of such other person, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both.         
	This is in sharp contrast with the current law that defines sexual assault as non-consensual penile penetration of the vagina.        
	The new bill stipulates that the trial shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible, preferably within six months.        
	The bill aims to widen the definition of workplace to cover students, research scholars and those working in the unorganised sector. It makes all sexual offences cognisable, empowering police to arrest an accused without a court warrant.         
	According to the draft bill, the trial under this act of any sexual offence shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible and every endeavour shall be made to complete it within six months.        
	Such a provision is considered essential as prosecution often tends to drag on for years, prolonging the trauma of victims and sometimes prompting them to give up the fight.        
	The clause that can be linked to the Girhotra case says: Whoever, being in a position of trust or authority towards a young person or is a person with whom the young person is in a relationship of dependency, touches, directly or indirectly, with sexual intent, with a part of the body or with an object, any part of the body of such young person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.        
	The fresh recommendations have been made by a committee with representatives from the ministries of social justice and empowerment, women and child development, health and family welfare, railways, information and broadcasting, home and labour and employment.              
	The legislation also proposes amendments to some sections of the Indian Penal Code related to rape and molestation and to the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.         
	According to the amendments, sexual assault will mean not only penile penetration but the introduction, to any extent, by a man of an object or part of the body into the vagina, or anus or urethra of a woman or a child.        
	The bill, once approved by the law and home ministries, is likely to be tabled during the budget session of Parliament, scheduled to begin this month.

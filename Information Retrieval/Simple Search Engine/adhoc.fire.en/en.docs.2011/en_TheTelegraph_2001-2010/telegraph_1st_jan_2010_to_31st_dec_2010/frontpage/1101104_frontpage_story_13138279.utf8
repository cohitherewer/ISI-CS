          K.P. NAYAR                                                    
	Washington, Nov. 3: President Barack Obama will arrive in India this weekend bruised but not battered from the results of yesterdays mid-term elections to the US Congress and gubernatorial mansions in America.        
	Obama lost control of the House of Representatives where Republicans convincingly captured as many as 60 seats that belonged to Democrats in the outgoing House and led in four more opposition bastions at the time of writing.        
	But Democrats retained their hold on the Senate with a wafer-thin majority of just one seat with three more results in the balance.        
	In states from coast to coast, Republicans altered the political balance in gubernatorial mansions: they now control 27 governorships against 15 by the Democrats with seven results expected. In the small coastal state of Rhode Island, a Republican who quit the party in protest against the policies of George W. Bush won as an Independent.        
	With Republicans gaining control of the House of Representatives and assuming veto power in a Senate  where any party with three-fifth majority can steamroller legislation  the President has largely lost the ability to pursue his ambitious domestic agenda which won him the White House two years ago.        
	Unless Obama is able to short-circuit this handicap, he may end up as a one-term President in 2012 like Jimmy Carter and George Herbert Walker Bush.        
	However, the mixed results bode well for Obamas visit to Mumbai and New Delhi and have actually brightened the prospects for improvement in Indo-US relations in the next two years, although they were written off by pundits in India before yesterdays voting.        
	If India  like Israel and its lobby here  is able to approach its bilateral dealings with Washington with an imaginative mix of vision, cunning, deft planning and cynicism, the sky could be the limit in the next two years in this city which will be divided deep down the middle on almost every issue.        
	Relations with India will be one of the few subjects on which the incumbent administration and the incoming Congress can agree. That offers a golden opportunity for New Delhi to do what it wants to make of its ties with America.        
	The occupant of the White House who will break bread with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh three times next week will doubtless be a President diminished by the unwillingness and intransigence of the next US Congress to be on the same page with him.        
	But look at the bright spots for India! The powerful House of Representatives foreign affairs committee will get rid of its Democratic chairman, the nuclear non-proliferation-obsessed Howard Berman of California, who opposed the nuclear deal with India throughout and authored some killer amendments to block it up to the very final vote on it in the House.        
	Instead, this committee will be chaired by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican who fought a hard-won battle to become co-chair of the Congressional caucus on India and Indian Americans in 2005, the year of the nuclear deal.        
	To be sure, Ros-Lehtinen has a price and demanded it during various phases of the nuclear negotiations. But if India is prepared to pay the price, New Delhi will have this key committee on its side in the next two years with attendant advantages which cannot be understated.        
	Similarly, the chairmanship of the House of Representatives sub-committee on terrorism, non-proliferation and trade, important for India, will switch from Brad Sherman of California, another ayatollah of non-proliferation on the Potomac. It will go to Republican Ed Royce, also of California, but a very different kind of Californian, a two-time co-chair of the India caucus, who played a key role in lifting sanctions imposed on India after the nuclear tests of 1998.        
	This House committee, among other things, deals with trade: while it may be too much to expect that Royce will do anything to repeal recent legislation against outsourcing for reasons of political correctness, he is an insurance for Indias service industry against further Democratic action on Capitol Hill to prevent globalisation of services.        
	Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, has been unhelpful for India on matters under his chairmanship of the committee on financial services. Royce is a contender for this post as well because this panel is more influential than the other committee where he is a shoo-in.        
	But if he does not make it, this chairmanship will go to one of the two senior Republican contenders: Spencer Bachus of Alabama or Pete King of New York. Both Congressmen have been conciliatory on issues of Indian interest: one of them is obsessed that China is evil and is willing to go along with anyone who is perceived as being against China.        
	Similarly, India now has an opportunity to forge partnerships with states where New Delhi hardly mattered. In Kansas, a long-time supporter of India, Republican Sam Brownback, was elected governor with a thumping majority of 63 per cent against his Democratic rival who got merely 32 per cent.        
	Legislation on Capitol Hill which eased the sanctions against India after Pokhran II are known as the Brownback amendments because of his role as a senator in crafting them during the Clinton administration.        
	Similarly, in Ohio, former Bush trade negotiator Rob Portman won a Senate seat. Portman has a deep understanding of and some sympathy for Indian positions on trade issues during the years when he built up strong personal ties with successive Indian commerce ministers.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 6: Infosys today brought the promise of 15,000 to 20,000 jobs for Bengal, giving the embattled state government an opportunity to protect its showpiece township of Newtown from going the Singur way.        
	Infosys chief executive officer S. Gopalakrishnan said the IT company wanted to set up a global software development centre on its 50-acre plot in the township. The announcement comes amid fears that a Trinamul-led land agitation, set to resume on Thursday, in Newtown may affect IT investments.        
	We will start as soon as required provisions and infrastructure development is complete, Gopalakrishnan said after a 30-minute afternoon meeting with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	He said the company would start construction within six months or probably before that once the necessary infrastructure was in place, but did not mention any specific requirements.        
	Necessary infrastructure for an IT company includes good roads, water supply, sewer lines, uninterrupted power supply, high-frequency connectivity and affordable accommodation nearby.        
	Gopalakrishnan drove by the plot in Action Area II of Rajarahat on his way to the airport. Had he stopped by with a checklist, he might have been disappointed. Newtowns development has come to a halt because of a power struggle between the ruling CPM and the Trinamul Congress.        
	This is about creating 15,000 to 20,000 jobs. We are not involved in any politics, Gopalakrishnan said.        
	Those involved in politics displayed caution. In a break from the past, chief minister Bhattacharjee and IT minister Debesh Das did not say a word on Infosyss plans.         
	The reasoning seems to be that if the government lets Infosys make all the announcements, any protesters could be projected as opposing industry rather than the CPM.        
	 We dont have anything against IT companies and our leader Mamata Banerjee also wants an IT hub in Bengal. But the land agitation will continue, said Partha Chatterjee, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. He asked why the state government had taken so long in identifying a plot for Infosys.        
	Trinamul cannot come in the way of Rajarhats development with their protests, said housing minister and Hidco chairman Gautam Deb.        
	Asked how long it would take to lay the necessary infrastructure, Deb passed the onus on Infosys, saying: The moment we get a letter of intent from Infosys, we will lay the infrastructure in two months.        
	Infosys had first shown interest in setting up a campus in Bengal in 2004 but backed out when Hidco asked for Rs 2.16 crore an acre. The next bid in 2008 fell through after the government scrapped the Kolkata IT Links project, where Infosys had been promised 90 acres, following the Vedic Village controversy.        
	Last month, Hidco allotted 50 acres to Infosys, at Rs 1.5 crore an acre, after its board cleared the allotment.        
	Some Trinamul leaders in Rajarhat believe that the allotment, made at a discount, has been rushed through with the aim of pushing their party on the back foot.        
	Trinamul has gained ground in the area in the past couple of years by rallying the farmers, who allege that Hidco, a state government agency, forced them to sell their plots at throwaway prices. The party backed the Rajarhat land-losers when they resisted attempts by Hidco to lay water and sewer lines and erect electric poles.

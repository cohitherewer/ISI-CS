  - Tubid back in home department        OUR BUREAU                             Suman Gupta                                        
	Ranchi, Nov. 25: A week after the custody death of Dhirendra Singh at Dhanbads Barwaddah police station, the state government today transferred district superintendent of police Suman Gupta, along with 14 other IPS officers.         
	In the first major reshuffle after Arjun Munda took over as chief minister on September 12 this year, a dozen IAS officers were also transferred or given additional charge according to notification issued by the state personnel, administrative reforms and Rajbhasha department.        
	Though Guptas transfer came as part of a major rejig in the police establishment, by shifting her, Munda took the sting out of the Opposition attack over the custody death. The SPs transfer followed the suspension of Barwaddah OC Sahdeo Prasad.         
	While speaking to The Telegraph yesterday, Munda had said he would be doing something to ensure a proper probe into the death.         
	Dhirendra Singh had been picked up by the Dhanbad sadar police for carrying Maoist literature on November 16. He was subsequently taken to the Barwaddah police station and arrested there.        
	Later in the night, he was shifted to hospital twice after he complained of stomach ache. He died in custody early next morning.        
	His death sparked off huge protests led by MLAs Arup Chatterjee of Nirsa, Phulchand Mandal of Sindri and Bokaros Samresh Singh.        
	Dhirendras father Sunder, in his complaint, had blamed Gupta and three other policemen for his sons death.        
	Guptas silence on the issue drew criticism from all quarters though she later clarified that she was going by the rule book and would not comment until the autopsy report came in, which was inconclusive and failed to establish the cause of death.        
	The SP had also said that she was being targeted by a few politicians with vested interests as they wanted her transferred out of the coal belt. She was due for a promotion next year.        
	Gupta will now take over as SP, communication and wireless services, in Ranchi. Former commandant of Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP)-I Ravikant Dhan will be the new SP of Dhanbad.         
	Meanwhile, the home department remained within the confines of one particular household as excise secretary J.B. Tubid got back his old department as principal secretary with additional charge of the cabinet committee on vigilance. Wife Rajbala Verma, currently home secretary, was shifted to the food and civil supplies with additional charge as chairman-cum-managing director of Jharkhand State Food Corporation.        
	Todays notification reversed the June 16, 2010, order by which Tubid, then home secretary, was replaced by his wife.        
	Sudhir Prasad, principal secretary, planning and development, was shifted to urban development with additional charge of drinking water and sanitation. Food and civil supplies secretary B.K. Tripathy was given charge of the building construction department with additional charge of science and technology and disaster management.        
	P.K. Jojoria has been shifted to civil aviation with additional charge of housing, while Smita Chugh, who was waiting for a posting, has been made excise and prohibition secretary. Alka Tiwary is the new secretary-cum-commissioner of commercial taxes with additional charge of secretary in the chief ministers secretariat.         
	The transfers were carried out to ensure proper co-ordination between ministers and departmental secretaries. We have tried to ensure that one secretary reports to only one minister, holding charges of various departments, a source close to Munda said.         
	IAS transfers        
	 Avinash Kumar, commissioner of Kolhan sub-division, has been given additional charge of Greater Ranchi Development Authority        
	 Vinay Choubey, currently programme director of Jharkhand Education Project Council, will look after State Housing Board as its managing director        
	 Sunil Kumar has been shifted as director (civil administration), urban development department, with additional charge as agriculture director        
	 Principal secretary labour, employment and training Vishnu Kumar has been given additional charge of commissioner, Palamau sub-division        
	 Manish Ranjan, director industries, would hold additional charge of Jharkhand Industrial Development Corporation and Ranchi Regional Development Authority        
	Police transfers         
	 Bokaro IG M.K. Mishra, has also been transferred as IG of State Crime Record Bureau (SCRB) at Ranchi. Anurag Gupta, IG of CID and director, sports, will replace Mishra. Amitabh Chaudhary, special secretary in the home department, is likely to be given charge of director, sports.   
	 A. Natrajan, inspector general of SCRB has been shifted to CID in the same capacity  
	 Sudhir Kumar Jha, SP of Sahebganj has been transferred as SP in CID wing.

	 A. Vijayalakshmi, SP in communication and wireless department, would be new SP of Sahebganj.   
	 SP of Jamtara M.P. Lakra will now be SP, special branch.   
	 Pakur SP Md Nehal would be the new SP in the Jharkhand Armed Police Training Centre (JAPTC) in Padma, Hazaribagh.   
	 Patel Mayur Knaiyalal who was serving as sub-divisional police officer in Bermo has been promoted as SP of Pakur.   
	 IPS Sunil Bhaskar, who was earlier serving as sub-divisional police officer in Chatra district, would now be SP of Jamtara.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dossier sets clock ticking on Tharoor 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dossier sets clock ticking on Tharoor

	New Delhi, April 17: Shashi Tharoor is expected to relinquish office by Monday, Congress leaders suggested today, basing their assessment on the contents of some files that reached the Prime Minister today.        
	He may resign tomorrow, if not tonight, a senior leader told The Telegraph, adding that the dossier given to the Prime Minister contained damaging information.        
	Sources said a two-paragraph note by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee was delivered to the Prime Ministers Office, along with a six-page report by the Intelligence Bureau and preliminary results of other investigations, including that of the income-tax department. Mukherjee could not meet the Prime Minister, who returned from abroad this afternoon, as the finance minister had prior engagements in his home state and was scheduled to return only on Sunday night.        
	Sources said the dossier would limit the options of the Prime Minister, who handpicked Tharoor for the foreign ministry.        
	Asked about the furore triggered by the junior foreign minister, the Prime Minister said today: In politics, ups and downs keep happening.        
	Although the Prime Minister can speak to Mukherjee on the phone, some sources did not rule out the possibility of Singh asking the Congress veteran to return early on Sunday. In that case, the Congress core group will formally meet.        
	If such a meeting takes place, the Prime Minister is expected to be alerted to the possibility of a larger racket in the IPL. Protecting Tharoor under such circumstances would involve a huge political risk if a planned multi-disciplinary probe throws up dirt, the sources said.        
	Sources said the dossier prepared by the finance ministry is self-explanatory. The six-page report prepared by the Intelligence Bureau, in tandem with the Research and Analysis Wing, is said to be highly critical of Sunanda Pushkar, Tharoors friend who was given equity in the Kochi IPL consortium.        
	Tharoors dearth of friends  other than the Prime Minister  in the Congress is also adding to the perception that he is being isolated. The junior ministers own bold assertions are being viewed with concern by the leadership.         
	He is creating an impression that he was trying to change the dirty political culture of this country and that the future of India will be made by brighter people like him, an AICC office-bearer said.        
	The governments priority is the Finance Bill and it would not like to carry an additional weight around its neck to that battle.         
	The Tharoor issue is most likely going to be settled tomorrow as the government would like to go to Parliament on Monday with a clean slate. Tomorrow, the Prime Minister may meet Tharoor.

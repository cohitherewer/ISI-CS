          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 5: The Bangladesh Supreme Court has lifted a four-year-old stay, setting the stage for the final battle to restore the word secularism to the countrys Constitution and force political parties to drop Islam from their names.        
	The Supreme Court has vacated the stay on a 2005 ruling by a high court that had thrown out the fifth amendment which allowed religion-based politics to flourish in the country during the past three decades.        
	The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the main Opposition and the architect of the fifth amendment, has now moved the apex court seeking a stay on its ruling and challenging the high court verdict. The Supreme Court will hear both pleas simultaneously on January 18.        
	The original spirit of the Constitution will be restored if the implementation of the high court verdict is cleared by the appellate division of the Supreme Court, law minister Shafique Ahmed told PTI.        
	Such a ruling will also mean dozens of religion-based political parties in Bangladesh will be forced to drop Islam from their names and stop the use of faith while electioneering.         
	The fifth amendment was introduced by a BNP government in 1979 when Zia-ur Rahman, the husband of current party leader Khaleda Zia, was President.        
	The amendment had allowed religion-based political parties to come into being and added the Arabic Bismillah-Ar-Rahman-Ar-Rahim (In the name of God, the most merciful, benevolent) to the preamble of the Constitution. The amendment also abolished the word secularism from the Constitution.        
	Ahmed said the Arabic words would remain intact as the high court verdict did not say anything about them as they were part of the preamble, not of the main body.        
	Secularism would automatically be restored in the Constitution once the high court verdict is implemented, he said.        
	The fifth amendment had also legitimised the subsequent government of Zia-ur Rahman after the August 15, 1975, assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.        
	The original Constitution of 1972 embodied four fundamental principles of nationalism, socialism, democracy, and secularism.        
	The 2005 judgment was challenged in the Supreme Court by the then BNP-led coalition government with the Jamaat-e-Islami being its key partner.         
	However, with Sheikh Hasina storming back to power in December 2008 in a landslide, the current government decided not to press the appeal at the apex court which has overturned the stay now.        
	Officials in the office of the attorney-general said despite the BNPs intervention, they expected the case to be disposed of soon as the government had decided not to pursue the appeal.

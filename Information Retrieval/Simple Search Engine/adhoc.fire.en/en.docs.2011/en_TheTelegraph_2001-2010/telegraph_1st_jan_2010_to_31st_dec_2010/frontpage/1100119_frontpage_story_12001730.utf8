The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Empty, but a room that will for ever be Jyotibabus
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Empty, but a room that will for ever be Jyotibabus
          SANJAY MANDAL                      The room at AMRI where Basu breathed his last. (Bishwarup Dutta)                          
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: The citys most famous hospital bed today stood empty in its 10ftx10ft glass enclosure for the first time in 17 days.         
	Bed number 649 at AMRI Hospitals in Salt Lake is where Jyoti Basu had fought the last battle of his life, shielded by curtains and surrounded by doctors as the world outside waited for good news.         
	Today, the advanced cardiac monitor that had captured every fluctuation in his heartbeat for more than a fortnight was switched off. In a corner of the cubicle stood the ventilation machine, inert.         
	The oxygen supply port and the suction apparatus stayed fixed to the wall behind the Fowler Bed, designed to make patients needing critical care as comfortable as they can be. A stethoscope hung from a hook just below the cardiac monitor. A food trolley, a side table with two glasses and a jug, and a couple of freshly cleaned waste baskets completed the picture.        
	To us, this room filled with medical gadgets would have been just another intensive care unit but for the fact that Jyoti Basu spent the last 16 days of his life here. We had all hoped that he would pull through, though it was not to be. He may be gone but this room will always hold a special place in my heart, critical care consultant Rajarshi Roy, a member of the medical board that had treated the late Marxist leader, told The Telegraph.        
	To the doctors, Basu  shifted from room no 827 on the eighth floor to the sixth-floor ICCU on January 2  was Sir. But for the nurses and attendants who cared for him day and night, he was an endearing Dadu (grandfather) rather than someone who ruled Bengal for 23 years.         
	Before being put on ventilation on January 6, Basu would speak to the doctors and other hospital staff in syllables. I heard him saying pete byatha (pain in the abdomen) a few times, recalled Roy.         
	Medical superintendent Debashish Sharma said Basu would also complain of respiratory distress by saying shash kashto hochchhe (I am having difficulty breathing) or point to where needles were inserted to say byatha (pain).        
	On being asked Sir, ekhon kemon lagchhe? (how do you feel now?) after being administered palliative medicines, Basu would say: Bhalo (good).        
	January 5 was the last day Basu tried communicating. I went near his bed and he gestured to me that he needed his reading glasses. He then raised his hands again to indicate that he wanted to write something, said T.S. Kukreja, the executive vice-president of AMRI.         
	But Basu did not have the strength to put pen to paper.         
	Once he was put on ventilation with tubes inserted through his mouth, Basu would respond to questions by opening his eyes, said a member of the ICCU staff.        
	We would hold our meetings by his bedside, looking at the readings on the monitors and making assessments. Some decisions had to be taken there, said a doctor.         
	Except for the first couple of days, no visitors were allowed into the glass enclosure. Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was allowed to see him only from outside the cubicle, said a doctor.        
	The freshly fumigated enclosure may soon have a new occupant, but for those who attended to the former chief minister from Day I it will always remain Jyotibabus room.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | US bank not to handle WikiLeaks payments
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                US bank not to handle WikiLeaks payments

	Charlotte (North Carolina), Dec. 18 (AP): Bank of America Corp. has joined several other financial institutions in refusing to handle payments for WikiLeaks.        
	With its announcement, the Charlotte-based bank joins a fray that has increased financial pressure on the website that released thousands of secret US diplomatic cables, but has also prompted cyber attacks on businesses that cut ties with the activist site.        
	The move comes as WikiLeaks says its preparing a release of information on banks, which could include documents it says it has on Bank of America.        
	Bank of America released a statement today saying it will no longer process any transactions that it believes are intended for the site.        
	This decision is based upon our reasonable belief that WikiLeaks may be engaged in activities that are, among other things, inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments, the bank said.        
	Reached by phone, Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri declined further comment to The Associated Press today. Other Internet companies and financial institutions- including MasterCard Inc., Visa Inc., PayPal Inc. and Amazon.com  have also cut ties with WikiLeaks, hurting the sites ability to accept donations and support publishing efforts.         
	The websites of some companies perceived as trying to stifle WikiLeaks have come under cyberattack in recent weeks by hackers who support its mission.        
	WikiLeaks has said it does not sanction the hackers work, which has caused some sites to temporarily go out of service.        
	WikiLeaks responded to Bank of Americas announcement with a Twitter message urging supporters to stop doing business with the bank.        
	We ask that all people who love freedom close out their accounts at Bank of America, WikiLeaks said in its posting today. It also called on businesses to switch funds from the bank.        
	In an interview with the cable television station CNBC yesterday, Assange said his organisation has plans to soon release information about banks, and he told Forbes magazine last month that the data would show unethical practices Assange told Computerworld magazine in 2009 that his organisation had a trove of files on Bank of America.

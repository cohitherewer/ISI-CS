          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Harmu Road in the state capital on Friday. Picture by Hardeep Singh                                   
	Ranchi, Sept. 10: The capital is being decked up, hotel suites have been booked, new name plates are being put up  all because politically turbulent Jharkhand is getting ready to welcome a new chief minister, the eighth in 10 years.        
	Having deftly worked the numbers and convinced allies that there was no better way, Arjun Munda is ready to take oath of the office at Birsa Mandap in Raj Bhavan at 11.55am tomorrow.         
	His deputies, Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto and JMM legislature party leader Hemant Soren, are likely to be sworn in immediately after. Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh, his Uttaranchal counterpart Ramesh Pokhriyal and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan are coming to Ranchi tomorrow to witness the ceremony.         
	By late tonight, the state capital, along with its major thoroughfares, will be completely decked up with posters, flags and cut-outs, said a very busy party spokesperson, Sanjay Seth.         
	About 50 rooms have been booked in top hotels for our distinguished guests. Party workers from districts have started arriving in Ranchi. There is an atmosphere of enthusiasm everywhere.        
	Munda, who had gone home to Jamshedpur last night, returned to Ranchi this afternoon to spend time at his official residence to oversee preparations. One thing he did was to ensure a huge tent was erected so that partymen who were coming in droves had a place to relax.        
	The state cabinet co-ordination department, the one responsible for taking care of nitty-gritty, is learnt to have ordered at least one new nameplate  that of Munda  which will be put up outside the first floor room of Project Building that is traditionally used by chief ministers.         
	His nameplate will replace that of Governor M..H Farook, the custodian of the state while it was under Presidents rule.        
	After the swearing in, Munda will head for the BJP headquarters on Harmu Road after which he would go to his office at the state secretariat. As is customary, the new chief minister would then hold his first cabinet meeting and also address the media to outline his governments priorities.

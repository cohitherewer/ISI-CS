          SUHEL SETH                               
	When I was growing up in Calcutta (and I refuse to call my beloved city by its new-found postal name, Kolkata) bandhs were days marked for playing cricket, for meeting school-friends without the burden of a uniform and basically having a daylong feast.        
	Often my father would tell me about the plight of day labourers, how business was suffering and how medical help would never come for those who needed it that day. But as children, we never cared.        
	When one grew up, one realised it was a political weapon, not to win a battle for something that would benefit the common man but instead a show of cowardly strength. A show of supposed solidarity between political parties which wanted to show they cared by actually hitting the poorest of the poor in the gut.        
	Bandhs have no ideology, they are a weak tool used by weak political parties for their own selfish purposes and it is not about which party engenders the most bandhs. It is about their lack of concern, their total disengagement from the aspirations of the people and their complete disbelief in the fact that in todays times cities dont shut down for political causes!        
	We are not fighting a cause as significant as freedom that we have to lock up people in their homes just so that the party which calls the bandh can brag to the world about its influence.        
	What influence do these wretched political parties talk about? How really strong are you when you use violence to stop people from working? How caring are you when you deprive the poor labourer his daily wage? How powerful are you when the infirm cannot access medical help on a bandh day?         
	Is this the face that Calcutta wants to always show? A city that paralyses itself for flimsy reasons? A city that will never be ready for serious business because those in power and those in opposition have lost the civility or the depth to fight for these issues in Assemblies?        
	Have we elected this bunch of jokers to hurl us into captivity at the drop of a hat? Is their only purpose in life to be disruptive and wilfully damage both livelihood and state assets such as buses and trains?         
	The bandh is no longer a symbol of peoples angst. It no longer represents the frustration of the governed. Instead, it is a symbol of our weakening polity and the fact that we today have pygmies, goons and hustlers pretending to be mass leaders who care for the people.               
	It is this ugly face that they rear with alarming regularity.        
	I was of the impression that the courts had passed orders against such bandhs but then of what use is that order when we see these bandhs every once a while? Why cant the very same courts exert themselves and have people who call for the bandh itself locked up in jail?        
	Or will Calcutta have to brace itself for a lifetime of such terrible disruptions, where young BPO executives will find it hard to explain to the customer in California as to why they cant process orders, thanks to a bandh?        
	Have we ever calculated the loss not just of commerce but of face when these bandhs happen? Does anyone really care? And if we do, can the people hit back? Why should I get beaten up if all I want is to go to work? Why must children be deprived of their school-day just because some silly politician doesnt understand the value of that education?        
	The answer must now lie with the people. Tolerance of bandhs should not suggest our compliance to these politicians.        
	Enjoying a game of cricket because you have nothing else to do must not signify that commerce can be sacrificed at the altar of a forced holiday and someone needs to tell these political parties that enough damage has been done to Brand Calcutta.         
	We dont need these bandhs. We need the city to be open. For business. For medical care. For school and for leading a normal life. These jokers very rarely can do us good; why are they depriving us of the good we can do for ourselves by earning a hard days wage?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | JMM cracks over cabinet 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                JMM cracks over cabinet 
  Hemant rushes to pacify seniors

	Ranchi, Jan. 10: Chief minister Shibu Sorens cabinet expansion has generated much resentment, both in the JMM and BJP camps.        
	At least three disgruntled JMM MLAs  Teklal Mahto, Champai Soren and Nalin Soren  met at Littipara legislator Simon Marandis home today to vent their anger against Guruji for daring to ignore senior leaders.         
	Teklal walked out of the swearing in ceremony yesterday after he found that he did not figure in the list of ministers to be sworn in.        
	Marandi, a two-time MP as well, had hoped for a cabinet berth because his family has represented Littipara since 1977. His wife, Shushila Hansda, represented the constituency four times.         
	This (cabinet expansion) was not a balanced act. There is no representation of Christians. Moreover, newcomers have been given importance over senior leaders. I have conveyed to the JMM leadership that the decisions were wrong, said Marandi. He also wanted to know why the JMM bastions of Singhbhum-Kolhan had not been represented in the cabinet.         
	The Littipara MLA claimed that at least two senior JMM legislators  Seraikela MLA Champai Soren and Mandu MLA Teklal Mahto (who was pro tem speaker)  also felt cheated. We are in close contact. We hope everything will go well for the government in future, said Marandi.         
	Champai left for his home in Jamshedpur today. I am here in Jamshedpur. I have no work left in Ranchi, said the leader who was tipped to be chief minister after Soren lost the Tamar bypoll.        
	Meanwhile, in a damage limitation exercise, the chief ministers son and party MLA from Dumka, Hemant Soren, rushed to Marandis house in the afternoon along with Madhupur MLA and newly sworn in minister Haji Hussain Ansari.        
	The duo then met JMM MLA from Sikaripara, Nalin Soren, who happened to be a minister in the last Shibu Soren government. However, they failed to meet Champai and Teklal.         
	Hemant and Ansari stayed at Marandis official residence in Dhurwa for over two hours this afternoon, but the 62-year-old Christian leader reportedly refused to be mollified.         
	 Ansari later admitted that they called on Marandi to resolve matters.         
	Many senior leaders deserve to be ministers but as JMM got three berths, they got distributed among the tribal, backward and minority communities. The tempers have cooled down now, claimed Ansari.         
	JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya also claimed that differences had been resolved.        
	The quota was small. They might be unhappy for some time but they have understood the compulsions, he said.         
	The BJP too was dealing with its fair share of resentment.        
	There is resentment over upper caste leaders not finding a place in the cabinet, a senior BJP leader said, requesting anonymity.         
	Upper castes constitute nearly 13 per cent of the states population. But Sorens cabinet comprises only the backward community, ST, SC and minority.         
	Of the four BJP legislators who got cabinet berths, two are tribals, one Dalit and one from the OBC (Vaishya) community.        
	Senior BJP leader and former chief minister, Arjun Munda, however, defended the partys decision.         
	Its a coalition government and there are many compulsions. The JMM too has not got representation in the ministry when it comes to Singhbhum-Kolhan region. As far as BJPs prospects in Santhal Pargana are concerned, we will focus more on strengthening the organisation. A ministerial berth does not ensure better show of party in the long run, Munda told The Telegraph.         
	BJP MLA from Nala, Satyanand Jha, said he feared that other parties would have an edge over BJP in Santhal Pargana after denial of a berth to the upper caste.

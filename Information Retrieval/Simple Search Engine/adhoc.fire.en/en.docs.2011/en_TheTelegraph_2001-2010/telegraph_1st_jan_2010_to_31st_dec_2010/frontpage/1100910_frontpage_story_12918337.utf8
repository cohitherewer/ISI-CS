	Ranchi, Sept. 9: A city businessman who refused to accede to demands of extortionists paid with his life today.        
	Unidentified assailants shot dead Vishnu Agarwal (40) and his employee Raju Verma (30) at the formers hardware shop in Sukhdeo Nagar police station area of the capital this evening.        
	The two killers walked into Shivshakti Hardware around 7pm and opened fire on the duo from a 9mm pistol before fleeing from the spot. Passers-by rushed Agarwal and Verma to RIMS where they were declared brought dead.        
	SSP Praveen Kumar said Agarwal had received extortion calls two months ago. Agarwal, however, did not bring it to the notice of the police. Had he done so, todays tragedy could have been averted. We have identified one suspect in this regard, he said.         
	President of Federation of Jharkhand Chambers of Commerce and Industries Pradeep Sharma expressed concern over the incident and said Agarwal was killed for refusing to pay extortionists active in the area. Agarwal had been worried for the last two months ever since he received the extortion calls, he said.        
	Sharma said the businessmans wife was bedridden for the last several years.

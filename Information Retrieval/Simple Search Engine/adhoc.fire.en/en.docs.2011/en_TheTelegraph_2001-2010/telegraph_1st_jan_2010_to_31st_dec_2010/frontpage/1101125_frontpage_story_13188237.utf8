  - Demand strong for octopus replicas           POULOMI BANERJEE                            The golden Paul and (below) a model of the octopus made with LED                                                    
	Death has not dented octopus Pauls popularity. Models of the German sea creature, famous for predicting the outcome of World Cup 2010 matches, in gold and lights continue to be in demand in Bengal and beyond.         
	While the prototype of golden Paul, crafted by a city jewellery house, has attracted overseas orders, the shinning psychic that adorned Durga pujas have been hired for Raas celebrations and a private programme in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Bengal has always been soccer crazy and we wanted to pay a tribute to that. Also, Paul was the talk of the World Cup. So when we were brainstorming for new designs, our artistes came up with the idea of sculpting Paul in gold, said Nilesh Parekh, the chairman of Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, the parent company of Gaja.        
	Made of 22-carat gold, the octopus weighs 3.3kg. The challenge was to recreate the fluidity of an octopus in gold and we managed to do that, added Parekh.        
	The showpiece was the centre of attraction at a jewellery show in Mumbai. We had made other items, like a replica of Eiffel Tower but Paul was a big hit. Many jewellers from across the globe were in attendance and everyone liked Paul, said Parekh.        
	Jewellers in Dubai placed two orders for replicas of Paul in gold. A jewellery house in Kanpur also placed an order.        
	The Paul models made with LEDs by Babu Pal of Chandernagore and seen at Sreebhumi and 95 Palli during Durga Puja travelled to Uttar Pradesh for a high profile family function even though the octopus had died in October.        
	The family is known politically. One of the members had contacted me a year back for providing the lights. Apart from Paul, I provided 20 illuminated gates and 70 road pillars for the programme, said Pal.        
	Jagaddhatri puja organisers were keen on using Paul to adorn their pandals, but the artiste chose to sent his creation beyond Bengal borders because of financial reasons.         
	Not that it has affected Pauls demand in the state. Back home, the replicas in lights were a part of the Jagaddhatri puja immersion processions and have now been hired for Raas celebrations in the districts.

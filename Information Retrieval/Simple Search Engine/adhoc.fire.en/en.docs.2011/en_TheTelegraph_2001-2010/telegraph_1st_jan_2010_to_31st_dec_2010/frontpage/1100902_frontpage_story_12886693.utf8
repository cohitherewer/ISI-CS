The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Same old cover-up feeling   ICC and   Pak wait in replay of 1995
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Same old cover-up feeling 
  ICC and   Pak wait in replay of 1995          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                          
	Sept. 1: With the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan establishment content with waiting for Scotland Yard to act, one gets the impression that both may not be outraged if a case cant be made out against the players alleged to have ties with bookie Mazhar Majeed.        
	Headed by Indias Sharad Pawar, the ICC has only been stating the obvious, which effectively means nothing, without admitting that its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit has been a colossal failure. As also its move to educate players on the perils of match-fixing.        
	Numbed by yet another controversy, huge at that, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) hasnt gone into overdrive either. Incidentally, the countrys President, Asif Ali Zardari, is its patron.        
	Both the ICC and the PCB, it seems, are on the same page and perfectly happy to keep it blank. This, surely, is as scandalous as the expose itself in the UK.        
	What better can you expect? The names of the current coach and his assistant (Waqar Younis and Ijaz Ahmed, respectively) had cropped up when allegations of match-fixing flew thick and fast a decade ago, yet the PCB got them on board. They shouldnt have been part of the dressing room, insisted a well-placed source.        
	Despite the burning of effigies and an emotional call for life bans, a cover-up is feared.         
	There is, after all, a history of brushing embarrassing happenings under the carpet. One example is how the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) reacted when this reporter wrote about two bookies being evicted from the players enclosure during the 1995 Asia Cup, in Sharjah.        
	The match? India versus Pakistan. The result? India, led by Mohammed Azharuddin, thrashed by 97 runs.        
	Shockingly, the bookies had gained access to that enclosure (arrangements used to be very different then) by claiming to be close friends of a senior India player.         
	Then, while being evicted, around half an hour after the start of the match, they spoke at some length to one of the India reserves for that day.        
	Their interaction was seen first-hand by this reporter and featured in the April 8, 1995, report in The Telegraph. Five years later, it made the Central Bureau of Investigations report, too.         
	As the 1996 World Cup, co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, was just 10 months away, a senior BCCI official rushed to Sharjah and requested that the issue be closed, otherwise the ICC would shift the showpiece tournament out of the subcontinent.        
	The request was made when this reporter suggested that the BCCI initiate a full-fledged probe and that the reserve player be called for a face-to-face meeting in the presence of whoever the senior official wished.        
	What happened? That suggestion wasnt acted upon. Strangely (or, well, not so strangely), there was also no response from the ICC.         
	Please understand that if you file any more reports on the incident, the World Cup wont be with us. Weve fought hard to get it and now. The manager (Arun Narain Singh) has told us that nothing was amiss. So, let the issue rest, the senior BCCI official pleaded.        
	Five summers on, a match-fixing scandal shook the BCCI to its core. Had it seen the bigger picture, back in 1995, it wouldve acted both against the senior player and the reserve.        
	Maybe, then, Cronjegate wouldnt have happened.        
	With the 2011 World Cup five months away, some in the ICC can again actually use the tournament as a bogey to sit still and wait for public memory, which is usually short, to be overwhelmed by a non-cricket controversy.        
	One may add that Cricket Australia (then the Australian Cricket Board) had kept quiet on the telephone conversations between Shane Warne and Mark Waugh with an Indian bookie, in 1994.        
	The revelation came in 1998. Worse, Warne and Waugh had been let off with fines, even though theyd confessed to providing information to the bookie!        
	Warne and Waugh gave tips on the likely XIs, the pitch and the weather, too. The information must have helped the bookie fix odds.         
	Clearly, as cricket faces another credibility test, Australia and its players cant take the high moral ground.

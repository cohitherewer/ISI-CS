                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Girl dies after distress call 
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Samata Maloo                          
	Calcutta, Feb. 4: An 18-year-old girl who had left her Howrah home today afternoon for a tuition class next door died mysteriously two hours later in the heart of the city, apparently after calling her brother to say: I am in trouble.        
	Samata Maloos phone got disconnected after she had uttered what were to be her last words around 6.20pm, prompting elder brother Kuldip to immediately dial her number, according to a relative. A stranger answered the phone this time, saying that the girl he was looking for was unconscious on a pavement at Ganesh Chandra Avenue, not too far from Lalbazar.        
	Police arrived a few minutes later and took Samata, a Class XII student of commerce at Shree Jain Vidyalaya in Shibpur, Howrah, to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where she was declared brought dead. An officer at Bowbazar police station said there was no sign of injury or struggle except a bleeding nose and a tear in her jeans.        
	Samatas uncle Manish Maloo  father Amar owns a sari shop in Metiabruz  said the family had no idea how and why his niece travelled to central Calcutta from her home in a Shibpur residential complex, Ganges Garden, instead of going to her tuition class three blocks away.        
	 We are shocked by what has happened. She wasnt unwell, and we have no reason to suspect foul play either. We are waiting for the police to tell us something, he told The Telegraph.        
	A police officer investigating the case said Samata was lodged between two parked motorcycles when he and his team reached the spot. Her bag contained a notebook and a pen, and her cellphone was lying next to her with the number pad partially dislodged. But the phone was working.         
	Neighbours at Ganges Garden said they heard about Samata being involved in an accident around 6.30pm but didnt know she was dead until the news was flashed on television.        
	Friend Nidhi Nagri, who lives in the adjacent flat in Block BI of the complex, said Samata was not the kind who would lie to her family about going out somewhere. It is strange that Samata told Aunty (the victims mother) she would go to the commerce tuition class within our complex and ended up in central Calcutta. She was a shy, obedient girl. I cant believe my friend is dead, she sobbed.        
	Some shopkeepers and pavement-dwellers on Ganesh Chandra Avenue claimed the girl jumped to her death from a nearby building but added that none of them saw it happen.         
	Samata was the youngest of the three Maloo children.

	Kolkata, Sept 15 (PTI): The West Bengal government has filed an appeal before the Calcutta High Court against an order by the Central Administrative Tribunal setting aside the promotion of four IPS officers.
    While the state government has filed an appeal before the court challenging the CAT order, two of the officers have also filed appeals separately, government pleader Sobhanlal Hazra said here today.
    The CAT had on August 19 set aside the promotion of four IPS officers in West Bengal, including that of chief minister's security director A K Maliwal, on a petition by two officers of the same cadre.
    The officers, whose promotions were set aside are chief minister's security director A K Maliwal, special commissioner (one) of Kolkata Police R K Pachnanda, special commissioner (two) of Kolkata Police Banibrata Basu and additional director general CID Raj Kanojia.
    The promotions were granted on July 28, 2009.

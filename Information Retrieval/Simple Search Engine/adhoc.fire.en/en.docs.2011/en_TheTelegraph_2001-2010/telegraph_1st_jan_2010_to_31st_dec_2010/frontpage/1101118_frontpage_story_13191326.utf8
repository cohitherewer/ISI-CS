The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | JPC call left with Singh
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                JPC call left with Singh
  - Deadlock drags on as   both sides stay firm        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Manmohan Singh                                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: Government sources today said an early end to the deadlock in Parliament hinged on whether Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi wanted to see the House return to normal.        
	Indications are both Houses might not function either tomorrow or on Friday, unless there is an unforeseen breakthrough.        
	The Opposition, too, played tough, with BJP veteran L.K. Advani telling reporters in Patna that the Prime Minister should immediately respond to the Supreme Courts rap yesterday on his silence and alleged inaction against former telecom minister A. Raja.        
	The sources said the Prime Minister was expected to take the final call on whether the government should give in to the Oppositions demand for a joint parliamentary committee to probe the Commonwealth Games, Adarsh and spectrum controversies.        
	Although they insisted the government wouldnt be the first to blink, the sources said it all depended on Singh and Congress chief Sonia whether they wanted to play hardball to avoid giving the impression of having caved in to the Opposition.        
	If there was no resolution, the weekend break might be used to call a fresh round of meetings between the government and the Opposition.        
	The sources said the government was keen to pass the supplementary demand for grants on the general budget, and, except that, there was no legislative business of immediate urgency.        
	In the absence of a forward movement today, Pranab Mukherjee, the leader of the Lok Sabha, did not get back to Opposition leader Sushma Swaraj. It meant todays Id holiday  the break could have been used for back-channel negotiations and internal meetings  was treated as one by the governments strategists.        
	Mukherjee left this evening for Chennai from where he would travel to Madurai to attend the wedding of Union minister M.K. Alagiris son tomorrow morning.         
	The finance minister, the Centres representative at the DMK function, is expected to meet the Prime Minister shortly after he returns and then contact Sushma before Parliament meets at 11am.         
	For the Opposition, yesterdays court observations on the Prime Minister have acted as a fuel.         
	But the BJP is also under pressure following allegations that one of its own, Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, freed government land to favour his kin, including his two sons, a son-in-law and daughters-in-law.        
	Former BJP Union minister Arun Shouries comment to a newspaper that the Supreme Court should monitor the spectrum probe and a JPC was not the right demand at all has also given ammunition to the Congress, which seized on the remark from an eminent journalist.        
	Congress sources said the Prime Minister would stand his ground.         
	While the solicitor-generals reply (to the court) tomorrow would reflect the governments mind, we have reasons to believe the Prime Minister would stand his ground and not get cowed down by external circumstances, a Congress source said.         
	Whatever will have to be said will be said in the court on behalf of the Prime Minister, party spokesperson Manish Tewari said.        
	It is learnt that although the Prime Minister was initially perplexed by the courts remarks, his mood lifted once he was advised by well-wishers to use adversity as an opportunity and convey the right political message to the nation.        
	The Prime Minister may be clean but he is not a cleaner who can wield the broom arbitrarily. You cannot expect him to do anything beyond what he has done  (Ashok) Chavan resigned and Raja quit once the Prime Minister told M. Karunanidhi there was no other option, a Congress minister said.

	Burdwan (WB), Oct 27 (PTI): Violence today gripped Burdwan town again after yesterday's clashes between activists of the Trinamool Congress and CPI-M, even as Rapid Action Force personnel staged flag marches at sensitive places.
    Hoodlums exploded at least ten bombs in areas adjacent to the Bardhaman railway station where a Trinamool party office was ransacked yesterday, police said.
    Passengers who deboarded from trains were not allowed by police to leave the station, lest they become targets of any attack. Shops were also not allowed to open shutters there.
    RAF and Specially Trained Armed Company personnel are patrolling the area.
    A Trinamool Congress party office at Lakshmipur in front of the CPI-M district office was ransacked by a mob.
    CPI-M district secretary Amal Haldar alleged that Trinamool Congress was wilfully staging violent acts in the town on an issue best left to the Burdwan University authorities to sort out.

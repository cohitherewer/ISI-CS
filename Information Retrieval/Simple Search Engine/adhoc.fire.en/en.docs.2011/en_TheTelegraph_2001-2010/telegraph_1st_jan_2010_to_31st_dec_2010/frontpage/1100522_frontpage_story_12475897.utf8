                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cornered BJP to wait till May 25

	Ranchi/Bokaro, May 21: The state BJP put up a brave front today after yesterdays stunning volte-face by Shibu Soren, but indications are that it is likely to wait till May 25 before taking a call on whether to continue supporting the JMM-led government.         
	A senior BJP leader, who did not want to be named, said the party did not want to precipitate a crisis days before D-Day, referring to the May 25 date that had been agreed upon by the Sorens to transfer power to the BJP for the first 28 months of the governments remaining tenure.         
	We have been given to understand from the JMM headquarters that everything will go ahead as per the terms worked out at the May 18 meeting at the chief ministers residence, he said.         
	Today, Soren added to the intrigue by claiming that no one was a permanent friend or foe in politics and that the crisis would be resolved in the next 24 hours.         
	But, more significantly, only seven of 18 JMM MLAs attended the partys official function in Bokaro to commemorate Durga Sorens first death anniversary, indicating there was a deep divide among partymen on the issue of supporting a BJP-led government.         
	Apart from Soren family members  Hemant and Durgas widow Sita  the MLAs who were present in Bokaro were Hemlal Murmu, Shashank Shekhar Bhokta, Jagannath Mahto and Haji Hussain Ansari.         
	Of the remaining MLAs, Teklal Mahto and Lobin Hembrom were camping in Delhi and claimed that the likes of Champai Soren and others would be joining them soon to chalk out their future course of action.         
	The MLAs want Arjun Munda, the BJPs chief minister in waiting, to talk to them directly instead of negotiating through Hemant. Simon Marandi, one of the vocal opponents of allowing the BJP to take over the government, gave the game away when he said the BJP was negotiating with the wrong man.         
	The BJP is avoiding the leader with 10-11 MLAs (himself) and dealing with a leader (Hemant) who only has the support of 5-6 MLAs, he told The Telegraph.         
	Munda tried to be as positive as he could amid the uncertainty that was thrust upon him once again by Sorens statement yesterday.         
	He said the forum which had worked out and agreed upon the formula for the transfer of power on May 18 would sit together again to review the developments before May 25.         
	I was not alone at the May 18 meet. Others who were present included the BJPs Raghubar Das, Jharkhand in-charge Karuna Shukla, Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto and Shibu Soren along with JMM MLAs Hemant, Teklal Mahto and Hemlal Murmu, he pointed out.

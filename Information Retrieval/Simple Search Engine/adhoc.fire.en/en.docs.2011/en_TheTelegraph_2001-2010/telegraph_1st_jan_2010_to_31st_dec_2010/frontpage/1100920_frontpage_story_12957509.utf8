          A STAFF REPORTER                            Tarun Gogoi (top) and Ratan Tata                                 
	Guwahati, Sept. 19: Dispur has decided to set up a children welfare trust to adopt a holistic and comprehensive policy for physical and mental wellbeing of every child living in Assam.         
	 The trust will be headed by chief minister Tarun Gogoi and include personalities like industrialist Ratan Tata as its member.         
	The government will formally float the trust on November 14 on the occasion of Childrens Day.        
	Health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told reporters here today that though the state government had been launching various child welfare schemes like free surgery for those with congenital heart ailments and Operation Smile for children with cleft palates, more required to be done for the children to keep them away from physical and mental ailments.         
	For the government it is also not possible to address each and every problem of children. The basic objective of setting up the trust is to adopt a comprehensive policy for their welfare. For example, many children affected by insurgency and ethnic conflicts are currently facing mental and psychological problems. A good number of children had to abandon their studies and are frustrated after their parents or breadearners of the families die in terrorist activities. The trust will take various steps for psychological intervention offering counselling and drawing up rehabilitation schemes like offering jobs, Sarma said.         
	He said the issue was discussed in details with Gogoi who had given a go ahead to the project.         
	Sarma said the government was launching another scheme to distribute free sanitary napkins among nine lakh girls of below poverty line (BPL) families.         
	 It has been found that a majority of these girls skip their schools when they pass through periods. Distribution of sanitary napkins would help them attend classes without facing hindrance, Sarma said.         
	 He said the government was also setting up special child stabilisation units at 450 hospitals across the state to provide dedicated healthcare service to sick children.         
	Admitting that there is an alarming rise in the number of children using tobacco, Sarma, however, expressed helplessness of his department to eradicate the menace. He said in India anti-tobacco law is not very strong and thus the health department alone cannot stop tobacco abuse among children.        
	 But definitely the health department will take initiatives to create awareness about the ill effects of tobacco use among children, he said.         
	 Samsher Ali, a teacher of a lower primary school, welcomed the government initiative and said it would go a long way to mould a bright future for the future generation.         
	Children are in the highly vulnerable group and affected first whatever happens in our society. The trust will have to work sincerely to really bring positive changes among the affected children, he said.

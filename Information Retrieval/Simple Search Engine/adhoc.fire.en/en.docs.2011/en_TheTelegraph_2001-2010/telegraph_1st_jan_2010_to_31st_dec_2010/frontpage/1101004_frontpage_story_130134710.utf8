	Washington, Oct 4 (PTI): Pakistan-based militants plotting to carry out Mumbai-style killings in European cities had on their sight landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, as well as Berlin's Central Station, a media report said today.
    The names of the high-profile targets were revealed as the US issued a travel advisory asking its citizens to guard against potential terror threats while in Europe.
    The terror targets included tourist hotspots like France's global icon the Eiffel Tower, one of the world's most visited monument which millions of people ascend every year and the Notre Dame cathedral, one of France's most famous architectures.
    Also on the list were landmarks in Berlin including the high-profile Hotel Adlon, near Berlin's famed Brandenburg Gate, Germany's most famous symbol.

          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                            Kapil Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: A scheme the human resource ministry has proposed to help states set up universities and colleges has been downsized by the finance ministry.        
	The expenditure finance committee (EFC) has approved a centrally sponsored scheme for incentivising state governments to set up educational institutions or expand existing institutions in higher and technical education but suggested that it be launched in a smaller way.        
	Against the HRD ministry proposal to set up 36 universities in the 11th plan period, the EFC has given the go-ahead to launch the scheme on a pilot basis by setting up eight universities. A bigger launch, drawing on experiences gained from the pilot projects, could be put off till the 12th plan period, sources said.        
	Of the eight universities to be set up now, two could come up in special category states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand or the north-eastern states, the committee said. The institutions will come up in states where varsities are burdened with several affiliated colleges.        
	The Centre has allocated about Rs 360 crore for the project. In a one-time assistance, it will give Rs 40 crore each to non-special category states and Rs 60 crore each to special category states. The states will have to meet additional expenses for setting up these institutions.        
	There are about 300 universities in the country at present, including 39 under the central government. One of the aims of the incentivisation scheme is to raise the enrolment rate in higher education by setting up institutions in backward and inaccessible areas.        
	Although nothing has been decided yet, sources said the Centre was likely to encourage Madhya Pradesh, Chhattishgarh and Uttarakhand to take the lead in launching the project. Subsequently, colleges affiliated to three central universities in these states  H.S. Gaur University in Sagar, Guru Ghasidas University in Bilaspur and H N Bahuguna University in Uttarakhand  would be brought under the new institutions.        
	The EFC has also given the go-ahead to set up 85 general colleges and 10 engineering institutes in districts where the enrolment rate is less than 15 per cent. The target is to take the enrolment rate from 12 per cent now to 15 per cent by 2012.        
	Each of the general colleges will be set up at a cost of Rs 8 crore, of which central assistance will be Rs 2.67 crore. But in special category states, the amount will be Rs 4 crore.        
	Likewise, central aid for each of the engineering colleges will be Rs 11.5 crore in special category states and Rs 7.67 crore in others.

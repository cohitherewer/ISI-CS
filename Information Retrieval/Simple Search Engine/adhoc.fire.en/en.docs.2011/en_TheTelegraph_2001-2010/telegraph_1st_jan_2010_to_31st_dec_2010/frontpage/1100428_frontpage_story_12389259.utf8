          OUR BUREAU                      Shilpa Shetty                          
	April 27: The lady who showed a lot of spunk to win a British reality show has taken over the IPL fight.         
	Actress Shilpa Shetty appeared in a combative mood as she battled the Indian cricket board for casting aspersions on the ownership of Rajasthan Royals, in which her husbands family has a stake.         
	The Royals today made public its shareholdings, which confirmed that Suresh Chellaram, a relative of suspended IPL boss Lalit Modi did indeed holds the majority stake.        
	Modi today steered clear of the controversy but again sent out the signal that he considered himself to be very much still at the helm.        
	Did you know ipl has made it to the no 1 spot in sports genre on youtube in the world. Overtaken nfl and cbs sports too. Thanks to the fans, Modi wrote on Twitter to highlight that his brainchild brand was at the top of all domestic sports leagues.         
	The NFL (earlier American Football League) is considered the best attended domestic sports league in the world. CBS Sports is a division of Columbia Broadcasting System, which airs sporting events on the American television network.        
	But if Modi was silent on the controversy, Shilpa, one of his most ardent supporters, took the baton to hit out at the Indian cricket board for erroneous comments about her teams ownership structure.        
	No room 4 erronious (sic) commnts 2b made,Custodians of Cricket must not hamper d Brandvalue of this viable sport.RR Support al Bcci nd govt probe, Shilpa wrote on her Twitter page.         
	Shilpa, whose husband Raj Kundra and his family owns a little over 11 per cent stake in the Jaipur franchise, had yesterday tweeted that she was a brand ambassador of the team.        
	Cant answer every1 queries(som very wierd)4 the las time.Yes we r stake owners in RR,I am ALSO the brand ambassador.cant get into details, she tweeted today.        
	Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Shashank Manohar had yesterday cast aspersions on the ownership of the Royals, saying the names of Shilpa and her husband did not figure in the documents relating to the franchise.         
	Shilpa today obliquely criticised Manohar for raising such questions about the team.         
	Statemnt on behalf of RR out!If ther r issues or qtns by BCCI,can be adressd directly to RR,Y does it hav to b done via the media!? she wrote on Twitter.        
	The statement she was referring to was the ownership details released by the Rajasthan Royals today.         
	The team confirmed what detractors of Modi had been highlighting so far: the majority stake of 44.2 per cent is held by his brother-in-law, the Nigeria-based Chellaram.         
	The Royals stated their bid consortium was led by the UK-based Emerging Media (IPL) Ltd. and denied Manohars allegation that the bidders identities were not known.        
	 The other entities in the consortium were disclosed in the bid submission documents, said a statement issued by the Jaipur franchise. The current shareholders of EM Sporting Holdings Limited, who all have multiple business interests and independent means, are as follows: Emerging Media (IPL) Ltd (Manoj Badale - 32.4 per cent), Tresco International Ltd (Suresh Chellaram family - 44.2 per cent), Blue Water Estate Ltd (Lachlan Murdoch - 11.7 per cent) and Kuki Investments Ltd (Raj Kundra amp; family - 11.7 per cent). There are no other shareholders, the statement added.

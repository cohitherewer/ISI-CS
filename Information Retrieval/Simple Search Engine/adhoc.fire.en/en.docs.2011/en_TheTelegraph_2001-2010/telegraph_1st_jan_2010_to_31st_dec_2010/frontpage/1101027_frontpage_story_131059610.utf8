	Padang (Indonesia), Oct 27 (AP): Planes and helicopters delivering rescuers, medicine and other supplies landed for the first time today on remote Indonesian islands that were pounded by a 3-meter tsunami, sweeping away villages and killing at least 154 people.
    For days, rough seas and bad weather have hampered relief operations, leaving residents to fend for themselves. With not enough people to dig graves, corpses littered beaches and roads, according to district chief, Edison Salelo Baja.
    Fisherman were scouring waters in search of survivors.
    The fault line that ruptured Monday on Sumatra island's coast also caused the 2004 quake and monster Indian Ocean tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.
    Disaster officials were still trying to reach more than a dozen villages on the hardest hit Mentawai islands, a popular surfer's destination that is usually reachable only by a 12-hour boat ride.

	Bangalore, Oct. 29 (PTI): A Karnataka High Court judge asked to resolve a division bench deadlock on the disqualification of 11 rebel BJP MLAs today upheld the Speakers action, giving the partys first government in the south the numbers to rule.        
	The Speakers order is in consonance with the provisions of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution (which contains the anti-defection law), Justice V.G. Sabhahit said.         
	Todays order may obviate the need for a fresh vote of confidence that may arise if the Supreme Court reverses the verdict on appeal. The lawyers for the BJP rebels have said that they would move the apex court.        
	Amit Shah bail        
	Amit Shah, the former minister of state for home, was today granted bail by Gujarat High Court in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case three months after his arrest.

	United Nations, Oct 11 (PTI): India is all set to get a seat on the Security Council as a non-permanent member after a gap of 19 years through the elections to be held tomorrow in the United Nations General Assembly.
    India is expecting an easy win since Kazakhstan pulled out from the race earlier this year and there is no other challenger from the region.
    While the Asian, African and Latin American seats are going uncontested with only one candidate each, the two seats for Western Europe and others Group are being fought for by Canada, Germany and Portugal.
    South Africa is a shoo-in for the African seat, which leads to a configuration of three emerging economies ? India, Brazil and South Africa - being on the Council at the same time.

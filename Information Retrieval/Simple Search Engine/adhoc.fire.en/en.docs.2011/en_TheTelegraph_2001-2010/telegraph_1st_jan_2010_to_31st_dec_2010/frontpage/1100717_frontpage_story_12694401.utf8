The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | On hearing eve, judge denies graft
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                On hearing eve, judge denies graft
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                            Soumitra Sen                                  
	New Delhi, July 16: Justice Soumitra Sen has dismissed the charges of misappropriation against him as he prepares to appear tomorrow before a Parliament-appointed committee that is probing charges of misconduct which, if proved, could lead to his impeachment.        
	The committee has framed charges against him on two counts: misrepresentation of facts to Calcutta High Court and misappropriation of Rs 58 lakh. Justice Sen has already filed his written reply, denying he had used court money for personal gain.        
	Justice Sen is accused of keeping in his personal account a sum of Rs 33 lakh, which he had received as a receiver in a case when he was a lawyer, and using it for personal gain. He returned the money only after the high court asked him to.        
	In his written reply, the judge has said he had repaid the entire amount of Rs 33 lakh with an interest of Rs 25 lakh within the time fixed by the high court. He has added that the high court had exonerated him and expunged the remarks made by a single judge against him.        
	Once he had been exonerated by a judicial order, an executive authority like the committee could not re-exa- mine the issue again, he has said.        
	The committee had sought a reply from Justice Sen by May 5, 2010, after it arrived at the prima facie conclusion that a case had been made out against him. The judge has since then been stripped of his judicial duties and been asked to confine himself to administrative duties.        
	Tomorrow, Justice Sen will get an opportunity to personally appear before the committee of Justice B. Sudarshan Reddy of the Supreme Court, Justice Mukul Mudgal of Punjab and Haryana High Court, and senior counsel Fali S. Nariman. Justice Sen will be coming to Delhi to defend himself on July 17 and 18, sources confirmed.        
	On the eve of the grilling, his defence seemed upbeat. No case of misappropriation is made out. Once a division bench of the court to which I am accountable has exonerated me (Calcutta High Court in this case), wheres the question of anyone proceeding against me? a senior lawyer closely associated with his defence said.        
	This is nothing but a witch-hunt, the lawyer said on condition of anonymity.        
	The Chief Justice of India (CJI) had written to the Prime Minister recommending Justice Sens removal through impeachment by Parliament.        
	An impeachment motion was later introduced in the Rajya Sabha by 58-odd MPs. Vice-President Hamid Ansari, who is the Rajya Sabha Chairman, then formed a committee to probe the charges.        
	Once the committee concludes its hearing and arrives at a finding, it will submit its report to the Vice-President. If the committee holds Justice Sen guilty, it will recommend his removal. The impeachment motion will then require to be adopted by a double majority in each House.        
	If both Houses adopt the motion, the judge will stand removed from his office.        
	Under his statutory powers, the CJI can only withdraw judicial work or transfer an errant judge.

	Kolkata, Sep 7 (PTI): Parts of North 24-Parganas district were today brought under curfew and the army was requisitioned to assist paramilitary forces in restoring peace after several places of worship were desecrated following clashes between two groups.
    North 24-Parganas District Magistrate Vinod Kumar said curfew has been imposed in Deganga area in the wake of violence that left a deputy superintendent of police and a civilian injured. The DSP was injured in brickbatting, while the civilian received bullet injury.
    "The Army has been requisitioned for enforcing peace at Deganga. Around 200 personnel have been sent to the area to stage a flag march to instill confidence in the people," a Defence official said.

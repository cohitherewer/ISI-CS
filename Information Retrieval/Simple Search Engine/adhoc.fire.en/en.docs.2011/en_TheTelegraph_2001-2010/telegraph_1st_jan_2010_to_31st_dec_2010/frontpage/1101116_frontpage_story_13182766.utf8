                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                A decade lost     -  Munda admits Jharkhands ills, lists priorities for better future
          AMIT GUPTA AMP; SANTOSH K. KIRO                                                     
	Ranchi, Nov. 15: Jharkhand has fared poorly in the last 10 years. Hence, the need of the hour is to set fresh, time-bound priorities.        
	If that diagnosis and prescription was the centrepiece of chief minister Arjun Mundas 10-minute speech today as chief guest at the states primary event to mark its 10th Foundation Day at Morabadi ground, what revealed more about Jharkhand was the declaration that over 11.44 lakh poor families had been added to the states BPL list while launching a scheme to provide them with rice at subsidised rates.        
	Chief secretary A.K. Singh admitted it wasnt a good sign. His follow up action: need for introspection.         
	The state has not developed as it was expected to and it lags behind in developmental goals. But the solution is not criticism, but setting time-bound goals in different sectors, declared Munda during his speech at the event which Opposition MLAs chose to ignore.         
	On his part, the chief minister listed out priorities, most of which he has spoken of on earlier occasions. Among his long-term plans were a skill development mission, ensuring electrification of all 32,615 villages in the next four years and turning Jharkhand into a power surplus state (see chart).        
	The state will set up a skill development mission which will be responsible for imparting skills in any vocation to youths right from the level of high school, he added.         
	The immediate focus, he said, would be on tiding over the effects of drought by concentrating resources on pending irrigation projects and launching watershed and check dam projects in rural areas.         
	Later, Munda and chief of state co-ordination committee Shibu Soren handed over 20kg rice to four newly included BPL beneficiaries who were brought to the venue  their transportation costs were borne by the state  from Angara block.         
	Soren, whose name was included among the dignitaries at the last minute as guest of honour, spoke before Munda. It is not an occasion to talk much. We need to reciprocate efforts showcased here in our homes and villages, the septuagenarian former chief minister said in a speech that lasted barely two minutes.        
	Todays celebration, purposefully low-key, was scheduled to begin at noon. But it started over half-an-hour late even though the presence of Munda, his entire cabinet and a host of senior officials gave it the importance it deserved.        
	Later, Munda and Soren distributed appointment letters to new ITI instructors who will come under labour, training and employment departments. Outstanding village eco-development committees, watershed management committees, milk producers, and a few government employees were also honoured with mementos and cash.        
	Renowned trade unionist and leader of the Opposition Rajendra Prasad Singh (Congress) was absent and so was Pradeep Yadav, JVMs legislative party leader.        
	It was a government function to mark so-called achievements. We celebrated the day as Birsa Jayanti paying floral tributes to the tribal icon at various places. It cannot be termed a boycott but a mere absence, said Yadav.         
	Wrapping up the show were children from various schools of the state capital, who performed at a cultural function and ensured that the moderate crowd of about 3,000 remained glued to their seats till 4pm.

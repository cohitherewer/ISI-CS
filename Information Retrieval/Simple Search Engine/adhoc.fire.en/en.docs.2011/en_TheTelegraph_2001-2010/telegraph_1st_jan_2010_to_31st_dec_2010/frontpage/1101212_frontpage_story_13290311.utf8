  - Obama fields Clinton at White House news meet, goes off to party          K.P. NAYAR                            Obama leaves the floor to Clinton at the White House on Friday. (Reuters)                                        
	Washington, Dec. 11: For 22 minutes and nine seconds last evening, America had a new President... er... an old President... actually, an older President to be exact.        
	Bill Clinton, the 42nd US President, took over the White House podium yesterday and held a presidential news conference even as the incumbent chief executive, Barack Obama, gladly yielded the familiar floor and went off to a Christmas party.        
	Like nothing before in Obamas troubled 23-month tenure, his decision to bring Clinton to the White House and field him before reporters covering the presidency highlighted the plight of an administration that is under siege from resurgent Republicans and querulous Democrats, and a country that is hurtling downhill in all respects.        
	Ex-Presidents in the US, by convention, do not return to their former residence except for ceremonial occasions. Also, they largely refrain from commenting on the policies of their successors, irrespective of which party they belong to.        
	Even when his son became President, George Herbert Walker Bush, Clintons predecessor, mostly avoided the White House and declined to speak in defence or otherwise of the 43rd President almost until it was time for the son to demit office after two four-year terms.        
	Obamas decision to bring Clinton back to the White House and put him under the strobe light followed four legislative defeats in two days for Democrats even though they control the Senate.                          
	A bill which would have authorised social security payments to poorer Americans, another giving trade union rights to policemen and firefighters, an immigration legislation and a fourth bill on medical relief to needy responders to the September 11 attacks, all key to Obamas re-election in 2012, fell short of enough votes for their passage in the Senate on Wednesday and Thursday.        
	Obama is worried that a compromise he has worked out with Republicans to extend his predecessors tax cuts for the rich in return for continuing unemployment benefits beyond December 31 may fall through because Obama is unable to convince his own party that he has not given away too much to the Opposition.        
	If that compromise is defeated in the US Congress, Obama not only stands to lose face, but also his standing as a viable President. Yesterday, Clinton defended the compromise just as he successfully defended similar compromises for eight years as President.        
	Obama is a gifted communicator, but Clinton is still Democrats best synthesiser of policy and political strategy, still the explainer in chief, The Washington Post wrote about the former Presidents unusual act.         
	On Friday he played it with customary gusto, to his and, Obama hopes, the Presidents benefit.        
	The unexpected arrival of Obama with Clinton in tow in their briefing room was a surprise for the White House press corps  or what remained of them on the premises on a quiet Friday evening when Washington has already slipped into the Christmas mood.        
	In fact, the President and the ex-President found the door to the briefing room locked with a few reporters taking a nap inside.         
	Clinton agreed to Obamas request to defend his compromise from the White House podium on the spur of the moment after the two men had a discussion on the subject and Clinton was being escorted out by the President.        
	Even Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, was unaware of the move and was not in the briefing room. Barred by the locked door, Obama and Clinton traced Gibbss secretary and got her to open the briefing room. The press office then made an announcement over the White House public address system, asking the press corps to assemble in the briefing room on urgent business.        
	Obama briefly introduced Clinton and then waited around for 11 minutes as the former President warmed to the subject of tax compromise. Then Obama excused himself saying that he had kept Michelle Obama waiting for half an hour at the annual holiday party for the West Wings staff.        
	Clinton let Obama off the hook, saying: I dont want to make her mad, please go.        
	For forms sake, Clinton said: Thank you very much, Mr President. First of all, I feel awkward being here, and now you are going to leave me all by myself. But his body language indicated otherwise. Clinton was rubbing his hands in glee as he entered the briefing room.        
	But he made out a very convincing case for Obama. One reporter asked Clinton: I get the feeling that you are happier to be here commenting and giving advice than governing.        
	Clinton replied: Oh, I had quite a good time governing.... I am happy to be here, I suppose, when the bullets that are fired are unlikely to hit me, unless they are just ricocheting.        
	For the next 22 minutes and 9 seconds, it was as if Obama had transferred power to Clinton and the better times were back in the White House.

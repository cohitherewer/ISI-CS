  - Singhbhum encounter leads to den with computer, generator set, dry fish           Our Bureau                      The body of Cobra jawan Himmat Singh, who died of his Bandhgaon encounter injuries, being taken to Ranchi airport. (Hardeep Singh)                                       
	Ranchi, June 14: Anti-Maoist operations have begun in right earnest within a fortnight of the imposition of Presidents rule in Jharkhand, with security forces today claiming unprecedented success in a 20-hour-long weekend encounter in the jungles of Sonua-Bandhgaon in West Singhbhum, 120km from Jamshedpur.        
	CRPF DIG Alok Raj would not reveal the number of Maoists killed in the hilltop gun battle, but unconfirmed reports trickling into the neighbouring district of East Singhbhum said at least 10 rebels were killed.        
	Most important, the CRPF managed to bust a thriving rebel hideout with a computer and generator that was being frequented by cadre from Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.         
	The CRPFs Cobra battalion lost one jawan  he succumbed to injuries in a Ranchi hospital today  and five others were injured. But the morale of the forces was high, having tasted success after a prolonged lull in operations for five months since January when the Shibu Soren-led JMM-BJP-Ajsu government took over.         
	CRPF special DG and commander of anti-Naxalite operations Vijay Raman and Cobra IG Ashutosh Shukla are camping in Jharkhand, indications that the top brass of the security apparatus was working towards a plan.         
	Raman visited ground zero yesterday, while IG (operations) D.K. Pandey was camping in Bandhgaon where the operations were still on.         
	The operations will be certainly intensified. It is an opportunity for us to flush out rebels who are apparently using the nearby railway and road links to their advantage and at the same time finding themselves strategically nestled in the hilly jungles of the Sonua-Bandhgaon region, asserted Pandey.        
	The well-planned operation by the Cobra forces, initially stretching over 20 hours (from the morning of June 12), led the police to a training camp from where they seized, among other material, dry fish, rice and jaggery, indicating that rebel leaders had been camping there till recently.        
	The CRPF also found a computer table, a generator and three motorbikes. As many as 21 claymore mines were found and defused.         
	We dont have dead bodies of the Naxalites and arms to show (now). But certainly it is a tangible success on the part of the police and CRPF, Raj told The Telegraph.         
	The encounter was severe. The police fired around 3,000 rounds of ammunition while the CRPF and the Cobra men fired as many as 16 mortars, considered rare in such combing operations.         
	Armed to their teeth, Maoist cadres used the hilltop advantage to fire even more rounds of ammunition than the police. I have never witnessed such a long encounter, said Cobra commandant Rajiv Rai still camping in Bandhgaon.Our jawans showed precision with which they were able to give a befitting reply to the enemy.        
	Late tonight, the police revealed a few more success stories. PLFI sub zonal commander, Sakal Gope (35), wanted in more than 30 cases of murder, abduction, extortion and rape, was killed in a police encounter this morning at Rakamshera village in Ghagra, about 30km from Gumla district headquarters.        
	According to SP N.K. Singh, a 9mm pistol, two motorbikes and some ammunition were recovered from him.         
	The police arrested a woman Maoist from Bhandaria forest, about 200km from the state capital in Garhwa district this afternoon. Identified as Sunaina Devi, the wife of Maoist zonal commander Vinay Singh, alias Nepali, she was wanted in Chhattisgarh (six cases) as well Jharkhand (five cases), said Garhwa SP Richard Lakra.

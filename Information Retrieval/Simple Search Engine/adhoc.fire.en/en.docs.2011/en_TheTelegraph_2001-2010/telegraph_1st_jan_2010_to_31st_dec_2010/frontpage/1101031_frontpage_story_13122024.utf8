The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chavan offers, Sonia defers
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Chavan offers, Sonia defers
  - Maharashtra chief minister ready to quit but told to wait          SANJAY K. JHA                          Sonia Gandhi, Ashok Chavan                                       
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan met Sonia Gandhi today and offered to resign over the Colaba high-rise controversy but was told to wait for now.        
	Sonia has asked party seniors Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony to study the entire controversy and assess Chavans explanations before a decision is taken.        
	After meeting Sonia in the morning, Chavan said: I have offered to resign and it is for the party to decide now.        
	Any chief minister who wishes to quit has to send his resignation to the states governor, which Chavan hasnt done so far.        
	Chavan, summoned to Delhi last night, was still in the national capital this evening, unsure of his fate and definitely not very hopeful, sources said.        
	Although the Congress leadership would like to resolve the crisis at the earliest, it is hobbled by a very complex schedule. While an All India Congress Committee meeting is slated for November 2, US President Barack Obama will be arriving in Mumbai on November 6.        
	In between, Diwali falls on November 5, and the festival is not the ideal day to sack a chief minister.         
	To top it all, Mukherjee is in Calcutta and, according to his original schedule, is to return to Delhi only on November 1.        
	Sources said the decision on Chavans fate would be taken either on November 1 or after Obamas India visit gets over.        
	If the party decides that Chavan should go, finding a successor will not be easy. Although there are many claimants  such as Vilasrao Deshmukh, Narayan Rane and Sushil Kumar Shinde  none boasts impeccable credentials.        
	Other contenders like Union minister Prithviraj Chavan may not have the political stature to be able to stand up to ally Sharad Pawar. All these factors have forced Sonia to buy time till Mukherjee and Antony can come up with a solution.        
	Some in the party still believe that the complexity of the situation may translate into a lifeline for Chavan. But the majority view is that the chief minister was summoned to Delhi only because Antony and other senior leaders were unimpressed with his defence at yesterdays news conference in Mumbai.                                    Vilasrao Deshmukh      
	Five of Chavans relatives have been allotted flats in the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society, built on prime Mumbai land that reportedly belonged to the defence department. The building is said to have been originally meant for Kargil widows but the flats have been allotted to politicians, bureaucrats and defence officials including three retired military chiefs.        
	Yesterday, Chavan said his relatives would return their flats and denied that the land belonged to the defence department or that the building was meant for Kargil widows.        
	Congress sources said Chavan would not have made his offer to resign public without sensing the high commands mood. He met Antony and Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel before meeting the party president, and understood that the climate of opinion was not favourable to him.        
	The sources said the chief minister explained his stand to Sonia, denying any wrongdoing but saying he was ready to quit if the party thought otherwise.        
	Chavan has handed Sonia a dossier detailing the involvement of various politicians at various stages of the housing societys development and naming all the flat allottees. The chief minister apparently feels that except for the flats given to his relatives, which have now been returned, it would be difficult to nail him on other counts.

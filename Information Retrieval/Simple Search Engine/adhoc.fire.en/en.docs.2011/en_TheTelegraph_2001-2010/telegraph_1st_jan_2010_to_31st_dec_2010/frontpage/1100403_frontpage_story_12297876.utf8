	Ranchi, April 2: Ashok Kumar Singh was named chief secretary today after chief minister Shibu Soren transferred Shiv Basant as director-general of the Sri Krishna Institute for Public Administration (SKIPA).        
	Singh, who was DG of SKIPA, is a 1977-batch IAS officer, while Basant, who was appointed chief secretary on September last year when the state was under Presidents rule, is a batch senior.        
	The new chief secretary said panchayat polls were a priority while he would also ensure that development reached the far-flung areas of the state.        
	I have always stood for decentralisation of power and as the panchayati raj system ensures the same, I will push through rural polls in Jharkhand  necessary to ensure that rural people take part in the process of development, Singh told The Telegraph.         
	The senior IAS officer, known for his no-nonsense approach to solving problems, described Naxalism as a serious problem which needed to be tackled through a multi-pronged strategies including the anti-Naxalite operations, accompanied by real development across Jharkhand.                           
	Naxalism is not a mere law and order problem. It requires a multi-pronged approach with focus on village-level development. I will ensure that every officer of mine plays his role in the process of development, Singh said.        
	He added that ensuring proper implementation of the historic Right to Education Act will be another priority his administration will focus on. No one will be allowed to act as a barrier in the success of this act in Jharkhand, he promised.

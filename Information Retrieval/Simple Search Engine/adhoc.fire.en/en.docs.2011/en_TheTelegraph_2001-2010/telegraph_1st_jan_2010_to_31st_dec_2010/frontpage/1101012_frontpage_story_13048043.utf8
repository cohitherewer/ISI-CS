	Ranchi, Oct. 11: The state secretariat was abuzz with activity after a lull of over four months with most new ministers joining work today, while four of them, including a deputy chief minister and a disgruntled JMM leader, stayed away.         
	Deputy chief minister Hemant Soren and revenue and land reforms minister Mathura Prasad Mahto started work from Day One, but first-timers like BJPs Vimala Pradhan and JMMs Champai Soren spent the day acquainting themselves with the nature of work.         
	Deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto is away to offer puja at Vaishno Devi and is expected back in the state capital on Wednesday. Gopal Krishna Patar, alias Raja Peter, the surprise entry into the cabinet, is in Patna, apparently to meet his JD(U) bosses, including Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.         
	Agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries minister Satyanand Jha Batul is expected to join office tomorrow, having spent the day at Speaker C.P. Singhs residence.         
	Hemant Soren showed he had picked up a few things or two about governance from his father Shibu Soren, the former chief minister and now chairman of a state co-ordination committee, starting his first day by issuing specific orders on water supply.         
	I have instructed the engineer in chief of the drinking water and sanitation department to ensure proper water supply in most areas of the state capital during the festival. I have told him to personally monitor the snag in the pumping station, Hemant told a select group of journalists at his ground floor office in Project Building.        
	Soon after, when an aide reported that water supply had been restored, he quipped proudly, This is my style of functioning.         
	The deputy chief minister, who is also in charge of finance, met finance secretary Sukhdev Singh and his commercial taxes counterpart J.B. Tubid, among others, to get a grip on the states finances.         
	I will ensure more tax collection and try and generate more revenue. Illegal mining will be checked strictly, while my focus will also be on implementing urban development schemes, he said.         
	Pradhan, the lone woman in the cabinet, chose her time of entry to her office  between 11am and 2pm, considered auspicious on the day.                                 
	The social welfare, woman and child development and tourism minister also brought along her trusted lieutenants from Simdega constituency that she represents.         
	Meet my district party in-charges and other office-bearers who performed a pivotal role in ensuring my win during the last elections. I am committed for to the development of tourism, she said, adding, Ramrekhadham in Simdega district needs immediate attention.         
	Pradhan met tourism secretary A.P. Singh, director (tourism) and managing director of Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation (JTDC) Sidhharth Tripathy, social welfare secretary R.A.Ekka, among others.        
	It was a courtesy meeting and I have not issued any directive, she clarified.         
	Mathura met officials of his departments, revenue and land reforms and food and civil supplies, asking officials to hold a performance review on October 18, the day the secretariat reopens after a four-day Dussehra break from October 14.         
	Tribal welfare and transport minister Champai Soren, who was the first among his colleagues to reach office at 11 am, said he would prefer to get acquainted with his departments before making any statement.         
	Chief minister Arjun Munda arrived at his office at 10.30am and remained busy throughout the day.         
	JMMs Haji Hussain Ansari did not join office, spending a good part of the day with his boss, Shibu Soren, at his residence to complain about his portfolio _ co-operative and minority welfare department. The portfolios are less important and offer little scope of work, he is understood to have told him.

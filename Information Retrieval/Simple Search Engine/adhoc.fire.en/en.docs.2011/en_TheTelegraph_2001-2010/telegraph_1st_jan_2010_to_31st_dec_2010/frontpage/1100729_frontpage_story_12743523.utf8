The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tihar is home for MP Koda now
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tihar is home for MP Koda now
          OUR BUREAU                                        Madhu Koda      
	Ranchi/New Delhi, July 28: Madhu Koda will be shifted to Delhis Tihar Jail tomorrow to enable him to attend Parliament, ending speculation about the fate of Mondays vigilance court order allowing the former chief minister to take part in the monsoon session and save his Lok Sabha membership.        
	Koda has been lodged at Ranchis Birsa Munda Jail since November 30 last year after the state vigilance bureau arrested him in a disproportionate assets case running into crores.        
	Home secretary Rajbala Verma issued the directive to shift Koda to Tihar after inspector-general (prisons) Vijay Kumar Singh sought guidelines from her regarding security to be provided to him.         
	Koda, MP from Chaibasa, is likely to be shifted tomorrow under the custody of Jharkhand police.        
	On Mondays vigilance court permission to Koda to attend the monsoon session, his lawyer Nityanand Sinha clarified it was given since absence of more than 60 consecutive days from the House could attract disqualification. The former chief minister was also present in the court when the order was passed.        
	Sinha said he did not press for provisional bail as Jharkhand High Court had already rejected the former chief ministers bail petition.        
	The IG (prisons), according to a source in the administration, referred the issue to the home secretary since his powers were limited to intra-state prisoner transfers. But since Koda will be going out of the state, it is an inter-state transfer. So, the IG referred the case to the home secretary, he said.        
	Jailed MPs can attend Parliament if they have permission by a court. But, the court is expected to inform the Lok Sabha Speaker in writing.         
	Usually, jailed or convicted MPs do not attend regular House sittings. They come on specific occasions, to cast their votes or to honour party whips.         
	For instance, RJDs Mohammed Sahabuddin and Pappu Yadav, LJPs Suraj Bhan and SPs Ateeq Ahmed attended Lok Sabha in 2008 to cast their votes in favour of the Manmohan Singh government during the no-confidence motion brought on the nuclear deal.         
	There are instances, however, when MPs have misled courts to attend Parliament proceedings. Pappu Yadav came to LS regularly in 2002-03 when he was allowed treatment at AIIMS by a Bihar court. But when the court noticed this, he was asked to return to Beur jail.         
	No securitymen from outside are allowed on Parliament premises where MPs live like a free bird. So, even if Jharkhand wanted to send escorts with Koda, they cannot come to Parliament.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Two rebels killed in Gumla
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Two rebels killed in Gumla
          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 20: A four-hour-long encounter in a forest near Raghunathpur, 22km from the Gumla district headquarters in Raidih police station area, left at least two Maoists dead today even as the police in Khunti nabbed a rebel who was involved in the killing of special branch inspector Francis Indwar.         
	Director-general of police Neyaz Ahmed confirmed the encounter that began at 4pm and said the killing of the rebels could only be confirmed once the bodies were recovered from the forest, which would happen after sunrise tomorrow.        
	Ahmed expressed his inability to provide details by stating that district superintendent of police Narendra Kumar Singh was still at the spot and details would be available only after he returned.        
	Sources, however, said the encounter started when a team of security personnel was on its way to Chainpur on a regular patrol and a group of around 150 Maoist rebels opened fire on them. There were only 13 members in the patrolling party, including the driver, when the encounter started.         
	When the Maoists opened fire, it seemed the police team had little hope of survival, but they somehow managed. Officer-in-charge of Chainpur police station Amarnath Thakur had a miraculous escape as several bullets whizzed past him, said a local villager.        
	Sources said reinforcements arrived from Gumla, Raidih and Chainpur police stations and within an hour, the place was swarming with security personnel. The Maoists, however, maintained the upper hand as they had hidden themselves on a hillock, at a height of 150m from the place where the policemen had assembled.         
	In another development, two Maoists were today arrested while a PLFI member surrendered with his country-made pistol and 10 rounds of ammunition before the police at Khunti.         
	Those arrested were Sainath Munda (25) and Budhudeo Terome (28). Khunti superintendent of police Manoj Kaushik said Munda was involved in the murder of special branch inspector Francis Indwar and the killing of havildar Narendra Pandey. Terome, he said, was involved in the murder of two villagers who were shot dead a month ago at Koya village under Arki police station area.         
	He said based on tip-offs given by Munda, police recovered 62 packets of power gel, 12 boosters and three boxes belonging to ICICI Bank, which were looted along with Rs 5 crore about three years ago.         
	The one who surrendered, was identified as Pratap Singh (22), whose area of operation was Siladon to Namkum. He was wanted in three cases of murder and one case of setting a vehicle on fire last year.

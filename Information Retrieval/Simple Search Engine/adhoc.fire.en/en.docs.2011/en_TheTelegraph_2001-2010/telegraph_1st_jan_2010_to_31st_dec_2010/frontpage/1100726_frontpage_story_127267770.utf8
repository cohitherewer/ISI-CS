	New Delhi, Jul 26 (PTI) Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today rejected the BJP charge of government misusing the CBI in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case and said the Centre had not tried to influence the investigation process in any way.
    "Well, there is no truth in that (BJP charge). The opposition knows it jolly well. This Sohrabuddin case is a Supreme Court-directed investigation. The Central government has no hand in it.
    "It has not tried to influence the investigation process in any way. I repeat categorically in any way," he told reporters in Parliament House on the first day of the Monsoon Session.

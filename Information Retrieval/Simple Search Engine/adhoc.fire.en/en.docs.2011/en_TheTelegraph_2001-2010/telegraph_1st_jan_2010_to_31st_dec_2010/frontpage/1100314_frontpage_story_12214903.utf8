          G.S. MUDUR                                          
	New Delhi, March 13: Indias apex medical regulator has specified penalties for doctors who accept cash, gifts, travel or hospitality from pharmaceutical companies. But any incentive below Rs 1,000 carries no penalties and limits on frequency of accepting such offers have not been set.        
	The Medical Council of India has outlined a set of penalties of increasing severity that will depend on the quantum of incentives accepted by doctors  from mere censures to delicensing for more than a year. (See chart)        
	Incentives from drug companies to doctors have long caused concern among even sections of medical professionals in India. Anecdotal accounts suggest that incentives to influence prescriptions range from cash to foreign travel. The effective cap on incentives with no specified time bars and the lack of policing mechanisms have prompted some medical ethics watchdogs to question the sincerity of the MCI proposals.         
	The penalties announced make it appear as if the MCI is not against the principle of incentives but is against the quantum of the incentive, said Amar Jesani, a doctor at the Centre for Studies of Ethics and Rights, Mumbai. These rules make it seem like it is okay for medical professionals to have inappropriate associations with industry as long as the incentives remain below a value.        
	Jesani said the absence of a time bar could be used as a loophole by unscrupulous practitioners and drug companies. What do these rules mean  can a doctor accept incentives below Rs 1,000 every day, or every week, or every month?         
	MCI president Ketan Desai said doctors were not expected to take any incentives from pharmaceutical companies but it was difficult to impose a time bar on incentives.         
	Ive been struggling with this for the past three months, quot; Desai said. I have discussed this with my counterparts in other countries where there are similar guidelines but no other country has imposed time bars, he said.         
	Were the first country to impose such penalties for incentives, Desai added.         
	But pharmaceutical industry analysts and sections of doctors fear that the guidelines will prompt the industry and medical professionals to seek out alternative routes to continuing the practice of incentives for prescriptions.        
	Theyll find ways  drug companies may channel funds to non-government agencies or even academic institutions which will then use those funds to pay doctors for travel to conferences, said Jesani.         
	Some non-government organisations have suggested that the government make it mandatory for pharmaceutical companies to disclose in their annual financial statements the amounts spent on doctors.        
	A senior MCI official who had helped pencil the new rules had said last month that they represent a move towards self-regulation and that they would not be enforceable as a criminal or civil code.

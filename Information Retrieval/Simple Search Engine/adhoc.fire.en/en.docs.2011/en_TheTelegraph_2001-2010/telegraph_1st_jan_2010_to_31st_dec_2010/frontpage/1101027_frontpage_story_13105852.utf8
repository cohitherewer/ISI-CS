  - Naughty awaits return of teacher          UTTAM DUTTA                      Naughty, Saumajit Basu rsquo;s Dobermann. Picture by Ananda Das                                
	Chinsurah, Oct. 26: Mourn for Paul. Spare a thought for Naughty, too.        
	The oracle octopus is dead and grief is taking its toll on the Dobermann.         
	For the past two days, Naughty has been anything but naughty. The three-and-a-half-year-old has been going around the house pensive and morose, then flopping down on the floor in a circle with a barely audible moan.        
	He hasnt even touched his meals. Chicken or mutton, the plate has remained untouched.        
	Naughty the Dobermann is missing his master.                    Paul    
	No one knows where his master, Saumajit Basu, is since the schoolteacher was suspected to have been abducted along with his police inspector friend Partha Biswas on Friday by Maoists. The two were apparently taken hostage from the Ayodhya Hills in Purulia.        
	The trauma of Naughty came to light on a day the world mourned a household name from the animal kingdom. Paul the octopus, who shot to fame during the football World Cup in South Africa for his flawless record in predicting game outcomes, died in its aquarium in Germany.        
	Saumajits family members said the usually cheerful dog has been miserable the past few days. We havent slept with worry ever since we heard about Tubai (Saumajit). Now Naughty has added to our worry. He is part of the family. For two days he hasnt touched his meals. He enters Tubais room, sniffs around, then lets out a moan, said Saumajits elder brother Avijit, a resident of Bandel, about 4km from Chinsurah town.        
	Calcutta-based veterinary doctor Deepak Dey said the dog was psychologically upset. Dogs are very sensitive. They can sense the atmosphere. In this case, the dog too appears to be tense as he can sense the tension around him. He is psychologically upset. But if he doesnt eat, he will fall ill and will have to be hospitalised and put on saline.                          
	Kunal Chakraborty, a vet in Chinsurah who has been treating Naughty ever since Saumajit brought him home as a pup, said the Dobermann was a healthy dog but is depressed now because he misses his master. I find the dogs reaction natural. But something must be done to make him eat.        
	Right now the only way out is to find Saumajit.         
	Avijit said Naughty was generally very cheerful and used to roam around in the garden. Every morning while roaming in the garden, Naughty would push its head through the window for Tubai to pat him. This was their game every day. We all would pat him or play with him. But now we are not in the mood and Naughty appears to have realised something is wrong.        
	Family members said either Saumajit or Avijits wife Paromita would feed Naughty.        
	There were times when Tubai was away from home for a few days but Naughty didnt behave like this, Paromita said. But whenever Tubai was away, his room used to be locked. Now the room is open and there are always people in the house but no one pats or fondles Naughty.

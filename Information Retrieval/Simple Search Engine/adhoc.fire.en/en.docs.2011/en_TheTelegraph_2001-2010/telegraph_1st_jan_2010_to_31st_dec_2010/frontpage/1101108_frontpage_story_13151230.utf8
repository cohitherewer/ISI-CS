The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Women take up rural poll cudgels 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Women take up rural poll cudgels 
  - Wives, sisters and daughters of politicians in panchayat election fray          AMIT GUPTA                                              Menon Ekka      
	Ranchi, Nov. 7: They may not be famous, but the spouses, sisters and daughters of some of the states politicians might well hold the key to revival of the latters political fortunes or consolidation of position.        
	And providing the perfect canvas is the first panchayat elections in Jharkhand, with nearly 58 per cent of the seats reserved for women.        
	So its hardly surprising to find Menon Ekka, wife of former minister and Kolebira MLA Anosh Ekka, who is cooling his heels in Birsa Munda jail on corruption charges, trying her luck from Simdega for the influential post of a zilla parishad member. If elected, she stands a chance of becoming chairperson of the district board later.        
	Like Menon, in Simdega alone, there are at least six candidates who are wives of politicians. Rose Kido, wife of ex-MLA and former minister in unified Bihar Theodore Kido; Jacinta Lakra, wife of former principal accountant general and Assembly election candidate Benjamin Lakra and Meera Nurani Longa, wife of former JMM MLA Basant Longa, are all the fray.        
	Gorito Kido, wife of former IPS officer Moreish Kido, has also thrown her hat into the Simdega ring.         
	Mother of three Jacinta minces no words when she explains why she is contesting.         
	I want to get back to my roots. Its an opportunity to serve women from the lower rungs of society, where they still dont have access to a toilet, potable drinking water or LPG connections, said the zilla parishad member candidate who filed her nomination from Kurdeg block.        
	Menon filed her papers from the newly created Panketand block and heaped praise on her disgraced husband who was rural development minister in the Madhu Koda regime.        
	I am sure of winning as my husband has served the area for long. It will surely pay dividends, said Menon, who aims to become chairperson of the district board.        
	Thirty-two-year-old Anjali Soren, daughter of JMM chief and former chief minister Shibu Soren, is also contesting for the post of zilla parishad member from Jaridih block in Bokaro district. She filed her nomination on November 3.         
	In Koderma, sister of former MLA late Chittaranjan Yadav is contesting from Jainagar block.

  - Cabinet secy to calm nerves         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Manmohan Singh during the inauguration of India Corporate Week in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today sought to assure a nervous corporate sector that the government would prevent misuse and exercise utmost care under well-defined rules before sanctioning phone-tapping.         
	Prefacing his first public, though indirect, reference to the tap and subsequent leak of Vaishnavi boss Niira Radias conversations, the Prime Minister said: Let me also take this opportunity to reaffirm our governments commitment to providing an enabling environment conducive to the growth of the corporate sector in our country. We wish to provide a level playing field for private businesses, free from fear or favour.        
	However, Singh subsequently pointed out that the business practices of some corporate houses have come under intense public scrutiny for their perceived ethical deficit.        
	The Prime Minister was speaking at the inauguration of the India Corporate Week, organised by the government and the CII.        
	 Addressing an issue that has been vexing industrialists, Singh said: I am aware of the nervousness in some sections of the corporate sector arising out of powers conferred upon government authorities to tap phones for protecting national security and preventing tax evasion and money laundering.        
	While these powers are needed in the world that we live in, they have to be exercised with utmost care and under well-defined rules, procedures and mechanisms so that they are not misused.        
	Keen to assuage concerns of the corporate sector over invasion of privacy, Singh announced that he was asking the cabinet secretary, K.M. Chandrashekhar, to look into ways of strengthening legal checks and balances and report to him within a month.        
	We must also look for solutions through technology to prevent access of telephone conversation to systems outside the institutional framework of government, Singh said.        
	Singh refrained from any mention of the Radia tapes, recorded by the income-tax department and currently in the custody of the Supreme Court, but he was clearly responding to the displeasure and unease the leak of the tapes have caused in the private sector.        
	Ratan Tata, who employs Radias Vaishnavi Communications as its public relations voice, has gone to the Supreme Court for violation of privacy. The leaked tapes also contain parts of conversations between Tata and Radia.        
	Addressing the same context, Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC, has also called upon the Prime Minister to address corporate concerns. You cant have telephones tapped for two years, thats invasion of privacy, Parekh told NDTVs Walk the Talk. In the same interview, Parekh asked the Prime Minister to dispel fears of the corporate sector.         
	Since the first Radia tapes were published last month, the political storm over 2G spectrum allegations has intensified. While Congress and Opposition leaders have engaged in daily fire on the issue, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi herself joined the battle-lines. But the Prime Minister has largely remained silent.        
	His remarks today may address some of the anxiety in the corporate world, but they also indicate, perhaps, that he is not prepared to join the political debate yet, happy to let the party wage battle on that front.         
	BJP patriarch L.K. Advani said: The Prime Minister has asked the cabinet secretary to look into phone-tapping and to suggest means to prevent leak of recorded conversations outside the government. He is only worried about that.        
	I dont know what he means about looking for solutions to technology. Are these matters the Prime Minister should be worried about? The Prime Minister anyway doesnt make his cabinet.

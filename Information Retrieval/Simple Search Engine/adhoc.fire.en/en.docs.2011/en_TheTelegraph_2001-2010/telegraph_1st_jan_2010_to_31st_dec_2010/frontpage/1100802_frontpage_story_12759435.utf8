The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Somnath unwell ahead of meeting 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Somnath unwell ahead of meeting 
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: Somnath Chatterjee today said he was not in a mood to attend a meeting on Subhas Chakrabortys first death anniversary on Tuesday because I am feeling unwell.        
	The statement came a day after the late transport ministers widow Ramala, who is organising the commemoration meeting, called on the former Lok Sabha Speaker at his Calcutta residence.        
	Asked if he had changed his mind after Ramala met him, Chatterjee ducked the question but confirmed the meeting. Ramala came to me last night and discussed the August 3 programme at length with me, said Chatterjee, whose upcoming memoirs have details that have already put CPM boss Prakash Karat in a tight corner.        
	I am not in a mood to attend Subhass memorial meet because I am feeling unwell, Chatterjee told The Telegraph over the phone from Santiniketan this afternoon.        
	Ramala said she had called on Chatterjee but refused to disclose what was discussed during the hour-long interaction.        
	If the former Speaker does stay away from the event, the gesture will help Ramala and some Bengal CPM functionaries wriggle out of the tricky situation of having to share the stage with Chatterjee after the disclosures in his upcoming book that embarrassed Karat.        
	Three days ago, Chatterjee had said he had extended his stay in Calcutta till August 4 only to attend Subhass death anniversary programme.         
	Ramala and the former CPM MP from Barrackpore, Tarit Topdar, are organising the memorial meeting under the banner of the Subhas Chakraborty Foundation at Netaji Indoor Stadium.        
	Sources said Ramala had informed Chatterjee of the sensitivities involved in sharing the stage with him in the wake of an expression of disapproval by some CPM leaders.        
	Although the invite had already been sent to Chatterjee and the posters referred to him as the president for the memorial meet, Ramalaboudi was in a fix after some leaders disapproved of our association with him so soon after his comments on the party chief, said a CPM state committee member.

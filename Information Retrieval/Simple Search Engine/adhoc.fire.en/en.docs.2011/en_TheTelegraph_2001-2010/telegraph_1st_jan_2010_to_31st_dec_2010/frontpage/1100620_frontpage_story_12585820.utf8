  - Manohar recuses to blunt bias cry, BCCI meet on July 3          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Shashank Manohar                                
	Calcutta, June 19: Lalit Kumar Modis complete isolation within the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to be officially confirmed on July 3, when the first of three items on the agenda is put to vote at a Special General Meeting, in Mumbai.        
	The SGM was decided upon this afternoon, a few hours after secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasan referred Modis replies to the three showcause notices, served between April 26 and May 31, to the BCCIs disciplinary committee.        
	Modi has already been suspended from all posts, including those of chairman and commissioner of the money-spinning Indian Premier League (IPL).        
	Significantly, BCCI president Shashank Manohar, who would have chaired the disciplinary committee meeting, has recused himself, leaving Modi with nothing to shout about.        
	Mr Modi believes he wont get a fair hearing as long as Im there (on the disciplinary committee). His claim is without substance, but Ive still decided to step aside. Ive withdrawn so that he doesnt, in any way, feel hes not getting a fair hearing, Manohar told The Telegraph from his chambers in Nagpur.        
	While Manohar, a lawyer by profession, didnt wish to say anything more, a well-placed source pointed out that Modi would now have no grounds to move court before the disciplinary committee takes up his issue.        
	On the face of it, then, Modi has been checkmated. Modi has reservations about Srinivasan, too, but hes not on the disciplinary committee.                          
	Senior BJP leader and vice-president from north, Arun Jaitley, and industrialist Chirayu Amin, interim chairman of the IPL and vice-president from west, are the other members of the disciplinary committee.        
	The SGMs agenda is as follows: (a) ratifying the secretarys decision to refer Modis replies to the disciplinary committee; (b) reconstituting the disciplinary committee, following the presidents recusal; (c) any decision which needs to be taken with regard to the IPL.        
	In this case, a simple majority would be needed for anything to be passed and, so, even 16 votes are going to suffice. Such is the anti-Modi mood, though, that another well-placed source felt it wouldnt surprise if the voting turned out to be as one-sided as 30-1.        
	The one vote for Modi coming from the Inderjit Singh Bindra-headed Punjab Cricket Association. Not that moves arent afoot, as of now, to ensure unanimity.        
	Manohar and Srinivasan went into overdrive as Modi had been spreading word that hed be back within two months and was seeking to put pressure on Jaitley and Amin. Also, an impression gaining ground was that the BCCI was, perhaps, content with serving showcause notices.        
	One learns that former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia, of the BJP, has taken up Modis cause with party colleague Jaitley. Then, it seems, Modi is banking on his industrialist father, Krishan Kumar, to use a long-standing relationship with Amin to good use.         
	Modi, of course, cannot be thrown out on July 3 itself, but the house may request Manohar to act suitably. In fact, another showcause, for continuing to harm the institutions image, is a strong possibility.        
	Given the mood, anything can happen. However, procedures will be followed as the BCCI doesnt want to give Modi a chance to parade himself as a martyr, somebody who was victimised. Theres enough to nail him for life (as a cricket administrator), is how one of the well-placed sources put it.        
	He added: Usually, support on issues such as this is conveyed verbally, but many of the BCCIs affiliated units have this time gone to the extent of formally asking the president to act firmly.        
	Modi, for his part, has said that hed like to call Manohar as a witness before the disciplinary committee, but few are willing to bet on that actually happening.        
	Most in the BCCI are of the opinion that such a move would be akin to committing hara-kiri.

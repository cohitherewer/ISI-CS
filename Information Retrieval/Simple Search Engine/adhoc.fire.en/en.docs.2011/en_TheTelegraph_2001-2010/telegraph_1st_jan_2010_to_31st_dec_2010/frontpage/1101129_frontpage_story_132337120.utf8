	Hyderabad/New Delhi, Nov 29 (PTI): Amid a stand-off with Congress leadership, Andhra Pradesh MP Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, today resigned from his Lok Sabha seat and announced his decision to quit the party alleging that the Congress "humiliated" his family and tried to drive a "wedge" in it.
    The 37-year-old MP, the son of late Andhra chief minister Y S R Reddy, will soon announce the launch of his new party -- Youth Sramik Ryot (YSR) Congress -- in Kadapa, his Lok Sabha constituency, sources close to him said.
    In a five-page 'open letter' to AICC President Sonia Gandhi released this morning, the MP also said his mother Vijayamma, who is an MLA from Pulivendula constituency, would also quit her post and the party.
    Jagan faxed his resignation letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, LS sources said in New Delhi.

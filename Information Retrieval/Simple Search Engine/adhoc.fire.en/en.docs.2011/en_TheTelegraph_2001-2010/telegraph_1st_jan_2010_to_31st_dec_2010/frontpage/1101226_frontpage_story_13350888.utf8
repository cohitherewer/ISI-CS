	Hyderabad, Dec. 25: Union minister D. Purandeswari today surprised guests at the International Kuchipudi Dance Festival with a small performance.         
	The junior minister for human resource development, in a purple silk sari, danced for almost 15 minutes, cheered on by delegates, mostly NRI Telugus from the US.         
	The elder daughter of N.T. Rama Rao, the actor who founded the Telugu Desam Party, hails from Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh, which is the home of Kuchipudi.         
	Purandeswari is said to have learnt the dance form for 13 years.        
	As a child, she had featured in a cameo in one of her fathers film songs but the scene got chopped off before the film was released.         
	Purandeswari can at last stake claim to 15 minutes of fame with todays stage performance.         
	The Kuchipudi dance festival will conclude on Sunday with a get-together dancers from five generations on the stage.        
	President Pratibha Patil, who is now in Andhra Pradesh, will attend the event on the closing day.

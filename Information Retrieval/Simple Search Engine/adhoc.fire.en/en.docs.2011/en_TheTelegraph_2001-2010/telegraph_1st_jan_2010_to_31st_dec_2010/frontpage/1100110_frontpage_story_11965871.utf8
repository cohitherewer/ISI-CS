The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | New faces in Soren cabinet
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                New faces in Soren cabinet
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA AMP; AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Jan. 9: Fresh after sailing through a confidence vote in the Assembly, Shibu Soren today expanded his cabinet by naming nine ministers, six of whom are first timers.         
	In the 12 member cabinet (see chart), which looked to be a judicious mix of backwards, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and the minority community, both the JMM and the BJP had equal representation in terms of numbers  four each.        
	The Ajsu had three and the JD(U) one.         
	Governor K. Sankaranarayanan administered the oath of office to the new ministers.        
	Soren said the Cabinet expansion was done in consultation with allies and that there was no dissension. The government will run smoothly and work for the welfare the poor, the chief minister said, adding that he would soon distribute portfolios.        
	But the Ajsu and the BJP went out of their way to second Soren. Soon after his swearing in, the BJPs Neelkanth Singh Munda said the names of ministerial candidates were finalised by his partys high command.         
	In our party no one dares question the high commands decision. We are ready to shoulder any responsibility that the party wants us to, he added.         
	Babulal Marandis JVM was, however, sceptical. Legislature party leader Pradip Yadav said, My best wishes are with them. Some among them have been ministers in the past and we are aware of their capabilities.        
	What Yadav did not spell out was that given the fragmented nature of the states politics, the BJP seemed to have lost out as it had been left with no ministers in the crucial Santhal Pargana, leaving it at the mercy of the JMM who have representation in the region in the form of Barhait MLA Hemlal Murmu and Madhupur MLA Haji Hussain Ansari.         
	Also, the saffron party would find it difficult to reach out to the upper castes as they dont find place in the coalitions cabinet.        
	If deputy chief minister Raghubar Das was a backward, Majhgaon MLA Barkunwar Gagrai and Khunti MLA Neelkanth Singh Munda were tribals. Latehar BJP MLA Baidyanath Ram was a scheduled caste. Only C.P. Singh, the Speaker, represented a forward caste.        
	The BJP will hold sway in the Singhbhum-Kolhan region with Das and Gagrai, while Munda would represent Chotanagpur. Palamau would be represented by Ram.         
	Barring Ram, Munda and Ramgarh MLA C.P. Choudhary, all ministers inducted today were first timers.         
	But, the induction of Choudhary, who has been a minister in both Arjun Munda and Madhu Koda governments, gave the Opposition a handle against the Ajsu and the government as his personal secretary, Manoj Kumar Singh, was being probed by the vigilance bureau for corruption.        
	First time MLA from Chandankiyari Uma Kant Rajak was the Ajsus last minute inclusion. Sources claimed initially, party chief and deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto had proposed Lohardaga MLA Kamal Kishore Bhagat.         
	But after the Opposition questioned his choice in the Assembly as he faced a number of criminal cases against him, he is said to have changed his mind.        
	The JMMs balancing act seemed the most successful, given that it had managed a good mix of Muslim, ST and SC and OBCits vote bank. Also, all major regions of the state had found representation in Sorens cabinet.        
	The three districts of Palamau commissionary (Latehar, Garwah and Palamau) would be represented by Latehar BJP MLA Baidyanath Ram and the lone woman in the cabinet, Chattarpur JD(U) MLA Sudha Choudhury, whose brother Udai Narayan Choudhary was Bihar Speaker. He was present during the swearing in ceremony.        
	JMMs Tundi MLA Mathura Prasad Mahto, who played a crucial role in holding the party together after Sorens defeat in the Tamar bypolls, would represent the coal belt as well as OBCs.        
	With his cabinet in place, Soren, sources said, was likely to go to New Delhi to meet the Prime Minister.         
	It is imperative on the part of a chief minister to call on the PM after assuming charge. This apart, he also plans to request the PM to give special attention to Jharkhand in the coming Union Budget, said an official.         
	The delay in Soren finalising his Cabinet meant the governor had to defer plans of visiting his home state of Kerala for Pongal.         
	He may now be going during the end of the week, just in time for the festival, said a Raj Bhavan source.

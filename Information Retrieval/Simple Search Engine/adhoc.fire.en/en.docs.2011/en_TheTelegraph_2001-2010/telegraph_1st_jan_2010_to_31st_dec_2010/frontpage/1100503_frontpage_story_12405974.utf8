The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | From Lucknow to Leicester
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                From Lucknow to Leicester
  - After political eclipse at home, Sanjay campaigns in UK           AMIT ROY                      Sanjay Dutt arrives with Keith Vaz and Shilpa Shetty rsquo;s husband Raj Kundra (in front seat) in Leicester 
  on Saturday                                
	Leicester, May 2: No luck in Lucknow? Try Leicester.        
	Sanjay Dutt turned up in this British city yesterday to campaign for his very close friend and wonderful human being Keith Vaz for the May 6 UK elections.        
	A labour of love for the Labour candidate from Leicester East? Perhaps a bid by Munna Bhai to lage raho with politics after his failure to contest from Lucknow last year and subsequent exit from the Samajwadi Party with elder brother Amar Singh?        
	The excitement of the hundreds of Asian fans, packed into the Feast of India restaurant for Vazs formal adoption as candidate, suggested the Gandhigiri had gone off well.        
	After being driven north from London with Raj Kundra, Shilpa Shettys husband, in one Rolls Royce, the actor switched to another equally un-Gandhian mode of transport -- a white convertible Rolls Royce.        
	The idea, Vaz explained, was for Sanjay to see a little of Leicester and for the citys Asians to catch a glimpse of the much-loved bad boy of Bollywood.        
	As the convertible hove into view in the locality of Belgrave, preceded by drum beaters and followed by police vans with blue flashing lights, the expected chaos ensued.         
	First stop for Sanjay was Vazs campaign headquarters on Uppingham Road, where he was ushered into the garden to be photographed one at a time with favoured party workers.        
	Then he stood on a balcony, between Kundra and Vaz, and chatted with journalists. He wasnt quite sure whether his presence would sway doubtful voters. I hope so but I dont think Keith needs me he said, modestly and entirely accurately.        
	Vaz cut in: We do, we need you.        
	Although Gordon Brown resembles the captain of the Titanic after it had hit an iceberg, Vaz, MP for Leicester East since 1987, is entirely safe.        
	Vaz has brought so many Indian film stars to Leicester that he can legitimately claim to be called the member for Bollywood Central.         
	His office wall is decorated with photographs of him with Shilpa, whom he had supported during the racism row on Celebrity Big Brother; Amitabh Bachchan, who was given an honorary degree at De Montfort University in Leicester; Aishwarya Rai; and Katrina Kaif. Shilpa and Bachchan have been to Leicester more than once, and for the last election, Dalip Tahil campaigned for Vaz.        
	As for Sanjay, he happens to be in England at this time and I invited him, Vaz said.        
	The restaurant was heaving with Asians in carnival mood by the time Vaz escorted Sanjay onto the platform past the ladies with cellphone cameras.        
	As Sanjay was invited to say a few words, he slipped unconsciously into the role of Munna bhai. Mamu, he began. Lage raho, someone from the crowd shouted.        
	Munna bhai admitted he wasnt too hot on politics but urged the voters to follow his example: Apun ka support to Keith ke saath hai (I support Keith).        
	As he resumed his seat to cheers, Vaz expressed his gratitude with a caveat in case Munna bhai was tempted to have another go at politics: Sanjay, you can choose any constituency in the world but not Leicester East, please!

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bengal for hostage talks
          A STAFF REPORTER                      The air show at Kalaikunda on Tuesday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                          
	Calcutta, Nov. 2: The Bengal government today said it was ready to speak to Maoists to secure the release of police officer Partha Biswas and his friend, schoolteacher Saumajit Basu, who are suspected to have been abducted by the rebels in Purulias Ayodhya Hills.        
	Police have so far made no headway in the search for the two since October 22.         
	Asked why the administration wanted to start talks with the Maoists over 10 days after the abduction, additional DGP (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha told PTI: We feel this is a right time. The government is open to dialogue (with the Maoists).        
	The officer said that the abductors could come forward for talks. The organisation that abducted them is hereby asked to come forward and discuss with the government. The government is open to dialogue, Purakayastha said at Writers Buildings. This is a message, not an appeal.         
	The officer gave two phone numbers. The information can be conveyed through 033-22145486 (fax) or +91-9051399183 (mobile). The identity of the caller(s) would be kept confidential, Purakayastha added.        
	He said that the government had learnt from media and other reports that Biswas and Basu had been abducted by followers of a particular organisation as prisoners of war in their own interpretation. He did not name any Maoist organisation or leader.        
	Maoist leader Kishan today told PTI that he had no information about the duo. We still dont have any information about the abduction of the intelligence branch inspector and the schoolteacher. If that was true, then we should have come out with a statement, he said. I will check the details with our Purulia squad and let you know.

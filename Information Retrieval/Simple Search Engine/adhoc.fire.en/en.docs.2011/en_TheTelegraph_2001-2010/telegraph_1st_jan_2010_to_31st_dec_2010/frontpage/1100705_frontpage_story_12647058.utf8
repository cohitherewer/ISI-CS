  - Buzz about unhappiness over strike        J.P. YADAV                                     
	New Delhi, July 4: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today quietly walked out of his partys politburo meeting that exempted Left-ruled Tripura from tomorrows strike but not Bengal, sparking speculation he was unhappy with central CPM leaders.         
	Although politburo members attributed his early departure to an appointment, Bengal government officials said the chief minister had no engagement apart from the party meeting.         
	The chief minister left by the evening flight after attending the politburo meeting. He had no other meeting, Bengal resident commissioner Bhaskar Khulbe said.         
	Bhattacharjee left the meeting venue, the partys headquarters at AKG Bhavan, around 12.45pm and remained closeted at Banga Bhavan till he emerged to catch the 5pm flight to Calcutta.        
	Other politburo members came out of the meeting at least an hour after he left.        
	Senior leaders Sitaram Yechury and M.K. Pandhe said: He left because he had an appointment. There was no other issue.        
	Bhattacharjee, who is known for his dislike of bandhs, was unhappy that the central leadership had exempted only Tripura, among the three Left-ruled states, on the ground that the state had recently had a strike to protest against the petroleum price increase.         
	So had Bengal, which observed a transport strike on June 26 in response to a Left strike call, people close to Bhattacharjee said.        
	Tripura chief minister Manik Sircar had sought the exemption, a plea the leadership accepted, sources said. Protest marches would be organised in Tripura but there will be no strike, Yechury had said yesterday.         
	Sources close to Bhattacharjee said that with Mamata Banerjee trying to project herself as a politician opposed to strikes, for which there is often little popular support, ahead of the Assembly polls next year, the shutdown call could go against the party.        
	In any case, the chief minister has opposed strikes in the past. Two years ago, he had said: I think it (strike) is not helping us, our country. But unfortunately, as I belong to a party and (when) it calls a strike, I keep mum.         
	Buffeted by embarrassing losses in the civic and Lok Sabha polls, Bhattacharjee is also unhappy with the aggressive anti-Congress line being pursued by the central leadership. Leaders close to him have voiced concern over the party being seen as coordinating with the BJP by calling a strike on the same day.         
	Bengal CPM leaders feel it could send a wrong message to Muslims. Why have we given a strike call on the same day as the BJP, asked one.         
	The discomfort in the Bengal camp would have escalated when senior BJP leader L.K. Advani today flaunted the Opposition unity on the strike. This may be the first time in the history of Indias politics that almost all political parties will participate in the Bharat bandh, Advani said.         
	Advani thanked NDA convener and JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav for bringing together even non-NDA parties. Although the CPM has said it is not acting with the BJP, it is no secret that Sharad has been in touch with Left leaders to make the strike a success.         
	After coordination between the BJP and the Left in Parliament in the budget session, it will be seen on the streets tomorrow.

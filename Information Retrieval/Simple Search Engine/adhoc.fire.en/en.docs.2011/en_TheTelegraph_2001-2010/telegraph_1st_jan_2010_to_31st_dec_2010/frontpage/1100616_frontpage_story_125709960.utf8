                  M. Veerappa Moily, Law Minister       
	New Delhi, Jun 16 (PTI): In an effort to curb discrimination against minors suffering from communicable diseases, Government is all set to amend an act providing for the care and protection of children.  
	The draft bill to amend the Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Act, seeks to prohibit authorities from sending minor children to mental asylums, and separate treatment for those suffering from diseases such as leprosy and TB.   
	According to the amendments, instead of sending such children to mental asylums, the authorities will have to ensure their proper treatment and such persons would not be allowed to be abandoned in asylums.  
	 The provisions of the new draft bill state that terms such as "mental disorder" should not be used while referring to children.

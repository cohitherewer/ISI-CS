          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today hastened to erase the if he had appeared to hang over his governments survival yesterday.        
	The chief minister asserted he would continue at the helm, a day after he had let slip a jodi sarkar thake (if the government stays), the if becoming the butt of speculation whether it reflected a subconscious feeling of insecurity.        
	I am not leaving. I am here. I am at the helm here with my colleagues. I cant betray the people of Bengal, Bhattacharjee said after inaugurating a new building of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation on Camac Street.        
	The chief ministers if had come at a weavers event on the Milon Mela grounds while he was listing his governments plans to modernise the handloom industry.        
	Being a lover of poetry, Bhattacharjee would no doubt be acquainted with another famous If, a poem by Rudyard Kipling.        
	If you can bear to hear the truth youve spoken... goes the poem, but the chief minister is certain to point out that the next line says: Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools....        
	Today, Bhattacharjee said: Some journalists are too clever. I want to tell them I cant make them happy. My colleagues and I are taking Bengal forward both in industry and agriculture. Theres no way we are leaving. We will go ahead.        
	The chief minister appeared to have taken Kiplings advice to trust yourself when all men doubt you but not the immediately following one to make allowance for their doubting too. He indicated how badly he had been stung by interpretations of his comment yesterday by suddenly changing course while describing his governments success in wooing investment.        
	Before I end I want to say that one or two newspapers have written some strange things about my speech yesterday. They have written that I gave an indication that perhaps we (the Left Front government) wont be here any more, Bhattacharjee said during his 14-minute speech.        
	A psychologist had said his remark yesterday may have been a Freudian slip and suggested the rise of the Trinamul Congress had sown insecurity in his mind.        
	Bhattacharjee said: Under no circumstances can we leave power in the hands of an irresponsible, anti-industry, unruly party that has no policy. The people of Bengal do not want the state to descend into anarchy.        
	State CPM secretary Biman Bose played down Bhattacharjees Milon Mela comment. He had only meant the weavers event would be held next year after the Assembly polls. He did not mean anything else, Bose told reporters in Siliguri.        
	Asked if Bhattacharjees remark had betrayed a sense of insecurity, Bose said: Its too early to comment on the Assembly polls; so I would prefer to keep silent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Young? Farewell; Old? Hello
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Young? Farewell; Old? Hello
  - Buzz of pensioners in would-be industry hub										      SAMBIT SAHA      OUR TOWNS: KALYANI                                    
	Named after the woman its founder could not marry, Kalyani should have been a town for the young and their dreams, its bricks shaped by their yearnings.        
	Instead, it has become a placid pensioners haunt, overrun by the moss of contentment.        
	The township of one lakh has three railway stations, mirroring the hope of founding father Bidhan Chandra Roy that it would become an industrial hub of the future. The youth should be happy  they cant wait to buy a ticket out of town.        
	Others who leave in the mornings every day, of course, have no option but to come back in the evening. They are the commuters, making the uncomfortable, 100-minute journey to Sealdah twice daily because this Nadia town has few industries or jobs.        
	So, the young boys and girls venture out in search of livelihood and settle outside.        
	T.K. Mukherjee, managing director of German firm Phoenixs plant, which boasts perhaps the largest and best-run factory in the township, admits it is difficult to attract or retain talent.         
	There is no cinema, shopping complex or mall where a young man would like to hang out over weekends, he says.        
	Mukherjee isnt going anywhere  he has been coming to the factory for the past 15 years. Nor are most of the older residents.        
	Although it hasnt thrived like Durgapur, former chief minister Roys other brainchild, Kalyani has retained its planned visage. It looks rather like Salt Lake used to with its plotted houses, mostly single or double-storied, the little patches of green in front, and serenity and languid charm all around.        
	Which is why the elderly want to stay on despite the administrations failure to provide adequate health care or security from rampant burglary.         
	Its a good place to spend ones retired life. There is less pollution and lots of greenery. It is calm and quiet, says former professor Chitreshwar Sen, who came to Kalyani in 1961 and never thought of leaving after retiring from the Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya.         
	Where there is greenery, there surely is land for industry? Yes, but its tied up in the red tape of complacency.        
	There is a lot of vacant land. The industry department needs to be pro-active in allocating land to those really interested. There are so many who have left land unused for years, a top executive from an existing unit said.        
	He has decided to expand outside Bengal after waiting for a five-acre plot for more than a year. Another company that wanted to expand in Kalyani claims it was not given land although suitable plots abound.        
	Land or no land, investors arent likely to come, avers Phoenixs Mukherjee. To see why, look no further than the two highways.        
	National Highway 34, the link with Calcutta port and airport and therefore the potential artery for trade and industry, is choked by encroachment. The less encumbered, two-lane Kalyani Expressway, which runs on to BT Road in Calcuttas northern suburbs, is too narrow anyway, a far cry from the likes of Bombay Road and Delhi Road that investors in Bengal are now used to.        
	Do you think investors will set up units here if it takes two hours or more to drive down from Calcutta, just 65km away? asks Mukherjee.        
	Yet it wasnt always so. The Kalyani Black Label once carried the towns name to far corners of India as the favoured brew of the upwardly mobile. The local factory that produces the beer is doing well after Vijay Mallya bought the brand and the unit at the beginning of the decade. But competition from the likes of Budweiser and Fosters has inevitably pushed Kalyani Black Label down the trendy drinkers pecking order.        
	The old-timers, though, have frothy nostalgia to sip. In the 60s and 70s, the town used to bustle with some 80 factories operating here. The number has dwindled to less than 10.        
	Iron and steel and rubber products were the two dominant industries here, but not any more. The biggest of the towns factories, Cycle Corporation of India, closed down years ago.        
	A tour around Kalyani Shilpanchal and adjacent Gayeshpur shows torn-down factory sheds, chimneys peeping from behind jungles of weeds, broken walls allowing free passage to all who want to use the deserted compounds for their dubious purposes.        
	The Cycle Corporation plot, next to the Kalyani Shilpanchal railway station, is finally being put to use, though.        
	Behind the rusted gates, the two young men resting inside become suspicious at being photographed against the backdrop of an under-construction building. Asked, they reveal that a college is being built but do not seem to know more than that.        
	Its enough, though, to hold up a mirror to Kalyanis recent history: rather than a buzzing industrial belt, it has become a minor education hub.        
	Kalyani University has been a landmark since it was set up in 1960, and the Krishi Viswavidyalaya came up in 1974. The town boasts many good schools. A new medical college is nearing completion.        
	The young will come to study and then go away.        
	Pride in Kalyanis educational heritage shines on the face of Sen, who has taught in Kalyani University as well as the Krishi Viswavidyalaya. He is optimistic about the towns potential for change: The civic amenities have improved in the past 5-10 years. The roads have become wider; lights have been installed.         
	But another Kalyani University professor, who would not be named, said the civic body had become active only about a year ago.        
	Kalyani, which became a municipality 15 years ago, has so far been ruled by the CPM with Krishi Viswavidyalaya professor Shantanu Jha as mayor. Sen claims Jha is the charismatic agent of change the town needs.        
	The mayor received an award from President Pratibha Patil last year for community-led total sanitation, Sen proudly reveals. Kalyani has been declared free of open-defaecation after people were inspired to build toilets with their own resources in all the 52 slums surrounding the town.        
	Not everyone is happy. Ward 20, added to the municipality after its residents refused to vote in the 2008 panchayat polls demanding civic status, is far from basking in the glory of the promotion.        
	We still depend on deep tube-wells; water connections havent reached our homes, a Ward 20 resident said.        
	He wants change, so Jha and his band face their toughest challenge in 15 years although the main Opposition, the Trinamul Congress, is enmeshed in faction fights.        
	But ask people if moving to Calcutta is an option, and many shudder at the thought. Roys dream may be in ruins, but there are many here to romance the wreck.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dow spares blushes in US
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dow spares blushes in US
  - Chief stays away from India meet        K.P. NAYAR                            Mukherjee in Washington and file picture of Dow   chief Liveris                                
	Washington, June 22: Dow chairman Andrew Liveris stayed away from a high-profile meeting of the Indo-US CEOs Forum here today to avoid a face-off with Indian ministers over previous assurances by New Delhi that the successor entity to Union Carbide was not responsible for the fallout from the Bhopal gas tragedy 25 years ago.        
	Louise Adhikari, a spokeswoman for Dow Chemical, has been telling curious reporters who were hoping to meet Liveris at the Forums meeting today that the companys chief had a prior engagement that he could not move as the excuse for his absence.        
	But the first meeting of the revamped Forum was fixed for June as early as seven months ago when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Washington and midwifed with President Barack Obama the rebirth of this key bilateral platform of corporate leaders.        
	Besides, Liveris had lobbied hard for several months in the run-up to Singhs visit to be nominated to the Forum and at one time hoped to be its chairman.        
	Several months before Singhs state visit in November, the US department of commerce notified in the Federal Register the intention to reconstitute the Forum and invited applications from CEOs in a transparent exercise. Liveris got the nomination, but lost the chairmanship of the US side to Honeywells CEO, David Cote.        
	In defending the absence of Liveris from todays meeting, Dow appeared to be wandering into tricky quicksand. With Adhikari insisting that all is well and that the companys chairman had other commitments, a second spokesperson let the cat out of the bag by iterating Dows stated position.        
	In an email to The Wall Street Journal, spokesman Scot Wheeler said Dow is not responsible for any liability relating to Bhopal. The onus for cleaning up the site of the former Union Carbide plant solely rests in the hands of the Indian central and state governments, he said.        
	If the head of Dow had gone for todays meeting holding fast to this position, it would have vitiated the atmosphere not only among other CEOs but also among members of the Indian and US cabinet at the engagements.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, commerce minister Anand Sharma and deputy chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia are here for the meeting.        
	Mukherjee had categorically said in Gandhinagar on Thursday that he would not meet Liveris in Washington this week.        
	State department officials would neither confirm nor deny that they had nudged the Dow chairman into giving a pass to the CEOs Forum in the light of Mukherjees statement, of which a video clip was transmitted here by the US consulate in Mumbai.        
	In an exceptionally warm gesture of welcome on his first visit to the US as finance minister, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, threw open the state department for Mukherjee and agreed to host the meeting of the CEOs Forum in one its historic halls reserved for signing treaties and bilateral exchanges at the level of foreign ministers.        
	Although the Forum has been functioning for five years, this is the only time that its meeting has been held on a US government property. The convention here is that since such meetings belong to the private sector, state facilities will not be used at American taxpayers expense to host events of this nature. Before the meeting, Clinton held a 30-minute meeting with Mukherjee in the state department although he is not her Indian counterpart any more. The meeting was attended by the deputy secretary of state James Steinberg.        
	Later, she and the Indian ministers attended a lunch hosted by Steinberg for the CEOs.

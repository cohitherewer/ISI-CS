	Ranchi, June 5: In a major breakthrough, CRPF and Jharkhand Jaguar jawans recovered four improvised explosive devices (IEDs), each weighing about 70kg, and one can bomb weighing 25kg from the outskirts of the state capital today.        
	All the bombs were defused, except one IED the forces chose to explode.         
	The explosives were hidden by Maoist rebels in a cave in Dungri Pahadi near Serangtoli village under Namkum police station, barely 20km from Ranchi.         
	The CRPF and Jharkhand Jaguar team, on a combing operation in the forests on the outskirts of Ranchi, were tipped off about the presence of a huge amount of explosives in Dungri Pahadi, following which they trekked about 10km into the forests from Lali village and reached the spot this morning.        
	Confirming the recovery, South Chotanagpur DIG R.K. Mallick said the bombs were very powerful. The four IEDs collectively had the power to blow up a fully protected anti-landmine vehicle, he explained.         
	While the 25kg bomb was kept in a can, the IEDs were kept in separate boxes made of inch-thick steel. The IEDs were also coated with carbon, thus making them safe from metal detectors when planted under a road or a bridge. The IEDs and the can bomb were covered with plastic and hidden in the cave.         
	The jawans reached Dungri Pahadi around 8am. The rebels, who had hidden the bombs, however, had already fled from the spot by the time the security forces reached. It took several hours of careful work for the bomb disposal squad of Jharkhand Jaguar, which accompanied the combing operation team, to defuse the bombs. They exploded one IED. The sound of the bomb could be heard several kilometres away, said a police official who was part of the team.         
	The joint team of the CRPF and Jharkhand Jaguar is now engaged in an operation against the rebels in the region.         
	Earlier, on March 28, the Ranchi police had recovered heavy-duty landmines under a bitumen road in Angara forest of Ranchi district. Then too, the landmines had been kept in cans.         
	However, the one recovered today was stored in a cave, for use in future.

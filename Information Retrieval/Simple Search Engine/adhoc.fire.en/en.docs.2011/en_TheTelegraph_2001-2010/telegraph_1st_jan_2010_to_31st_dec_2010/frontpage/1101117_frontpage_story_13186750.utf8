	Ranchi, Nov. 16: Special healthcare awaits children of Jharkhand.         
	Under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), a check-up drive for students of state-run government schools will be launched from Thursday with the hope of reaching out to about 45 lakh children aged between five and 10.        
	According to Aradhana Patnaik, state director, NRHM, the children will be issued health cards giving them access to regular check-ups every six months and free medical treatment depending on their requirements. The cards will be valid for two years.         
	This is the first time that such a campaign is being launched in the state. Last year, we conducted similar programmes for pregnant women. Now, we are focussing on child health, especially primary schoolchildren. The first phase of the drive, which will continue for a month, will cover 10 lakh children, said Patnaik.        
	She said all aspects of a childs health would be monitored and taken care of  nutrition level, weight, abnormality, if any, sight problems and so on. Based on reports, the children will be referred to clinical centres at their blocks, districts or government hospitals.         
	Jharkhand celebrated its 10th statehood day yesterday, but little has been done in the field of healthcare for the masses. There are around 24 state-run hospitals in the state and on an average, one hospital caters to one lakh people. There is only one doctor for 12,000 people and hardly one primary health centre for 67,000 people on an average.         
	Although the government launched NRHM after withdrawing its maiden health project, Welfare and Family Health Care, in 2005, it has failed to execute the national programme properly in the last five years.         
	NRHM and health officials blame poor awareness, lack of co-ordination between the state and the Centre and to some extent, lack of initiative on the part of officers for the weak implementation of the schemes in rural areas.         
	The biggest hurdle is ignorance both at the public and official levels. Hence, the state as well as the Centres intervention is required from time to time to ensure proper monitoring of the schemes, said Patnaik, adding that awareness campaigns also helped.         
	She said at recent review meetings, they discovered that the amounts allocated for 188 community health centres, 330 primary health centres and 2,000 sub-health centres had remained unutilised for the last two years.         
	We also found that over 50 per cent of the centres were lagging behind as far as revamp and procurement of medical facilities was concerned. Naturally, the health situation is bound to suffer at the grassroots level, she said.        
	However, Patnaik maintained that guidelines had been issued to all civil surgeons and medical officers of the districts to utilise the unused money at the earliest.

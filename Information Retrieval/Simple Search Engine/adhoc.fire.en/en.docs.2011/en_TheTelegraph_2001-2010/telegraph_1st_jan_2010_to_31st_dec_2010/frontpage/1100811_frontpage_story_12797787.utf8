The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Riddle: to thank or to target Gurjar
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Riddle: to thank or to target Gurjar
          OUR BUREAU                            Truck driver Gurjar Singh. Picture by Jahangir Badsa                                  
	Aug. 10: Gurjar Singh from faraway Punjab has become an enigma in Bengal.        
	Conspiracy theories are swirling around the driver whose truck hit a jeep in Mamata Banerjees convoy on her way back from the meeting in Lalgarh last evening.        
	But no one can vouch if he has bailed out Mamata from a Parliament storm or denied her the pleasure of watching the BJP steal the CPMs thunder in the House.        
	The railway minister, who was scheduled to leave for Delhi tomorrow to attend the ongoing session of Parliament, cancelled her visit after being advised rest by doctors. Mamata had said yesterday that she was flung against the dashboard of her SUV when it was hit by an intelligence branch car on impact from the truck crash.        
	Critical care expert Subrata Maitra, who examined Mamata at her Harish Chatterjee Street residence, said she was suffering from chest, neck and back pain and respiratory distress because of the accident.         
	She suffered a whiplash kind of injury as her chest banged against the dashboard of the car during the accident. This resulted in muscle and bone injury of the chest, said Maitra. I have advised her bed rest for two days and have prescribed her painkillers.        
	Her condition is stable but I advised her to get admitted to a hospital for two days for proper medical observation, the doctor added.         
	However, Mamata was reluctant to get admitted to the hospital as her mother was not keeping well, a Trinamul Congress source said.         
	Maitra has also advised a CT scan of the thorax, an ECG and an X-ray of the cervical spine.         
	The additional private secretary to Mamata, Ratanlal Mukherjee, said the railway minister would not be able to attend Parliament until she was declared fit. Instructions were sent today to the two ministers of state for railways to attend Parliament regularly, said Mukherjee.         
	While Mamata stayed at her Kalighat home through Tuesday, a furore erupted in Parliament over her comments in Lalgarh on slain Maoist leader Azad. Mamata had echoed doubts, expressed by others earlier, on the governments claim that Azad was killed in an encounter.        
	With most leading lights of the CPM away in Vijayawada for an extended session of the central committee, the BJP filled the Left void and targeted Mamata.        
	Arun Jaitley, the Rajya Sabha Opposition leader, led the attack, demanding that the Prime Minister clarify whether he endorsed Mamatas stand.        
	He was joined by Prasanta Chatterjee of the CPM who normally sits back in the shadow of Brinda Karat and Sitaram Yechury.        
	Trinamul minister Dinesh Trivedi tried to intervene but Jaitley reminded him that he could not do so because he was not a member of the Upper House. If Trivedi said something, it would be construed as a statement coming from a minister and, therefore, representing the official line, the BJP leader said.        
	The scene was re-enacted in the Lok Sabha with Gopinath Munde picking up the thread. But the Congress refused to criticise Mamata. ( )        
	This morning, when the BJP parliamentary party met, members from Gujarat felt that Mamatas comments on the Azad encounter should be raised. The Gujarat MPs smelt a chance to settle scores with the Congress for running a campaign against Narendra Modi over the Sohrabuddin encounter.         
	The BJP feels that it scored three goals. One, we forced the CPM to support our line. Two, we exposed the fissures between Mamata and the Congress. Three, we have to address our anti-Maoist constituency, a BJP leader said.        
	Mamata, keen to distance herself as much as possible from the BJP after her disastrous alliance with the NDA, should not have any reason to be unhappy with the onslaught. That the Left and the BJP were on the same side is expected to be seen as a bonus.        
	In Vijayawada, a vocal CPM veteran in Parliament smiled sheepishly when told that the BJP is doing the Lefts job in Delhi.        
	In Calcutta, Trinamul leaders said the truck crash was a major conspiracy to kill our leader.         
	However, home secretary Samar Ghosh said: It appears to be an accident and I have asked the East Midnapore superintendent of police to submit a report.        
	Asked about the Trinamuls allegation, director-general of police Bhupinder Singh said: I dont think so.         
	Singh said the railway minister enjoyed Z-plus category and such a person needed to observe rules. She does not use a bullet-proof car. Police are aware of scheduled stops of VVIPs but what can they do if there is an unscheduled halt to have tea? Both the police and the IB will probe the incident, he said.         
	Driver Gurjar, charged with rash and negligent driving, was produced in a Tamluk court and granted bail.        
	Gurjar, a resident of Sangrur district in Punjab, said he had been driving trucks for the past 10 years. I have driven trucks to various parts of the country and Bangladesh. It was my bad luck that I hit the convoy of a VIP, Gurjar said outside the court.        
	 I have heard of Mamata Banerjee but never seen her. I saw her walk towards the truck with people surrounding her. I tried to tell her that I did not mean it. I was even ready to apologise. But police dragged me away, said Gurjar.         
	The driver said there was a problem with the brakes of my truck and so I avoided the flyover and took the shortcut. I wanted to remain behind the convoy but suddenly the convoy slowed down and I hit a car.        
	The police said officials of the motors vehicles department would verify the claim.

          PINAKI MAJUMDAR                                         
	Jamshedpur, July 25: A parched Jharkhand can look forward to some relief in the next two days.         
	The Patna Meteorological Office, which monitors weather conditions in the state, has forecast widespread rainfall over Jharkhand in the next 48 hours.         
	A well-marked low pressure system over coastal Orissa will result in rainfall at various places across the state. The low pressure trough, which is hovering 5.8km above sea level, is gradually intensifying. It may turn into a depression, said S.I. Lashkar, an officiating director of the Patna Meteorological Office.         
	Several parts of the state including Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Daltonganj and Hazaribagh recorded more than 10mm rainfall in the last 24 hours. The rainfall is due to the impact of the low pressure. It is accompanied by winds with a minimum speed of 20km per hour, added Lashkar.         
	Jamshedpur and adjoining areas continued to experience intermittent rainfall throughout the day today. The local meteorological office recorded 12mm rainfall in the last 24 hours, while the state capital received 24.7mm. Daltonganj and Latehar experienced about 25mm of rain each.         
	Weathermen at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, said the low pressure system would help revive monsoon in Jharkhand. Conditions are favourable. The low pressure system over coastal Orissa and the prevailing wind pattern will help activate monsoon currents, said a duty officer.         
	The Met office has also issued a heavy rainfall warning in isolated places across Jharkhand.        
	A subdued monsoon has raised Jharkhands average rainfall deficit to a high 51 per cent. Statistics revealed that against normal average rainfall of 452.6mm, so far the state has received 222.6mm, resulting in a drought-like situation in several districts.         
	Jamshedpur recorded a meagre 124.2mm rainfall till July 25 this year, against a normal 514.6mm. The capital was better placed with 266.3mm rain so far.        
	Senior Met official S.K. Mandal said unless there was continuous rain in the state, it would be difficult to make up the deficit.

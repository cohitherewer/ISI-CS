	Guwahati/Jorhat, Sept. 24: Fear gripped mobile phone users in Assam after seven more persons were injured and developed health complications today while receiving calls on their handsets, taking the number of persons so affected since yesterday to 12. A harried Dispur was left clueless on ways to deal with the situation.         
	Chandan Datta, chief operating officer (Assam operations) of the Hyderabad-based firm GVK-EMRI, told The Telegraph that the firm today received six calls for requisition of Mritunjoy 108 ambulances for persons affected by incoming calls.         
	Dipak Saikia of Ratanpur Lahangaon under Jengraimukh police station in Majuli fainted after he picked up the mobile handset when it rang this morning.         
	Fear has gripped mobile users in the state and many of them are not answering calls from unknown numbers. The mobile service providers are drawing flak from the public for not paying any heed to the issue and creating awareness.         
	Commissioner and secretary, health, J.C. Goswami, said he had come to know about the incidents only after going through the news report in the September 24 edition of The Telegraph.         
	On whether the health department would ask the mobile service providers to issue a list of dos and donts for subscribers, Goswami refused comment.         
	Sailesh Baruah, a resident of Lalmati where one such case was reported this morning, said, It is high time the authorities took note of the development. The mobile service providers and handset dealers cannot escape their responsibilities simply by saying that such technical glitches cannot happen.         
	Majuli sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Amitabh Basumatary told this correspondent that Dipak, 26, was asleep when his cell (8011537743) started ringing. He felt a sensation like an electric shock when he touched the handset, Basumatary said, adding that the youth fell off his bed due to the impact.         
	The SDPO said the handset had not exploded and the battery was removed by his family members. He said he felt an unusual sensation on touching the handset and fell unconscious.         
	Basumatary said if a formal complaint was lodged, the police would seize the handset and send it to the state Forensic Science Laboratory in Guwahati.        
	 As the incident was related to an electronics gadget, the police could investigate the case on the basis of SFSL examination report, he added.

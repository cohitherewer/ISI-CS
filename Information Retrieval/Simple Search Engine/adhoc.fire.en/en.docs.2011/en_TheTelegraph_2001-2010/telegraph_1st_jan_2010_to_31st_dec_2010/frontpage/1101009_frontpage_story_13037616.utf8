The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rebuke to China in Peace Nobel   Jailed dissident feted for rights struggle

  -   Jailed dissident feted for rights struggle
          NYTNS AND AGENCIES                  
	Beijing, Oct. 8: Liu Xiaobo, an impassioned literary critic, political essayist and democracy advocate repeatedly jailed in China for his activism, has won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.        
	Liu, 54, perhaps Chinas best-known dissident, is serving an 11-year term on subversion charges in a cell 300 miles from Beijing. Since he has no access to a phone, he may not have immediately learnt of the news, said his wife Liu Xia whom police today barred from leaving her Beijing apartment and meeting foreign journalists.        
	By honouring Liu, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has handed a rebuke to Beijings authoritarian leaders at a time of growing intolerance for domestic dissent and a spreading unease internationally over the muscular diplomacy that has accompanied Chinas economic rise.        
	In a move that in hindsight seems to have been counterproductive, a senior Chinese official had warned the committees secretary that awarding Liu would harm relations between the two countries.        
	Beijing reacted angrily today, calling the award an obscenity and a desecration of the Peace Prize and reaffirming that it would harm Norway-China relations.        
	 Liu Xiaobo is a criminal, China said and summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing.         
	The award drew muted reactions from the European Union, France, Germany and Britain. But last years winner, US President Barack Obama, accused China of falling behind on political reforms as its economy surges, and urged it to free Liu as soon as possible.        
	The Nobel Committee noted that China, the worlds No. 2 economy, should be commended for lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty but chastised Beijing for ignoring basic human rights.        
	The Chinese media and the countrys main Internet portals appeared to black out the news of the award. Mobile users reported not being able to transmit text messages containing his name (pronounced Liew Show Boh) in Chinese.        
	But on government-monitored microblogs like Sina.com, which regularly blocks searches for his name, the news still generated nearly 6,000 comments within an hour of the announcement.        
	The prize is an enormous psychological boost for Chinas beleaguered reform movement and an affirmation of the two decades Liu has spent advocating peaceful political change in the face of unremitting hostility from the ruling communists.        
	Blacklisted from academia and barred from publishing in China, Liu has been harassed and detained repeatedly since 1989, when he stepped into the Tiananmen Square drama by staging a hunger strike and then negotiating the peaceful retreat of student demonstrators as thousands of soldiers stood by with rifles drawn.        
	If not for the work of Liu and others to broker a peaceful withdrawal, Tiananmen would have been a field of blood, said Gao Yu, veteran journalist and fellow dissident.        
	Liu is one of three people to receive the prize while imprisoned by their own governments, after the Myanmarese leader Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991 and the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky in 1935.

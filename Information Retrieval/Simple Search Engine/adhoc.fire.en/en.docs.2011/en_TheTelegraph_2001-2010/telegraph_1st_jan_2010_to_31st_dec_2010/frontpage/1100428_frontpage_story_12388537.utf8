	Ranchi/Jamshedpur/Dha-nbad, April 27: The Opposi-tion-sponsored dawn-to-dusk Bharat bandh to protest against price rise took a heavy toll on train services today, with dozens of cancellations across the state.        
	 The bandh threw normal life out of gear in the cities as buses stayed off roads and courts, banks and government offices recorded thin attendance. Most schools remained shut and college students skipped classes.         
	Though the bandh was by and large peaceful, clashes were reported from Ranchi and Jamshedpur. In the state capital, bandh supporters damaged cars, while in Jamshedpur, they clashed with vendors.        
	At least half a dozen trains including Howrah-Ranchi Shatabdi Express, Black Diamond Express, Patna-Dhanbad Intercity Express, Ranchi-Howrah Intercity Express, Coal Field Express and Ranchi-Patna Janshatabdi Express were cancelled on the Dhanbad section, as were dozens of passenger trains.        
	The Sealdah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, which managed to leave Dhanbad station at the scheduled time of 6.30am, was stopped by bandh supporters squatting on the tracks near Gaya Bridge, less than a kilometre away from the station. The train left for Asansol at 7.59am only after the arrival of a police party.        
	Passengers of the air-conditioned A-2 coach of Howrah Bombay Mail, which was stuck on platform No 2 of Dhanbad station, faced a harrowing time when the air-conditioning system stopped working for an hour.        
	In Jamshedpur, the trains cancelled were Tata-Howrah Steel Express, Tata-Danapur Express, Howrah-Barbil Janshatabdi Express and Tata-Dhanbad Express.         
	About half-a-dozen passenger trains including Tata-Kharagpur Passenger,Asansol-Tata Passenger, Chakradharpur-Tata-Kharagpur Passenger and Tata-Chakradharpur Passenger, were all cancelled as well.         
	The Howrah-Kurla Ispat Express was short terminated at Tatanagar. The train left for its onward journey three hours behind schedule. The Howrah-Mumbai Geetanjali Express was running several hours late. The railway authorities at Tatanagar faced a tough time as passengers demanded refunds on cancellations.         
	In the state capital, the majority of business establishments remained closed while bus stands wore a deserted look. Attendance in colleges, courts and government offices remained thin.         
	President of Bus Owners Association, Mohan Singh, said 300 buses remained off the roads due to the bandh.         
	 Bandh supporters congregated at Albert Ekka Chowk, Piska More, Ratu Road, Kanke and several other places since early morning. Breaking of car windscreens and tyre burning was reported from Hinoo and Piska More.         
	Some auto rickshaw drivers used the occasion to earn a quick buck. They charged double fares from passengers stranded at bus stands and station. City police superintendent Sambhu Thakur said 267 bandh supporters were arrested and released.         
	Though majority of schools remained closed for the bandh, classes for senior students did take place in DPS and DAV Schools, which remained open.         
	In Jamshedpur, members of 13 Opposition parties jointly took out a rally from Ambagan Ground in Sakchi around 8am. Bandh supporters, carrying flags and banners, forcibly downed shutters at Sakchi market.         
	A clash broke out between bandh supporters and hawkers at Sakchi. The bandh supporters were attacked by vendors when the former tried to dismantle the makeshift shops on the footpath. Four people were injured.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Wake-up call in rifle loot case

	Ranchi, Dec. 27: A five-year-old case has come back to haunt the Giridih police with Maoist ideologue Narayan Sanyal being convicted by a Chhattisgarh court on December 24 for sedition and waging war against the state, along with public health specialist Binayak Sen and businessman Piyush Guha. Sanyal is among the 27 accused in the rifle loot case of November 11, 2005.         
	According to sources, the Raipur police, while collecting evidence against the trio, had visited Giridih and requested a report from the Giridih SP. Inspector Parmeshwar Shukla, then posted in Giridih, also appeared as a witness in the Binayak Sen case.         
	When Sanyal was arrested by Raipur police, we had put an application for his remand, but did not pursue his case. He was not in the original list of accused, but was named later, confided a police officer.        
	Ironically, Giridih SP Amol Homkar retrieved the file today after The Telegraph informed him about Sanyal being an accused in the rifle loot case and the police doing nothing to complete the trial.        
	DGP Neyaz Ahmed too, initially, maintained that there was no case pending against Sanyal in Jharkhand. He also said the special branch monitored the cases lodged against Maoists in the state. When reminded that a case was pending in Giridih, he promised to take up the issue with the special branch.        
	Armed Maoists had struck a home guard training centre at Mohanpur, barely 3km from Giridih town, and looted Rs 3 lakh in cash, 200 rifles and 2,000 rounds of cartridges on November 11, 2005.         
	The surprise attack lasted barely half an hour, left seven dead and a dozen injured. Most of the dead were home guard trainees and cadets, though officers said the company commander, too, had been shot. The incident took place three days before the Jehanabad jailbreak in which over 1,000 Maoists laid virtual siege to Jehanabad town on the night of November 13, 2005, and freed over 130 Naxalites incarcerated in the prison within seven hours.        
	Sanyal was arrested by the intelligence branch from Raipur on December 25, 2005.         
	The Giridih SP said he would send the investigating officer of the case to Raipur and speed up trial in the loot case.        
	Generally, the court allows remand to the police of other states after the cases lodged in a particular state is concluded, he said.        
	The SP said 10 of the 27 accused had been arrested and were in Giridih jail. They include Karamchand Murmu, Rameshwar Manjhi, Shanti alias Sheela, Jankipuri, Jagdush Turi, Nagoda, Bhagirathda and Mithilesh Mandal.

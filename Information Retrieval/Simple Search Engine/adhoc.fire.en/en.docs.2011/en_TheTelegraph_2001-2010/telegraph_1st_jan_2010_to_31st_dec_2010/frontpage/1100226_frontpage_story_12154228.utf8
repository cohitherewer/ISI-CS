          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Talks touch-up: Nirupama Rao in London on Monday and after the Delhi talks on Thursday. (AFP and PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: India today handed over three dossiers to Pakistan with a list of 34 wanted men, including two serving army officers and Lashkar-e-Toiba founder Hafiz Saeed, the man accused of masterminding the 26/11 attack.        
	The list also includes Indian Mujahideen militants and absconders from Indian law and Delhi has demanded that Islamabad either deport these men to India or allow Indian investigators to interrogate them.        
	We will look into all documents given to us, Pakistan foreign secretary Salman Bashir said.        
	The three dossiers follow the four India has already handed over to Pakistan since November 26, 2008, and Islamabad has promised to look into the documents seriously.        
	The first dossier submitted today focuses on the Mumbai attack and names eight men, including Saeed, who founded the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a front for the banned Lashkar.        
	The others include Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Abu Hamza, Abu Qama and Pakistan Army officer Major Iqbal, believed to be a pseudonym. India has said the officer was one of the handlers of the men who carried out the Mumbai attack.        
	 The FBI had gleaned these names from arrested Lashkar operative David Headley and shared these details with Indian investigators.        
	Of the eight, India has claimed that five were involved in the conspiracy while the rest were suspects.         
	The second dossier is on Ilyas Kashmiri, who recently claimed responsibility for the Pune bomb blast.        
	The FBI had intercepted email correspondence which shows Headley reported to Kashmiri, who was also the handler of Omar Sheikh, one of the men India released as part of a prisoner swap after the 1999 Kandahar hijack. Kashmiri is also believed to be an al Qaida commander.         
	The third dossier relates to militants who have found sanctuary in Pakistan. It lists 24 men  17 from the Indian Mujahideen and seven associated with the Khalistan Commando Force and the Babbar Khalsa International.         
	Of the 17 Indian Mujahideen men, five are Pakistani nationals. India wants Pakistan to deport these men. The dossier also mentions a Major Samir Ali as their handler.        
	It was pointed out that the Mumbai attack was a symptom of a larger problem  that of the continued existence and unhindered activities of organisations, such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Hizb-ul Mujahideen, etc., Indian foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said.        
	India also asked Pakistan to investigate the claims made by a hitherto unknown organisation, the Lashkar-e-Toiba Al Alami, owning responsibility for the Pune blast, Rao said.

	Ranchi, Oct. 18: Two Naxalite rebels were arrested from Chainpur police station area of Palamau today. Jharkhand Prastuti Committee leader Girivar Chaudhary and rebel Vijay Chaudhary had been on the run for a long time.        
	Acting on a tip off, a search team was sent to nab the two this morning. The entire operation took over two hours and a few rounds were fired from both sides. However, there were no casualties, said Palamau SP Anup T. Mathew, adding that there were six rebels present at the spot.         
	The gun battle took place near Chaudhasa village, around 180km from Ranchi. Some arms were recovered from the arrested duo.        
	We recovered 10 firearms and 39 bullets. This is the biggest arms seizure in Palamau till date, said Mathew. The two, who the police said were once associated with Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC), were being interrogated.        
	Earlier, they were frontline cadres in Maoist camps. However, their association with the TPC didnt last long. A few months ago, they looted arms and ammunition from TPC camps and set up their own group  the Jharkhand Prastuti Committee, said Mathew, adding that Girivar had unleashed a reign of terror in the region over the last few months.        
	He was wanted in eight cases in Palamau. Most cases are of murder, extortion and kidnapping, said Mathew.

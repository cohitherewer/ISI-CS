The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sponsor googly by Pak board

          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Sept.4: If high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasans very undiplomat-like statements havent been bad enough, the Pakistan Cricket Boards legal adviser, Tafazzul Rizvi, has queered the pitch even more for the tainted trio.        
	Late this evening, Rizvi, who is in London, told a TV channel back in Pakistan that Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer did take money from bookie Mazhar Majeed, but for sponsorship contracts!        
	When The Telegraph contacted him around 10.15pm (IST), to ask why the players hadnt cleared the air last Sunday itself, after the News of the World expose, Rizvi claimed he was in an important meeting and wouldnt be able to take calls for two-three hours.        
	According to an agency report, which quoted Rizvis interview to the TV channel, he made the following claims:        
	The trio, provisionally suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC), did take money from Majeed, but for sponsorship contracts. Their admission came during questioning by Scotland Yard;        
	Butt, Asif and Aamer showed written contracts to the investigators;        
	The players insisted they didnt know Majeed was a bookie.        
	Surely, nobody is going to be fooled by this sponsorship nonsense. In any case, it contradicts what Hasan said elsewhere today  that the cash, around 30,000 found in Test captain Butts hotel room in London, was for shopping in connection with the upcoming marriage of his sister.        
	Whats amusing is Hasan describing that sum as not much. Earlier reports had suggested the amount was as high as 50,000.        
	Even 30,000 is an extraordinary sum, especially in an increasingly cashless system, like the UK.        
	Clearly, the sane-headed in Pakistan must be wondering just how much help is actually being provided by the countrys high commissioner to the UK and the PCBs legal adviser.        
	Incidentally, on Hasans advice, the PCB has threatened to sue the ICC if the trio get cleared of all charges.

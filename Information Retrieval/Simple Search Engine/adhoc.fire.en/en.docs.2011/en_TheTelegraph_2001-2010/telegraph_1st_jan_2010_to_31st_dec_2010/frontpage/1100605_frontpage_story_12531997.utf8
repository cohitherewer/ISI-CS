The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Builder lands Pawar in IPL fix
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Builder lands Pawar in IPL fix
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 4: Aniruddha Deshpande, the managing director of a construction company in which Sharad Pawar and his family have a stake and which unsuccessfully bid for an IPL team, is among a clutch of powerful builders said to be close to the politician.         
	The Pawars  the agriculture minister, his wife Pratibha and daughter Supriya Sule  own 16 per cent of the shares of City Corporation Ltd through a couple of family-owned companies. City Corp, of which Deshpande is boss, had vied for a franchise at the March auction but emerged fifth in the race.         
	The revelation has pushed the Pawars to a corner as the family never disclosed that it had a stake in a firm that took part in the franchise race.        
	In Pune, Deshpande claimed the Pawar family had no link with the bid. The director and shareholders of the company allowed me to bid in an individual capacity. The Pawar family has nothing to do with the bid, he said.        
	The builder owns Torna Tigers, a team in the Maharashtra Premier League, a T20 tournament being organised by the Maharashtra Cricket Association in Pune since 2009.         
	Asked why he used the company name if it was an individual bid, Deshpande said: By the time the board meeting took place, I had bought the bid document using a company letterhead. We had told the IPL that we would form a consortium if our bid was successful. But we lost the bid.         
	Deshpande said he had spoken to Pawar before bidding, though the minister is not a director in the company. He said if you are making an individual bid, he had no objections, the builder said.        
	Sources in Pune said the 44-year-old Deshpande was among a few prominent Pune real estate magnates known to be close to Pawar. Hailing from a family of doctors, the bearded Deshpande is also a racing enthusiast.         
	Eyebrows were raised when Deshpandes name figured among the stakeholders of Lavasa, a hill station city project in Lonavala promoted by Hindustan Construction Companys Ajit Gulabchand, but he sold his stake.         
	In a project uncannily similar to Lavasa, he set up Amanora Park Town, a lakeside township of 35 towers sprawling over 400 acres near Hadapsar in Pune.

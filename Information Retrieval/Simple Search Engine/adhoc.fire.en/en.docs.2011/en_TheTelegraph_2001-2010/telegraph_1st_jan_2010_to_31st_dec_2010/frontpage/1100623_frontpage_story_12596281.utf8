  - France crash out, Englands Capello faces do-or-die          
	Fabio Capello was asked: You have achieved so much in your career as a player and yet as manager, you have never taken a team as coach to a World Cup: What do you expect and how are you preparing?        
	Capello, sitting comfortably in a quiet corner of an empty conference room in the Wembley Stadium complex, shrugged slightly and responded with all the confidence one would have expected.        
	Of course, he said, a World Cup itself is not a new experience because I was there as a player.        
	Then he explained how his own and the Football Associations backroom staff were studying all the options, all the possibilities, and working as hard as were the players. He also said, with unfortunately accurate hindsight: Sometimes, you know, players can find every excuse possible this wasnt good, that wasnt good, I cant sleep, the pitch is a problem, the hotel waiter, etc.        
	This writer is not reporting the question and answer at second-hand or having researched it elsewhere: this writer put the question and noted Capellos answer.         
	Now, as England face a do-or-die date with Group C leaders Slovenia on Wednesday, the awful truth is that Capello was guilty of either mistaken complacency or over-confidence from having been there as a player.                  South Africa rsquo;s coach Carlos Alberto Parreira (left) speaks to France rsquo;s Raymond Domenech at the end of the match on Tuesday. It later emerged that Domenech refused to shake hands with Parreira. Host South Africa and France were both knocked out of the World Cup. (AFP picture)      
	Perhaps he underestimated the differences between the World Cup of 1974 and the World Cup of today. In 1974, he played in all three of Italys matches  the 3-1 win over Haiti, 1-1 draw with Argentina and 2-1 defeat by Poland.         
	He even scored Italys late goal in the defeat by Poland which put them on an early flight home.        
	But that was a World Cup in a different world, when football was about mere sport and not about dipping into the billion-dollar treasure trove provided by sponsors and television or about over paid whingers and their WAGs.        
	Capello did a thoroughly professional job restoring Englands pride and player motivation and discipline and leading them into the finals. But, out of his competitive comfort zone, Capello appeared to lose his way.        
	His warm-up, match preparatory work, player assessment and squad selection betrayed managerial naivety. His Italian-type ritiro (a training camp, that is, one closed to outsiders) plans apparently left the players bored and resentful and proved a breeding ground for grumbles (notoriously now from John Terry) provoked by the furious  and justified  criticism among media and fans of two awful performances, against the United States and Algeria.        
	Of course, Capello is not the only culprit: some of the most talented and highly paid but over-hyped players in the history of Englands football were the ones who went out on the pitch and performed like rabbits caught in an international spotlight.        
	Their great fortune is that, against Slovenia, they all have a chance of redemption.        
	The equation is not complex stuff to puzzle an Einstein. Its perfectly simple: Victory equals England going forward into the second round with everything forgiven. Defeat equals the players losing much of their career kudos and Capello losing his job.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Amar vs Mulayam family
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Amar vs Mulayam family
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Amar Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: Amar Singh, the Burrabazar boy who became an irrepressible gadfly ostensibly capable of saving governments from collapse, today carried out his threat of making himself politically dispensable to his party.        
	Amar, who had announced the intention in a recent blog, today quit his posts of Samajwadi Party general secretary, spokesperson and parliamentary board member  faxing his resignations from Dubai where he is vacationing with his family.        
	Amar, who has kept his Rajya Sabha and Samajwadi memberships, had quit these party posts thrice earlier but each time let his boss Mulayam Singh Yadav change his mind. As his critics sniffed another drama, Amar insisted that this time he would not listen to Mulayam even if it means disobedience.        
	Sources said the trigger was personal and political. Amar was upset with Mulayams cousin and Rajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav for publicly ticking him off after he had blamed the Firozabad bypoll defeat to the party chiefs over-confidence in fielding his daughter-in-law. Ram Gopal had accused Amar of crossing the limit.        
	Amar aides felt Ram Gopal could not have openly berated him without tacit backing from the top  not from Mulayam but perhaps from his son and political heir Akhilesh. Asked if the party would accept Amars resignations, Akhilesh said: (Mulayam) will take a call tomorrow. He is consulting seniors. Amar Singh will always remain an uncle to me. In politics, there are other considerations too.        
	It appears Mulayam is keen to get former confidant Azam Khan back in the party. Khan had left over differences with Amar and said he would not return till Amar was out. Khans return is crucial to Mulayam reclaiming lost Muslim votes.        
	However, a game-changing factor could be tomorrows legislative council polls, where 36 posts are up for grabs. The Samajwadis held 27 of these. Mulayam has asked Ram Gopal and Akhilesh to micro-manage the exercise, and their failure could raise Amars stock again.        
	Many party old-timers had resented the rise of Amar, an industrialist with celebrity friends, and dubbed him a wheeler-dealer living off the party. The likes of Khan, Raj Babbar and Beni Prasad Verma quit because of Amar, hurting the party electorally.         
	But Amar, with his connections and negotiating skills, had also lifted the regional, caste-based outfit from the heartlands boondocks to the national scene as a serious player.

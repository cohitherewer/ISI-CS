  - Arunachal teacher braves fear to find plane remains        ATONU CHOUDHURRI                            The metal plate from the aircraft. (Telegraph pictures)                                         
	Itanagar, June 20: A village schoolteachers personal challenge to his clans fear of the unknown has led him to the wreckage of a World War II aircraft on a perilous wooded hill in Arunachal Pradesh.        
	Tani Bagang, 28, had heard legendary tales of how sightings of arre  mystery object in the Nyishi language  on the hill would scare off his ancestors. Ten days ago, he decided to see it for himself.        
	Braving snakes and poor weather, he trekked alone for seven days, losing his way once in the remote hill forests, before stumbling on mangled pieces of metal. A little further down, where the hill sloped towards a gorge, he lifted a veil of foliage to find a metal plate. A skeleton and four-inch bullets lay nearby.        
	The inscription on the plate said: ST 95T6 BLACK HAWK 7.26.1943SPMCO. The schoolteacher realised he may have discovered the wreckage of a WWII aircraft that probably crash-landed at the spot.        
	My grandfather and father would tell me about a mysterious object that had scared them all their life. A hunter from our locality, Kasee Bagang, once sighted the wreckage from a distance but could never gather the courage to come closer, Bagang told The Telegraph over the phone from Seppa, district headquarters of East Kameng.        
	My family tried to dissuade me from visiting this remote site, infested with snakes and wild animals, but I made up my mind after performing rituals to ward off evil on June 10. I spotted the broken metal parts on June 17.        
	He carried the plate, bullets and the bones down with him and showed them to district planning officer Vijay Sonam. The skeleton has been sent for a DNA test.        
	It appears to be the wreckage of a WWII fighter that may have been lost during an operation. Another skeleton, and fragments of a pair of jeans, was found in nearby Yangfo village way back in the 1950s. We believe it was the skeleton of a second person who was on the fighter aircraft, Sonam said.        
	Army officials from 5 Mountain Brigade at Tenga, West Kameng, have summoned Bagang to ask about the plane.        
	In 2007, villagers in East Siang district had found the wreckage of a US aircraft, B-24J, nicknamed Hot As Hell, that had crashed on January 25, 1944.         
	Several other crashed US fighters have been found in Dibang Valley, Papum Pare and Lohit districts over the past few years.        
	More than 430 aircraft and hundreds of crewmen of the US air force went missing in the forests of Arunachal during WWII.        
	Last year, a US government team visited East Siang and West Siang to prepare the ground for the excavation of known crash sites in the state.

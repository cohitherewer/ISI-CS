          RASHEED KIDWAI                       A man prays at a mosque in Ayodha on Friday (AFP)                                
	Oct. 1: Familiar voices among the minority community expressed unhappiness at the Ayodhya verdict but many clerics across the country took a leaf out of Prophet Mohammeds life to advocate tolerance and patience at Friday prayers.        
	A 10-member legal team of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) will meet in Delhi on October 9 to study in detail the Allahabad High Court verdict. This will be followed by a meeting of the 51-member executive committee on October 16 to discuss future strategy, said Maulana Abdul Rahim Qureshi, the boards secretary.        
	Board insiders said they were awaiting some response from the Union government and the Congress, which feels an adverse reaction to the verdict will affect the partys prospects in the upcoming Bihar elections.        
	So far, there has been no contact, which has prompted some board members to wonder if the UPA is considering a hands-off policy and preferring to wait for a Supreme Court verdict.        
	Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh today tiptoed around the subject, advocating the need for consensus but not committing if or when the government would take the initiative to bring all sides to the negotiating table. ( )        
	The younger elements within the AIMPLB want Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to play arbitrator. In their scheme of things, the loss of Babri can be compensated with barabri (equal opportunity) or bhagidari (participation) in national life.        
	This section is of the opinion that a process of conciliation should precede the Supreme Courts final observations. They feel a socio-economic development package for the community, a display of resolve to crack down hard on vandalism of places of worship, ensuring a greater sense of security, and a written undertaking from the VHP could help the clergy offer a spectacular goodwill gesture towards the construction of a grand temple in Ayodhya.        
	A band of young Shia Muslims, grouped in an outfit called Hussaini Tigers, today requested the AIMPLB to let the matter end here and offered to donate Rs 15 lakh to facilitate the construction of the temple. The group, one of whose patrons is an AIMPLB member, asked the VHP to reciprocate the gesture and support the construction of a mosque on the land set aside for the Sunni wakf board.        
	Such voices may be straws in the wind now but others too broadly echoed similar sentiments.        
	During the Friday sermons, some imams cited the Hudaibiya treaty dating back to the early period of Islam when Prophet Mohammed signed a treaty with the opposing non-Muslim Quraish. Along with his followers, Mohammad had gone from Madina to Mecca to perform the Haj. But he was stopped at a place called Hudaibiya by the Quraish.        
	Amid opposition from his close associates, the Prophet agreed to return to Madina and come back the next year for the Haj, avoiding confrontation and bloodshed.        
	The incident figures on the Ayodhya verdict, too. One of the three judges, S.U. Khan, wrote: When Prophet Mohammed entered into a treaty with the rival group at Hudaibiya, it appeared to be abject surrender even to his staunch supporters. However, the Quran described that as a clear victory and it did prove so. Within a short span, Muslims entered Mecca as victors, and not a drop of blood was shed.        
	In Lucknow, the naib imam of the Idgah, Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangimahli, referred to the need for an out-of-court settlement. Firangimahli, who is in his late 30s, said that before rushing to the Supreme Court, the religious leaders from the two communities should sit together and give peace a chance.        
	But the imam of Jama Masjid, Delhi, Syed Ahmad Bukhari, could not hide his disappointment. We are unhappy with the court verdict, Bukhari said, adding that it had turned out to be a compromise and partition suit rather than a title suit.        
	Another hardliner, Syed Shahabuddin, continued to oppose the high court judgment, pointing out that it ignored the fact that the Supreme Court order of 1994 had treated the disputed site as one entity and had not envisaged any division.        
	In Delhi, the Friday prayers passed peacefully and business went on as usual at Chandni Chowk. Its a new day today and we are more concerned about supporting our families rather than other issues, said Md Aslam, who sells chicken rolls.                    WITH INPUTS FROM IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

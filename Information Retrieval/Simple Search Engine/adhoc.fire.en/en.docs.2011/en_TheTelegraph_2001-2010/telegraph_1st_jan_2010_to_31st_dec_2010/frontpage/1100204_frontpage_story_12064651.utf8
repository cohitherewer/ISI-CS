	Timergara (Pakistan) Feb. 3 (Reuters): A bomb planted outside a girls school killed three US soldiers in northwest Pakistan today, the army said.        
	Three children and a Pakistani paramilitary soldier were also killed and 45 people were wounded in the blast near Swat Valley, where the government mounted a crackdown nearly a year ago it said had cleared out al Qaida-linked Taliban.        
	The blast, triggered by a remote-controlled device, was a grim reminder of the resilience of Taliban militants determined to topple the government of President Asif Ali Zardari, a deeply unpopular pro-American leader.        
	Pakistans Taliban have bombed markets, schools and military and police facilities despite major government security crackdowns that have destroyed some of their bases and US drone aircraft attacks that have killed their leaders.        
	The three US soldiers were part of a small unit that trains Pakistani Frontier Corps responsible for security in northwestern areas near the Afghan border seen as part of a global militant hub.         
	After todays attack which left a crater outside the school, an elderly man walked through the destruction holding a pile of books as soldiers stood by.        
	Resident of the town of Timergara tried to rescue school girls in blue uniform trapped below rubble. Others helped carry away the wounded.        
	Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi condemned todays bombing in the district of Lower Dir. He said terrorism will never be allowed to succeed in its nefarious designs.        
	US drone strikes in northwest Pakistan have intensified since the attack on the CIA in Afghanistan, but analysts say they are unlikely to pose a long-term danger to the Taliban, who seem to carry out suicide bombings at will.        
	The death toll from drone attacks last night  the heaviest ever in terms of the number of missiles fired  has risen to 31.

	Ranchi, May 17: BJP leader Arjun Munda is trying his best to get the JMM on board to hammer out an amicable solution to the 20-day political crisis facing the state government, but Shibu Soren is proving to be a tough cookie by playing his cards close to his chest.        
	Munda spent the day holding a series of meetings with Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto and Speaker C.P. Singh and also spoke to BJP as well as JMM MLAs to find a way out of the impasse.        
	He also held a closed-door meeting with his partys organisational secretary, Saudan Singh, Jharkhand in-charge Karuna Shukla and other office bearers. Earlier in the day, state BJP chief Raghubar Das also met Shukla.         
	According to high-level sources, the BJP was ready to accede to the JMMs demand for a rotational chief minister provided it got the first shot at the chair. But, the JMM, it seemed, was opposed to this, insisting that Soren be allowed to continue as chief minister.        
	We want the JMM to lead the government for the first 28 months for the sake of stability and continuity, said Vinod Pandey, a member of the partys core committee, set up to take policy decisions in case of political exigencies.        
	Munda wouldnt admit the difficult nature of his assignment, claiming to The Telegraph instead that his talks were positive and that a solution was in sight. Guruji, too, was positive, he claimed.        
	 For a moment though the BJP thought it was all over when word spread that Governor M..H. Farook had met advocate-general R.S. Mazumdar, sparking speculation that Presidents rule was imminent in the state.                                            
	The governor is understood to have discussed his constitutional duties under the present circumstances, but Mazumdar denied that politics was discussed. It was a general discussion, he added.         
	Shukla said that Munda had been asked to work out a formula with the JMM to run the government. But she clarified that the BJP wont wait till June 29 for Soren to step down.         
	I believe the imbroglio will be over in a day or two, she asserted.        
	However, a key BJP negotiator said that the JMMs inner contradictions were holding back a solution.         
	Soren, apparently oblivious of the BJP-led brainstorming sessions, attended office today and cleared files for around three hours from 11 am to 2 pm. He seemed relaxed not worried at all, said an aide.         
	The JMM was waiting for a final word from Soren. He had assured the partys core committee of arriving at a decision by Monday. But he has not given any signal to step down, said a source close to Guruji.        
	Asked for a comment, Seraikela MLA Champai Soren said like everyone else he too was waiting for Gurujis decision. We have nothing to say when we have authorised him to take a final call, he added.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Attack on hill MLA house 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Darjeeling, Feb 18: The house of the GNLF MLA from Kurseong, Shanta Chhetri, was set on fire today after violence spread in parts of the Darjeeling hills during the 24-hour strike called by the Vidyarthi Morcha.         
	The immediate trigger was the arrest of 77 Gorkhaland supporters in Siliguri for blocking NH55 and NH31 early in the morning. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has blamed the violence on agitating public and various elements that may have taken advantage of it.         
	Shortly after 10am, a mob went on the rampage in Kurseong, attacking the police station there with stones and setting on fire three police vehicles and damaging five others.        
	The residences of S. K. Pradhan, president of the ABGLs Kurseong subdivision, and Palden Bhutia, a former commissioner of Ward 19 of the Kurseong municipality who had won on a GNLF ticket, were ransacked.        
	The Morcha has withdrawn the 12-hour strike called tomorrow to condemn the Shilda massacre. But everything will remain shut between 10am and noon when we will be holding condolence meetings in memory of the slain EFR jawans all over the hills tomorrow, said Amar Lama, a Morcha central committee member.         
	The hills turned volatile in the morning after news filtered in that 23 students picketing at Darjeeling More in Siliguri had been picked up around 7am. The students immediately started demonstrating in front of police stations across the hills, demanding the release of the arrested persons in Siliguri.         
	Reports of the police picking up another 70 picketers from Salugara near Siliguri and Malbazar in Jalpaiguri district in the Dooars added to the tension.                     
	 One police vehicle was completely damaged and four private vehicles which were seized by the police and parked on the police station compound were also damaged, said a witness in Kurseong.         
	Later, the mob targeted the MLAs house on Dow Hill Road. Since my husband is very ill I was at the hospital. My son and daughter-in-law too, had come to the hospital with his lunch when my house was torched. I have not opposed the statehood demand. Why are they targeting me even now? said the MLA, blaming the Morcha without naming them.         
	I have informed all the top police officers about the incident. However, the police cannot even venture out leave alone arrest people, alleged Shanta Chhetri.         
	Darjeeling police chief D.P. Singh admitted that government vehicles were not being allowed to ply. Whenever we are venturing out the vehicles are being stopped. We are initiating cases against those obstructing us. In the Kurseong incident, we are in the process of identifying specific people and we will initiate specific cases against them, Singh said.         
	With one his party leaders having been targeted, ABGL president Madan Tamang alleged that the Morcha was behind the attack on orders of the state government. The Morcha is now trying to threaten the common people under instructions from the state government as they are ready to settle for a council, alleged Tamang.         
	The Morcha has denied its involvement in the violence. We are trying to get a proper report on the incident. The public might have been agitated and various elements, too, might have taken advantage of the situation. Nevertheless, the party does not believe in violence and we strongly condemn such acts, said Harka Bahadur Chhetri, a Morcha spokesperson.        
	Kismat Chhetri, president of the party student front, the Vidyarthi Morcha, too denied its members hand in the violence. Anti-people forces might have taken advantage of the situation. However, we strongly protest the abusive language used by K.L. Tamta, inspector-general of police, north Bengal, and we are now determined not to let the officer enter the hills at any cost.         
	In Siliguri, Tamta blamed the Kurseong police for not being able to protect the police station building and the vehicles. The officers and the men present there should have prevented the attack and protected government property. I have asked the additional police superintendent to conduct an inquiry, extra forces are being sent to Kurseong, Tamta said.

  - Minister becomes a punching bag for punchlines           ANANYA SENGUPTA                                                     
	New Delhi, April 17: Old proverb made new for Shashi Tharoor: those who thrive on Twitter, get thrashed on Twitter.        
	The junior foreign minister was back tweeting last night after a gap, thanking new India for all its support amp; good wishes.         
	This is the sort of support he has been getting: An aquarium is about aqua, planetariums are about planets. So now we know what Consort-ium is about, smirks a message going around the country.        
	If that sounds a little naughty, how about some serious stuff?        
	The first big success of UPA2 is the evidence that there is growth with equity, goes a chain text, exploiting a Manmohan Singh government catch-phrase to take a dig at the free equity given to Sunanda Pushkar in the Kochi IPL franchise.        
	If Tharoors invocation of new India was meant to draw sympathy for a new-age politician being martyred by old-style power-brokers, he seems to be receiving little of it, at least from the new India that swears by text and tweet.        
	From aqua to equity, many of the jokes were apparently circulated by politicians, getting their own back after being at the receiving end of Tharoors tweets for months.        
	Other jokes were less subtle, such as a tweet that dipped into Bollywoods evergreen repertoire of songs:        
	Shashi Tharoor b4: Main baarish kar doon paise ki bas kochi ho jae meri (Ill rain money to win Kochi)        
	Shashi Tharoor now: Ye kya hua, kaise hua, kab hua, kyun hua         
	The first part is a parody of the Paisa song in De Dana Dan, the second a line from a Kishore Kumar hit in Amar Prem.                    
	Jokes  
	If Tharoor is offended that a man with over 715,000 followers on Twitter can be treated so shabbily on the networking site, he may turn to a passage in one of his own books for consolation.  
	When rivals fling jokes at each other it means that there is no turning back. Between opponents who will not physically fight, a punchline is equivalent to a punch, he wrote in his The Great Indian Novel.        
	The punches are being thrown even on the airwaves. A question on a popular radio channel: Whats Sunanda Pushkars favourite song?        
	Pat comes the answer in the nasal tone of Himesh Reshammiya: Tera tera tera Tharoooooooor with the radio jockey bursting into peals of laughter at this take-off of a song from Aap Kaa Surroor.        
	If surroor sounds dangerously like a coinage from Su-nanda and Tha-roor, thats a mere coincidence.        
	Most of the jokes, however, hide behind the anonymity of chain messages, whose origin is not easy to pin down. The Indian media has largely shied away from targeting politicians private lives --- just think of the blander and kinder fare served by desi talk-show hosts compared with their US counterparts who left little to the imagination after the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair.        
	So what might an Indian Jay Leno offer on Kochigate? Perhaps a question to Sunanda why she was dating a still-married man, to which she replies: After all, he is the minister for external affairs.        
	Alas, even this is taken.        
	US actress Shirley MacLaine had given just this answer in the late 70s when she was asked about her unabashed affair with the young Australian foreign minister, Andrew Peacock.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chief first, not Cong election

          SANJAY K. JHA                                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: For all the talk of internal democracy, the Congress high command has been discouraging contests for the posts of state unit chiefs.        
	Sonia Gandhi is expected to nominate almost all the state presidents, and those who want to contest an election are being firmly told to accept the high commands choice.        
	Party sources said most states would pass a one-line resolution by September-end authorising Sonia to appoint their Pradesh Congress Committee presidents. There is strong opposition to the sitting PCC president in many of the important states, but the dissidents have not been allowed to force a contest.        
	Many leaders were ready to oppose (Uttar Pradesh) Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi, but we were told not to create a situation where an election becomes a must, a party official from the state said.        
	The high command spoke to the various leaders to evolve a consensus. Now we shall pass a one-line resolution on Monday authorising Soniaji to nominate the new president. Anybody who wishes to have an elected president after that will face disciplinary action.        
	Even Digvijay Singh, the Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, wanted a change of guard and many senior leaders were planning to force a contest, sources said.         
	Demands for elections came from many other states too, especially those where the PCC presidents are unpopular or have completed their terms. Delhi, for instance, wanted a change through an election but was denied by the high command.        
	Senior leaders say they want to avoid elections to minimise internal rivalry and bitterness. They also argue that an elected president may not be the best president since candidates with money and muscle power tend to be successful even in party elections.        
	The high command wants to pick PCC presidents keeping larger political and organisational goals in mind, but an election turns only on numbers, sources argued.        
	For instance, it might be difficult for Sonia to ensure a victory in Bihar for Mehboob Ali Kaiser, whose chief qualification is his religion, or to make sure that no Mamata baiter replaces Manas Bhuniya in the top post in Bengal.         
	Similarly, a Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a Brahmin, is important in the Congresss scheme of things: the high command does not want to put all its eggs in Digvijays basket.         
	The same logic seems to apply to the working committee despite the manoeuvrability available to the Congress president in that case: the party constitution allows 12 CWC members to be nominated. Sonia, however, has been nominating the entire lot of 24.         
	Senior leaders justify this, arguing the party chief has the right to build a team of her choice, ensuring the presence of minorities, Dalits, OBCs and women.

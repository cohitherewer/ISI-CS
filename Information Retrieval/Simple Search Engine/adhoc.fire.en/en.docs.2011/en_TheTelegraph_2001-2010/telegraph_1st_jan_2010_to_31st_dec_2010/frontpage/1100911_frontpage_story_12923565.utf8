  - MCI approval needed for courses        BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The IIT council, the apex decision-making body of the tech schools, today granted them permission to teach medicine but they need the approval of the Medical Council of India (MCI).        
	The announcement settles a year-long debate over whether national institutions of importance such as IITs need clearance from councils monitoring a specific field when the institutes step into unfamiliar territory.        
	The council, headed by HRD minister Kapil Sibal, said the institutes would have to seek the approval of the Medical Council of India to offer degrees for the practice of medicine. But they can launch inter-disciplinary courses involving medicine and engineering on their own.        
	IITs can start degrees like MBBS, MD etc for practice of medicine with approval from the MCI. If the degree is not aimed at practice of medicine, the IITs themselves can start such inter-disciplinary programmes, Sibal said after the meeting. The IIT Act of 1961 will have to be amended to include medicine as a subject to be taught in the institutes.        
	IIT Kharagpur has already proposed to start a medical institution in collaboration with Indian Railways, which will offer courses for MBBS, MD, MS and PhD degrees.        
	The issue has been hanging fire for the past year because of divergent views within different ministries. Earlier this year, the HRD ministry had suggested that since the IITs are institutions of national importance, they need not go through the MCI to start courses in medical education. However, the health and the law ministries opposed this.        
	The law ministry said the IITs had established themselves in engineering education but should not be given the status of top medical schools AIIMS and PGIMER, which do not need the MCIs approval to start courses. The health ministry also said the IITs can start courses in medicine if they meet the criteria laid down by the MCI, which governs medical education in the country.        
	For inter-disciplinary courses in bio-technology, bio-engineering and e-health, however, the IITs will not need the MCIs approval.        
	IIT Kharagpur says its medical courses will be unique programmes that will bring medicine and engineering together and produce doctors with high knowledge of mathematics, simulation, animation and engineering. They will be able to design low-cost technology for health care and deliver cheaper health care.         
	While teaching physiology, there is a requirement of models, animators and simulators. The idea is to develop a new health care delivery system. The cost of medical tests is too high these days that patients cannot afford. The students at the proposed medical college will get knowledge in engineering which they can utilise to develop low-cost equipment, an IIT Kharagpur official said.        
	Medical education and research in technology are going hand in hand in all developed countries and in most developing countries, the official said. He gave the example of Johns Hopkins University, Imperial College London and Harvard Medical School, which have brought together the medical and engineering disciplines.        
	The official said the proposed medical colleges will start a medical outreach programme to provide health care advice in villages through a cellular phone network. For small ailments, patients can consult doctors over the network.

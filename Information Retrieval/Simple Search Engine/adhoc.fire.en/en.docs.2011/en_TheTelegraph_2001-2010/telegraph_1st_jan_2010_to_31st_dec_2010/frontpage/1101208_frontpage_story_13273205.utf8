The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Raja name in judges letter
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Raja name in judges letter
  - Lawyer who approached Justice with phone suspended           G.C. SHEKHAR                            Regupathi (top) and Raja                                
	Chennai, Dec. 7: A retired high court judge has said he was told by a lawyer that a Union minister by name A. Raja was at the other end of a phone line and wanted to influence him in a forgery case but he did not take the call.        
	Justice R. Regupathis letter, the existence of which was denied by the then Chief Justice of India but has now been made public as part of a court order, resolves a riddle left behind last year when the judge made the disclosure about the attempt to fix a bail order without revealing the ministers identity.        
	Since Justice Regupathi did not take the call, it will be difficult to prove if Raja, who resigned in the wake of the 2G spectrum controversy, was indeed on the line.         
	But Madras High Court today lent some credence to the overall charge by suspending the lawyer, K. Chandramohan, from the post of chairman of the Tamil Nadu Bar Council as well as the bar.         
	Justice Regupathi has said in the letter that Chandramohan had walked into the judges chamber in June 2009 and handed him a mobile phone saying that Union minister A. Raja wanted to talk to the judge.        
	Though a contempt of the court has also been committed by Chandramohan, we are not acting on it now since we have already given directions about his membership in the bar, the high court said in a 78-page order.         
	Reacting to the order, Raja told a TV channel that he had never spoken to any judge or tried to influence the judiciary and had nothing to say on the action against Chandramohan. A lawyer from Tiruchy, Chandramohan had become close to Raja, also a lawyer, when the two had practised there.                     
	The high courts action followed a writ petition filed against Chandramohan by Elephant G. Rajendran, a lawyer and social activist whose legal crusade to remove encroachments from the elephant corridors of the Nilgiris earned him the prefix.        
	Rajendran alleged that Chandramohan had attempted to interfere with the administration of justice and had committed contempt of court for which he had to be debarred from legal practice.         
	Rajendran had wanted the court to proceed against Chandramohan based on the letter written by Justice Regupathi to the then Chief Justice of Madras High Court, H.L. Gokhale, in July 2009. The contents were revealed today as the letter formed part of the orders issued by Justices Ibrahim Kalifullah and M.M. Sundresh.        
	Justice Regupathi had told Chandramohan in an open court on June 29, 2009, that he had tried to influence his judgment by getting a Union minister to talk to him after the two had exchanged words over the bail plea.        
	 Justice Regupathi then declared that he was writing to the registry seeking transfer of the case to another judge.         
	In his letter to the chief justice, Regupathi said Chandramohan had come to his chamber on June 12 and he said two persons who are father and son/accused in a criminal case are family friends of a Union minister by name A. Raja and that the petition filed by them for anticipatory bail must be considered favourably.         
	Simultaneously he handed over his mobile phone by saying that the Union minister is on the line to have a talk with me, right away. I discouraged such conduct of Mr. Chandramohan and told him that the case would be disposed of in accordance with law.         
	Chandramohan was seeking anticipatory bail for one Dr C. Krishnamurthy and his son Kirubha Sridhar, who were accused by the CBI in a forgery case. They were accused of attempting to forge the mark sheets of Sridhar after he failed in the entrance test to Pondicherry Medical University.         
	According to AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, Krishnamurthy had promoted a real estate company as the benami of Raja.        
	The then Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan, when asked by reporters in Chennai about the Regupathi incident, had said that no such incident had taken place. Justice Gokhale, who was with him, had also denied that Regupathi had written to him about the incident.

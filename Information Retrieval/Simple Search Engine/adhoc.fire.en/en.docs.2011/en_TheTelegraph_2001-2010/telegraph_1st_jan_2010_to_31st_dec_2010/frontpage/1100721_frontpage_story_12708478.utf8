          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, July 20: The Union home ministry has undergone a quiet voice change after the cross-border cacophony over the past week.        
	The additional secretary (Naxalite management) will interact with the media from now, apparently in the wake of a directive to the home ministry to restructure the current mechanism.         
	The directive could be interpreted as an indirect gag order on the Union home ministry, which, the foreign policy establishment felt, was stepping into its turf. The latest flashpoint was Union home secretary G.K. Pillais comments on the eve of the foreign minister-level talks in Islamabad, which gave Pakistan an opportunity to sling barbs.        
	Such a directive to the home ministry can normally be issued only by the Prime Ministers Office. It was known that the foreign policy establishment, responsible for implementing Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs peace initiative, was not happy with the timing of Pillais remarks, although some feel the home secretary would not have made the comments unilaterally.        
	Few in the government dispute the content of Pillais remarks  that the ISI had a role in the Mumbai attacks  but many feel that such a comment could have been avoided when Pakistan was hosting an Indian minister. Also, the foreign policy establishment feels that issues involving David Headley  Pillais comments were based on the outcome of the militants interrogation  are its preserve.        
	 National security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon today more or less echoed Pillai but the context was different. Menon was addressing a seminar in Delhi and his comments complemented US secretary of state Hillary Clintons jab at Pakistan on Osama bin Laden from Kabul, where foreign minister S.M. Krishna was also present. ( )        
	The usually forthcoming Pillai was reticent today. He directed questions from journalists to D.R.S. Chaudhary, the designated official. Considered media-shy, Chaudhary replaces additional director-general (media) Onkar Kedia, who is on leave now.        
	Other sources said the shift in the home ministry need not be the upshot of just one incident and reflected the absence of an overarching public relations outlet dealing with security issues.        
	 The home ministry had been in the news without break over Maoists and the Manipur stand-off, and sections of the Congress had been advocating a more circumspect approach. These sources felt that the bureaucratic change was part of a political step to balance voices.

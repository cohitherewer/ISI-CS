          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Cecelia Guriya at Ranchi SSPs office. (Hardeep Singh)                                   
	Ranchi, Oct. 27: It was a tip-off that demanded attention. When the police intercepted a shuttle taxi ferrying passengers between Ranchi and Khunti late last evening at Satranji, about 15km from the state capital, they knew they had their prize catch. Among the passengers was 22-year-old Cecelia Guriya, said to be the love of dreaded Maoist commander Kundan Pahans life.        
	Cecelia, who is also known as Rupa and Monica Dang, was arrested with 30 rounds of ammunition and a letter from CPI(Maoist) politburo member Amitabh Bagchi. She was produced in court today and forwarded to judicial custody.         
	Senior superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said Cecelia, who had been living in a rented house at Bahu Bazar for the last three months, was assigned the task of helping Maoists get proper medical treatment in city hospitals. She was also responsible for receiving Maoist leaders coming from different parts of the country for organisational work in the state.        
	She hailed from Pinding in Khunti and joined the Maoist fold seven years ago. She trained at Saranda and then worked with Maoist sub-zonal commander Prasadji in Rania. When Pahan met and fell in love with her, she was sent to work in Bundu-Tamar in January. He then sent her for computer training at an institute in Khunti to make her a member of the Maoists technical cell, Kumar said.         
	Asked about the bullets, he said Cecelia was taking them to Pahan for test-firing.

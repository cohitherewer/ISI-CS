The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Yeddy turns graft gun on BJP
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Yeddy turns graft gun on BJP
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Yeddyurappa                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The BJP leadership today decided to allow B.S. Yeddyurappa to stay on as Karnataka chief minister till a judicial probe he had ordered into questionable land transactions was done.        
	There is no chargesheet against him, no CAG report implicating him. Unless we have foolproof evidence against him, we cannot act, a source close to BJP president Nitin Gadkari told The Telegraph.        
	Gadkari told reporters after a late-night meeting that a formal announcement on Yeddyurappa would be made tomorrow morning.        
	The CM is safe, now and for the rest of his term, one of Yeddyurappas aides said, as central leaders pondered how to tackle the Centres refusal to order a JPC probe into the spectrum scam and an Opposition splintered by the Karnataka issue.        
	Sources said the breather  as BJP detractors called it  was secured on the chief ministers terms, and not because of the leaderships magnanimity.        
	In his meetings with Gadkari and Rajya Sabha Opposition leader Arun Jaitley held over yesterday and today, Yeddyurappa, said two of his close aides, hammered home the following points:        
	 If he went, the Karnataka government went too. He made it clear he was accountable to the people who elected him. If he had to prove his innocence, he would do it before them, an aide said. The veiled threat of Assembly dissolution, which implied fresh elections, rattled the leaders.        
	These people are fighting a limited battle inside Parliament. They are in the Opposition and unlikely to come to power in the near future. So, what are the stakes for them when compared to the stakes involved in keeping a government that is the BJPs first government in the south? asked an aide.        
	 Yeddyurappa went armed with documents and dossiers to prove that it was unfair to single him out on corruption charges.         
	According to his aides, he told Gadkari that if he was accused of creaming off Rs 40 or 50 crore through the alleged land deals, others in his government would be raking in that amount in a day. He said such persons ought to be investigated too, and if an inquiry was on, they should         
	be sacked until their innocence or culpability was established.        
	The chief minister also claimed he had evidence that allegedly implicated two central leaders with interests in the mining business.        
	He said since the Delhi bosses feared the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) might sustain their campaign against him, he also possessed evidence to prove that two former Congress chief ministers had allocated land to their relatives by flouting rules.

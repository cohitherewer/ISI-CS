  - Computer CAT to spell it out for the best and brightest          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            Back to the cat table                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The IIMs are bolstering firewalls guarding the computerised Common Admission Test (CAT) and altering the option of ending the examination to minimise embarrassment in a retest planned for end-January.        
	Desperate to prevent a repeat of glitches that marred the first attempted computerised CAT, the organisers are strengthening software security for the retest and are tweaking a test option that triggered a spate of complaints.        
	The End option that appeared at the bottom of the testing screen at each stage is likely to be replaced by a more explicit End Test tab in the January 30-31 retest, CAT convener Satish Deodhar told The Telegraph.        
	Changing the nomenclature to make it more explicit will help ensure that students do not mistake the End tab for an option to move to the next screen, when they take the test on January 30 or 31, Deodhar said.        
	The addition of a single word may appear superficial, but IIM officials are hopeful it will help eliminate what students complained was a major source of confusion that led to many exiting the test prematurely.        
	Those who pressed the End/Quit button within the first 120 minutes during the first three days of the testing window and have not been rescheduled yet are among those allowed the retest.        
	IIM officials estimate that between 500 and 1,000 students prematurely quit the test, held between November 28 and December 8, because they clicked the mouse on the End option.        
	Prometric, the US-based testing service provider, has also been asked by the IIMs to strengthen the software security for the test.        
	Around 7,000 students either could not take their test in their scheduled slot or suffered during the test because questions appeared on their screens slower than for other candidates or simply froze on the screen.        
	All such students, identified through a combination of onsite reports from officials at the testing centres and technology, have been promised the retest option.        
	The IIMs and Prometric blamed common viruses, though cyber network security experts, including those who have conducted similar computerised public examinations, junked the explanation as a cover-up.         
	An outcry that echoed even within the walls of Parliament forced the IIMs to consider scrapping the computerised test and reconducting a pencil-paper test.        
	But the institutes eventually decided on sticking with the computerised CAT -- despite internal opposition and demands from many faculty members for a pencil-paper retest.        
	The IIMs tried to accommodate many adversely affected candidates for a retest within the November 28- December 8 slot.        
	After a meeting with human resource development minister Kapil Sibal on December 16, the IIMs announced they would conduct a review to identify all possible adversely affected candidates who had not received a retest.        
	The institutes also announced the January retest for candidates who could not be accommodated for a second opportunity in the earlier test slots.        
	The January 30-31 retest will also be open for candidates who were offered a retest in the earlier slots but on too short a notice or in a city different from the one where they had originally enlisted for the test.

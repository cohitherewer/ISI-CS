The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cutter, generator? No, just cellphone light
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cutter, generator? No, just cellphone light
          SOUMI BHATTACHARYA                              
	Sainthia, July 19: A gas cutter could have saved the two-year-old girl whom local resident Tinku Shaw saw die slowly before his eyes, trapped in a mangled coach.        
	If the railways had sent a few generator lamps in time, Tinku and the 50-odd others who had rushed to help after the 2.02am crash would not have had to try to locate the dead, trapped and injured in cellphone light.        
	A couple of railway ladders would have helped the rescuers reach the Vananchals rear compartment, flung across the railway overbridge, a little quicker.        
	The generators never came. A relief train brought ladders and gas cutters at 5.45am, almost four hours after the collision, by when all those trapped had been rescued and all the injured sent on their way to hospital. And the little girl was dead.        
	We had spotted her lying next to her mothers body. We tried our best to break in but there were no gas cutters. Her death broke our hearts, said Tinku, a man in his 20s.        
	The girl died even before district officials arranged for two gas cutters to be brought from a local iron grille factory, around 3.45am.        
	The cellphone lights were supplemented with a few torches that the Government Railway Police gave us at least two hours after the accident, said Saurav Bardhan, 28, a small-time trader.        
	To Bardhan, who had climbed into a coach, the darkness was the biggest obstacle, preventing him from telling the unconscious from the dead. Whoever I dragged out was dead. I pulled out at least 15 bodies, said Bardhan, who had to depend on the dim light from his mobile.        
	Chitta Malakar said: We eventually found a ladder but it broke when we tried to mount it. Then somebody found another one, which we could use.        
	A middle-aged passenger, bleeding profusely, grabbed Tarun Pals feet and begged for help. Pal, 35, lifted him and took him to the platform where the man passed out.        
	I got him into the first car that we could arrange, around 2.30am, Pal said.        
	Salim Mian, who is in his 40s, found a briefcase lying open next to a body with bundles of cash. I tried my best to locate the owner, then handed it over to a GRP officer. I told him the owner, if he was alive, must get the money. If not, his family must receive it.        
	Police said the briefcase contained Rs 1.5 lakh and that they were trying to find the owner or his family members.

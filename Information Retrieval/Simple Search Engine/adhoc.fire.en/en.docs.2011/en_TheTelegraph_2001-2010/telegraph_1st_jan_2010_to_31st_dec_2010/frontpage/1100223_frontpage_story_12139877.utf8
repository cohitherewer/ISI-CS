	Siliguri, Feb. 22: Nearly 1,000 members of the Kamtapur Students Organisation stormed the regional office of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in Shivmandir today, but were pushed out of the compound by police who burst teargas shells and lathicharged the mob that was throwing stones at the lawkeepers.        
	A second lathicharge took place around 9pm to disperse the students who had been blocking the national highway at Ghoshpukur for four hours.        
	The KSO members said they had come to submit a memorandum demanding the inclusion of the Rajbangshi language in the Madhyamik syllabus. Regional officer of the board Debasis Datta said the KSO, the student front of the Kamtapur Progressive Party, had not informed him in advance about its plan.        
	However, the local police were ready with reinforcements from Matigara and Bagdogra.        
	At 12.45pm, when the KSO members entered the campus, they were stopped by the police. The protesters retaliated by throwing stones at the building, shattering windowpanes.        
	No documents were destroyed and the employees were unhurt because of the police intervention, Datta said. The Madhyamik examination of the board begins tomorrow.        
	Atul Roy, the president of the KPP, however, denied that his outfits involvement in the violence in Shivmandir, 10km from here.         
	Our agitation was peacefulBut the police attacked us and arrested our supporters, Atul Roy alleged.        
	At 5pm, the KSO supporters set up a blockade at Ghoshpukur, 25km from Siliguri. The blockade led to severe traffic congestion on NH31 and left thousands of passengers of long-distance night buses stranded.         
	At 9pm, the police arrived and persuaded the KPP supporters to remove the human barricade. When they refused to budge, the police lathicharged. By 9.15pm, the road was clear.         
	Atul Roy said all primary schools throughout north Bengal would be shut down from March 1 to protest the lathicharge.         
	Gaurav Sharma, the Siliguri additional superintendent of police, said 14 people had been arrested.

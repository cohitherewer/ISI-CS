The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Why I chanted Raa-hul
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Why I chanted Raa-hul
          MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	Santiniketan, Sept. 14: Raa-hul, Raa-hul, Raa-hul        
	Rabindrasangeet paused for a brief while in Santiniketan this morning as girls climbed trees, clung to branches, perched themselves on railings and kept vigil at the barricades.        
	As soon as any car approached the gates of Uttarayan in Visva-Bharati, where Rahul Gandhi was to hold an interactive session with the students, the chant rose: Raa-hul, Raa-hul, Raa-hul.         
	Rahuls SUV reached the gates at 9.45am, 25 minutes behind schedule. When he suddenly stopped the vehicle and stepped out, the girls outnumbered the boys in stretching out their hands.        
	Sraboni Ghosh, 14, a Class IX student of Pathabhawan, was among those who managed to shake Rahuls hand. She was waiting near the Uttarayan gate since 7.30am, booking a place just behind the barricade.        
	In her own words, Srabonis unbelievable moment follows:        
	How do I describe the excitement I felt every time I saw a car approaching the gate and thinking it was Rahul Gandhi coming? Or the joy in screaming Raa-hul in anticipation of him entering the institution?        
	I think the dominant emotion in me was one of pride. After all, his grandmother Indira Gandhi was a student of the institution where I am studying today. His father Rajiv Gandhi and his great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru as well as his grandmother were all chancellors of this institution.         
	The moment I learnt that Rahul Gandhi was coming to Santiniketan, I decided that I would not attend school and would instead wait at the gate to meet him. Today, I reached the gates of Uttarayan at 7.30 in the morning, about two hours before Rahul Gandhis expected arrival. People were already there and I was lucky to find a place to stand behind the barricade.         
	It was fun to scream his name every time a car approached the gates because all my friends were very keen to give him a rousing reception. We all wanted to make him feel wanted.               
	There was, of course, the expected disappointment when we realised that it was not him approaching but just security cars doing their rounds.        
	Of course, he arrived behind schedule and we had a long wait. But, in the end, I think it was well worth it.        
	The proudest moment for me -- as well the most unbelievable one -- was when Rahulji suddenly stepped out of the car and shook my hand. I had never imagined such a thing would happen. I had expected, at best, that he would wave to us and smile.        
	Never in my wildest dreams had I thought that I would be shaking the hand of this charismatic leader. And so handsome at that.        
	For me, it would have been enough to have just seen him from behind the glass window of his car.        
	Today is one of the happiest days in my life. It was like meeting a very close member of my family whom I had never met before. Can anyone define this emotion? At least I cannot.

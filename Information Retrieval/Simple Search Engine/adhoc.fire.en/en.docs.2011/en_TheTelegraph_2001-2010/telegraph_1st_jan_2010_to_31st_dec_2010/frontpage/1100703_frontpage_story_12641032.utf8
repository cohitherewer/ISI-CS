The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Congs Cup riddle: Rahul to go or Manmohan
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Congs Cup riddle: Rahul to go or Manmohan
          RASHEED KIDWAI                             Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi                                
	New Delhi, July 2: A skipper to represent India in a football final is proving difficult to pick because Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi are among the possible contenders.        
	The Congress is in the grip of such soccer fever that many of its general secretaries want either the Prime Minister or his possible successor to represent the country at the July 11 World Cup final at Soccer City in Johannesburg.        
	They feel that given the historical aspect of India-South Africa ties, India should officially present itself to mark the successful completion of the event hosted by that country.         
	During his recent visit, South African president Jacob Zuma had invited Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul to attend the finals and the closing ceremony.         
	Zuma had congratulated Singh for India hosting the Commonwealth Games later this year and the Prime Minister had complimented the President for holding the worlds most widely viewed sporting event.         
	Rahul, who is now in Europe, is expected to return in a few days. He is a soccer buff and a Brazil supporter. His favourite team, though, exited from the Cup today.         
	A pistol shooter and spare-time footballer and cricketer, Rahul has keen interest in sports. Recently, when Indian Olympic Association chief Suresh Kalmadi called on him telling at length how preparations were on course for the Delhi Commonwealth Games, the Amethi MP had stunned him with a query: How many medals is our country going to win?         
	The otherwise chatty Kalmadi was said to have kept mum.         
	Unlike Rahul, the Prime Minister has little interest in sports. The first edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) had not enthused him much. Sources said when an official had then made a reference to IPL-I during a meeting, the Prime Minister had gently asked: What is IPL?         
	The academic-economist Prime Minister is not known to have great interest in Bollywood either.         
	In Toronto last Sunday, actress Twinkle Khanna was reportedly sitting at a high table with him while her hubby Akshay Kumar was the master of ceremonies at the state dinner.         
	Singh reportedly smiled and made polite conversation with the daughter of Dimple Kapadia and Rajesh Khanna.         
	A senior UPA minister who is a frequent visitor to South Africa said while the Congress has the highest regard for South Africa and takes pride in an African country playing host to the FIFA World Cup, a representation at the highest level was unlikely. We have never qualified for the World Cup. There is not a single referee or match official from our country. The Prime Minister has just returned from a visit abroad. So I feel it is unlikely that he would go in response to the invitation extended by President Zuma.         
	Looks like it is for Rahul to fulfil the partys wishes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Combat schools not ready yet
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Combat schools not ready yet
                                        
	State police spokesperson V. H. Deshmukh, who is also managing director of State Police Housing Corporation, said it would not be prudent to reveal too much about the infrastructure of specialised training schools, specially in the wake of heightened Naxalite activity.         
	IG (provisions) N. P. Singh also appeared unaware of the latest developments as far as the specialised training schools were concerned.         
	However, highly placed sources said the home department had interviewed a retired colonel rank army official to head the Netarhat school, but no final decision had been taken by the state machinery.         
	As far as two proposed CIATs were concerned, things were yet to take any concrete shape despite the Centre releasing Rs 10.50 crore for the purpose.

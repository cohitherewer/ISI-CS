          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Jorhat, Sept. 16: Papillon has competition. An allegedly drunk youth in this Upper Assam town tried to flee twice from police custody even with a bullet in his leg like the French criminal who was recaptured every time he tried to escape from a prison.         
	The youth, too, was recaptured twice but he kept the police busy  sweating and running  since 11.30 last night when he was picked up for creating nuisance in a drunken state in front of a city hotel.         
	The police said the youth, identified as Rofiuddin Ahmed in his late twenties, was picked up by cops from Tarajan under Pulibor police station. He also tried to attack passing vehicles.         
	Rofiuddin was shifted to Jorhat police station, 4km away, a couple of hours later, as Pulibor police station did not have a proper lock-up. A police official present at Jorhat police station last night said the youth turned violent soon after he was locked up and started beating up two inmates. He broke the bathroom door inside the lock-up and damaged the wooden window bars. He calmed down only after he was threatened with dire consequences, the official said.        
	Around 6 this morning, the youth was found sleeping and did not respond when the sentry asked him to wake up. As the guard opened the lock-up to shift the youth to the hospital for a medical test, he turned violent again and grabbed the handcuff from the guard, threatened to hit him and ran out of the police station, the official added.        
	A group of about six policemen chased Rofiuddin for about 600 metres. On the way, the youth threatened to attack morning walkers with the handcuff which he swung wildly. He stopped near Smriti Gopal cinema and started throwing stones at the approaching policemen and at the morning walkers. Several attempts to cuff him failed, forcing our men to fire, Jorhat superintendent of police Debajit Hazarika said. But even a bullet in his right leg was not enough to stop Rofiuddin from trying to flee.         
	He was caught and admitted to the Jorhat Medical College Hospital where he snatched a pair of scissors from a medical staff attending him and ran again, the SP said.         
	He was however over-powered by policemen after a brief chase, Hazarika said.         
	The superintendent of JMC Hospital, B.P. Das, said the youths scondition was stable. He has been advised psychiatric treatment, Das said.         
	The police have booked him under several sections of the IPC like creating nuisance.               
	damaging government property and obstructing government officer/employee from discharging duty.

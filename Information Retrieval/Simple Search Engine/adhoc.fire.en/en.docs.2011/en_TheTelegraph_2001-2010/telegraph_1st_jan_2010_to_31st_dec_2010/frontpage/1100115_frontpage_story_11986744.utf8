          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: A software system that helps planes take off and land crashed at Delhi International Airport today, halting operations for an hour and a half before air traffic controllers switched to manual handling of flights.        
	Sources said about 30 to 35 flights, mainly domestic, were affected after the air traffic control (ATC) system blinked around 6pm.         
	Officials said civil aviation regulator DGCA would order a probe into the crash, which could have resulted in a major mishap as an entire sector turned blind and controllers groped to find out the location of flights already airborne.        
	Normal operations resumed around 7.30 after traffic controllers switched to manual handling of flight take-off and landing, ATC sources said.        
	The sources said the standard separation between two planes is 10 nautical miles when radar is available. But, under manual handling, the distance was increased to 80 miles.        
	It is a major disruption as the visual display unit and the data processing unit crashed. The entire radar system collapsed. Several flights were taking off or landing around that time, an airport source said.        
	The crash affected flights over Delhi and its adjoining airspace, including Udhampur, Khajuraho, Lucknow and the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.        
	The officials said it was the first time that the automation and surveillance system had failed since it was installed in 1999 by US-based company Raytheon. The crash, they added, had occurred when the system was being upgraded.        
	Delhi airport is upgrading from Raytheon AutoTrac II to AutoTrac III. The upgraded software features a flow management system for generating arrival lists, a medium-term collision detection alert and automatic route non-conformance alerts. The existing system flashes only a short-term collision alert.        
	Inadequate radar system is seen as a major factor behind the countrys worst air tragedy in November 1996 when a Saudi Arabian jet and a Kazakhstan aircraft collided, killing 350 people.

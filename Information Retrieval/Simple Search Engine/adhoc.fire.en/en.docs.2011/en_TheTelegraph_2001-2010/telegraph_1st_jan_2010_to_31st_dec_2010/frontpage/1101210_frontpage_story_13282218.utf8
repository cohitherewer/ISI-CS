The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Columbia five sell drugs to pay fees
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Columbia five sell drugs to pay fees
                                Columbia University: Getting high                            
	New York, Dec. 9: It was dubbed Operation Ivy League. Five students at one of Americas most prestigious universities were arrested after allegedly helping to put the high into higher education by running a drug ring from their fraternity houses and dorm rooms.        
	The students at Columbia University in New York, an institution with tuition fees of more than $40,000 a year, were detained after undercover officers allegedly bought nearly $11,000 of drugs from them in a five-month operation codenamed after the elite group of US universities. At least two of the five were reported to have said that they sold drugs to help to pay their tuition fees.        
	Police, who began their investigation in July after a tip-off, said that the five supplied classmates in Manhattan with a range of narcotics from cocaine and Ecstasy to marijuana and Adderall, a drug often prescribed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.        
	They also sold LSD, which was often applied to sweets and mints. Each of the five specialised in selling a specific drug and referred customers to one another, according to police.        
	The five  Chris Coles, David Harrison, Adam Klein, Jose Stephan Perez and Michael Wymbs  were arrested during police raids early on Tuesday, at which quantities of drugs and $6,600 in cash were seized. All five are pleading not guilty to the charges. Coles allegedly told one arresting officer: I just sell it to pay tuition.        
	Harrison was said to have blamed his father, saying: Why do you think I do this s***? He wont pay my tuition.        
	The investigation also led police to three alleged narcotics traffickers who allegedly supplied the students. One, Miron Sarzynski, allegedly sold cocaine, LSD and dimethyltriptamine (DMT) to undercover officers on seven occasions. He also manufactured drugs for distribution at his Manhattan apartment with the help of his girlfriend who specialised in growing marijuana, police said.        
	Sarzynski also faces charges of attempting to kidnap a pair of rival cocaine traffickers, who he believed had stolen money from him and tried to hire an undercover officer to help him with the abduction, police said. He planned to kidnap the victims at gunpoint, hold them for ransom and forcibly administer a heavy dose of LSD.        
	Bridget Brennan, the special narcotics prosecutor, suggested that a worrying aspect of the investigation was the involvement of naive college students in the violent drug-dealing business.        
	All the students were videotaped trafficking, according to Brennans office.        
	When the police searched the students rooms, they seized a bottle of LSD, 50 Ecstasy capsules, 15 Adderall pills, more than half a pound of marijuana and about $6,600 in cash, Brennans office said. Adderall is a prescription amphetamine often used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. On campus, where students were busy preparing for finals, many were astonished at news of the arrests.        
	I dont feel like drugs are much of a problem on this campus, said Damaris Giha, 18, a freshman. I feel like alcohol is more of a problem. Its not something I hear a lot about.        
	An older student said drug use was not uncommon. Its college, so its the kind of place where you see a lot of drugs, said Lew Bibler, 20, a junior. People here are smart and theyre trying to get through college, so I see how it could happen. The fraternities are not as central to the social scene as they are at some other colleges, he added.        
	Aliya Zlotkin, 21, is not a student at Columbia but said she was a friend of Adam Klein. Hes a great guy; hes a really exceptional person, said Zlotkin, who described him as smart and kind, a focused student majoring in biology studies. This just came absolutely out of the blue for him.

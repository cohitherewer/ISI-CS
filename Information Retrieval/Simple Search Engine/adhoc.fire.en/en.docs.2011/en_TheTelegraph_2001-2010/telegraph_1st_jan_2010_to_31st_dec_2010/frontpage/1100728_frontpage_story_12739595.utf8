The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bypass advice for Gogoi 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bypass advice for Gogoi 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, July 27: Chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who is undergoing treatment at Delhis Max Hospital, will be shifted to the Asian Heart Institute amp; Research Centre in Mumbai where he is likely to undergo a bypass surgery and aortic valve replacement.        
	Official sources told The Telegraph that the decision was taken today after a coronary angiography done on Gogoi at Max Hospital yesterday detected that two blood vessels in his heart had 70 to 80 per cent blockages each, necessitating immediate bypass surgery. Doctors at the hospital have also advised aortic valve replacement. Otherwise Gogois heart functioning is perfectly normal. He already has a pacemaker installed, which is also functioning well.         
	The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has intervened in Gogois treatment and discussed the matter in detail with the Assam government. It was finally decided that the chief minister would undergo bypass surgery or open heart surgery and aortic vale replacement at the Asian Heart Institute. He is expected to be shifted to Mumbai either on Friday or Saturday, the source said.         
	A team of doctors, led by Dr Pervez Ahmed, the CEO of Max Healthcare Institute Ltd, is continuously monitoring Gogois health. Doctors at the hospital said his condition was stable now and he was fit to fly to Mumbai.         
	Gogoi, 75, was hospitalised on Saturday after he complained of uneasiness during the National Development Council meeting at Vigyan Bhavan in Delhi. Sources said he was today shifted to a cabin from the semi intensive care unit of the hospital and was talking to visitors.         
	The chief cardiologist of the Guwahati-based Hyat Hospitals, Sasanka Baruah, indicated that considering the kind of surgery that Gogoi needs to undergo, he is likely to be in the hospital for a couple of weeks and may have to undergo complete rest for some months after that.         
	Since the functioning of the chief ministers heart is normal, there should not be any risk factor in the surgery, he added.

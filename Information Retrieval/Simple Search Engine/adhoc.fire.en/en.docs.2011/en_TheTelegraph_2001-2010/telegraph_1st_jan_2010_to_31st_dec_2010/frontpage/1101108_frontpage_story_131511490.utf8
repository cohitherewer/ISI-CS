	New Delhi, Nov 8 (PTI): US President Barack Obama today offered to play any role India and Pakistan would like on resolving Kashmir issue while Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made it clear that New Delhi was not afraid of discussions but terror from across the border must stop.
    After talks with Singh, Obama said the two countries have agreed on the need for all nations in the region to take steps to ensure that there are no safe havens for terrorists.
    Noting that Kashmir was a long-standing dispute, Obama told a joint press conference that it was in the interest of India and Pakistan to reduce tensions between them.
    "The US cannot impose solutions to these problems. I have indicated to Prime Minister that we are happy to play any role the parties think is appropriate in reducing tensions.

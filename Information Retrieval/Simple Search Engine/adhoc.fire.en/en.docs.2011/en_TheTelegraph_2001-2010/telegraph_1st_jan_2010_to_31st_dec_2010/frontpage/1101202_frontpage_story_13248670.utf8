The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Indian red face after royal leak
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Indian red face after royal leak
          AMIT ROY                            Banerji (top), Charles                          
	London, Dec. 1: Amitav Banerji, a senior official in the Commonwealth Secretariat in London, told an American diplomat that Prince Charles did not command (as much) respect as the Queen, according to a cable leaked by WikiLeaks.        
	Banerji, who is director of political affairs, is also said to have questioned whether Prince Charles would automatically succeed his mother as head of the Commonwealth.        
	In Britain, the Commonwealth does not much excite the public imagination but Banerjis alleged comments are being seized on by sections of the media who need little excuse to attack Prince Charles.        
	Following the announcement of Prince Williams engagement to Kate Middleton, some are even suggesting that the succession should jump a generation and pass from the Queen to her eldest grandson, thereby bypassing her son.        
	There is no provision in Britain which would allow for such an unlikely scenario but the very suggestion reflects the mutual dislike that exists between Charles and a section of the media.        
	It is unclear whether Banerji was expressing a personal opinion or was speaking on behalf of the Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma and other members of the Commonwealth Secretariat.         
	 The leak is certainly an embarrassment for India and especially for Sharma since Britain backed his bid to be Commonwealth Secretary-General when many African and Caribbean states needed convincing that Indias candidate was worthy of their support. One theory is that Banerji was reflecting the views of African and Caribbean countries who feel they do not see members of the royal family as often as, say, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.        
	Charles cannot be faulted on the India front, though. He is a frequent visitor to India  he opened the Commonwealth Games in October  and is often spotted at Indian functions in the UK.        
	Banerji had what he thought was a private conversation with a diplomat from the US embassy in London. It got reported back to Washington in a cable dated June 11, 2009.        
	A spokesman for the Commonwealth Secretariat said: We are not commenting on what we consider to be privileged communications.        
	 The US Embassy cable was classified as confidential by Richard Mills, a political counsellor in the US State Department.        
	After discussing topics including human rights in Sri Lanka and unrest in Nigeria, Banerjis comments turned to the issue of who should be the Commonwealth figurehead, it has been reported.        
	Banerji acknowledged that the succession of the Head of the Commonwealth would have to be dealt with when Queen Elizabeth passes, as there is no rule stipulating that the British monarch is the Head and no procedure for selecting a new Head, said the cable.        
	He acknowledged that heir-apparent to the British Crown, Prince Charles, does not command the same respect as the Queen and said the Commonwealth was trying quietly to get him more involved in Commonwealth affairs. Banerji noted Marlborough House, the Commonwealth Secretariats current location, was a royal property, owned and funded by the British Royal Family, and mused that may be a factor in the discussions.        
	The implication is that Charles was not giving some Commonwealth countries the attention they felt they deserved.        
	 The latest disclosure may come as a blow to the Prince, who was stung by a survey earlier this year which found that fewer than one in five citizens of Commonwealth countries believed he should be the next head, with a rotating headship, shared by the leaders of member nations, the most popular alternative, observers said.        
	 They point out that the Prince is known to be passionate about succeeding the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth, and was hurt earlier this year by negative comments about his suitability for the role contained in the Royal Commonwealth Societys report into the future of the organisation.        
	They add that Charles regards the Headship of the Commonwealth as a vital part of the monarchs role, and when the Societys report came out in March he swiftly ordered Clarence House to send the media a list of the 33 Commonwealth countries he had visited.        
	 The American diplomat said in his report that the director acknowledged succession was not being actively discussed within the Commonwealth.        
	 Banerjis CV says he took office as director of political affairs in January 2009. As chief political adviser to the Secretary-General, he is responsible for managing the Commonwealths political activity and the division supporting this work.        
	Banerji joined the Commonwealth Secretariat in 1990. He was previously special adviser in the Political Affairs Division, where he was responsible for the Commonwealths democracy and good governance programme, as well as organising the biennial heads of government meetings.        
	A career diplomat, Banerji is fluent in six languages. He was private secretary to the Indian external affairs minister between 1979 and 1982. His diplomatic assignments have included Spain, Pakistan, Malaysia and the Indian Permanent Mission to the UN in New York.        
	Back in India, Banerjis late father, Sushital, was an influential member of Indira Gandhis PMO under P.N. Haksar

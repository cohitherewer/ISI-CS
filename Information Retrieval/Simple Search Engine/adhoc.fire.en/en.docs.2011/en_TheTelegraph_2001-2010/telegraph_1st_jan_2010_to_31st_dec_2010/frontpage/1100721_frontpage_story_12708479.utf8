The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Three cups on the tracks
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Three cups on the tracks
          SOUMI BHATTACHARYA                              
	Gadadharpur (Birbhum), July 20: Three white plastic cups and three used tea bags lying on the tracks and platform of this small, sleepy station may hold the key to the mystery of the train crash at Sainthia, 7.5km away.        
	If the Uttar Banga drivers did drink drug-laced tea during their two-minute halt here, just seven minutes before the 2.02am accident, they would have had to buy it from ghosts. At 1.53am, when the train rolled in for its unscheduled stop, the platform would have been deserted, local vendors said.        
	But then, its only ghosts who could have sold the plastic cups. No vendor at the station or the stalls outside sells tea in plastic cups, station officials and hawkers said. None provides tea bags.        
	No one knows if the drivers drank from these plastic cups, but the mystery still remains: where did the cups come from?        
	Or could they have been placed conveniently by an interested party after the accident?        
	Two of the cups, with tea bags inside, lay in the foliage by the tracks just to the right of where the Uttar Bangas engine would have stood  a throw away from the locomotives right window. Nearby lay an empty, crushed pack of cigarettes.        
	Did either driver smoke? It wasnt clear tonight.        
	To the left of where the engine would have stood, on the stone chips between the tracks and the platform, lay a third cup  just under where the locomotives left window would have been. The third tea bag lay on the platform, just above the third cup. Who was the third drinker?        
	Beside the tracks near the third cup lay a second pack of cigarettes, empty but new, as evident from its shiny plastic cover.        
	If the Uttar Banga drivers indeed drank tea here, they must have got it from someone travelling on the train, said Pintu Das, a hawker who sells lemon tea at the station in earthen cups.        
	If hes right, one possibility is that it was one of the gangs that drug and rob passengers.        
	Only local trains stop here. The Vananchal had passed the station at 1.43am; the Uttar Banga stopped briefly because the line wasnt clear, a railway official said.        
	Its impossible to say what happened after that. No one except the assistant stationmaster spends the night at the station (in his office). The ticket counter closes at 11pm after which no local train passes the station, an official said.        
	Even the four shops outside the station  two selling tea and telebhaja and two selling sweets  close by 10pm.        
	You will not even find a beggar sleeping on the platform, said Kishen Sharma, a hawker who sells jhalmuri on trains.        
	Government Railway Police (GRP) sources said their officials and those of the railways, Railway Protection Force and the state criminal investigation department (CID) had visited the station yesterday afternoon.        
	But they did not seize anything from the spot, a GRP officer said.

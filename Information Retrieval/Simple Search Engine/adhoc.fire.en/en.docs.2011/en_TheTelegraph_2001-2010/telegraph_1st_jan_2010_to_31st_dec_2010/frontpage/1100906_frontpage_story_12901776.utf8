The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bandh salt in festival cut: shop earlier 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bandh salt in festival cut: shop earlier 
          A STAFF REPORTER                       Kali Ghosh, CITU general secretary                           
	Calcutta, Sept. 5: Sanam Zeya had taken a weeks leave starting tomorrow to prepare for Id. The young banker had drawn up plans to wrap up her Id shopping by Tuesday to avoid the last-minute rush in markets.         
	Thanks to a 24-hour nationwide general strike of trade unions  to protest the Centres divestment policy, privatisation and price rise, among other issues  on September 7, the 34-year-old womans plans have gone awry.        
	Kali Ghosh, general secretary of Citu, has a solution for people like Sanam who are ruing a bandh on the auspicious Day 27 of the month of Ramazan. Id is scheduled either on Friday or Saturday, depending on the sighting of the moon.        
	When there is a petrol pump strike, people fill up their car tanks a day in advance. Similarly, people will have to do all their shopping a day before the strike or a day after, Ghosh told The Telegraph this evening.         
	Although many unions have called the strike, it will be seen as a Citu-sponsored shutdown in Bengal, especially since the Congresss Intuc and the Trinamul Congress outfit are not part of the programme.        
	Facing uncomfortable questions on the necessity of a strike just a few days before the festival, Citus Ghosh pleaded helplessness and said the date of the strike had been announced well in advance.         
	Some leaders of Citu, the labour arm of the CPM, admitted that they were wary of the impact of the strike as successive election results in the state had suggested the minority community had drifted away from the Left.         
	In an attempt to minimise the damage, Citu leaders had announced that the Muslim-dominated areas in the state would be kept outside the strike. All shops in Muslim-dominated areas will remain open and the local transport will ply as usual, said Citu leader Md Nizamuddin.         
	However, shopping during the festival season is not confined to particular areas. A week before Id, most big markets buzz with activity. Exempting Muslim-dominated areas from the strike is not a solution as people also buy from malls, said Sanam.         
	Humayun Khan, a member of the Calcutta Muslim Orphanage, wondered what would happen to people who do not live in minority-dominated pockets.        
	As the exemption has not clearly spelt out the criteria that will make an area Muslim-dominated, shoppers and traders are confused and Ghosh could not offer a solution.         
	Local comrades will decide if a particular area is a Muslim-dominated one or not. Do you expect us to carry out a census in every area to find out its demographic pattern? asked Ghosh.         
	Some local comrades, however, were clueless till this evening. A central Calcutta Citu leader explained the problem. A lot of people come to New Market for Id shopping. But New Market has a cosmopolitan culture. We dont know what to do, he said.         
	Till this evening, the management of JS Mohamedally on Esplanade  a favourite shopping destination before Id  had decided to keep the showroom open on Tuesday. But everything depends on whether people can make it to our shop. If no transport is available, shoppers cannot venture out, said a shop official.        
	Although the strike has exempted the railways and the airlines, Citu-dominated bus, minibus and taxi unions will join the strike. The authorities of most city malls have already decided to down shutters.

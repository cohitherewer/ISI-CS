          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Imphal, March 7: Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh today admitted that one of the two ministers travelling with advocate-general N. Koteshore Singh in the same car fired the shot that wounded him, but refused to disclose the name of the minister.         
	It was a very unfortunate incident. One of the two ministers travelling with the advocate-general accidentally fired from his licenced gun. The minister confessed that it was an accidental firing, Ibobi Singh told reporters after visiting the injured official at Shija Hosptials at Lamphel in Imphal West today.         
	When a reporter asked which minister fired the shot, Ibobi Singh walked away.         
	Before moving away surrounded by his security guards, the chief minister angrily aanounced there was no need for further inquiry as it was an accidental firing from a licenced gun.         
	The chief ministers statement made it clear it was an attempt to cover up the matter to avoid trouble for the state government and the minister who fired the shot.         
	Works minister K. Ranjit Singh, tribal development minister D.D. Thaisii and the advocate-general were on their way back in a car last evening after attending a seed-sowing festival of the Tangkhuls at Hunphung in Ukhrul district.         
	Reporters travelling as part of the convoy said several shots were fired while the line of cars was entering Imphal East at Yaingangpokpi. The car carrying the three drove straight to a government hospital.         
	Some guessed that militants had shot at the convoy.        
	A bullet hit the right arm of the official and entered the right rib cage.        
	The injured was admitted first to Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital at Porompat in Imphal East, and then taken to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences and finally to the Shija Hospitals at Langol.         
	All the hospitals reported the matter to the police, but no case was registered.         
	The superintendent of police, Imphal East, Th. Radheshyam Sing, confirmed that no case was registered as it was an accidental firing and there was no complaint.         
	The director-general of police, Yumnam Joykumar Singh, too, echoed the chief minister.         
	Before Ibobi Singh arrived at the hospital today, he called the two ministers and spoke to them.         
	The three came together to the hospital in the chief ministers car.         
	Legal experts said though there was no report, the police should register an FIR and look into the matter.         
	Even if the shooter had admitted that the firing was accidental, it could be confirmed or negated only after a police inquiry. Now that the police are aware of the incident, criminal procedure code requires that the police should register a suo motu case and make inquiries, a senior lawyer said.         
	No family member of the advocate-general was available for comment.         
	Doctors at the hospital said his condition was serious but stable.         
	Residents of Lamlai in Imphal East last night protested at the gate of Lamlai police station charging that the ministers convoy fired at the house of public health engineering minister Ph. Parijat Singh while the convoy was passing the house in the neighbourhood.

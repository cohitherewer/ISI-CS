          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Wen Jiabao, 68, with Manmohan Singh at a dinner in   Hanoi on Friday. Indian sources quoted Wen as telling Singh: ldquo;I am just 10 years younger than you but you look so   much wiser. rdquo; (AFP)                          
	Hanoi, Oct. 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh discussed all difficult issues in the India-China relationship with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao this morning and spoke of the need for sensitivity.        
	At their 45-minute meeting at the Daewoo Hotel, the two Prime Ministers underlined their intent to find consensus on these issues before Wens Delhi visit later in the year.        
	Underlying this objective was the recognition that both countries were here to stay as key geopolitical players and economic powers in the Asia-Pacific region. This was articulated by Singh a couple of days ago in Malaysia and echoed by Wen today.        
	Quoting Singh, Wen said: You have said on many occasions that there is enough space in the world for India and China to achieve common development. On top of your remarks, I add that there is enough space in the world for India and China to have co-operation.        
	Singh had said: The world is a large enough place to accommodate the growth and ambitions of India and China together.        
	The two Premiers peppered their exchange with profuse compliments that harked back to their countries shared history and the prospect of a mutually beneficial relationship.        
	Wen reminded his Indian counterpart that the year 2010 marked 60 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties between their countries. Singh said: You are the architect of the strategic cooperative partnership which was signed by both of us during your first visit to India in 2005.        
	Since then, the two have met nine times. The dates for Wens India visit are still being finalised, with sources indicating it could take place in the second week of December.        
	National security adviser Shivshankar Menon told the media that Singh raised the issue of all difficult questions and spoke of the need to show sensitivity to each others core issues.        
	Menon, however, was economical with specifying what the difficult issues were, and chose to elaborate only on a question on the boundary dispute over Arunachal Pradesh.        
	I think both indicated to each other that this is an ongoing convention and will continue discussions leading to Jiabaos visit, Menon said.         
	He stressed that India was sure the visit would be successful and productive. It is understood that Indias concerns related to boundary disputes and Kashmir, including Chinas growing presence in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and its denial of regular visas to Jammu and Kashmir residents.        
	China was primarily exercised over the Dalai Lamas activities in India, which it perceives as prejudicial to its interests.        
	Asked about the exchanges on the boundary problem, Menon said: Both sides said they looked forward to an early resolution and the need to carry forward this process on the parameters of an agreement signed by them in 2005.        
	Pending reconciliation, India and China would maintain peace and tranquillity in the region, he added.        
	The two Premiers directed the officials and special representatives dealing with the difficult issues to look into them and prepare for Wens visit. The two countries special representatives will meet in Beijing in end-November to take forward the boundary negotiations.        
	Asked whether China had acknowledged the import-export imbalances with India, triggered largely by an under-valued yuan, Menon said: Jiabao said we are very conscious of trade imbalances and we need to do something. There was satisfaction that in the first nine months (of 2010), there was $45 billion in two-way trade and we are on our way to achieving $60 billion by the end of the year.Menon said that while there was no discussion on the G20 meeting that both the countries would attend, the two Premiers did take up subjects like food security, counter-terrorism, disaster management and energy cooperation on which we have similar or identical views.        
	Singh also met South Korean President Lee Myung-bak. Menon said Posco did not figure in the discussions. The two leaders agreed that the G20 countries must evolve systems to implement the decisions taken at such summits rather than just leave them as decisions.

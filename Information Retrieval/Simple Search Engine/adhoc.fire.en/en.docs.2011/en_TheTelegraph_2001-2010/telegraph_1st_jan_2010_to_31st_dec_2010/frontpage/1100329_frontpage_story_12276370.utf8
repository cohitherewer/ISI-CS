	Calcutta, March 28: Stephen Courts additional floors, dubbed illegal by the chief minister in the Assembly, were sanctioned in 1975 and the permission was renewed in 1983, documents accessed by The Telegraph show.        
	The sanction and the renewal occurred when the Calcutta corporation was under administrators appointed by two state governments, one headed by the Congress and the other by the Left.        
	The additional floors were among those that caught fire on Tuesday. At least 34 people were killed in the blaze.                    
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said in the Assembly on Thursday: How were the two new floors added to the building? They were totally illegal. Who broke the law?        
	It is difficult to conclude whether the law was broken when the two floors were added. If the norms in vogue before 1984  when the Corporation of Calcutta became the Calcutta Municipal Corporation  are taken into account, the government will find it hard to penalise Stephen Court on the specific ground of illegal addition.         
	But had Stephen Court waited for another year, it would have had to approach fire officials before the sanction was renewed. It is also an open question whether the rules that had changed by then would have allowed the additions without any modification.        
	However, it is easier to answer the chief ministers first question: How were the two new floors added?        
	The documents  copies of building plans approved by the corporation  with The Telegraph show that Stephen Court had the sanction to add not two but three floors (fifth, sixth, seventh and a roof) to five floors. The Telegraph has tried its best to verify the authenticity of the documents; corporation sources did confirm that the contents tallied with the information they had collated.        
	The sanction was given on March 31, 1975 (see parts of the documents on the left). The sanction did not limit the options available to the developer  whether it would erect a new building, or alter or add to the existing building  which can be interpreted as a carte blanche.        
	In 1972, the Siddhartha Shankar Ray government had superseded the corporation board. An administrator to run the civic affairs was appointed by the then municipal affairs ministry, which was headed by Subrata Mukherjee.        
	Asked about the sanction, Mukherjee said today: In 1975, I was the municipal affairs minister and P. Samaddar was the administrator. In those days, unlike todays centralised administration, Writers Buildings or the ruling party never interfered in the matters of the corporation. If anything was sanctioned at that time, it should have come to my notice as the minister of municipal affairs. But I must say that the vertical escalation of the building (Stephen Court) was done much before 1975.        
	However, three residents of Stephen Court since the 1960s  Debkishore Dutta, Rajeev Butta and Manu Lilaram  said the fifth and the sixth floors were added in 1984. The sanctioned seventh floor was never built.        
	The sanction of 1975 was valid for five years till 1980. In 1983, the sanction was renewed for another five years with retrospective effect from 1980 by another administrator, who reported to the then municipal affairs ministry headed by the late CPM leader, Prasanta Sur. Subsequently, the addition and alteration to Stephen Court was regularised.        
	Gorachand Mondol, the official who renewed the validity in 1983 as deputy city architect, said the sanction was in line with the rules prevalent then. Yes, I did sign. According to the then Calcutta Corporation Act, the maximum allowable height for a building used to be 2.5 times the width of the road in front of the premises, Mondol, now director-general of buildings, said today.        
	Going by Mondols statement, Stephen Court could have risen up to 150 feet as Park Street is considered 60ft wide by CMC officials. Fire officials put the current height of Stephen Court around 120 feet. This probably explains why the corporation allowed a seventh floor  under the rules being cited by Mondol the building could have gone up by another 30 feet.        
	What would have happened if Stephen Court had waited for one more year?        
	In 1984, Calcutta corporation formally became a municipal corporation and the building rules changed. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act introduced concepts such as floor-area ratio and mandatory open space. It also imposed conditions for height above 47.5 feet (14.5 metres).        
	For construction above 47.5 feet, approval was needed from the fire department, police and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.        
	The clearance in 1983 meant the corporation could renew the sanction without making such conditions mandatory.

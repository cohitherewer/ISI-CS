          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 4: Black gold glittered on Dalal Street today as Coal India, the worlds biggest miner of the humdrum fossil fuel, made a scintillating debut on the stock exchanges today with the share surging almost 40 per cent as investors swarmed the market with both buy and sell orders.        
	At the end of a frenzied day of trading during which the sensex climbed to its highest closing level ever at 20,893.57, the stags  the people who sell the stock as soon as it lists  were counting their gains from an investment that many had seen as clear winner.        
	The Coal India stock closed at Rs 342.35, a 39.73 per cent gain over its issue price of Rs 245 per share.        
	The stock provided the ideal Diwali gift to investors, closing way above the pundits consensus estimate of around Rs 280 a share. Very few had forecast that it would top Rs 300  and hardly anyone had expected it to hover above that level at the close.         
	The strong closing means that institutional investors who are still holding on to the stock  would have made a gain of Rs 97.35 per share. Retail investors are in a relatively better position, since they were entitled to a discount of 5 per cent to the issue price. After accounting for this discount, they will be sitting on a profit of Rs 109.6 per share.        
	Investors have made a killing in this stock. This is a great Diwali gift to all investors, said Arun Kejriwal, director of research firm KRIS.         
	Market analysts said the stock was propelled upward by the huge buying interest from foreign investors.        
	At the end of the day, Coal India had another achievement to boast about: its market capitalisation soared to Rs 2,16,240 crore, breaking into the top five capitalised stocks in the market.        
	Reliance Industries has the largest market capitalisation of over Rs 3.61 trillion, followed by ONGC with just over Rs 2.93 trillion and SBI with over Rs 2.18 trillion.        
	The Coal India stock had opened strong on the BSE at Rs 287.75 and surged to an intra-day peak of Rs 344.75, before sliding a bit to close at Rs 342.35. The counter topped the turnover charts at the exchanges with over 19 crore shares being traded, resulting in a turnover Rs 6,324 crore.         
	On the National Stock Exchange, the share debuted at Rs 291 and rose to a days high of Rs 344.90 after dipping to Rs 341.90 at the end of the day.         
	On the NSE, close to 47.97 crore shares of Coal India were traded. The combined turnover on the two exchanges stood at nearly 67 crore shares, more than the IPO size of 63.16 crore shares.        
	Coal India is now a strong candidate to break into the bellwether indices like the sensex and the Nifty though market analysts felt it would be a while before this happened.        
	The spectacular listing of Coal India will cheer officials in Delhi who are gung-ho about the prospects of raising more money from the stake selloff in several other state-owned companies later this year, notably ONGC, Indian Oil Corporation and Powergrid Corporation.        
	Market experts, however, have said that this will be possible only if the government doesnt get too greedy and prices the stocks reasonably as it had done in the case of Coal India.         
	The government had left some value on the table for the Coal India investors, said one market analyst.

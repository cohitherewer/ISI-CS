The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nadal master of all, greatest race is open 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nadal master of all, greatest race is open 
                                Rafael Nadal rolls on the ground in celebration after winning the US Open mens singles final. (AFP picture)                            
	Sept. 14: As TV screens showed Rafael Nadal with the US Open trophy tucked safely under his arm, former World No. 1 Mats Wilander tried to answer the one question everyone was asking.        
	I think we should stop talking about Federer being the greatest player of all time, the Swede said.        
	Theres no point doing that until Nadal is done. Its already unfair to me to say Roger is (the best ever), because Rafa is beating him all the time on every surface and in the Slam finals.        
	A growing number within the game feels that the Spaniard, who now has nine majors, will eventually challenge the Swiss masters record 16 Grand Slam singles titles.        
	Consider the stats. The so-called rivalry has seen the Mallorcan with the bulging muscles and shy smile beat Federer in six of their last seven meetings. He leads the Swiss 14-7 overall and 5-2 in Slam finals. At 24, he is five years younger than Federer who, at the same age, had three majors fewer than Nadal.        
	Till now, Nadal has shared an era with Federer. He now shares the aura after his 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 demolition of Serbias Novak Djokovic in last nights final at a Federer citadel where the Swiss won five successive titles and reached six finals.        
	The victory not only makes Nadal the youngest in the Open era to have won all four Slams, it proves that he is at last a master of all surfaces. For, the US Open had always seemed the one that might elude him, as the French Open had eluded Pete Sampras.        
	The hardcourt was thought too quick for his big forehand backswing; the bounce too low for his extreme grip. The lack of an overwhelming serve made it too tough to win easy points.        
	More than what I dreamt, Nadal acknowledged last night, his broken English increasingly endearing. To win in the US Open I think is the more difficult tournament for me to play, more difficult conditions to adapt, to adjust my game on this court, for the balls, for the court, for everything.         
	When Djokovics last forehand sailed wide, Nadal dropped to the blue court, covered his head with both hands and then jogged towards the net and hugged his opponent.        
	Federer remains competitive but Nadal is now the relentless one. He is the itch you cant scratch, the wall you hit against as a kid. The ball always came back, and so it does from Nadal. Wherever the Swiss was on Monday  and he had promised not to watch  he could surely hear the express train roar of Nadal catching up on him.        
	Nadal dismisses such talk, remaining charming and humble as he sledgehammers one opponent after another with a better serve, better return, better volley and better sliced backhand. I think talking about if I am better or worse than Roger is stupid, he said after his win, because his titles say hes much better than me. I think that will be true all my life.        
	His vanquished opponent differed. He has lots of time if he plays five, six, seven years, Djokovic said. He has the game for each surface.        
	And that sums up Nadal: day by day, climate after climate, he keeps raising his game, from one built for clay into one for all surfaces.              
	Nadal knows what he must do next. For me the most important thing is try to keep serving like I did during this tournament, said the champion who lost only one set at Flushing Meadows.        
	If I can do it, it is gonna be a big change for me and my tennis career, because if I have those free points that I had during all this tournament, (its) gonna be different for me. I can play more aggressive. I can play with more calm when I am returning. After that, I can improve everything: volley, keep improving the volley, keep improving the position on court, being more inside the court.        
	I had this 15-30 chance in the 5-4 third set, Djokovic said. And then he served, I mean, three amazing serves.        
	The improvement is all the more awe-inspiring considering the turnaround from last year, when Nadals chronic knee problems kept him from defending his Wimbledon title and an abdominal problem weakened him at the US Open. His physical woes forced him to quit his quarter-final at the Australian Open in January this year.        
	Since then, Nadal has won the next three Slams  the French, Wimbledon and now the US Open  the only man to do so since Rod Laver 41 years ago.        
	I improved a lot since last year, but never is enough. I am not a perfect player, so everybody can improve, Nadal said. But he was still loath to speculate on catching Federer. We will see what happens in the future. I am not a genius.        
	His uncle, coach and mentor Toni Nadal was careful too. Is Rafael the best? No, he is far away. The best of all time are Laver, Federer, (Bjorn) Borg. Then Sampras. We are very happy with nine Grand Slams and 18 Masters (titles) but after one month or in 15 days, we have problems again because tennis is relentless, said the man who cultivated the prodigy whose talents have not yet fully flowered.        
	But he added: What gives me great satisfaction is how much he has improved on fast courts. It was a goal we had in mind, never knowing for sure if wed get there.        
	The next few years will be interesting both in the pursuit of major titles and the focus on who Nadal really is. His intense look on the court belies an inner boy scout. He is the player most likely to help a little old lady across the street.        
	Wins are important. Common courtesy more so.        
	After his semi-final on September 11, he told the crowd how sad he still was about the terror attacks. He later said he had visited Ground Zero six times. Once is a photo op. Six times is heartfelt.        
	Tennis fan Bob Drew tells of seeing Nadal as an unheralded youngster, playing at Wimbledon. A ball boy was hit with a shot and Nadal made the chair umpire stop the match, something veterans would hesitate to do. That kid is bleeding, he said.        
	In his news conference yesterday, Nadal was asked to rank his top moments. He ignored his career and said: When Spain won the (football) World Cup, I cried.        
	A defining moment in a night of so many occurred as the awards ceremony was ending.        
	Nadal was posing for the on-court photographers, Djokovic was departing and the public address announcer asked for one more round of applause. Nadal stopped posing and, trophy in arms, joined the applause.        
	You can see hundreds of similar ceremonies. You wont see that.

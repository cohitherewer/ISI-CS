  A jerk unlike any before                            Passengers being evacuated through the motormans cabin of the derailed train in the tunnel near Central station. Picture by Amit Datta				                                 
	8.58am, Wednesday: Sushmita Saha, 28, is getting late for office. She glances at her watch as she races down the steps of Belgachhia Metro station.         
	9.44am: Sushmita, gasping for breath, is lifted by two male co-passengers and brought out of the train through the emergency exit in the motormans cabin. Someone brings a chair for her but the courier company executive is so shaken that she can barely sit still.        
	9.55am: A stranger splashes water on Sushmitas face, asking repeatedly whether she is all right. She nods before mumbling: I thought everything was over.        
	Sushmita, a Dutta Bagan resident who takes a train from Belgachhia station to reach her Park Circus office almost every morning, recalls the morning that no Calcutta Metro commuter has ever faced before.              
	The train I boarded was chock-a-block as usual, being a weekday morning. I boarded the second compartment from the engine and was pleasantly surprised to find a place to sit in the section reserved for ladies. A good start to the day, I thought to myself. When the train reached Girish Park, the compartment was so crowded that all I could see were pairs of legs in front of me.        
	Just as the train was nearing Central station, our compartment jerked violently. I have been a Metro regular for more than five years but this was unlike anything I had experienced before.                     
	Something told me this was not just another snag. I was right. The train jerked again, almost throwing me off my seat. A child travelling with a woman fell on the floor. Many of those standing fell on each other.         
	Then the lights went out. I tried hard not to panic but how do you stay calm? The train had come to a halt in the tunnel and I could smell smoke. Shouts of fire, fire echoed as people banged on the doors.         
	I froze. An elderly woman seated opposite me passed out.         
	As smoke filled the dark compartment, all I could hear was people screaming and coughing. I dont know whether I passed out for a few seconds. I only remember feeling extremely weak.         
	What happened over the next 20 minutes is a blur. I was barely conscious when two men lifted me and took me out of the compartment. Not a single Metro official was around to offer help. They left us there in a dark, smoke-filled compartment.         
	I consider myself fortunate to come out of that train alive today. I am not sure I will be waiting to board a Metro train tomorrow.       AS TOLD TO ZEESHAN JAWED

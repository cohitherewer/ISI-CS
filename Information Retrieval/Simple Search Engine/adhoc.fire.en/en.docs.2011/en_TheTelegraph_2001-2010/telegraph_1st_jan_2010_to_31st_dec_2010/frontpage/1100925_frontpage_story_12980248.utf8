	Midnapore, Sept. 24: The biggest cache of explosives yet from a Maoist belt in Bengal was found today in West Midnapore, a haul big enough to blow up a small town like Lalgarh, police said.        
	The joint forces came across 803 gelatine sticks, 20kg of ammonium nitrate and 10 detonators at an abandoned camp in the Tapoban jungle in Nayagram early this morning.        
	A small town like Lalgarh can be blown up with this quantity of explosives, said a police officer in Midnapore town.        
	The place where the explosives were stashed is about 15km from the Orissa border and about 95km from Lalgarh.         
	In March, the police had found a big cache of explosives  apparently enough to blow up Writers Buildings  from a Maoist hideout in a forest at Shirshi in Kotowali area, about 30km from Lalgarh.        
	The quantity of that haul was put at 250kg  200kg of potassium nitrate and 50kg of sulphur  in five sacks.        
	Todays seizure is far bigger than that in Shirshi in March. This is for the first time we have found such a huge quantity of explosives from the Maoist belt in Bengal, said Manoj Verma, the district superintendent of police.         
	The officer said it was being suspected that the gelatine sticks were part of those looted about a month ago while being transported in trucks from Chhattisgarh. We are contacting our counterparts in Chhattisgarh, Verma added.         
	 A police officer said that the explosives were kept in a hideout inside the dense jungle. The Maoists had pitched camp in the jungle where they had also stored these explosives. We did not find any Maoist in the hideout as they may have abandoned the place on getting news about our raid, he said.         
	The arrest of two Maoists earlier this week had put the police on the trail of the explosives, the police said.         
	We had arrested two people, Himangshu Bera and Khokan Bera, two days ago from a village called Patina in Nayagram on charges of murdering five members of a single family on September 13. During interrogation, they gave us the information about the huge cache of explosives, the officer said.        
	In another raid carried out last night in Kantapahari, about 5km from Lalgarh town, the joint forces found three single-barrel guns, two 9mm pistols and 12 cartridges from a pond.

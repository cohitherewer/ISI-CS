	Mangalore, May 25: The flight data recorder of flight IX 812, the missing link in the probe into Saturdays Air India Express crash that killed 158 people, was found today with its most important component intact.        
	We found the outer casing (of the recorder) damaged and its rear portion almost completely damaged. But the most important part, the memory boards, which are protected by a cylindrical casing, appear to be fully intact, said an official of the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) who was part of the search team.        
	The recorder  also called the black box  was retrieved around 10am from a bed of slush at the crash site  72 hours after the Boeing 737 fell off the tabletop runway and caught fire, and two days after the search began. The cockpit voice recorder, another key device, was found on Sunday, a day after the accident.        
	The search officials said the cylindrical casings around the memory boards were designed to withstand a crash and the impacts that come with such an eventuality, such as fire and water and even piercing by steel rods.        
	The search team said its task at the crash site was almost over and that the probe would now shift to the DGCAs laboratories where the readings of the black box and the cockpit voice recorder needed to be decoded.        
	It would be difficult to put a timeline on that process but hopefully we should be able to complete it within a fortnight, a senior officer said. The recorder needs to be cleaned up and connected to a computer for the readings to be transferred and analysed, Air India s flight safety officer Bharath Kumar said. The overriding theory so far is that the crash occurred because of pilot error.        
	The flight data recorder records crucial parameters such as altitude, airspeed, landing speed and other key parameters. It can throw light on how the plane was handled while landing and whether any device malfunctioned.        
	A two-member team from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the US governments crash investigator, arrived in Mangalore today. Although the accident occurred in Indian territory, the boards mandate and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) convention, to which India is a signatory, allow the American agency to join the investigations as the aircraft involved in the crash had been manufactured in the US. Our role will be only supportive, not intrusive, one of the NTSB officials said.        
	A team from the US-based Boeing is also expected to scan the crash site and the aircrafts wreckage. Though the aircraft belongs to Air India, Boeing will be allowed to take home any part it feels may help in further improvement.

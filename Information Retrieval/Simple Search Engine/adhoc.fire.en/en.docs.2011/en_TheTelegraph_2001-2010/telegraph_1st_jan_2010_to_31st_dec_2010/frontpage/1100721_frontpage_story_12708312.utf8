The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blessed by Delhi, Omar powerless in kingdom
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Blessed by Delhi, Omar powerless in kingdom
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Jawans stand guard on Tuesday outside a closed market in Srinagar during a strike called by separatists. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar, July 20: Sounds like a rumour that Omar Abdullah is the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir. Or that Mehbooba Mufti is leader of the Opposition. Or even that less than two years ago 70 per cent of the Valley had validated their faith in whats known as the Kashmiri mainstream.         
	Omar enjoys power, newly endorsed by New Delhi, but scarcely any authority beyond preserving his own safety. Mehbooba is in self-proclaimed exile, unsure of a foothold in the tide but happy to wink at the drift.         
	The people have vacated their mandate and gifted themselves to the flagellations of anarchy. This is the eve  or probably even the onset  of another disbanding of the political process in Kashmir and a lapse into chaos that will summon harder measures.         
	Whos to say the chief ministers writ runs when all the forces at his command cannot force the failure of bandh calls issued by shadowy separatists working out of Srinagars buzzing underground?         
	Whos to say he is in control when no more than a handful of masked boys on motorbikes are able to put the locks on everything but birds wings in this town? He calls government employees to work and they refuse to arrive. He calls schools and shops to open and they remain shut. He opens roads and theres no traffic to oblige. He imposes curfew and its peppered with defiance, he ends curfew and he gets a hail of stones. Whos to tell this is still his domain?         
	Whos to tell his National Conference (NC) swept Srinagar, winning all of its eight seats in the Assembly in the elections of 2008? Not one among them  and four, mind you, are ministers or high advisers of the government  can step into their constituencies and counsel and end the unceasing burst of brimstone from the neighbourhoods?         
	What Kashmirs peoples representatives have come to dread most are the people themselves. Hah! remarked a constituent in senior minister Ali Mohammed Sagars downtown Khanyar. Has he the guts to come here? Hes part of a killer government, his neck is on the block and he knows.         
	But then whos to say Omars political opponents are faring any better? Whos to say Mehbooba Mufti or her Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are under benefit from the governments discomfiture? She isnt reaping what Omar is every day losing.         
	The PDP isnt out anywhere churning wrath into political profit. Its offices lie as bereft and abandoned as the NCs, its cadres as dormant and scared. It isnt for lack of initiative or energy that Mehbooba hasnt employed her ranks to cash the discord and feed her votebank. She stands as outflanked by the gathering rage as the government itself.         
	We see no role for ourselves at the moment, theres too much anger and we cannot seem to do anything about it. What Mehbooba wont say is apparent in what she does: its the end of politics in the Valley, if only for a bitter and bloody while, and the resumption of confrontation between the State and the Street.         
	To a senior NC leader, powers centre of gravity has already rolled out of Srinagar and located itself in what he calls a dangerous address named New Delhi. The signs have become apparent to him: the visit of Union home secretary G.K. Pillai, the directives from North Block to take the situation in hand, Omars own trip to Delhi to seek support and reassurance. Say what you will, he argues, but this show has already slipped out of local hands.         
	Its been our history, he says, the worst sin a Kashmiri leader can commit is to get New Delhis blessings, and Omar got it last week. He will increasingly be seen as Delhis man lording over Kashmir, not a Kashmiri governing his people. Sure Delhi is backing him, but it might be backing him to his grave. Not that the Kashmiri street is in any mood to spare him that fate. Rumour is, theyve already begun to dig.

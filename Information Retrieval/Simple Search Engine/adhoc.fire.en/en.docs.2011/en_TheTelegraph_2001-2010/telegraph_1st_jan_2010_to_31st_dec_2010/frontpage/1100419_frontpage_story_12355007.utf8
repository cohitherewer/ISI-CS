          OUR BUREAU                                        
	April 18: Sunanda Pushkar today offered to surrender her Kochi sweat equity and quit Rendezvous Sports in what seemed an attempt by the Shashi Tharoor camp to make a virtue out of necessity.        
	Had Sunanda not chosen to give up her sweat equity in Rendezvous, which led the consortium that won the IPL Kochi bid, she and the franchise were likely to have run into charges of irregularities.        
	The rules say sweat equity can be allotted to a companys employees and directors but consortium sources have clarified that Sunanda is not an employee but a hired professional. She herself has used the word consultant, a position she seems to have now resigned.        
	Unlisted companies like IPL Kochi cannot issue more than 15 per cent of the paid-up capital in a year or shares with a value of more than Rs 5 crore, whichever is higher, without prior approval from the Centre. Sunanda is said to hold an 18 per cent stake in Rendezvous, translating into an indirect stake of 4.5 per cent in the Kochi IPL, with an estimated paper value of Rs 70 crore.        
	The eligibility of Sunanda to receive the sweat equity would have had to be vetted and cleared by an independent valuer.        
	 Besides, had the allocation been found inappropriate, the company would have had to buy back the equity from her  all of which ensured that it was better to surrender now than run into a maze of legal problems later.        
	Although most people saw the surrender as an attempt to relieve the political pressure on Tharoor, her lawyer Ashish Mehta claimed it had nothing to do with the junior foreign minister.        
	Sunanda was said to have taken the decision yesterday, but it was announced shortly after Tharoor explained his position to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Sunandas statement, read out by Mehta, said the 48-year-old Dubai-based business executive was shocked to find certain vested interests questioning her credentials just because she was a woman. She said she was voluntarily giving up her stake because of the unpleasant publicity and the wild and malicious reporting of recent days.        
	Tharoor and Sunanda have both denied she was given the free equity as a proxy for the minister.        
	Sunandas statement suggested she was being targeted because of her gender and stressed her Kerala connections and sympathies  themes Tharoor has been emphasising while defending his own role in the Kochi IPL bid.        
	As a woman professional, I am shocked to find how easily certain parties with vested interests questioned my credentials mainly because I am a woman. I, therefore, voluntarily offer to return to Rendezvous the sweat equity they had offered me, her statement said.        
	 I do not intend to seek compensation for the efforts I have made so far for them (the consortium). As a mother of a half-Malayali son, I wish Kerala cricket well and I hope this team succeeds handsomely in IPL-4 and in the years to come.        
	The father of Sunandas 13-year-old son was her now-deceased second husband, Sujit Menon, a Dubai-based Malayali businessman.        
	Last week, Sunanda had said in a statement the free equity was awarded to her because of the business expertise she could bring to the franchise as a consultant. In view of my extensive international experience as a business executive, marketing manager and entrepreneur, I was invited to assist Rendezvous particularly in the areas of fund-raising, networking event management and brand building, she had said.        
	Because this is a start-up effort, I was told that in lieu of a salary they would grant me minor equity in Rendezvous in return for my efforts.

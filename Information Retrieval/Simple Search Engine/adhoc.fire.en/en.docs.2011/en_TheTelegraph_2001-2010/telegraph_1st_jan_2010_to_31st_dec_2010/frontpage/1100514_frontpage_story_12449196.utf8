	Lahore, May 13 (PTI): A court has allowed a woman to marry her fianc who is currently on death row in a prison in this eastern Pakistani city and directed authorities to make arrangements for the wedding.        
	Justice Ijaz Ahmed Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court yesterday accepted Laiba Sahers plea to be allowed to marry her fianc, Muhammad Attique, who was given the death sentence and is incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat jail.         
	However, the judge did not allow Saher to take a wedding band inside the jail.        
	 He directed the prisons superintendent to arrange for a nikha khwan (marriage registrar) to conduct the wedding. Saher was engaged to Attique in her childhood.         
	She told the judge that she wanted to marry Attique but the jail authorities were not allowing her to do so.         
	The jail superintendent submitted a report that said Antique was a hardened and desperate criminal against whom more than 10 cases of heinous crimes like kidnapping for ransom and murder were pending in different courts.         
	Pakistans prison rules did not have any provision for arranging a prisoners marriage inside a jail, the report said.

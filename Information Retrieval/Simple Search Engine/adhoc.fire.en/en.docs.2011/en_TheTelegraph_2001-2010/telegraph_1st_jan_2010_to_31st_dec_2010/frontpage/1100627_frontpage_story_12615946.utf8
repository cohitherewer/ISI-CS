  - Calcutta to Canada: One protest torments a city but gets exposed, another keeps world leaders on toes         OUR BUREAU                      Auto-rickshaws ply near Park Circus during the strike on Saturday.   Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                
	Calcutta, June 26: Paribartaner haowa today caught an auto-rickshaw to ride to town.        
	Auto unions, once the preserve of the Left, defied the transport strike called by Citu and plied in many parts of Calcutta.        
	Not that commuters did not suffer but the three-wheeler rebellion somewhat cushioned the blow and mirrored the political shift that has been taking place in Bengal over the past few years.        
	What was unfolding on the roads was a reflection of a switchover. Many auto drivers have switched allegiance from Citu, the CPMs labour arm that had set them up in business and allowed them a run unhindered by the constraints of the law, to a relatively new union blessed by the Trinamul Congress.        
	In sharp contrast with earlier strikes when autos stayed off the roads, the three-wheeler operators did brisk business on Saturday and sometimes openly challenged Citu.        
	At Lake Market this morning when a handful of flag-waving Citu activists stopped an auto full of passengers, the union got a taste of the change. The frightened passengers responded as usual and hastened to climb out of the three-wheeler, but the driver stood his ground.        
	Let us see if you can break my auto, the driver shot back when the Citu activists threatened to damage his vehicle.                    A strike supporter tries to stop an auto. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya    
	Taken aback by the open show of defiance, the Citu activists let him off with a warning.        
	A Citu leader of Salt Lake, Prabhat Chatterjee, admitted: The auto unions have gone over to the Opposition to a large extent. Dont you understand, its the paribartaner haowa (the winds of change). People are switching sides.        
	In places such as Gariahat, Park Circus, Sealdah, Burrabazar, Ultadanga, Phoolbagan, Beliaghata and Salt Lake, the three-wheeler ferried passengers on a day buses, taxis and trams stayed away because of the Citu-sponsored strike against the fuel price increase.        
	Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, Trinamul MLA and president of the three-year-old Auto Drivers Association, said todays large turnout of autos proved that his partys union had managed to reduce the Citu-controlled one to a non-entity.         
	We are happy that the winds of change have started blowing across the transport sector as well, Chattopadhyay said.        
	Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh did not dismiss outright Chattopadhyays claim. There is no denying the fact that autos plied in large numbers today. It appears that many decided to ignore our strike, Ghosh said.        
	That a section did assert its right to work and refused to be intimidated are welcome steps but the key reason behind the switchover need not augur well for the rule of the law.        
	If Citu and the CPM once looked the other way or actively encouraged auto drivers to break the law and behave as they pleased, Trinamul stood by them during a standoff over dumping polluting vehicles. Eventually, the autos relented but not before several attempts had to be aborted because of the political patronage the operators enjoyed.        
	Citus reluctance to unleash the full might of its enforcers, possibly fearing another voter backlash, also helped the adventurous autos to run today. Fewer Citu supporters were seen on the streets today than on other strike days.        
	Citu activists did stop the stray taxi and force out passengers and made a few autos and buses turn back. But at key points like the Gariahat crossing, the Shyambazar five-point crossing, Moulali and Park Circus, where Citu supporters have invariably flexed their muscles in the past, they were hardly visible.         
	Citu leader Ghosh said: We did not deploy our men to enforce the strike this time. Instead, we had left it to people to make the strike a success since the fuel price hike affects everyone.         
	Not that the auto drivers were doing community service. They did charge many times the normal fare. There may be fewer Citu supporters, but the risk element is still there. So why wont we charge extra? asked an auto driver on the Sealdah-Beliaghata-Bamonghata route.        
	But passengers were not complaining. I usually curse the autos because of the traffic jams they cause. But I want to thank them today. It is the only way I will reach office, said 26-year-old Anita Basu as she alighted in front of Kalighat Metro station.

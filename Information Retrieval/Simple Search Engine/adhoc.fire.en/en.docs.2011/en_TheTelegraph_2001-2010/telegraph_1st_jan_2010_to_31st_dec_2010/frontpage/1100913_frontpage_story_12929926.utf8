The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Salman sorry for 26/11 hype barb 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Salman sorry for 26/11 hype barb 
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 12: The comment was dabangg (fearless) but the apology was uncharacteristically swift.        
	Salman Khan came under fire today for telling a Pakistani channel that the hype around 26/11 owed to elite people being targeted, but said sorry as politicians gunned for him.        
	Family sources linked the swiftness of the apology partly to Salmans anxiety to protect the market for his film Dabangg which has had a blockbuster opening, but denied that the original comment was made to help promote the film in Pakistan.        
	Salman accused Pakistans Express TV of twisting his comments. Footage of the interview shows Salman saying: Too much hype has been created around the 26/11 attacks because elite people were targeted. Attacks have happened in trains and small towns too, but no one talked about it so much.        
	The actors apology says: I gave an interview about three weeks ago. Now it has been twisted around and the way it is coming across on TV, it sounds insensitive. I was just saying that all lives are equal... gareeb aadmi ho, aamir aadmi ho (rich or poor).        
	It adds: I did not mean to hurt anyones sentiment and if I have hurt anybodys sentiment, I am really sorry.        
	A similar distinction between the vulnerable citizen and the security-cocooned VIP had sparked public fury at politicians immediately after the 26/11 attacks, but today the politicians were at Salmans throat. The Shiv Sena, Samajwadi Party, BJP and deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal (NCP) were united in condemnation.        
	Yet Salman found an unusual ally in Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, known for his strident Hindutva and regional-identity politics. What Salman has said... about elite people is correct. I have been saying the same thing too. When the train blasts took place in Mumbai, why was there nobody at the Gateway of India to light candles? Salman need not have apologised, Raj told The Telegraph.        
	Born to a Brahmin mother and Pathan father, Salman was celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi at home when the news broke. The Khans celebrate Id, Ganesh Chaturthi and Christmas at their home, which attracts Bollywoods whos who during these festivals every year.        
	As TV aired reports of his comment and criticism began pouring in, distributors and exhibitors began calling, a source close to Salmans family said. The fear was that Dabanggs collections would be hurt. If Dabangg took a beating, then Salmans brother Arbaaz would also be hit. Dabangg is Arbaazs first production, the source said.        
	Salmans father, scriptwriter Salim Khan, told the media the actor would apologise. Salim saab told Salman to be a man and apologise as it was not so much what he had said but how people had perceived his remark, the source said. So Salman went straight ahead and apologised. It is very uncharacteristic of him. But he is truly secular at heart and the way the Pakistani channel projected the remark upset him.        
	Arbaaz dismissed grapevine buzz about a link between Salmans 26/11 comment on Pakistani TV and the possible release of Dabangg in that country. The film is not being released in Pakistan, he said.        
	A top Bollywood distributor, though, said the producers were keen to release the film in Pakistan but added: It would not be fair to say the comment was made with an eye on the films possible release in Pakistan.        
	Writer Shobhaa De tweeted that Salmans statement smacks of arrogance, ignorance and plain stupidity. A lame apology wont do, Sallubhai. Boycott Dabangg!        
	Salmans reaction on Facebook: She is Appealing to people to boycott DABANGG.... Please Send her good tweets!!

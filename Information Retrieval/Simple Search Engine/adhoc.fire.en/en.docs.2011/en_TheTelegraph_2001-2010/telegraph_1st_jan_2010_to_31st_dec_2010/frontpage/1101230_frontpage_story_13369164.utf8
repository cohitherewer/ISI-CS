	Lucknow, Dec. 29: Ten-year-old Sushma Verma didnt want cakes for Christmas, she wanted a college education. Now.        
	Lucknow Universitys admission committee played Santa last evening, making the daily-wage earners daughter the institutions youngest ever student.        
	It had little choice. Sushma, born on February 7, 2000, had passed her Class X boards in 2007 at the age of seven with 59 per cent marks. That made her one of the worlds youngest ever matriculates, say her former schoolteachers.        
	She failed her Class XII exams last year but cleared it with a score of 62 per cent in May this year from St Miraj Inter College, where her father is paid a daily wage as a casual employee.        
	After several colleges rejected her because of her age, the CMS Girls Degree College admitted her provisionally to its BSc course in August. Sushma was waiting for the university to clear her application.        
	It took us four months to clear it because the matter was referred to the university legal cell and then to the vice-chancellors office, university spokesperson S.K. Dwivedi said.        
	We found out that the university never had any lower age limit for admission to undergraduate courses, unless its a professional course. So, we could not object.        
	Father Tej Bahadur Singh Verma, 48, who studied only till higher secondary, is over the moon. Were poor, but its a day to remember for me. God willing, my daughter will become a science graduate at the age of 13, he said.        
	If she does that, she will have outdone her brother Shailendra Verma, now 17, who had enrolled in a Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) course in a private college at the age of 11 in 2004.        
	Sushma, a girl with sparkling eyes who loves computers and mathematics, said: I was a little worried initially, but now Im happy that I wont have to waste a year.        
	Her former teachers said she had completed a micro-processor computer survey course when she was just seven-and-a-half.        
	Eventually, I want to become a doctor. After completing BSc, I will appear in the pre-medical admission test, Sushma said.        
	She will have to wait four years before she can take the test, though, unless the Medical Council of India agrees to waive the rules. Sushma had contacted Kanpur University, which conducts the Combined Pre-Medical Test (CPMT), this year but was told she must wait till she turns 17.        
	Her self-taught brother Shailendra had passed his Class XII exams from the National Open School, without teachers or private tuition. Then, aged 11, he had cleared Americas Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and TOEFL and secured admission to a Bachelor of Computer Science programme at a US university. But his father was too poor to send him to America.        
	So, Shailendra enrolled for a BCA with a private college here and in 2007, got admitted to the Masters in Computer Application course, aged 14. But poverty forced him to drop out, Tej Bahadur said ruefully. The teen is a wizard with computers and now designs websites.        
	Indias best-known prodigy, perhaps, is Tathagat Tulsi of Bihar who followed up on his initial promise to become an assistant professor at IIT Mumbai last year, aged 22.        
	Tulsi had completed his schooling at nine and earned a BSc at 10. He did his MSc at 12 and received a PhD from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, at 21.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: Mamata Banerjee today announced a pay hike and bonus for employees of wagon-makers Burn Standard and Braithwaite, the Puja double bounty coming four months after the railway ministry took over the two Bengal PSUs.        
	A senior rail official said the pay revision, effective from October 1, would push up monthly salaries at the firms by Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,000 on average. The raise will be topped with a one-time bonus of around Rs 3,500.         
	Braithwaite has 250 employees and Burn Standard 900. Burn Standard turned sick 16 years ago. Braithwaite had been bleeding too but had returned to profit in the past few years.        
	The railways issued a statement saying wage pacts at the two firms, transferred in June from the heavy industry ministry, were being finalised.         
	A senior leader of Mamatas Trinamul Congress was quick to see gains from the move in the Bengal polls next summer. Our leader has not only revived the companies, she has also given the workers a better deal. This will surely help our party, he said.         
	The firms, starved of orders until they were taken over, now have enough to supply to the railways.

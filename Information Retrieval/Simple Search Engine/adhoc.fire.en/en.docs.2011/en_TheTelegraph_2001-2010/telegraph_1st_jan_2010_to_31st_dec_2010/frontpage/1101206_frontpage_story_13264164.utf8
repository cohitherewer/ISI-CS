The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Daal not enough? Grow them abroad, says Pawar
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Daal not enough? Grow them abroad, says Pawar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Sharad Pawar                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: Few politicians can match Sharad Pawar when it comes to having ones finger on the aam aadmis pulse, er pulses.        
	At a time Indian entrepreneurs are manufacturing Jaguars and Landrovers abroad, the Union agriculture and food minister wants them to cultivate daal overseas.        
	That would not only help fulfil the growing domestic demand for lentils, Pawar declared today, but also curb the environment-unfriendly dependence on animal proteins.        
	At the sixth Agriwatch Global Pulses Summit here, Pawar asked the delegates to ponder over the viability of Indians leasing land abroad for growing pulses and exporting it back to India.        
	He praised the Indian agricultural entrepreneurs who had already attempted growing lentils in Africa and South America, saying: Such efforts need to be supported.        
	The minister made it clear that while the government would not invest in buying land abroad, his ministry would act as a facilitator if the private players show interest in this.        
	But the veteran politician took care to allay fears that his call might lead to a competitive disadvantage for domestic farmers.        
	To clear any misgivings about our import policy vis-a-vis pulses, I must mention that our import policies are linked to... the principle of balancing the farmers interest in a manner that the prices are not distorted and the Indian farmer continues to get a good return for his produce, he said.        
	Although India is the worlds largest producer, importer and consumer of daal, the land under lentil cultivation has been stagnant at 23-24 million acres for years. The yield (around 600kg a hectare) is less than half the global average and the per capita availability, at about 16kg, is one-fifth lower than what nutritionists recommend.        
	The poor, who traditionally fell back on daal whenever vegetables got too expensive, now find lentils increasingly out of their reach because of high open-market prices and unmitigated food inflation.        
	According to the governments assessment, the demand-supply mismatch that is pushing up prices is unlikely to stabilise until 2011-2012.        
	Myanmar and Canada, the big lentil-growing countries from where India imports, are shifting more towards corn and oilseeds. The uncertainty of lentils availability has prompted the National Advisory Council to exclude them from the ambit of the proposed food security law that recommends giving people a legal entitlement to subsidised food grains (wheat, rice and millets).        
	Making a pitch for lentil cultivation, Pawar said: From the environmental point of view also, consumption of pulses is more beneficial than (that of) meat products.... Pulses are the most efficient natural foods for production of proteins.        
	He emphasised that as primary protein producers, lentils only harness natural elements like sunlight, soil nutrients and water while cattle and pigs consume 7kg and 4kg of grain per animal, respectively, to produce 1kg of beef or pork.

  - How breakthrough got   derailed in December         OUR BUREAU                                           
	Darjeeling, March 16: The Gorkhaland issue could have been resolved, at least for the time being, on December 21 itself had the Centre not promised in haste statehood to Telangana, information collected by The Telegraph suggests.        
	It was generally believed that the Telangana decision had breathed fresh life into the Gorkhaland campaign. But it was not known till now how Delhis decision had an immediate and direct impact on Bengal and how close the three sides had been to a breakthrough.        
	All parties concerned  the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, the Bengal government and the Centre  had more or less accepted a central draft formula that was disclosed by the hill outfit yesterday, state government sources said today.        
	The draft, which mooted an authority with greater autonomy and under the direct control of the governor, was informally circulated among the three parties two weeks before tripartite talks were held on December 21 in Darjeeling.        
	However, on December 9  a few days after the draft was given out  the Centre muddled the situation by promising to initiate the process to form a Telangana state. Till today, it has not been conclusively established what prompted Union minister P. Chidambaram  many see the hand of the Congress leadership  to make such an announcement.        
	The stunning announcement not only ignited a backlash in Andhra but also made it untenable for the Morcha to agree to anything less than full statehood, the sources said. Till then, the three parties discussing the Gorkhaland issue had managed to arrive at a tentative agreement that the draft would be tabled at the December 21 talks and then discussed to iron out the finer points.        
	In general, the central governments draft proposal had been agreed to by all the parties concerned, an official said. It had, in principle, been accepted. But, of course, there was room for bargaining by all sides concerned.         
	However, Chidambarams announcement on December 9 forced the Morcha to raise the stakes and stick to its demand for a separate state.         
	The only clause the state government was in disagreement with was the last one, which stated Gorkhaland Personnel would be considered for recruitment in the police, army and the paramilitary forces.         
	The sources said even this clause was subject to discussion and the state government was willing to go ahead with the Centres proposal as it would bring peace and stability to the hills.         
	It was almost as though the entire deal with the Morcha had been sealed, an official said. But suddenly came the Telangana statehood announcement and it got the back of the Morcha up and it hiked its stakes, thinking that a Gorkhaland state could actually become a reality.         
	This prompted the Morcha to prevent Union home secretary G.K. Pillai from tabling the Centres proposal at the December 21 tripartite talks.        
	Suddenly, the Morchas mood seemed to have totally changed, an official present at the talks said. It was a deal we had all thought was virtually signed and sealed. But the prospect of statehood had become so real for the Morcha that it would not hear any more of the deal that had, for all practical purposes, been struck with the Centre. Now it is back to the drawing board.        
	After this, the Morcha drew up its secret proposal, virtually proposing a state within a state. State government officials said the Morchas virtual statehood proposal was unacceptable.        
	The state government, sources said, is hoping that during the March 18 talks in Delhi, the Centre will impress upon the Morcha that the Telangana state will not easily happen and will try to revive the December proposal.

	Srinagar, Sept. 17: Dilshada, two months pregnant, had just stepped out of her house in Srinagars Old City on Wednesday to get some fresh air when the screams of local residents being chased by security forces enforcing a strict curfew forced her to get back in.        
	She stumbled but managed to rush in only to complain that she had some complication. She said it was manageable and there was no need to see a doctor, said a family member of the 25-year-old.         
	The next morning she had some bleeding. We became worried and tried to take her to Lal Ded but the security forces outside did not allow us despite our pleas.        
	Lal Ded is the only maternity hospital in the Valley. The family later managed to take her to a small hospital at Rainawari through some alleys behind their house.        
	But doctors told us that she had already had a miscarriage. Perhaps, if we had reached Lal Ded in time, it could have been avoided. Perhaps it was destined, the family member said.        
	Lost in the din of deaths of young boys, killed in clashes with security forces, is the suffering of many such families made prisoners in their homes by the round-the-clock curfew since Sunday. The three-month agitation has left 97 dead, three of whom died today defying the curfew at Pattan, Budgam and Shopian.        
	Curfews are not new to the Valley. But its harshest version, in force after the violence on Id, has turned the Valley into a big jail. A large number of people have no access to medicines or other essentials such as milk.        
	This is martial law. Not even a crumb of any food item has entered Srinagar in the last six days, said Jan Mohammad Kaul, president of the Kashmir Traders Federation. Life-saving drugs like Insulin have dried up. Forget about honouring the valid curfew passes issued to us by the government, security forces are not even allowing chemists to open.        
	In curfews and shutdowns in the past, supplies continued to reach Kashmir, Kaul said.         
	The Old Citys residents are the worst sufferers in the curfew being imposed round the clock.        
	That means no milk and no vegetables, said a retired government school teacher. As if it was not enough, the CRPF is spreading panic by breaking our windows, using stones thrown by catapults, he alleged.        
	The authorities, however, said they are taking care to prevent hardships to people. For any assistance regarding emergency health aid, essential needs like baby food, etc. and marriage, families have been asked to contact the local SHOs, a police spokesperson said.

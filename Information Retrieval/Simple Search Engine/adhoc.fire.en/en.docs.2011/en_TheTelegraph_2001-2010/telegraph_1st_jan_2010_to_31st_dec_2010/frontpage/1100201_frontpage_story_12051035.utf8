The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Morcha lifts liquor ban in hills
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Morcha lifts liquor ban in hills
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Jan. 31: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has decided to lift the ban on sale of liquor in the Darjeeling hills from tomorrow, ending the fiat that was put into force from November 7.         
	The ban on the entry of illegal liquor from Sikkim will, however, stay in force, as it has since August 4 last year.         
	Morcha spokesperson Harka Bahadur Chhetri said: The party has decided to lift the ban on the sale of liquor in the hills from tomorrow. However, the ban on the entry of illegal liquor from Sikkim will continue.         
	The announcement effectively means that all bars, off-shops and licensed country liquor shops across the hills will remain open. Chhetri, however, did not provide any reason for the sudden lifting of the ban.        
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung had given a call for the ban on the sale of liquor, except on traditional drinks, saying the state exchequer had collected Rs 40 to Rs 50 crore during Puja and Diwali from the sale of liquor in the hills. Sources in the excise department had, however, put the figure at Rs 3 crore per month.         
	Tourists, however, had been allowed to bring their own liquor during the ban.         
	Even though the Morcha did not cite any reason for lifting the ban, observers believe that it is largely because of the partys realisation that the ban was impossible to execute. It was common knowledge that many shops were selling liquor by smuggling them in.        
	The ban only turned out to be an unpopular move as liquor prices in the black market soared overnight, said an observer.        
	Restaurant owners are likely to be relieved as they had reported a drop of almost 40 per cent in their revenue earnings because of the ban.

	Islampur/Raiganj, July 9: Jailed Bangladeshi infiltrator Malati Barmans tearful plea had moved an Indian court to use a UN convention, in the absence of an Indian law, to let her visit her children at their juvenile shelter every week.        
	But Bangladesh has proved less flexible or sympathetic than Calcutta High Court towards its own citizens. It separated Malati and her husband Madan from their two minor children, citing red tape, the moment the couple set foot on home soil.        
	When Malati and Madan were pushed back into Bangladesh on June 30 after serving out their terms in Islampur jail, North Dinajpur, Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) refused to let in Krishna, 14, and Anima, 12.        
	BDR officers claimed the order from Dhaka mentioned only the parents and not the children, BSF sources said. Krishna and his sister Anima have been sent to a government home in Raiganj.        
	We requested the BDR officers to let the children in on humanitarian grounds but they refused, said a BSF officer who was present at the pushback at Fulbari border in Jalpaiguri district.        
	 Both the parents were crying and wailing. It was a very sad moment even for us, the officer added.        
	North Dinajpur district magistrate Sunil Dandapat and superintendent of police Milan Kanti Das said the matter had been taken up with the Bangladesh deputy high commission in Calcutta.        
	Its been the Indians who have all along gone out of their way to unite the parents with their children ever since the family was caught crossing the border in Sujali, North Dinajpur, in September 2007.        
	After the parents were lodged in Islampur sub-jail and the children in government shelters in Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar, the Islampur sub-divisional court had in December 2007 turned down Malatis plea to let her visit her children.         
	It said Indian law did not provide for meetings when both the parents and the children were in custody.        
	But Feroz Ahmed, a local lawyer who was in the court at that time, was moved by Malatis tears and, on his own, appealed to the high court on her behalf.        
	In April 2008, the high court made such meetings legal by creating a new rule based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.        
	It is one of their basic human rights and should not be denied, Justice Ashim Kumar Roy had said in the judgment.        
	Our parents used to visit us every Sunday (in India), Krishna said. He and Anima are unsure if they would ever see their parents again.        
	We were not allowed to accompany them back to our village in Dharmapur. The (BDR) officers said we would all be reunited in a day or two, but its now been more than a week, the boy said.         
	My brother keeps telling me that sir (the homes principal) is trying hard to get us back home in Bangladesh, Anima said, but I have told him we would wait for a day or two and then return home on our own. If we stay here, we will never see our parents.        
	The principal of the Suryodaya home in Raiganj, Parthasarathi Das, said Krishna asked him every day about his and Animas fate. The social welfare department has taken the matter up with the Centre and we hope something will happen quickly, he said.        
	Dhaka should act promptly on humanitarian grounds, lawyer Ahmed said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Demolition Deepak devours on debut

  - On the Ranji board: Hyderabad 21 all out, 8 wickets for Rajasthan lad           RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                      Deepak Chahar in Jaipur.  Picture by Surendra Jain Paras                                
	Jaipur, Nov. 1: Cricket must seem an easy game to Deepak Chahar tonight  and a very treacherous one to Hyderabads batsmen.        
	The 19-year-old Chahar took eight wickets in 45 balls on debut today as Hyderabad collapsed to 21 all out against Rajasthan, recording the lowest total in the Ranji Trophys 77-year history and equalling the worst first-class score on Indian soil.        
	Chahar ended with figures of 7.3 overs, 2 maidens, 10 runs and 8 wickets.        
	Rajasthan coach Harish Joshi said: He has good length and line, and swings the ball both ways.        
	Thats what the teen must have done to good effect here this morning: he had three caught behind, three bowled and one lbw apart from one caught in the field.        
	Chahar, however, missed the bowling record for a Ranji debutant, which stays in the name of Maharashtras Vasant Ranjane who took 9 for 56 against Saurashtra in 1956-57.        
	I was not aware of having achieved anything until everybody started congratulating me. I am naturally very happy, and I am keen to become the highest wicket-taker for India, the shy young man with the big ambition told The Telegraph.        
	I have been working hard. Today I had favourable conditions; the pitch was right and none of the catches was dropped. It was good teamwork, he added modestly.        
	And perhaps, in a statistical anomaly, all the wafts ended up as edges instead of harmless play-and-miss; and whenever the batsmen missed, the ball was headed for the stumps. It also helped that Rajasthan skipper Hrishikesh Kantikar had read the wicket correctly and opted to field.                    
	No Hyderabad batsman reached double figures ---- the highest score being just six ---- although, surprisingly, there were only three ducks in their 78-minute, 93-ball essay. In a ruthless exhibition of parsimony, Chahar and new ball partner Pankaj Singh (2 for 11) gave away no extras at all.        
	Hyderabad, playing without V.V.S. Laxman, broke South Punjabs 75-year-old record of 22, scored against North India in 1934-35. They levelled the even older Indian first-class record by the Mohammedans, who were skittled for 21 by the Europeans in the Bombay Quadrangular in 1915-16.        
	The world first-class record is way below at 12. It was registered twice, by Oxford University against MCC in 1877 and by Northamptonshire against Gloucestershire in 1907.        
	The most recent such debacle was suffered by Surrey when Essex bowled them out for 14 in 1983. The lowest Test innings ever is 26, by New Zealand against England in 1955.        
	Chahar, son of a retired air force man, is from northern Rajasthans Hanumangarh district and has been playing junior cricket for the past 4-5 years. His talent was spotted while he was playing in the state under-16 championships.        
	He was not excited after his feat today; he took it all very calmly. That is his plus point. He has the right attitude and temperament, coach Joshi said, adding: He is a brilliant all-rounder too.        
	Chahar has been slotted at No. 8 in the batting order but with Rajasthan 220 for two at stumps, already 199 ahead, its anyones guess whether he will get a chance to prove the coach right, at least in this game.

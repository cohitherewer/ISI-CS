The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rahul bats for tribal rights
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rahul bats for tribal rights
          SANJAY K JHA                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Rahul Gandhi today focused on tribals and land acquisition in his suggestions on the resolutions the Congress will adopt at the plenary, choosing to ignore the WikiLeaks revelations and not uttering a word on the RSS or communalism.        
	The party and the government need to revisit their policies to address the random dispossession of tribals, the general secretary said in a brief intervention at the subjects committee meeting, where draft resolutions are approved and amendments proposed.        
	The Congress should work to strengthen tribal rights and also ensure that land is not acquired from farmers without consent, Rahul said.        
	These sentiments will be reflected in the political and economic resolutions, which will lay emphasis on the social sector, welfare schemes and the pro-people thrust in policy-making. Although the party will support economic reforms, the focus on the poor, agriculture and social inequalities will get sharper.        
	Rahul, who will be the main speaker on the political resolution at the plenary, shut out the WikiLeaks controversy on his views on the threat from Hindu fundamentalist groups and did not comment even when senior leader Digvijay Singh broached the subject of alleged RSS involvement in terror activities.        
	The decision is being seen as part of a strategic move to act tough on fundamentalist outfits without fanfare. There will undoubtedly be a very tough stand on the RSSs links with terror but there is no need to make a noise, a leader said. The resolution is not very strident, the leader added, stressing that it talks about religious fundamentalist forces and not terror.        
	Rahul suggested that the description of the Babri Masjid demolition as an act of vandalism in the political resolution should be changed to criminal act. He stressed that the 1992 demolition was more than just vandalism.        
	The speakers on the political resolution can, if they like, take a tougher stand on the Sangh parivar than is reflected in the formal resolution, sources said.        
	Todays meeting was attended by all working committee members, state unit chiefs, legislature party leaders, front organisation heads and drafting committee members.         
	Sonia Gandhi hailed the head of the drafting committee, Pranab Mukherjee, who has been doing this job for decades, for excellent work.               
	The draft resolutions were circulated among the leaders present and anyone who had a suggestion was allowed to speak. Certain amendments are being made to the resolutions.         
	The draft political resolution iterates the partys known positions on Naxalism, cross-border terrorism and foreign affairs.         
	On the question of coalitions, it says the party will enter into alliances with like-minded parties wherever required without compromising on its basic ideology. At the same time, it calls upon workers to strengthen the Congress in states without being hemmed in by coalition compulsions.         
	Leaders from Bengal and Kerala demanded a sharper attack on the Left in the resolution which has focused on the BJP.         
	The draft political resolution takes a tough stand on corruption. Sonia objected to suggestions that it should include a commitment to zero tolerance of corruption. Zero tolerance, she argued, was an American clich and the expression that there will be no compromise on probity in public life was better, sources said. The resolution, which will be debated tomorrow when the open session begins, also accuses other parties of duplicity on the corruption issue.         
	The omission of any reference to the Non-Aligned Movement and Palestine in the draft foreign policy resolution was taken up by Mani Shankar Aiyar, who said India was one of the founding leaders of NAM and a staunch supporter of the Palestine cause. Several other speakers supported him, forcing the leadership to direct Anand Sharma, who had drafted the resolution, to make amends.

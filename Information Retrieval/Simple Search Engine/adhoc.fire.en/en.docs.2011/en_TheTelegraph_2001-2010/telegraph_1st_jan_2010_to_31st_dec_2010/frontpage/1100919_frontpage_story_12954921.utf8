     DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY
    
	Balikhali (Kakdwip), Sept. 18: Sitting on the veranda of her hut in this South 24-Parganas hamlet, Johora Bibi, 40, says her battle has just begun. 
    
	It was the illiterate womans persistence in pursuing the disappearance of stepdaughter Tahira Khatun (mistakenly referred to as Zarina in todays edition) that forced the police to acknowledge to the high court that over 2,500 teenaged girls had vanished from Bengal last year, apparently because of rampant trafficking.
    
	Tahira, who Johora says was kidnapped by a relative on April 15 last year when she was 15, is just one of the 2,500 and her story is therefore the tip of the iceberg.
    
	Tahiras father Khater Bhisti, 61, says he is too preoccupied with earning a living by selling fish and has left it to Johora to fight the battle to get Tahira back home.
    
	Heres Johoras account of her struggle, and the help she received from Rafique Ahmed Dorji, the clerk of a lawyer who practises at Kakdwip subdivisional court:
       
	Tahira is my stepdaughter. Her mother Samira, who lives with us, lost her mental balance over 10 years ago and doesnt talk to anyone. I am sure she misses her daughter, but she is in no state to do anything.
    
	Our ordeal began on April 15 last year, a couple of hours after Tahira had left to watch the circus that had come to our village a few days earlier.
    
	With her was her bhabi Jasmina, Samiras daughter-in-law. They left hand-in-hand, chatting happily.
    
	When Jasmina returned alone, I thought Tahira may have stopped on the way to chat with a friend. But somehow, the strange expression on Jasminas face worried me.
    
	She said she didnt know where Tahira was  the two of them had got separated in the crowd.
    
	From the way she said it, I knew straightaway that she was lying.
    
	As I questioned her, our neighbour Mahitun Bibi rushed in to say she had seen Tahira climb into an Ambassador. She said she had seen Jasmina standing by the car and watching.
    
	Jasmina denied this for a while but before our persistent questioning, she blurted out the truth. She said her father Kaush Mir and her elder sister had taken Tahira away. She did not know where.
 
	She said Kaush Mir had told her to bring Tahira along to the circus. When she did, Mir asked Tahira to get into the car, promising her something, and sped away with her. She swore she didnt know where Mir had taken Tahira.
    
	My husband and I couldnt sleep that night. Being illiterate, I did not know what to do. My husband, too, is a simple man and was at a loss about how to go about finding Tahira.
    
	But I realised one thing: if we had to make any headway, we needed to get in touch with someone educated, someone who knew the ways of the world. I thought of Rafique.
    
	The next day, Rafique took us to the local police station at Dhola and we lodged a complaint against six persons including Mir, his wife and his daughter. But, just as we had heard before, we quickly found out that the police had no time for the poor.
       
	They said they couldnt find any of the accused, even though everyone knew that Mir, a trader, was moving around freely.
    
	After a month, Rafique took us to the Kakdwip subdivisional judicial magistrates court. It was only under the courts orders that the police arrested Mir, his wife, his elder daughter and one of his neighbours.
    
	But strangely, they were out on bail within three weeks. I suspect the police had not seriously pressed charges against them.
    
	Rafique next took us to the circle inspector, then to the subdivisional police officer of Kakdwip, and finally to the district superintendent of police. Still, nothing happened. There was no trace of Tahira.
    
	On Rafiques advice, we moved the state womens commission, the state human rights commission and finally filed a writ petition in the high court. Rafique did everything, from drafting letters to delivering them.
    
	Im so happy that the high court (yesterday) asked the state government to produce Tahira before it by October 1. It was like a blessing from Allah.
    
	But I suspect the traffickers have taken Tahira to a big city in another part of the country, and I wonder if the state police can find her. I can only hope and pray they do.

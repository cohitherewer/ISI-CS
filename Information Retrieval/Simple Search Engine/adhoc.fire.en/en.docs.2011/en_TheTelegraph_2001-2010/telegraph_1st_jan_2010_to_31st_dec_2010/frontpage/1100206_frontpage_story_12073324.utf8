  - Operations on till outfit agrees to talk        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: A meeting of the top home ministry, intelligence bureau and Assam police officials today decided to continue anti-insurgency operations against Ulfa in Assam till the outfit agreed to talks.         
	The conclave came on the sidelines of the home ministrys meeting with state police and civil administration chiefs. It was a precursor to tomorrows chief ministers conference on internal security here.         
	The half-an-hour-long security meeting, chaired by home secretary G.K. Pillai, reviewed in detail the anti-Ulfa operations and the outfits response to home minister P. Chidambarams offer of dialogue.         
	Halting anti-Ulfa operations was ruled out since officials feared that such a move would offer the outfit an opportunity to regroup, as had happened a couple of years ago.         
	The issue of talks with Ulfa is likely to come up at the chief ministers conference, which will discuss terrorism, Naxalism, insurgency and modernisation of police and intelligence infrastructure.         
	Officials also reviewed activities of the Ranjan Daimary-led faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB).         
	Apart from Pillai, the meeting was attended by Assam director-general of police Shankar Barua and Centres interlocutor P.C. Haldar.         
	The home secretary is understood to have briefed other officials on his recent visit to Myanmar.         
	Pillai had been assured by Myanmars ruling military junta of their help in flushing out Northeast militants hiding in that country.         
	The ministry of home affairs has also called upon states to give high priority to police modernisation while allocating funds in their budgets.         
	The Centre has been forced to substantially increase the strength of its paramilitary forces, because the state forces cannot be augmented and modernised to the desired level, said a home ministry statement today after a consultative committee on police modernisation meeting on Thursday.

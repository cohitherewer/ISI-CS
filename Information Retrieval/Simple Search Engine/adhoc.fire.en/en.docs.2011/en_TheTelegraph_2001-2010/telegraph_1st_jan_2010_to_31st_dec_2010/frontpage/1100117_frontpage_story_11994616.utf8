The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Welcome to St Xaviers, PM (and nanaji) 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Welcome to St Xaviers, PM (and nanaji) 
          GUNEET SINGH                      Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the valedictory event of the 150th anniversary of St Xavier rsquo;s. Picture by Pabitra Das                           
	Calcutta, Jan. 16: Today was special for me, as a Xaverian and as a grandson.        
	When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said it was a great pleasure, a great honour, a great privilege to be at St Xaviers for the sesquicentenary celebrations, I watched him proudly from a distance.        
	I was proud not just as a Xaverian  I am a 2nd year student of mass communication  but as a family member. My naani (maternal grandmother) Pritam Kaur is the Prime Ministers younger sister.        
	The wait began a year ago. The sense of thrill and excitement was building up from when the Prime Minister had agreed to be part of the inaugural ceremony of the 150-year celebrations. But then he took ill.        
	I was heartbroken as a Xaverian and anxious as a grandson. The entire family  there are more than 20 of us in Calcutta  was praying for his speedy recovery. And thank God, he recovered quickly and resumed his duties.        
	Then began the countdown to the concluding ceremony of the sesquicentenary celebrations. Would he agree to come to our campus? Would he be able to make the time? Even after he had said yes and everything was set, would there be any last-minute hitch again?        
	All doubts were finally laid to rest when he strode into St Xaviers today, through the Park Street gate, at 4pm sharp.        
	I could not wait to welcome my nanaji, in the aisle, behind the stage.        
	Welcome to St Xaviers and thank you for coming here, I said and touched his feet.        
	He smiled warmly at me, blessed me and moved on towards the dais.        
	The brief meeting was more than I could ask for. He is the Prime Minister first and then my grandfather.        
	Being seated in the VIP block with my family  my parents, grandparents, uncles and cousin Rashmin Kaur (who is in her BBA 2nd year at Xaviers)  and watching him on the dais for such a special event in the history of such a grand institution was like a dream come true.        
	His words were simple but his thoughts significant. By referring to the glorious history of St Xaviers and its students  from Rabindranath Tagore to J.C. Bose to Jyoti Basu  he was urging todays students to strive for excellence and all-round growth.        
	Just before leaving the dais, he waved at us. My naani, her sister Gobind Kaur  the two sisters of the Prime Minister who live in Calcutta with their families  and all of us waved back. Our smiles said it all.        
	This is the place and these are the grounds I have been coming to every day for the past one-and-a-half years, but January 16, 4pm to 5pm, is something I will never forget.        
	As a Xaverian and as a grandson.

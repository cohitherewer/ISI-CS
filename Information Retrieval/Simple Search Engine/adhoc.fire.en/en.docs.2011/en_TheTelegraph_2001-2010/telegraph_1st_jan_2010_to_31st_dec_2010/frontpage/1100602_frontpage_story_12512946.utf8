	New Delhi, June 1: Overruling the state units demand to somehow manage numbers to form the government, the Congress high command gave the go-ahead for imposition of Presidents rule in Jharkhand today.         
	President Pratibha Patil accepted the cabinet recommendation and placed the state under central rule for the second time in two years.         
	The Assembly will be kept in suspended animation during Presidents rule. The Union cabinet met this morning and took the decision on the basis of the governors report, which clearly said no party or group was in a position to form a stable government.         
	The Soren government had been reduced to a minority on May 24 when BJP, with 18 MLAs and JD(U) with two, withdrew support.         
	The BJPs decision to snap ties with Soren who voted in Parliament for the Manmohan Singh government on cut motions moved by the Opposition on April 27 was followed by an ugly political bargain fraught with several flip-flops, compromises and betrayal but the arrangement finally collapsed. The Congress, which had initially adopted a hands-off policy to avoid getting into murky deals, also fell for the lust of power and tried in vain to sew up an alternative coalition.         
	Though the Congress high command was always worried about its image after the BJPs credibility took a huge beating in the state, its state unit argued the voters would detest the absence of a democratic government. The high command was, however, determined not to give the reins to the JMM and allowed the state unit to work out numbers in support of its own chief minister.         
	The party also tried to persuade ally Babulal Marandi to accept the deal but the ministerial ambitions of too many legislators derailed the efforts.        
	The Congress leaders have not yet lost hope of forming the government and feel that imposition of Presidents rule will enable them to create a much greater manoeuvring space as the governor belongs to the party.         
	The Congress, with a strength of 14, and its ally JVM with 11, will require 17 more MLAs to form the government. The party may make a fresh attempt to arrange numbers after the Bihar elections in October.        
	Jharkhand, which has seen seven governments since its creation on November 15, 2000, has suffered political instability and misgovernance for much of its 10-year-long existence. It went to polls in 2009 under Presidents rule, which became necessary after Soren failed to get elected to the Assembly. His inability to find a seat for himself was the prime reason for the political turmoil in the state this year.        
	Family intrigues and Soren losing clout were responsible for the fresh crisis. Even Sorens son and his daughter-in-law had refused to vacate their seats for him and his exit from the chief ministers office was a foregone conclusion.         
	Political observers now feel this spell of Presidents rule may herald the end of Sorens political career, as the chances of his returning as chief minister are remote. He could have planned to build a much better platform to propel his sons career, but the mess he has now left behind may open up gates for other political players to encroach upon the JMMs base.

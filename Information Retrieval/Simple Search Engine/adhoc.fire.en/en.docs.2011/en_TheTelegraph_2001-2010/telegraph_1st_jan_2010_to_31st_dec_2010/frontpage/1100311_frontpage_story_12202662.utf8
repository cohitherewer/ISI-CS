          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            A jawan patrols a forest in Bokaro district                                  
	Bokaro, March 10: The arrests of Maoist area commander Pandu Manjhi and his accomplice Bhuvaneshwar Singh have yielded rich dividend for the security forces who recovered a huge cache of explosives from the jungles of Nawadihs Uparghat zone today based on information provided by the two.         
	More than 1.2 tonne ammonium nitrate, packed in 25 polyester gunny bags, were recovered by security personnel during raids in Uparghat, Palamu, Sarubera and Manpur in the last 18 hours. The explosives had reportedly been ferried to Bokaro district from Lalgarh and Purulia in Bengal.         
	The explosives had been hidden under branches and dry leaves and the areas surrounding the hiding places had been mined by the rebels. The police reportedly took Bhuvaneshwar along during the search operation to ensure safe passage.         
	Meanwhile, a joint operation by the Khunti and Chaibasa police led to the recovery of a large quantity of arms and ammunition from Pindi in Khunti today. The operation was led by ASP Vijay Kumar. The police also recovered clothes, medicines, electronic equipment, can bombs and explosive boosters from a bunker.

	Sainthia (WB), Jul 20 (PTI): 20 unidentified bodies of train accident victims at Sainthia are being sent to a government hospital in neighbouring Burdwan district as the Suri Sadar Hospital did not have facilities for preservation.   
	The bodies would be preserved at the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital which had the necessary facilities, hospital sources said.   
	38 bodies have been handed over to family members of the deceased, while three still remained at the Suri hospital, the sources said.   
	They said five passengers succumbed to their injuries at the Burdwan hospital, but it was not known if the bodies were handed over to their kin.   
	Eastern Railway sources said that 83 passengers were under treatment at the Suri and Burdwan hospitals. 66 persons were killed when the Ranchi-bound Vananchal Express was hit from behind by Uttarbanga Express at Sainthia station in Birbhum district yesterday.

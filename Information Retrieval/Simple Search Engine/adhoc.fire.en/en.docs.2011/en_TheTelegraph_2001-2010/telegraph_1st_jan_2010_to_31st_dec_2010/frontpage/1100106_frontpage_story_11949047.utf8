                                Slapstick prank                            
	Madrid, Jan. 5 (Reuters): An unidentified hacker briefly hijacked Spains official website for its presidency of the EU, inserting a large smiling picture of comic character Mr Bean, an official said yesterday.        
	The supposed resemblance of the bumbling slapstick character played by British actor Rowan Atkinson to Spains Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has been a running joke in Spain for years.        
	A recent edition of leading newspaper El Pais printed a cartoon depicting Zapatero as Mr Bean above an article critical of the governments handling of the economy, in which unemployment has more than doubled to about 19 per cent.        
	An official at Zapateros office confirmed a security breach had affected the page (http://www.eu2010.es/) specially set up to mark Spains six-month presidency of the EU but added that no information at the site had been affected.        
	Newspaper El Mundo published a screenshot (http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/01/04/union_europea/1262610678.html) of Mr Beans appearance on the official webpage, adding that the character had greeted visitors to the Spanish government site with a cheerful Hi there!

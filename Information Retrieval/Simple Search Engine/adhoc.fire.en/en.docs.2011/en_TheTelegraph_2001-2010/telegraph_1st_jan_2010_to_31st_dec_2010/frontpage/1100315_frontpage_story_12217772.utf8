     SANKARSHAN THAKUR 
                    
	Calcutta, March 14: Edens lights didnt fail, Shah Rukh Khan didnt dance and his Knights didnt do their usual. 
    
	Amid Mexican waves rippling round the stands, they downed Bangalores Royal Challengers in probably the most facile victory of season three; unlike in Mumbai two nights ago, the Knights never looked like losing this one.
    
	The frailty of their opposition on the day encouraged Sourav Ganguly enough to give Rohan Gavaskar a bowl. Father Sunil, on commentary at the time, took a wicked crack at his son. Offered a comment, he quipped, Well, all I can tell you is I wouldnt mind facing him. 
    
	Gangulys men have two in two now, but they will do well to remain reminded of 2008. They are exactly where they were that first season  two out of their first two  and then they took a tumble they have yet to recover fully from.
    
	Shah Rukh Khan hasnt forgotten; no dancing, hes promised himself, not until his men have won five in a row. Im assured by Dav that we will win many more, he told the elated arena post-match. Souravs team must improve on their act to achieve that, tonights win notwithstanding.
    
	They were gifted this game more than they earned it. The Challengers batted leaden of feet and shackled of shoulders, barely able to get the ball away. There was some accusatory chatter in their dugout over the wickets drowsiness, but it was swiftly buried when the Knights came out to bat. The strip crackled under their ministrations. They got to a hundred in the 12th over and they hadnt even lost a wicket.
    
	Anil Kumbles Challengers were a mere 73 at that stage of their outing and had lost half the studded side. His stars all seemed set on a trek. Sreevats Goswami 8. Virat Kohli 2. Manish Pandey 0. Eoin Morgan 10. Rahul Dravid 21. 
    
	Jacques Kallis was the only one who stood there, an infallible column amid the ruins around him. He must have flown in first class from Johannesburg last night and slept well en route. He showed few signs of fatigue, tonking an unbeaten 65, and then opening the bowling for them. 
    
	But by then, the Knights had grabbed the initiative rather too completely for Kallis to turn things. Manoj Tiwary, picked Man of the Match for his blustery 50, and Brad Hodge began as if they wanted to be early for the Knights evening bash.
    
	Tiwary bludgeoned Kalliss second over for 14 and then immediately got after Dale Steyn, scooping him over mid-off for six and then a four and then another four. Kumble brought himself on at the other end, and received no mercy from Tiwary; he went for nine, including two rasping hits to the boundary on either side of Eden. Tiwary had suddenly climbed to 40 off 20, dwarfing the more reputable Brad Hodge at the other end.
    
	Shah Rukh Khan stirred out of circumspection and clapped. Then he eased a little more into himself, calmed by a couple of more hits to the fence, and air-kissed. The MC was belting korbo, lorbo, jeetbo, Eden was swinging.
    
	But Shah Rukh was still resolute in his vow not to dance. Even though he had good reason, and a better stage. He had won his place on the makeshift open-air deck with a tweeted dare to fire authorities mid-morning: Im not coming to Eden unless I have it. They gave in on their objections quite tamely and the buzz is the deck is there to stay for the duration of the Knights home outings.
    
	Nearly a quarter of the seats went unsold, though, and Shah Rukh hadnt ferried an entourage big enough to fill it up. Not even seats given away to the beautiful people backing Bangalore  a despondent Katrina Kaif among them  gave the hospitality box the bearing of a full house. Eden was another story, packed to its gills and roaring in delight as Dadas men proceeded to make short work of the opposition. 
    
	Both Tiwary and Hodge perished after getting quicksilver half tons, but theyd brought the Knights too close to the target for any real discomfort. Sourav scratched about to begin with and swung and missed, but even stolen singles kept the runs required well below balls left.
    
	He got one good tonk for six above long on before holing out to Eoin Morgan off Praveen Kumar but his dugout was already able to afford celebration. The way theyd batted, it was a disappointment the Knights went into the last over to seal victory. 
    
	But they must post a few more if they wish to see their boss dance. He has picked  and tweaked  lines from Robert Frost and he intends them to be a frosty reminder to his employees: The road is deep, and we have promises to keep.

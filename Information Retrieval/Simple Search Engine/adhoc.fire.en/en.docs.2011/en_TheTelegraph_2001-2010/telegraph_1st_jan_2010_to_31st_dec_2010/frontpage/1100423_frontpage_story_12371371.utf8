  - Truant Norwester means no respite soon          OUR BUREAU                      Bokaro residents battle the heat on Thursday. Telegraph picture                                
	Bokaro/Jamshedpur, April 22: Bokaro singed at 47.2 degrees today, making it the hottest town in the state now under a spell of a severe heat wave.        
	Bokaros was the highest temperature recorded in the state this season. The last time the PSU town came anywhere near was in May 2007 when it recorded 47.6.         
	Maximum temperatures in Bokaro and several other parts of the state have been constantly rising due to dominating westerly winds. The chart analysis indicates the westerly winds are going to prevail for another five days, which means there is less possibility of the temperature coming down, said A.K. Manjhi, a senior meteorologist at Patna Met office.         
	He explained that westerly winds, which usually contribute to the rising the day temperature, coupled with non-incursion of moisture into the atmosphere, were resulting in such extreme weather conditions.        
	Todays maximum temperature in Bokaro was seven degrees above normal, forcing the Met office to issue a severe heat wave alert in the district. Weatherman also ruled out the possibility of Norwester rains in the next 24 hours.         
	The maximum temperatures in Jamshedpur, 44.6 degree Celsius, and Daltonganj, 44.8 degree Celsius, were five degrees above normal today.         
	Daltonganj, considered to be one of the hottest places in the state, had recorded the seasons maximum temperature on April 18 when the mercury soared to 46.4 degree Celsius.         
	In Jamshedpur, the maximum temperature surpassed all previous records on April 19 when the mercury climbed to 46.3 degree Celsius.         
	In Bokaro, people felt the difference since early morning and most residents remained indoors throughout the day.        
	As mandated by the district administration, all schools in the steel city finished classes for the day at 11am.         
	I have never experienced such a hot April here, said 80-year-old R.K. Mitra, who has lived here for the last 35 years. I shudder to think what will happen in May and June, said the resident of Co-operative Colony.

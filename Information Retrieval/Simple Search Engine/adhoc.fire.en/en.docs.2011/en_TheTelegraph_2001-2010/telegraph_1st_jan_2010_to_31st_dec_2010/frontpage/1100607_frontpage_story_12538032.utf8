The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tirupati attire bar to check queue trouble
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tirupati attire bar to check queue trouble
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            The Tirupati temple                                  
	Hyderabad, June 6: Tirumala is ready to say goodbye to its trendy visitors in bermudas or minis to avoid offending the more orthodox pilgrims, amid fears that the culture clash in the queues could lead to a security threat.        
	The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam has announced a ban on jeans, miniskirts, low-cut tops, bermudas, skin-tight dresses and the like. From now, it will be saris and salwar-kameezes for women and dhotis or simple shirts and trousers  not fancy ones for men.        
	We will educate the devotees on the dress code for two months before strictly enforcing it, Devasthanam executive officer I.Y.R. Krishna Rao said. We have received complaints from several orthodox devotees that they feel uncomfortable standing in queue with people wearing fashionable western clothes.        
	On Friday, the Devasthanam board had said the tight modern clothes some pilgrims wore were not only unhealthy considering the hours one had to stand in the queues, but were provoking other devotees, some of whom were illiterate.        
	Of late, we have observed minor incidents of tension between the two sets of differently attired devotees, leading to friction, a temple official said.                        TEMPLE DRESS CODE: What not to wear      
	The pilgrims to Tirumala have always been predominantly rural and orthodox, but with Bollywood stars, top politicians and industry leaders becoming regular visitors, the temple has now become a fashionable weekend getaway for the hip crowd in the southern metros.        
	Devasthanam chairman Adikeshavulu Naidu confirmed that one reason for the dress code was a recommendation from security guards and police to avoid unnecessary friction in the huge crowds whose members often stand in queue together for 12 hours or more.        
	The countrys richest and most famous temple has not witnessed a single stampede although more than 50,000 devotees come visiting on a normal day.        
	The Devasthanam has not had to invent a dress code, it has merely dusted off the one it had clamped in 2003 in consultation with the then Chandrababu Naidu government. The code was lifted the following year since new chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy wanted to abolish everything Naidu had done.        
	The 2003 regulations applied only to those participating in rituals inside the temple, but the current dress code will be enforced on every darshan seeker right from the time they enter the queues.        
	Earlier, the Devasthanam had tried without success to get every pilgrim to wear a tilak on their forehead, especially because members from faiths other than Hinduism too visit the temple.         
	Many other temples in the country have dress codes. For instance, men visiting the Guruvayoor shrine in Kerala must keep the upper half of their body bare.        
	The Balaji temple at Chilukur on the outskirts of Hyderabad has an unusual dress code: on Saturdays, visitors can only wear handloom.

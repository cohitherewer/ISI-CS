  - Karon-Dhalbhumgarh officers swap stalled          KUMUD JENAMANI                              The Dalbhumgarh BDOs offoce from where Prashant Layek (above) was abducted by Maoists on February 13. File pictures				                                       
	Jamshedpur, March 31: No one wants to be BDO of Dalbhumgarh from where Maoists abducted one in February and freed him only after the government agreed to release 14 villagers jailed for suspected rebel links.        
	Around 70km from Jamshedpur, this forest area in East Singhbhum bordering Bengal has been without a man in charge since February 19, the day its BDO, Prashant Layek, was freed by Maoists after having been held hostage for six days.        
	And although the state government okayed a swap with Karon BDO in Deoghar district after Layek wanted out from the Maoist stronghold, the new man refused to vacate his home posting and got a ministers backing to complicate matters further.         
	Anwar Hussain is happy that rural works department and social welfare minister Hazi Hussain Ansari helped him get a stay on his transfer to the rebel zone in Ghatshila.         
	Even if I had joined my new posting at Dalbhumgarh, I would have worked in a tense atmosphere. I believe whatever happens is for good. The minister has came to my rescue, said Anwar.        
	Minister Ansari had his own reasons to intervene. As Anwar Hussain had been posted as BDO of Karon only three months back, it was not ethical for any department to transfer anyone in such a short period. Therefore, I had to step in, he explained.        
	Layek (36) was abducted by a group of armed rebels from his office in Dalbhumgarh block on February 13. He was released after six days in the jungles of Ghurabandha after the state government bowed to rebels demand of freeing 14 people from Ghatshila sub-divisional jail.        
	Layek left Ghatshila bag and baggage the morning after his release. On way to Dumka, his home town, he met deputy commissioner of East Singhbhum R.K. Agrawal in Jamshedpur and chief minister Shibu Soren at his Ranchi residence where he is understood to have voiced his desire to be relocated.        
	Though he returned to join work at Dalbhumgarh in the first week of March, he left as it was too traumatic for him.        
	The government agreed to a shift him on compassionate grounds and the rural development department issued a directive to interchange postings of the BDOs of Karon and Dalbhumgarh and asked both to take up their new assignments on March 22.                          
	Layek told The Telegraph that he got his transfer letter 10 days back. Since I was supposed to join on March 22, I had carried the letter from Deoghar deputy commissioner requesting Anwar to vacate his post as early as possible. But he refused and got a stay on the transfer two days back, he said, sounding dejected.         
	A senior officer in the rural development department said since the transfers were ordered under special circumstances the minister shouldnt have intervened.         
	True Anwar Hussain had been posted in Karon block for only three months, but the decision to shift him was taken at a higher level, he said, and confessed that they were now searching for another posting in Santhal Pargana for Layek.        
	The problem is that no one seems interested to work in Dalbhumgarh, which is a Naxalite bastion, he said.

	Johannesburg, June 11: Heartbreak intruded on the opening day of the soccer World Cup when Nelson Mandelas 13-year-old great-granddaughter Zenani was killed in an auto accident here early today.         
	Mandela cancelled a much-heralded appearance at a tournament depicted as a triumphant showcase for his country and his continent.        
	Zenani was returning home from the events Thursday night kickoff concert in Soweto, an extravaganza that included stars like Alicia Keys and Shakira and meant to launch the contest on a joyous note. At its conclusion, the sky lit up with fireworks as happy attendees made their way to parked vehicles.        
	According to police, Zenani died in a one-car accident on a Johannesburg highway. The man behind the wheel, who has yet to be named, has been accused of drunken driving and may also be charged with culpable homicide, the police said.        
	The Nelson Mandela Foundation issued a statement saying the former President would be unable to attend the opening ceremony of the tournament. The World Cup is being played in Africa for the first time, and the presence of Mandela, the frail, 91-year-old liberation hero, was expected to be an emotional high point to one of South Africas proudest days.        
	We are sure that South Africans and people all over the world will stand in solidarity with Mandela and his family in the aftermath of this tragedy, the statement read.        
	We continue to believe the World Cup is a momentous and historic occasion for South Africa and the continent and we are certain it will be a huge success. Madiba will be there with you in spirit today, the statement said, using a title from the Xhosa language by which Mandela is widely known.        
	At the opening ceremony, one of the loudest cheers was reserved for Mandela, whose image appeared on screens to a message of hope from him. The generosity of the human spirit can overcome all adversity. Through compassion and caring, we create ... hope.        
	Details of the accident remain incomplete. The Associated Press quoted a police spokesperson, Edna Mamonyane, saying the driver was found to be drunk.         
	Zenani had turned 13 on Wednesday. She was one of Mandelas nine great-grandchildren. She was the grandchild of Zindzi, the elder of two daughters born to Mandela and his second wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.        
	Early reports said that Winnie had been in the car, but this was later denied.         
	A family spokesperson told the South African Press Association that Winnie was briefly hospitalised for shock after learning the news.        
	Mandelas triumphs are well known to his countrymen, and so are his tragedies. His oldest child, Thembikele, died in a car accident in 1969. His second child, Makaziwe, died after living only nine months. His third child, Makgatho, died of an AIDS-related illness.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                              
	Srinagar, Feb. 20: Buy peace with better homes.        
	The Omar Abdullah government is working on a scheme to quell unrest in downtown Srinagar, a strong separatist stronghold, with a flurry of development projects.         
	Part of the plan is to decongest the region by shifting many of its residents to new and improved housing colonies in the city suburbs.        
	Protests and stone pelting, almost a daily feature in the old city, are a worry for the government.         
	The ruling National Conference won all the eight seats in Srinagar in the 2008 Assembly elections which was marked by a low voter turnout, with a large majority of people boycotting the polls.         
	Srinagar has given us most of the trouble in the last 14 months because of protests and stone pelting. One reason for the plan is certainly to ensure peace but that is not all. Srinagar has been ignored for decades and people need development here. Srinagar gave us eight seats and it is time to repay, said a minister.        
	Nasir Sogami, minister of state for urban development, however, denied that fighting stone pelting was the reason behind developing the city.         
	There are many families without proper housing facilities. We are identifying land to develop housing colonies for them. We will widen roads which again involves shifting many families. There is a dearth of playing fields and we are creating sports facilities for the youth, Sogami said.        
	Dozens have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes between police and stone-throwers in downtown Srinagar in the last two years. The government has been trying to restore peace, the development drive being the latest.         
	You have a six-room house shared by three, four or more families who can hardly breathe, a government official said. Around seven lakh people live in the scores of localities in old Srinagar, whose narrow alleys are a perfect turf for stone-throwers.         
	Apart from better accommodation, we intend to create more employment opportunities for the youth. There will be a package for handicraft artisans. We will also preserve and develop several heritage sites, the official said.        
	Sources said the government was considering rehabilitating these families in places such as Narbal, 15km from the old city, and Shoor in Lal Bazar. We have already undertaken the project for widening of key roads and scores of families are being relocated under this project, a source said.         
	Historian Fida Mohammad Hasnain said a similar plan had been implemented in the 1960s by then chief minister G.M. Sadiq, which involved shifting hundreds of families out of the old city.        
	In the process, the government filled the famous Nallah Maar canal, built by 14th century ruler Zainul Abidin, which would take the water of the Dal Lake to river Jhelum and a road was built over it. That was an engineering disaster as it wrecked havoc with the lake by depriving it of one of the major outlets, Hasnain said.

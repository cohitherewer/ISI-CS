  - Want to survive India? Ask Americans          K.P. NAYAR                                                    
	Washington, Nov. 4: Protectionism, the Obama administrations mantra to save American jobs from being outsourced to India and China, will assume a new meaning in Indo-US relations next week and be literally lived through in Mumbai and New Delhi by those accompanying the President to India.        
	A confidential code of conduct distributed here among those who will be following Obama during his three days in India also reads, at a personal level, like an extension of Americas revived tendency to be inward-looking under resurgent Republicans led by the so-called Tea Party activists who are also isolationists.        
	The US-India Business Council (USIBC) has told the large Presidential Executive Mission of American business representatives who will be with Obama to book hotel rooms in Mumbai and New Delhi that faces inwards  away from the front entrance or passing road.        
	They have also been told to assume throughout their stay that in hotel rooms in Mumbai and New Delhi, all external door keys are compromised and strongly advised to lock your luggage.        
	Parts of a six-page advisory issued to these businessmen read like a manual which would be given to James Bond by MI6, Britains Secret Intelligence Service in charge of foreign intelligence, and border on the bizarre.        
	Do not trust anyone or any situation you find yourself in in India, they have been told. CEOs and other executives of US companies have also been banned from displaying logos of their firms which would identify them at events attended by Obama or anywhere else like restaurants and hotel lobbies.        
	Question all activities and assess all situations for possible danger or threats, they have been warned.        
	One top American executive who received the advisory said yesterday that he was initially confused that his delegation was going to Afghanistan or Pakistan, not an open society like India, especially to its vibrant and dynamic cities.        
	The advice to secure hotel rooms facing inwards is said to be a precaution against rockets, grenades or missiles being launched from roads or even the sea targeting the hotels while the Americans are staying there. A room that faces a hotel garden or quadrangle inwards will offer one extra layer of protection in the event of such a hit.        
	The advisory is said to be similar to the ones that are being given to the official delegation that is part of Obamas entourage. They go way beyond the travel warnings issued from time to time by the US state department on India, which have repeatedly irked New Delhi.        
	Businessmen have been told not to discuss your business or travel plans in public areas where they may be overheard. That means, ideally, a member of the delegation who hires a taxi at the Maurya Sheraton hotel in the capital must either whisper in the cab drivers ears the destination or tell the cabbie where he is going only after the car has left the hotel portico and parking lot and is on Sardar Patel Marg outside.        
	Discuss your travel plans and movements during your stay with as few people as possible, the advisory warns. Remain anonymous and low-key, dont draw attention to yourself.        
	Many businessmen here who are frequent visitors to India were yesterday advising those going for the first time not be paranoid over the instructions but to enjoy Indias famous hospitality reflected in Jawaharlal Nehrus oft-quoted advice to his countrymen to receive a visitor, send back a friend.        
	The more bizarre parts of the advisory urges delegates to keep your laptop with you at all times and try to disguise it by using a general day sack rather than a laptop case.        
	In a country where travel planning is not as organised as in the US, some of the instructions may be hard to follow. For instance, delegates have been asked to request a map of the route where they are going to ensure you know where you are at all times.        
	It is an instruction which conjures up images of scores of Americans struggling all at once in designated hotel business centres or in the special control rooms for the visit on computers with printers in order to take out maps of Expedia or Mapquest driving directions from the Dhaula Kuan flyover to Rashtrapati Bhavan or Hyderabad House the way they are used to in the US.        
	The USIBC is virtually in charge of Obamas engagement of Indian business throughout his stay in India and has planned a number of events in co-operation with the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

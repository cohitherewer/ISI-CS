          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Jan. 22: Lucknow district magistrate Amit Ghosh today slapped a government employee several times, provoking retaliatory action that paralysed public services across Uttar Pradesh.        
	 Ghosh, who slapped the man in full view of colleagues and was caught on camera, was apparently angered by the employees refusal to show his ID card.        
	The incident occurred at the agriculture directorate where the district magistrate had gone, along with civil and police officials, to check attendance during a strike call given by some trade unions.        
	It was a tight slap, said an employee who was present.        
	Ghosh admitted later that he lost his cool and slapped the employee, but additional-director general of police Brij Lal denied the incident. We dont know about it.        
	Pressure is now building up on the Mayavati government to act against Ghosh while the unions have demanded punishment for Lucknow DIG Prem Prakash as well for using force against the agitating employees.        
	We condemn the incident and both the officers should be placed under suspension by the government. The employees will not buckle under the pressure tactics of the administration, Ramakant Mishra, a union spokesman, said.        
	The Opposition Congress has scented blood. It is shocking for democratic norms that the DM, A.K. Ghosh, has no hesitation in slapping employees. As in any other case when action is taken against anyone taking the law into their hands, a case should be filed against him and the DIG and they be suspended immediately, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the Uttar Pradesh Congress president, said.        
	The government employees, who have decided to go on an indefinite strike from today to protest against a lathi-charge during a demonstration here yesterday, have warned of sterner action if Ghosh was not immediately removed.        
	Ghosh reached Krishi Bhavan in the afternoon while making the rounds of government offices.         
	The employee who was later slapped was standing near the gate of the agriculture department when Ghosh asked him if he was on duty. I am not on duty. We are on an agitation.         
	The district magistrate then asked his name and sought his ID. Why should I tell you? Who are you? Why should I show you the ID card? the employee challenged him.        
	An infuriated Ghosh then slapped him, again and again.         
	When pictures of the incident went on air, the protests spread.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Painted into corner, a show of bravado
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Painted into corner, a show of bravado
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                               
	April 16: The ground seems to be giving way, but Lalit Modi is digging his heels in. Encouraged, perhaps, by Sharad Pawars public show of support and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Shashank Manohars decision to nominate him as his alternate for the world bodys executive board meeting in Dubai.         
	That Modi would be representing India at the highest forum within the International Cricket Council (ICC), on Monday-Tuesday, was made known this evening.         
	I cant give you the exact date when Mr Modi got nominated, but it was a few days ago, the ICCs head of media and communications, Colin Gibson, told The Telegraph.         
	A couple of senior BCCI officials one spoke to were absolutely in the dark. In fact, they were shocked to learn that the under-acute-fire Modi would actually sit in the chair earmarked for India.         
	Shock, indeed, would be the best way to describe how many in the BCCI, who want Modi to be removed as chairman and commissioner of the money-spinning Indian Premier League (IPL), responded to Pawar going on television and backing him.         
	That was last night, soon after word spread that a move was afoot to create the post of a co-chairman and to place Manohar, who has a squeaky clean image, in that position.         
	Pawar, a senior member of Manmohan Singhs cabinet, is a former president of the BCCI and the next head of the ICC.         
	The conflicting signals have, predictably, set off confusion across the rank and file of the BCCI.         
	Modi is trying to project himself as the aggrieved party, in the Team Kochi row, but the income-tax raids have put him in the dock as well.         
	Sources said the documents pertaining to the Kochi and Pune franchises, which were auctioned last month, were with Modi and not at the IPL office in Mumbai.         
	When the income-tax officials came, it transpired that the Kochi and Pune papers werent in the office (housed in the BCCI headquarters)... Modi had to be asked to rush those documents over, one of the sources pointed out.         
	Reacting, somebody senior in the BCCI thundered: Its time to end Modis autocratic behaviour. Let the governing council (of the IPL) make a recommendation to the BCCI. Weve had enough of controversies and embarrassments.         
	Modi holds a constitutional position and so can only be removed by a two-thirds majority at the AGM or at a special emergent meeting of the BCCI.         
	Some governing council members are understood to have had an informal meeting in Dharamshala tonight but, till around midnight, nobody was available for a comment.         
	The knives appear to be out, with quite a few terming Modis continuation untenable, but the man at the centre of a furious storm isnt short on bravado. Is it for real or a put-on? We will probably know sooner rather than later.         
	Shashi Tharoor may lose his job first, but big bets are also being placed on Modi being shown the door. Or, to begin with, having his wings clipped with a capital C.         
	As IPL 2010 reaches the business stage, the attention is on the off-the-field manoeuvring.

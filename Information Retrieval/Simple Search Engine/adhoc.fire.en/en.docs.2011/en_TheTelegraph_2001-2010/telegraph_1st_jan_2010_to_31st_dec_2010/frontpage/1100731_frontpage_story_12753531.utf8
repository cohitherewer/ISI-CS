          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                    
	Calcutta, July 30: A rare convergence of opinion among Opposition parties and a section of the ruling Left has forced the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to abort its plan to fast-track a bill to create a parallel primary and secondary education system under the panchayat department.        
	The West Bengal Panchayat Board of Education Bill 2010, which fuelled fears of an undeclared caste system in the education system, has been put in the freezer for the time being.        
	The Telegraph had published a report on the bill on July 24 and raised concerns about the future of students passing out of the new education system under the panchayat and rural development department, which does not have the expertise to run an education board.         
	The government had stepped up the drive to push through the bill in this session itself to court a votebank of potential teachers before the Assembly elections next year, going as far as to propose an extension of the session by a day after a break to pass the legislation.         
	However, deviating from yesterdays plan of placing and passing the bill on August 16, the government has deferred its passage till the winter session of the Assembly.         
	The panchayat department minister wants an elaborate discussion on the bill to arrive at a consensus. That is not possible as the (extended) budget session of the Assembly ended today. Thats why we leave it to the next session, said government chief whip Syed Mohammad Masih.         
	Sources in the government said that deferring the bill to the winter session  which normally gets wrapped up in less than a week  was almost like pressing a permanent pause button.        
	A winter session is convened only if the government has important business and a good number of bills. Just for one bill, calling such a short session is not the usual practice, a source said.         
	If the proposed legislation is not passed in the winter session, its likely to go into cold storage as the 2011 Assembly session will not witness a full budget but a vote-on-account because of the elections.        
	An elaborate discussion  as mentioned by the chief whip  was not part of the strategy the government had drawn up. As the passage of the bill would have created over 56,000 jobs in 16,108 sishu siksha kendras that hold classes from I to IV and 1,900 Madhyamik siksha kendras (MSKs) that run classes from V to VIII, the government wanted to rush it through.         
	With protests from the Opposition parties and a section of CPM-backed teachers associations intensifying, the government referred the bill to the standing committee a day after it was introduced.        
	Panchayat minister Anisur Rahman had claimed on July 28 that the bill would be passed today. The standing committee referred it back to the House in less than 24 hours without making any changes.        
	The growing opposition to the bill  even some former CPM ministers are against it  forced the government to buy time and the business advisory committee of the Assembly extended the ongoing session till August 16, with an adjournment between July 31 and August 15.         
	The extension was planned only to get this bill tabled and cleared on August 16. But thats not happening. Getting it cleared in the winter session is a remote possibility, said a CPM legislator.         
	 At an informal meeting of Left ministers in the Assembly yesterday, the possible impact of the bill was reassessed. They realised that the passage will create more problems for the government and the party than serving the intended purpose of winning votes, said a CPM insider.         
	This realisation forced the government to drop its earlier plan. To ensure that the Opposition parties do not get any chance to claim credit by forcing the government to scrap the bill, it was decided to put it in cold storage, said the source.

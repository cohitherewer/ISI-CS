                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                IT man back at helm of Koda probe

	Ranchi, Feb. 23: Jharkhand High Court today stayed the sudden transfer of income tax director (investigation) Ujjwal Chaudhary probing the multi-crore scam involving former chief minister Madhu Koda and his associates, dealing an embarrassing blow to the Central Board for Direct Taxes (CBDT) that claimed the move was a routine administrative reshuffle.        
	A division bench headed by Chief Justice Gyan Sudha Misra and Justice R.R. Prasad stayed the transfer while hearing a petition filed by Durga Oraon whose earlier PIL had helped blow the lid off the disproportionate assets allegedly acquired by Koda and five of his ministerial colleagues.        
	The court stayed the transfer of Chaudhary for three months. The court also asked the enforcement directorate to submit an investigation report in the Koda scam by March 16 when the case will be heard again, said Oraons counsel Rajiv Kumar.        
	Chaudhary, who was camping in Chaibasa during last weeks nationwide raids on Kodas associates and several government officials, had gone on leave after his transfer.         
	I will follow the high court order and rejoin office tomorrow, he told The Telegraph.        
	Chaudharys sudden transfer as commissioner (central IT) in Patna evoked criticism from the BJP whose central and state leaders alleged the move was done at the behest of the Congress, which was trying to shield some of its leaders allegedly linked to Kodas alleged money laundering operations.         
	Even the JMM sought a stay on the transfer of Chaudhary who had been IT director (investigation) for Bihar and Jharkhand since June last year. It alleged the transfer was done with mala fide intent in order to shield corrupt politicians and bureaucrats.         
	The counsel for the IT department, Deepak Roshan, defended the decision as a routine affair.                           
	As many as 30 officials were transferred within the department in which Chaudhary was also included, he said.        
	Last week, Chaudhary led the IT department to raid as many as 70 properties spread over 13 cities, including some belonging to M.L. Pal, the then personal secretary of chief minister Shibu Soren, and two former chairmen of the Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) V.N. Pandey and H.B. Lal.         
	Pal was removed as personal secretary after the raids.         
	Among the others raided by the IT department were former mines secretary Jaishankar Tiwari, Jharkhand mines and geology director B.B. Singh, JSEB chief engineer P.K. Sinha, JSEB member S.N. Chaudhary and member of state pollution control board R.K. Sinha.        
	Today, the high court rejected an application filed by Shobik Chattopadhya, an aide of one of the accused, alleging foul play by Durga Oraons advocates. Shobik, an associate of Binod Sinha who has been on the run ever since his name figured in the scam for his ties with Koda, alleged that Oraons advocates, Ritu Kumar, Rajeev Kumar and Rajendra Krishna, had asked for money in return for weakening the case against them.        
	The bench, however, did not find merit in the petition and dismissed it.

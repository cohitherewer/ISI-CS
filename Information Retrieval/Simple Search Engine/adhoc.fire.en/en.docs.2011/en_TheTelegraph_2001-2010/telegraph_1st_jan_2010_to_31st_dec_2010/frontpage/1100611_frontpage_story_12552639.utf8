  - Assam hope for locals   in Grades III, IV posts        UMANAND JAISWAL                            Protest path                                              
	Guwahati, June 10: Assam will formally push for reservation of Grade III and IV jobs for local unemployed youths in central organisations operating in the state.         
	A source in the chief ministers office today said advocate-general A.K. Phookan was preparing a proposal in this regard so that the official process can begin soon.         
	According to the president of the All Assam Central and Semi-central employees Parishad, Tarun Barman, there are approximately 1.5 lakh Grade IV and 2.5 lakh Grade III employees, spanning bank, insurance, railways, power, oil, income tax and postal sectors.         
	The development assumes significance in a state that is largely dependent on agriculture with nearly 18 lakh educated unemployed.         
	The chief minister feels strongly about the issue and has discussed the same with the advocate-general so that the official process can begin soon. We need to make a strong case because it will require a constitutional amendment. These are basically jobs of drivers, peons, watchman, orderlies, railway gangmen, guards, particularly in the railways, oil sector and FCI, among others, the source said.         
	A favourable response  if that happens before next years Assembly elections  would give the ruling coalition a big boost.         
	It would also leave the Opposition AGP and BJP and the AASU one weapon short to attack the government with.         
	Confirming the move, Phookan told The Telegraph that he has started work on the proposal, to be submitted shortly to the chief minister.         
	It will require amendment of Article 371 (B) that pertains to Assam. We will basically seek, as a special case, inclusion of a provision in respect to employment  reservation of Grade III and IV jobs in the central sector PSUs for local youths, given the volume of unemployment in the state. I honestly believe that there is no need to import people from outside the state when we have so many unemployed persons here itself. We have qualified people working as daily wagers, Phookan said.         
	The demand became a burning topic after AASU hit the streets seeking 100 per cent job reservation in Grade III and IV jobs for local unemployed. The protests turned violent after a few applicants from outside were roughed up when they came to take tests organised by the Railway Recruitment Board for Grade IV jobs in the state.         
	AASU general secretary Tapan Gogoi said the Centre and state should meet their demand at the earliest.         
	It is our long-standing demand given the acute unemployment problem in the state. We want results, he said.         
	AGP legislator Anup Phukan said, We have raised the issue in the Assembly and at different forums. We dont need drivers and peons from outside the state. It is a welcome step, he said.        
	Left leader Pramode Gogoi said half of the employee strength would belong to these two categories.         
	Independent Jonai MLA Bhubon Pegu said the move would have far-reaching implications for the state and for a backward constituency like his.

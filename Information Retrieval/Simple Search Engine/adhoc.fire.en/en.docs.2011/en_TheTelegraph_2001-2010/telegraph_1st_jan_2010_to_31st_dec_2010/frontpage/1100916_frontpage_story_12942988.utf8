The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cabinet pangs take Munda to Delhi

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 15: A day after breezing through his trust vote, chief minister Arjun Munda was in the thick of it, grappling with his immediate problem of forming a cabinet without upsetting allies, primarily the JMM which wants it to stall till September 22 when its annual convention in Dumka would have got over.        
	The JMM is worried that those denied a ministerial berth will spoil the Dumka meet which old-timers in the party apprehend will be used by JMM patriarch Shibu Soren to formally install son and deputy chief minister Hemant Soren as his successor.        
	With these initial worries in mind, chief minister Arjun Munda left for New Delhi today with a blueprint of his cabinet. He is set to meet JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav and senior BJP leaders, including L.K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj, both of whom were against the party joining hands with the JMM to form a government in Jharkhand.        
	If Munda decides to go by the JMMs wishes, he will expand his cabinet on September 22-23. The Ajsu, however, is insisting that he complete the exercise soon, said a source close to him.        
	Munda, who proved his majority yesterday, was sworn in on September 11 along with two deputy chief ministers  Ajsus Sudesh Mahto and Hemant. He can accommodate nine more ministers.         
	In the BJP, at least six MLAs are lobbying hard to get a place in the cabinet. They are state party president Raghubar Das, Baidyanath Ram, Neelkanth Singh Munda, Barkuwar Gagarai, Arun Mandal and Satyanand Jha.         
	Munda is also in a dilemma about the JD(U), which has two MLAs, Sudha Chaudhary and Raja Peter. Both are in the race for a place. If JD(U) does not get a berth, the task of cabinet formation will be a bit easier, a senior BJP leader said, adding the party did not deserve a berth since it did not vote for BJP nominee Ajay Maroo in Rajya Sabha elections.         
	However, another section of leaders says the denial of a berth to the JD(U) will adversely impact the BJP-JD(U) alliance in poll-bound Bihar.        
	The JMM too has many claimants, including Teklal Mahto, Simon Marandi, Champai Soren, Mathura Mahto, Haji Hussain Ansari and Sita Soren, Sorens daughter-in-law.        
	Munda, however, put up a brave face. Cabinet expansion will take place after consultations and mutual understanding. There will be no problem, he told reporters before leaving for Delhi.         
	Ajsu chief Mahto said the expansion should take place before JMMs convention.         
	According to a broad agreement, the BJP is supposed to get four berths, including chief minister, JMM five and Ajsu three. If the JD(U) is accommodated, either the BJP or the Ajsu will lose one berth.

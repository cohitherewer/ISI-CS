  - Trinamul leader addresses concern on post-poll confrontation, vows to build consensus          OUR BUREAU                            Mamata Banerjee at the STAR Ananda studio on Wednesday evening.  (above) Goenka asking the question. Pictures by Pradip Sanyal                                
	Calcutta, Nov. 3: Mamata Banerjee today addressed concerns on how she would cope with a vengeful Left if she comes to power in Bengal, saying she would expect her predecessors to give her leeway for 10 years and that she would build consensus.        
	Veteran industrialist R.P. Goenka appeared on screen to ask Mamata, who was at the STAR Ananda studio for an interactive session this evening, a question that has been on the minds of investors for long. Do you think that your Opposition will sit quiet and allow you to perform for the states development?         
	Mamata replied, but not before enquiring after the health of the octogenarian: The CPM should go into political exile for at least 10 years if it loses power in Bengal after the Assembly polls. The party should sit quiet and allow those newly elected to power to work for the development of the state.        
	After the Assembly elections, the CPM would be nowhere in the state. They have ruined Bengal during its rule for 34 years. So, they should allow those who have newly come to power to work.        
	However, after delivering the political message, Mamata tried to reassure investors by suggesting that she would focus on building consensus.        
	If voted to power, we shall not use bulldozers against people. Instead, we shall carry on the government taking people into confidence, she said.        
	Inability or reluctance to forge a consensus with sceptics and potential opponents was the loudest criticism the Left government had to face when its initiatives to revive industry ran aground one after the other.        
	The issue of confrontation has been vexing potential investors ever since the political atmosphere in Bengal turned acrimonious after Nandigram and Singur.               
	This June, a top Infosys official had told The Telegraph: quot;Next one year, Mamata wont let the Left Front government work. And when she comes to power, the Left will not let her work. That is what we feel. It is a sad situation. But we cannot get in there in such an environment. What to do? quot;        
	Mamata dismissed the oft-repeated allegation that she was not co-operating with the government for the states welfare. quot;We co-operated a lot with the state government. But I have stopped doing so ever since they threw the agreement signed in front of the governor at Raj Bhavan on the Singur land into the dustbin. Why should I sit with the government that goes against the Constitution of the country? quot; she asked.        
	Without naming state housing minister Gautam Deb, Mamata spoke of a hint of threat during the Singur discussions. quot;He wanted to threaten me by asking over the phone that I should accept his suggestion about the venue for the meeting. He even told me the Congress always accepts his suggestion. But I told him that I would not act according to his diktat. Since then, I have stopped talking to him, quot; she said.        
	Mamata had stayed away from a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, organised by Deb at the Calcutta Information Centre inside the Nandan complex. The meeting eventually took place at Raj Bhavan.        
	Although Mamata accused the Congress of breaking the alliance during the civic polls, she acknowledged that the pa-rtnership had to be kept intact.        
	 quot;It is the people who matter the most. The people are the best judge and we should all respect their aspirations. We have been with the people through good times and bad times. Where were the others then? Dont underestimate their wisdom, quot; she added.         
	Mamata iterated she would not sever ties with the Congress at the national level despite the Centres decision not to concede her demand for the withdrawal of joint forces.         
	 quot;I have made a commitment to remain in the government for five years and I shall stick to it, come what may. Regarding the withdrawal of joint forces, I have been raising the issue because they are being used by the CPM. I am doing my bit and I expect the Centre to do its bit. But I shall not beg before Delhi to concede my demand, quot; she said.        
	The Trinamul leader dismissed reports that she had referred to Rahul Gandhi as a seasonal koel. quot;In fact, I had compared the CPM with a seasonal bird because it comes with a string of promises only during election time. You had all misinterpreted me. quot;        
	However, Mamata sought to make light of the threat fr-om Rahul to her political sp-a-ce. quot;Rahul is still learning the ropes of politics. I have high regard for Rajivji, quot; she said.        
	On the contentious questi-on of land acquisition, Mamata came up with a develop-and-return formula if a government agency wanted to acqu-ire land for defence, communication or road requirements.        
	Over and above compensation, she said, the government should return one-tenth of the acquired land fully developed to the owner for commercial use. One person in the family of the land loser has to be given a government job. In case there is none to take up a job, the family should be given monthly pension for 30 years.        
	All those involved with the land, including sharecroppers, will also have to be compensated.        
	On land acquisition for private industry, she stuck to her known position of a complete hands-off policy by the government. Asked about the stuck land bill that proposes a government role in the acquisition of 30 per cent of the land, she said: quot;I am not aware of any 70:30 formula. My opinion is: no forceful land acquisition, acquisition only by discussion. quot;        
	On the dedicated freight corridor, for which funds have been tied up only for the western belt, Mamata said she would let private companies build the rail line in the east and let them enjoy quot;economic interest quot; in return. She said the railways would kick off work on a 50-km stretch from Dankuni on November 13 or 14.        
	She also sought to calm nerves over her partys proposed agitation against land acquisition, saying the quot;IT industry has nothing to fear quot;.

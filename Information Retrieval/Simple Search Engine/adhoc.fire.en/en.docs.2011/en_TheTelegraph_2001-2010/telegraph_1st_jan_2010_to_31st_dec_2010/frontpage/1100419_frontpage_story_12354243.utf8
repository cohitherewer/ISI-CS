  - Soren to chair Election Commission meeting of DCs today          AMIT GUPTA                                                     
	Ranchi, April 18: The first phase of the national census is set to start from June 15 in Jharkhand fueling speculation that the state government will be left with no option but to schedule panchayat elections till after the monsoon against the chief ministers promised timeframe of June 30.         
	Both the exercisescensus as well as panchayat electionswould require an army of people, primarily government servants, and it doesnt seem feasible for the state machinery to be able to pull them off simultaneously, given the scarcity of manpower.         
	Moreover, the state Election Commission is yet to approach Raj Bhavan with the dates of the panchayat election which need to be notified at least 45 days prior to voting. This means the commission needs to apprise the governor about the dates before May 15 if the state is serious about holding rural polls according to plans.        
	State election commissioner M.K. Mandal is scheduled to address deputy commissioners on the poll requirements at a meeting tomorrow to be chaired by chief minister Shibu Soren.        
	Mandal clarified that no deadline had been fixed for the panchayat polls, but the exercise would have to be completed at the earliest in the wake of the Supreme Courts January 2010 verdict.         
	We are on the task. But we need to accelerate things to ensure early conduct of polls, he said.        
	The first phase of the census involves listing of all houses and getting individual details for a National Population Register (NPR) followed by the second phase in which the actual head count will take place.                                 
	Director (census operations) Sunil Kumar Burnwal said the first phase would take about 45 days and would take place between June 15 and July 31. Second phase would take place between February 9 and February 28 next year.         
	Recently, the state government sent across its plan to the Delhi-based office of the Census Commissioner which okayed the dates.         
	During the first phase, details required for creating the first-ever NPR will also be canvassed. Enumerations will take place across the entire population of the country, including that of Jharkhand, during the second phase, which will be conducted simultaneously across the country from February 9 to 28, 2011 as the reference date has been fixed as March 1, 2011.        
	The NPR will also include biometric elements like fingerprints and photographs.         
	In the first phase, two forms will be given to each household. The first relates to house-listing and housing census, will have 35 columns on amenities like drinking water, power and sewerage facilities, while the second relates to NPR which will seek basic details on 15 counts, including name, place and date of birth, address, occupation and nationality.

	Ranchi, July 9: Salaries and allowances of state MLAs have been frozen ever since Presidents Rule was imposed in Jharkhand on June 1 and the Assembly kept in suspended animation, forcing Speaker C.P Singh to seek an opinion from the advocate-general.        
	Singh, who raised the issue during the Speakers conference on July 19 in Jammu amp; Kashmir, said MLAs had been granted salaries and other allowances under Article 195 of the Constitution.         
	Since the provision has not been suspended under the proclamation made by the President while imposing Central rule in the state on June 1, I dont see any logic in denying salaries, allowances and access to area development funds, he said.        
	The rural development department had stopped releasing money allocated to each MLA under their area development fund  Rs 3 crore annually  in view of a Raj Bhavan embargo that had been issued during last years Presidents Rule.         
	But now, in view of objections raised by several MLAs, Governors advisor Wilfred Lakra has asked the law department to re-examine the Raj Bhavan embargo. We will take a decision accordingly, Lakra, who is in-charge of rural development, said.         
	Assembly deputy secretary Uday Bhan Singh said MLAs were allowed to draw salaries and their medical allowances during Central Rule last year. This time, the Assembly secretariat has stopped their salaries and medical allowances, besides rail coupons and telephone facilities, he pointed out.        
	Singh said the House had been kept under suspended animation and hadnt been dissolved. If the MLAs can vote for the Rajya Sabha polls, attend meetings of district rural development agencies or other constitutional bodies like the tribal advisory committee, then there is no logic behind stopping the sanction of MLAs local area development fund, he reasoned.        
	Former secretary-general of Lok Sabha Subhash Kashyap said there was no legal hindrance in releasing funds for area development while the Assembly was under suspended animation. The provision of MLAs fund comes through an executive order. So, it is the discretion of the executive (governor now) to allow the use of funds, he said from New Delhi.

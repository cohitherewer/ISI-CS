The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pump fault in street flood
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pump fault in street flood
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Residents of Tiljala wade through water on Wednesday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	The new civic bosses have blamed the former Left Front regime for the waterlogging on Monday and Tuesday but CMC sources said the city would have been spared the ordeal had the Trinamul board turned its focus on drainage pumping stations in time.        
	Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy on Wednesday shot off a letter to Nilangshu Bose, the chief engineer in charge of project and development, asking him to explain why the blocks in the underground sewers on the Hazra-Rashbehari Avenue stretch were not removed before the onset of the monsoon.        
	The letter states that the blocks  plugging in technical terms  were in a large way responsible for the flooding and asks Bose to explain how his department could allow such a situation.        
	The blocks were left by a private firm whose contract to clean and refurbish the sewers was terminated by the previous board more than a month ago. A newly-appointed firm has informed the civic body that the last of the blocks was removed on Tuesday.        
	Sources in the drainage and sewerage department, however, rubbished the claim that the sewer blocks were responsible for waterlogging.        
	The flooding, they said, could have been avoided had the Ballygunge Drainage Pumping Station, which serves around 40sq km across south Calcutta, functioned to its installed capacity.        
	The station has 11 pumps which together can drain out 1,240 cubic feet of water every second. But two of the pumps, with a combined installed capacity to displace 440 cubic feet of water per second, broke down more than a week ago. One of them is beyond repair and has to be replaced, said an official in the drainage and sewerage department.        
	With the Ballygunge station functioning to one-third of its capacity, flooding was inevitable, especially because the first two days of the week received around 130 mm of rain, the official added.        
	Department sources said the new board headed by Sovan Chatterjee, who held a waterlogging meeting with civic officials even before being sworn in as mayor, had not bothered to inspect the health of the pumping stations since coming to power on July 16.        
	Mayoral council member Rajib Deb, who stressed the need to upgrade the pumps at an informal meeting of the panel during the day, said: The Left board had hired a firm for Rs 3 crore to prepare a project report for the refurbishment of the pumping stations. That is yet to be submitted.        
	As the city fathers engage in waterlogging wars, around 7,000 people in Darapara, Tiljala, have been submerged since Monday. The water had turned dark and was stinking on Wednesday.        
	Residents said the water could not drain out as most of the water bodies had been filled up by promoters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Palin seethes, staff evacuated
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Palin seethes, staff evacuated
          ATONU CHOUDHURRI                               
	Palin (Kurung Kumey), Feb. 12: Palin today erupted in grief and anger, resorting to vandalism in moments of unbearable anguish, two days after 10 primary school students of Don Bosco were charred in their sleep when a fire raged through their private hostel.         
	Don Bosco School in this remote corner of Arunachal Pradesh became one of the primary targets of the grieving families ire, prompting the district administration to evacuate the principal, Father Jose Karripai, and some other staff to Itanagar today.         
	We are more angry than anything else, said Takam Kaku, brother of Takam Guna, one of the victims, and a resident of this township in Kurung Kumey district.        
	The charred remains of Guna, along with Takam Ponglu and Yomdo Gogi, were defiantly buried by their families on the premises of the school where they had studied till Wednesday.         
	Guna died a braveheart, having saved the lives of eight children by waking them up from deep slumber and heralding them out of the inferno that was slowly devouring their hostel.         
	Why have you come here, what do you want? Gunas father, Takam Chongma, charged when this correspondent tried to approach their house.         
	Gunas mother was on the verandah, inconsolable, begging her son to return.         
	Kaku said the students were buried inside the school as a mark of protest.         
	He also alleged that the fire had spread from candles lit by the matron of the hostel.         
	There was no power. She had some work to attend to and after lighting the candles went away, locking the only door. By the time she returned, about 15 minutes later, the fire had already started. She unlocked the door to help the students out, but by then all of them had died, he said.         
	There are conflicting reports about the number of deaths, though.         
	While the school principal, Fr Jose, today said 14 students had died, additional deputy commissioner, Palin, Chukhu Takar, said the number was 10.         
	We have found 10 bodies and we are continuing our search. If there have been more deaths in the fire, then we should be able to find some evidence of it in the debris, Takar said.         
	At a meeting with chief minister Dorjee Khandu today, the families of the victims demanded that the schools name be changed suitably in the memory of the students who had perished.         
	They want memorials built inside the school and various classes named after the students, an official in the administration said.         
	A bout of vandalism broke out soon after Khandu left the school following separate meetings with the parents and guardians of the victims and leaders of local organisations and the school authorities.         
	I had gone with the chief minister to see him off when people began hurling stones at the school, said Takar.         
	The atmosphere is quite surcharged... it would not have been wise to keep the staff here when the public is in such an aggressive mood, he said.         
	The crowd also threw stones at legislators Markio Tado and Bamang Selix when they were standing on the school verandah after Khandu had left.         
	The principal said a mob gathered outside the school and started hurling stones, breaking almost all the windowpanes and damaging two doors.         
	The vandalism did not last for more than 15 minutes, but the damage was done, he said, adding that the few policemen posted there were reduced to mere spectators.         
	The peoples anger does not end with the school.         
	We dont even have a fire brigade here, a relative of Takam Ponglu fumed. The fire tenders have to be brought in from Ziro, about 90km away, he said.         
	Giving away money as the chief minister has promised is only a short-term measure. There will be another fire and more money, but why is a proper fire brigade not allotted to us, he asked.         
	Shocked by the vandalism, the principal said the school has been closed down indefinitely.         
	We are not certain when we can reopen, he said.         
	Fr Andrew, assistant parish priest, said at the Don Bosco School in Itanagar, where he and the other evacuees are putting up, that the few minutes of crowd rampage was like a nightmare.         
	The chief minister had sent his chopper back for the evacuation, he added.                     (WITH INPUTS FROM A CORRESPONDENT IN ITANAGAR)

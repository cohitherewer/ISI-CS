                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Singh-Wen hotline to start buzzing soon
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         Manmohan Singh and Wen Jiabao                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Wen Jiabao will be able to pick up their phones and talk directly through a hotline.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna today said the facility would be available soon, reaffirming a decision he had announced during his Beijing visit this April.         
	Such a hotline  first installed between Moscow and Washington at the height of the Cold War to prevent a nuclear conflict  is already in place with Islamabad.         
	Krishnas statement comes ahead of Premier Wens scheduled India visit next month. We welcome Premier Wen Jiabaos proposed visit. He will receive a warm welcome. The hotline between the two Prime Ministers will soon become operational, Krishna told a seminar on India-China relations here attended by two leaders of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).        
	Zhou Yongkang, a member of the standing committee of the politburo, is the ninth most powerful leader in the party. Wang Jiaarui is minister of international department in the central committee.         
	The two leaders are on a three-day India visit at the invitation of the Congress to increase party-to-party contacts.         
	Krishna said New Delhi and Beijing should co-operate rather than compete and recalled that the two countries were often described as Buddhist twins. He cited Rabindranath Tagores lines in which the Nobel Laureate said China was like my native place.        
	Zhou too dwelt on the theme, arguing that Indias development was not a threat but an opportunity for China. Chinas development is an opportunity rather than a threat to India. Likewise, Indias development is not a threat but an opportunity for China.         
	Zhou also met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. When the Prime Ministers of India and China shake hands, the world notices, Singh told Zhou, quoting his Chinese counterpart Wen.        
	Zhou also called on Left leaders parties and BJP president Nitin Gadkari, who presented him an idol of Lord Ram. Zhou gave Gadkari a Chinese clay pot.         
	Around 50 Tibetan activists protested outside Nehru Memorial Library, the venue of the seminar.

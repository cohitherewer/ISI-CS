The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Munda logs on to IT
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Munda logs on to IT
  - Software park invites for Infy, Wipro, TCS          SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA      
	Ranchi, Oct. 26: If it was steel in his earlier tenure as chief minister, Arjun Munda has now moved on, looking at information technology as the agent of change for Jharkhand.        
	In his third stint as chief minister, heading a coalition government of BJP, JMM and Ajsu, Munda has invited several IT majors to set up an information technology park in Jharkhand and put the state on the IT map of the country.        
	Around 10 days back, Munda wrote to managing directors of Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra pledging generous support, including land, to set up the IT park to offer state-of-the-art IT infrastructure under one roof to companies working in areas of IT services, IT-enabled services, engineering consultancy and other related domains.         
	We are yet to get responses, may be because of Puja vacations, industry secretary A.P. Singh said and confirmed to The Telegraph that Munda had indeed sent the letters.        
	Earlier, Munda had promoted the steel industry and signed as many as 44 MoUs with major firms, including ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel. However, most of the projects were non-starters, and he ended up receiving severe flak from his detractors.        
	The industries secretary pointed out the state has 25 acre ready-to-use land in Gamharia under the possession of Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority (Aiada) and 60 acre at Patratu under Ranchi Industrial Area Development Authority (Riada).        
	The Seraikela-Kharsawan deputy commissioner has also identified a big chunk of land, he added. It will depend on the IT companies to select any one of them to set up the park. We are ready to provide an environment conducive not only to the development of business but also to the working community.         
	Ranchis tryst with IT began in November 2006 when the Software Technology Park of India (STPI), a society set up by the Union ministry of communication and information technology to promote and facilitate software exports, set up a centre in the state capital.              
	Spread over 12,500 sq ft with a workable area of 6,500 sq ft, the centre started off well with companies like Hyderabad-based Gen2 and Calcutta-based Leonid Ltd joining a dozen others to set up shop.        
	But the global meltdown buried IT in Jharkhand even before it spread its wings.         
	 Now, Singh said, Jharkhand was awaiting two more STPI centres. One in Jamshedpur under AIADA and the other at BIT- Sindri campus in Dhanbad. An STPI team visited these sites in September. Now, we are waiting to hear from it, he added.         
	Assistant director of STPI, Ranchi, Siddharth Kumar Rai said the centre was offering incubation facilities to software development companies in various streams and office equipment for start-ups.        
	We have STP units in Tata Technologies and TCS at Jamshedpur , he said, adding the new centres were sure to help software companies and professionals.         
	The industries secretary admitted the last three-four years werent good for industry, but hoped things would improve with investors becoming serious about Jharkhand.        
	We have weeded out several non-serious players who had signed MoUs. We now hope the serious players will invest around one lakh crore in the next three-four years, he said, indicating he was pinning hopes on the likes of Tata Steel, Electrosteel, Jindal Steel and Power and the Abhijeet Group.

	Itanagar, April 2: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today said the Centre had resolved to tackle terrorism stringently and would not allow any militant group to carry out subversive activities in the Northeast.        
	We are resolved to tackle terrorism of any kind with firm hands, Chidambaram, who arrived here today on a two-day maiden visit to the state, said.        
	The minister, however, evaded queries on whether his aerial survey of the Indo-Myanmar border, scheduled for tomorrow, had anything to do with the much-speculated-on joint operation against Northeast rebels in that country. Since the matter is related to national security, it cannot be discussed publicly, he said.        
	On sealing of the Indo-Myanmar border, he said it was unrealistic. Do you want me to seal it with wax? he quipped.        
	Chidambaram said the Centre was open to dialogue with Ulfa and other militant groups if they abjured violence. But we will firmly tackle troublemakers, specially splinter groups, he added.         
	He said the government had achieved breakthroughs with its peace initiatives last year through talks with militant groups.        
	Speaking to reporters here this evening, the minister dismissed claims that the Centre had bowed to external pressure over the ADB loan to Arunachal Pradesh. The Centre does not need ADB loan for Arunachal Pradesh. We are capable enough to fund development projects in the state, he said.         
	He also said the ceasefire with NSCN would not be applicable to the states Tirap and Changlang districts and that security forces had been instructed to handle the groups activists in these districts with an iron hand.        
	On the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, Chidambaram said a committee had been formed under Justice J. Reddy to recommend ways of making the act more humane.         
	He also addressed a high-level security meeting here for three hours this evening, during which he interacted with the top brass of the CRPF, SSB, ITBP and police.        
	Chidambaram, who arrived in Guwahati last night, reached here this morning. Soon after his arrival, he left for Gerukamukh in Lower Subansiri district, where he inspected the 2,000MW Lower Subansiri hydel project.         
	Upon his return here, he visited Ganga Lake, a bamboo processing centre at Poma village and Doimukh police station.         
	Chidambaram told reporters earlier in the day that inclement weather had put paid to his plans to visit Tawang today but added that the Centres stand on Tawang and the state was firm and clear  Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of the country. The minister was scheduled to visit Tawang yesterday, too, but the trip was postponed because of inclement weather.         
	After launching the bamboo processing unit at Poma, 35km from here, the home minister said the state would soon have a rail link and an airport to help it to exploit its tourism potential.

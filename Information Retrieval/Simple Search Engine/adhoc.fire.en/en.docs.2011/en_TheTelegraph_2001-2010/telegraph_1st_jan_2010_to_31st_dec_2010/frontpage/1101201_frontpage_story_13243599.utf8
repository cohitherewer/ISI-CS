          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Sonia Gandhi unveils the bust of Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi in Rae Bareli on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Lucknow, Nov. 30: Sonia Gandhi today walked into a temple built by writer Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi in his house in Rae Bareli in 1910 and found he had put his wifes portrait between the idols of Lakshmi and Saraswati.         
	One who places his wifes portrait in his temple gives the highest status to women in society, the Congress president said later, paying tribute to the writer who is regarded as the architect of modern Hindi prose.         
	I went into his temple today and put some flowers there, she added.         
	The temple is located in Daulatpur village, 98km from here, where Dwivedi was born in 1864. He died in 1938.         
	This is a unique move of empowering women that I ask men to take inspiration from. Women in those days had a low social status and Dwivedi wanted to form a new social order, the Congress president said.        
	She urged the youth to pledge to show respect to women and work for their empowerment in Uttar Pradesh.         
	The Rae Bareli MP, who is on a three-day trip to her constituency, unveiled a statue of Dwivedi who is called the Saratchandra Chattopadhyay of Uttar Pradesh and opened an exhibition of his writings.         
	The writers house is maintained as a national monument. Dwivedi had started as a clerk in the telegraph department and became a writer later. As the editor of a magazine, he evolved a new idiom for writers.         
	Bike siblings        
	Sonia Gandhi today asked members of her cavalcade to attend to two siblings who fell off their motorbike while trying to give way to the VIP convoy on a highway.        
	The brother and sister suffered minor injuries while trying to stop the bike at Bhairampur in Rae Bareli when Sonias convoy was coming from opposite direction, police said.        
	Sonia stopped there and ensured that the two were given first aid, the police added.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, March 11: A suspected kidnapper was tied to a funeral pyre on a field and burnt alive by a mob in Sonitpurs Bishnupur this morning.        
	Villagers identified the victim as a scrap-picker in his forties, but could not give his name.        
	Sonitpur deputy commissioner Rajesh Prasad said over telephone from Tezpur that the scrap-picker had gone to the area on his daily round on his bicycle and had allegedly tried to kidnap a three-and-a-half year-old boy.         
	He was caught by the villagers at Daitrang, assaulted and then set on fire, Prasad said, quoting preliminary reports from police.         
	Inhabited by Adivasi and ex-tea community people, Daitrang village in Bishnupur, about 15km from Gohpur town and 145km from the district headquarters Tezpur, is an area where witch-hunting is prevalent.         
	A police official from Gohpur police station, who visited Daitrang, said the scrap-picker had gone to the village around 10.30am.         
	The villagers alleged that he had tried to tuck Mesa Murmu, son of Col Murmu, into a gunny bag. The villagers caught him when the child raised an alarm, the official said.         
	The kidnapper was taken to nearby Lakhipathar, an open field, along with his bicycle and tied to a funeral pyre which was put together immediately. The pyre was then set on fire, the official said. The police arrived around 1.30pm.         
	When we reached, the fire was still burning. The half-burnt bicycle was all what we found, the official said.         
	There was no one near the pyre.         
	Our investigations revealed that the man frequently visited these areas collecting scrap. No one is willing to talk about the incident. What we have gathered till now is on the basis of accounts given by a few persons who had opposed burning of the victim, the official said.         
	He said a few of the villagers were claiming that they did not approve of the brutal method of punishment.         
	The handful of the victims remains has been sent for post-mortem, the police official said.         
	The Sonitpur district administration has ordered an inquiry into the incident, the deputy commissioner added.

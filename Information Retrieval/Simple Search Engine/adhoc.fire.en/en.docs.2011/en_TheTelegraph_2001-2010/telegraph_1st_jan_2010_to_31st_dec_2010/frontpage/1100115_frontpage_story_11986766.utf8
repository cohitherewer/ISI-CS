The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rules set to fight night noise
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rules set to fight night noise
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: The Centre has changed rules to prohibit or regulate noise from myriad sources, including the modern-day menace of construction and blowing horns at night.        
	Loud noise from the neighbours music system and parties is also covered by the rules notified this week by the environment and forest ministry.         
	The rules ban the use of vehicle horns, sound-emitting firecrackers, sound-emitting equipment and noisy construction equipment in residential areas at night.         
	Night-time has been specifically defined as 10pm to 6am, removing an ambiguity that allowed violators a loophole.        
	A person driving home after 10pm who honks for an apartment or a house gate to be opened will be violating the rules which will for the first time also cover sound-emitting systems and construction equipment.         
	Court-imposed restrictions were already in place but the notification means the rules are now in the realm of automatic policing. Local police now have no excuse for inaction if someone complains or they come to know of a violation on their own.        
	This is an important measure to make our cities less noisy, our nights less noisy, our public places less noisy, environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh said.        
	The government had first developed the noise pollution (regulation and control) rules in 2000, and set upper limits for permissible ambient noise levels in various zones. But current restrictions on noise levels have primarily relied on orders passed by the Supreme Court.         
	Now that weve incorporated the restrictions on noise levels in the noise pollution control rules, it will be easier for authorities to take action against violations, said an official in the ministry.         
	Prosecution and conviction under the rules may lead to a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh and imprisonment of up to seven years, depending on the gravity of the violation.         
	An occupant of a private place playing a music system will have to restrict its volume so that its noise level in a nextdoor neighbours house does not exceed 5 decibels more than the ambient noise level there.         
	The rules also specify that the noise at the periphery of a public place such as a hotel or a stadium should not rise above 10dB of the ambient noise beyond its periphery.         
	Vehicle horns, sound-emitting and construction equipment and loud firecrackers will be banned at all times through the day and night  around sensitive silence zones such as areas around hospitals and educational institutions.         
	Ramesh announced that the environment ministry would set up noise monitoring networks in Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Lucknow by September.        
	Ten automatic noise monitoring stations in each of these cities would record ambient noise levels 24 hours a day to create noise maps for each city.

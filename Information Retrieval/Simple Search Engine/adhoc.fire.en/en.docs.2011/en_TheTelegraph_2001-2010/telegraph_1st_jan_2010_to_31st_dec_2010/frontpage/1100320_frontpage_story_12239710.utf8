          NICK ALLEN                            Joslyn James                                  
	Los Angeles, March 19: Joslyn James, one of Tiger Woods alleged mistresses, has set up a website featuring X-rated text messages she claims were sent to her by the golfer.        
	The website carried a warning about explicit content and the messages were regularly punctuated by swear words and graphic descriptions of sex acts.        
	Their release could cause further problems for Woods as he attempts to patch up his marriage to Elin Nordegren following months of therapy.        
	 The first message, said to have been sent by Woods to the former porn star on July 30 last year, said: Heading back from the course now. Another sent 15 minutes later said: I will leave an envelope at the front desk under Ms Daniels. Your room will be 305. Get settled and let me know when you are ready to see me. I will be in room 201. You can come down the stair well next to your room. Make sure absolutely no one sees you.        
	 Weeks later the messages become extremely graphic, including expressing a desire for rough sex and multiple partners.         
	The final angry message, sent on October 4, said: You almost ruined my whole life.              
	 Miss James, 32, whose real name is Veronica Siwik-Daniels, is one of a dozen women said to have had affairs with Woods.        
	She said: quot;I just wanted to let the public know what the relationship was. Everyone else can draw their own conclusions from that. quot; The former porn star claims a total of 120 text messages were sent to her by Woods between July and October. She also claims to have been twice made pregnant by Woods.        
	The golfer publicly apologised for his behaviour last month and has been undergoing therapy.        
	After the revelations about his private life began in November he took a leave from professional golf. He will return in the Masters next month.

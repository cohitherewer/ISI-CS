          SANTOSH K. KIRO                            Archana Mahto, the mukhiya of Muramkala in Ramgarh, with the villagers on Friday. (Prashant Mitra)                                   
	Ramgarh, Dec. 24: Thousands of Hiware Bazars in Jharkhand?         
	The panchayat polls held in the state after 32 years have given newly elected village mukhiyas many such dreams. But how many villagers have heard of Hiware Bazar, Indias model village in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra with the highest GDP?         
	I dream of leading my village into another Hiware Bazar. I am prepared to work very hard for this, said Archana Mahto (35), the newly elected mukhiya of Muramkala gram panchayat in Ramgarh. An MBA from Ranchi University, Archana used to run an automobile service station in Ramgarh.         
	After polls, our mukhiya is suddenly talking of big things, all of which I fail to understand. I just want her to get me a BPL card, said Saraswati Devi (55), a Muramkala villager.        
	Archana is already facing a unique challenge  convincing villagers why the ideal of Hiware Bazar is important.         
	For villagers, words like change are too big to grasp. Consecutive droughts, widespread gaps in the delivery mechanisms of government welfare schemes and stagnant rural economy have broken their backbone. They only understand survival basics such as BPL cards, Antyodaya Yojana, public distribution system, old age pension, widow pension, etc.         
	But the freshly minted gram panchayat chiefs  both men and women  are talking about livelihood , irrigation , quality education and healthcare. A complete rural overhaul, in fact.         
	My first call is irrigation for farmers, which will drastically improve rural economy, said Basanti Devi (32), Gorobind gram panchayat mukhiya in Chitarpur block of Ramgarh district. The sociology graduate was a housewife till the polls changed her life forever. Now she hopes to change the lives of her fellow villagers. I am on my toes listening to villagers and planning on the development face of my gram panchayat, she said.         
	For mukhiya Ashna Pervez from Mail panchayat under Chitarpur block of Ramgarh, the education of the girl child is priority. If a girl is educated, her familys living standard grows, she said.         
	The results of well over 1,000 mukhiyas in districts of Ramgarh, Deoghar, Godda, Sahebganj, Dumka, Bokaro, Khunti, Simdega, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Koderma, Pakur and Jamtara have already been declared. By December 31, the state will get as many as 4,423 mukhiyas. Panchayat secretariats have also come up.        
	Once the state transfers powers to the gram panchayats under Panchayati Raj, mukhiyas will supervise 29 vital concerns, including irrigation, animal husbandry, fishery, rural housing, among others.

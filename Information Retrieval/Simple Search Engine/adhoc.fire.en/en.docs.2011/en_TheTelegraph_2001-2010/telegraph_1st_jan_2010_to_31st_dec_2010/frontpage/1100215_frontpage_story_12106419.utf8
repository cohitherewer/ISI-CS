          RITH BASU AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                            Ankik and Anindyees mother (in a red shawl) in Pune. (PTI)                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 14: The brown door of the third-floor flat at BB49 in Salt Lake was locked from outside and the days newspapers  with headlines crying out of the blast that took nine lives in Pune last evening  lay tucked in the collapsible gate till this evening.         
	Two of those nine  Ankik Dhar, 23, and his sister Anindyee, 19  had spent over 15 years behind the brown door of Flat No. 5 in the five-storey building.         
	Shilpa Goenka, 23, of 877A Jamuna Circle in Lake Town, was also killed in the blast at German Bakery in Pune.         
	We had seen Ankik and Anindyee growing The siblings were so bright. We cant believe this, said Ashok Das, a resident of the BB49 apartment building.         
	Ankik and Anindyees father Kamalendu, an ONGC employee, left for Pune early this morning along with his wife and youngest son Aishik, a Class XII student. Shilpas uncle Gopal Goenka, who lives in Mumbai, brought her body back to the city tonight.         
	An IIT Kharagpur alumnus, Ankik was working with global financial services firm JP Morgan in Mumbai and he had gone to Pune to meet sister Anindyee, a first-year economics student of Fergusson College.         
	He would have escorted his sister to Calcutta. Their father was transferred to Assam recently and they were probably coming here to pack their stuff, said neighbour Das.                           Anindyee and Ankiks house in   Salt Lake (Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha). Anindyee (top), who a friend said had interests ranging from trekking to fashion designing, besides academics      
	Shilpa, who did her engineering from BIT, Mesra, before joining Japanese finance major Nomura in Mumbai, was probably with the siblings at German Bakery. She was Ankiks classmate at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan school in Salt Lake, said a common friend.         
	Ankik completed school in 2004 with over 90 per cent marks. He was particularly good in mathematics and physics, said Anindita Chatterjee, the principal.         
	At IIT Kharagpur, old associates recounted how Tempo-da  Ankiks nickname on the campus  had endeared himself in hostel.         
	We will miss the exuberance that had brightened our dramatics practices and pushed us to better performances. We will miss your shouts from the goalpost to the strikers on the football field, we will miss your finger tip save, fifth-year undergraduate student Mithun Madhusudan wrote in The Scholars Avenue, an online campus newspaper.         
	The jolly and adventurous Anindyee  Andy to her friends  was equally loved in her peer group.         
	Her school friend Chitrangada recounted how she pursued several interests  from trekking to fashion designing.         
	In her profile in social networking site Facebook, Anindyee had written: I believe in being a beautiful and strong woman who will make heads turn and eyes look up. I am my own princess and I need a prince who needs me.         
	At BB49, the residents remembered how the little princess and her brother kept everybody entertained.         
	The mourning was a private affair at the Goenka household in Lake Town.         
	Our family is very conservative. But Shilpa had been a good student since her childhood. She convinced us that she would be fine by herself in Mumbai. But look what has happened, said Ganpat Goenka, her grandfather.        
	Mamata Banerjee visited the Goenkas this evening. I have come here to stand by the family in this hour of crisis, the Trinamul Congress leader said.        
	CPM leader Amitava Nandi was at the airport when the body landed around 10.30pm. He accompanied the hearse to her house.

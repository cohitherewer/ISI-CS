The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Delhi cut up over Lalgarh

          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	April 5: More than local politics, the Bengal governments reluctance to take responsibility for the battle against Maoists is being seen as the principal reason behind P. Chidambarams repeated reminders to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that the buck stops at his table.        
	Home ministry sources in Delhi today said the Bengal government was depending too much on the Centre to clear up the areas infested by the Maoists, instead of taking decisive action on its own.        
	First, the state government dragged its feet on Lalgarh and allowed the Maoists to strike deep roots there. Now, indecision by incompetent officers is standing in the way, an official said.        
	The home ministry also feels that while many Maoist-hit states are trying to take on more responsibility, the Bengal government is still a laggard.        
	Chidambaram almost said so yesterday. In Bengal its a mixed record, the record should improve. All over the country, there is a mixed record but significant improvement in the situation in Gadchiroli (Maharashtra), Chhattisgarh, certainly in Andhra Pradesh, the situation is virtually under control. But the situation is causing concern in Orissa, Jharkhand.        
	Home ministry sources said Chidambaram might visit Lalgarh again in the near future to shake the Bengal administration out of its slumber.        
	The ministry officials feel that the Sunday visit to Lalgarh exposed the Bengal governments apathy and failure to provide political and administrative leadership in the area. Bengals senior political leaders, including the chief minister, have not visited Lalgarh since November 2008. But a Union minister could do so yesterday, an official pointed out.        
	A crowd of 500 had materialised within a short time of the home minister landing at Lalgarh. By his visit, the home minister proved it was not difficult to enter Lalgarh for public representatives, the official said.         
	Political leaders and local representatives have not even bothered visiting the area for over a year now. There is a lack of leadership at the district level. How will they carry out development work if they do not even go there? the official asked.         
	CPM leader Mohammad Salim said: You better ask the chief minister why he didnt visit the area. We think it depends on ones style of functioning. Visits by ministers do not solve local problems. State government officers have visited the area. At the party level, we have a different way of functioning.

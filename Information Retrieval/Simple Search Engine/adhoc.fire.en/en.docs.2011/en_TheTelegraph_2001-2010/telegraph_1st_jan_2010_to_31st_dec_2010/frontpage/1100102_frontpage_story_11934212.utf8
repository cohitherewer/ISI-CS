          RICHARD ALLEYNE                            Sleep stability                                  
	London, Jan. 1: Teenagers should go to bed before 10pm to stop them developing depression, new research claims.        
	Teens allowed to go to bed after midnight were almost a quarter  24 per cent  more likely to suffer from depression and a fifth more likely to think about self harm than those who were set bedtimes of 10pm or earlier. The authors of the study, published in the journal Sleep, said that the more sleep adolescents get the better it is for their mental health.        
	 Adolescents who usually slept for five or fewer hours per night were 71 per cent more likely to suffer from depression and 48 per cent more likely to think about committing suicide than those who reported getting eight hours of nightly sleep, it was claimed.        
	Researchers studied more than 15,000 students and their parents at US schools. The average sleep duration was seven hours and 53 minutes, against the nine or more hours of nightly sleep recommended for adolescents.        
	Those with a bedtime or 10pm or earlier slept on average eight hours and ten minutes  33 minutes longer than those who went to bed at 11pm, and 40 minutes more than those who went to bed past midnight.

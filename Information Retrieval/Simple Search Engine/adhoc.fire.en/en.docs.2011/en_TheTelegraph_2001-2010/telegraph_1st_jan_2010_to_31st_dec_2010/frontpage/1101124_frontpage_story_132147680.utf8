	Hyderabad, Nov 24 (PTI): Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister K Rosaiah today announced his decision to step down from the post citing personal reasons.
    "I have decided to resign, I am submitting my resignation to the state Governor and I will request him to accept it immediately," 77-year-old Rosaiah announced at a crowded press conference in the State Secretariat.
    He cited personal reasons for his resignation while stating that "there are no political reasons behind it".
    The resignation comes hours before a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party here to discuss the telecast of a programme by rebel MP Jaganmohan Reddy owned Sakshi TV criticising Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
    The meeting will be attended by Union ministers Pranab Mukherkee and M Veerappa Moily, who is in-charge of Congress affairs in the state.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 23: Twin snags greeted the new Metro Railway boss on his first full day in office, prompting an official to suggest that yesterdays removal of the previous general manager amounted to finding a scapegoat (that) wont solve Metros problems.        
	An AC train got stranded at Girish Park station today and let out smoke, triggering panic among passengers. Minutes earlier, a non-AC train had got stuck at the changeover point at Kavi Subhas (New Garia) station because of a signalling system failure.        
	Sources said the signalling panel had snagged four times since becoming operational last month. The system was set up in haste so that services could be run till New Garia in keeping with the ministrys orders, an official said.        
	Both incidents happened in the morning, hours after P.B. Murty had replaced Amar Nath as Metro general manager yesterday afternoon.        
	Nath, relieved of his post officially on health grounds, was understood to have been removed on railway minister Mamata Banerjees orders because of a series of mishaps capped by the first-ever Metro derailment on Wednesday.        
	Todays glitches have again proved that finding a scapegoat wont solve Metros problems. Instead of removing the general manager, the minister should lay stress on improving the infrastructure, a senior Metro official told The Telegraph, venting the discontent among staff and officials.        
	Mamata sounded a little defensive today, telling a rally in Calcuttas Beliaghata that things would take some time to settle down.        
	A person can come to know about the leaks in the pipes or cracks in the wall only after coming to live in a house.... I am just one year and four months old in the railway ministry. Anything new requires at least a few months to settle down, she said.        
	How do I increase the number of rakes overnight? she asked at one point.The days second snag came at 7.45am when one of the two newly procured, and apparently jinxed, AC trains was about to leave Girish Park. The brake of one of the coaches jammed because of excessive heat and so the axle could not function, an official said.        
	As smoke rose from the coach, passengers panicked. Some began banging on the door, said a commuter.        
	The passengers were evacuated at the station and the empty train was taken to the Tollygunge maintenance shed before being run again in the afternoon, officials said.        
	Speaking generally, Metro officials said the AC rakes should have been given more trial runs before starting passenger trips.        
	Earlier at 7.22am, after the passengers had got off a train at New Garia, the empty rake approached the changeover point to get onto the Dum Dum-bound track and got stranded. Services resumed at 7.56am after the signalling fault was repaired.

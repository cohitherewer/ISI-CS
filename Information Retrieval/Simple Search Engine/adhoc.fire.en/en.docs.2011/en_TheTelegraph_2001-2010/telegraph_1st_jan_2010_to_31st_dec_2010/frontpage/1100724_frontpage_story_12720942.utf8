          J.P. YADAV                       Karat                          
	New Delhi, July 23: The CPM will place before an extended central committee meeting two separate resolutions on the strategy for Assembly elections in Bengal and Kerala, Prakash Karat announced today.        
	 The statement is a virtual admission that the Bengal unit has not yet accepted the dictates of the central leadership and will try to fashion its own tactics.        
	Special resolutions for Bengal and Kerala would be placed before the extended central committee, Karat said today in reply to a question on what strategy the party would follow in the poll-bound eastern state.         
	Sources said that because of the strong resistance from Bengal leaders, the central committee was unable to give shape to the political strategy for the elections next year and postponed it till the extended central committee meeting.        
	The decision for separate resolutions that will give some leeway to the Bengal unit, which feels that blind anti-Congressism has only served to unite the Opposition at the cost of the Left, was taken after a three-day meeting of the CPMs central committee.        
	The extended central committee, the highest decision-making body of the party, is scheduled to be held in Vijayawada from August 7 to 10.         
	The decision in effect means that Bengal and Kerala have been granted a free hand by the central leadership to decide their political approach based on different conditions prevailing in each state.         
	For the Bengal unit that has been continuously holding the decisions of the central leadership as the key factors for the string of electoral debacles in the state, todays decision was received as a victory for the state leadership.        
	The sources said that central committee members from Bengal  divided in the past  put up a united fight to get their voice heard. All of them appeared to challenge the defeatist attitude of the central leaders about the fate of the Left Front government in Bengal.        
	The central leadership, led by Karat, believes that the defeat of the Left Front in Bengal was only a matter of time and holds the state government responsible for the steady slide. Nirupam Sen, Bengal industries minister and politburo member considered close to Karat, had recently delivered in the Assembly what sounded like a farewell speech.        
	The central leadership has also left the state unit to fend for itself, strengthening the perception that the headquarters does not want to sully its hands by trying to salvage an impossible situation. If the Bengal line is allowed during the Assembly polls and the Left still loses, the central lobby may find it easier to wash its hands of responsibility.        
	The Bengal leaders contended that unlike in Kerala, the Trinamul Congress, not the Congress, happened to be the main enemy of the Left in Bengal. The local unit should not close the option of a tactical adjustment with the Congress in the state. The Bengal leaders felt that the alliance between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress was fragile and the fault lines would widen during seat adjustments.        
	If Bengal had its way on one count, Karat, too, held his ground. The CPM leader got the central committee to accept that the party has to fight the neo-liberal policies of the Congress-led UPA government with the same vigour with which it opposes the communal BJP.        
	The central leadership faced strong criticism from the members for its political mistakes but Karat is learnt to have withstood the flak over the timing of the withdrawal of support to UPA1.         
	He accepted that the third front experiment was a mistake but justified the withdrawal of support. The withdrawal of support was right, Karat said after the meeting.        
	He virtually declared that the party had abandoned the idea of a third alternative in the present context.        
	Asked whether they will ally with the Congress again to stop communal forces if the need arises, Karat said it was a hypothetical question. Where is such a situation now? he asked.        
	The final political line the Vijayawada meeting is scheduled to decide will be different from the one etched at the last party congress in Coimbatore, he said. The party congress had laid stress on the BJP as the main enemy as the CPM was then supporting UPA1.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 15: The Prime Minister has given Kapil Sibal additional charge of telecom, sending a nuanced message to the DMK and other UPA constituents less than 24 hours after A. Raja was persuaded to vacate the ministry.        
	The allocation has nipped for the moment speculation that the Congresss Tamil Nadu ally was preparing for another round of bargaining to reclaim what was mirthfully described as ATM (any time money) ministry. We have been holding it since the UPAs first tenure, a DMK source said.        
	Government sources said big changes were likely only during a long-awaited ministry shuffle that is now expected sometime in January.        
	The quick decision to hand over telecom to Sibal, the human resource development minister, signalled the intent of the leadership of the government and the Congress that corruption would not be countenanced, whether it tainted Congress leaders or those of the allies.        
	Sibal has run up his share of controversies in the HRD ministry  the education tribunal bill he piloted was opposed by a section of the Congress that blocked its passage in the Rajya Sabha. But his detractors agreed that his clean image was unsullied, a factor that apparently weighed the most with the Congress brass at this moment.        
	Rahul Gandhi underscored the importance of the crusade against corruption when he told journalists in Uttar Pradesh today that we need to be strict on corruption. The government is in the process of taking strong action.        
	Sibal was earlier asked to handle science and technology that was vacated by Prithviraj Chavan who was moved to Maharashtra.        
	But the last has not been heard on the joust for the telecom ministry. The DMK said Sibals appointment was a stop-gap arrangement.        
	Sources said the Karunanidhi clan was preoccupied with preparations for the wedding of central minister M.K. Alagiris son this week, so the leader did not have had the time to mull over names.         
	The DMK is smarting from the perception that Rajas ouster might dent its record of being one of the few regional parties that consistently, and often successfully, challenged governments in Delhi.        
	The sources conceded that failure to get back telecom would be another political blow in the run-up to the Assembly elections, due next May. The cadres would get the message that our bargaining power has been eroded, a source said.        
	On the other hand, the word from the Congress was it would like the temporary arrangement to become permanent. Sibal has handled telecom cases as a lawyer and he is familiar with the complexities of the issues, a Congress leader said.        
	However, since Sibal has another key portfolio, a cabinet shuffle will have to be effected sooner than later.        
	In the prevailing mood, Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi are expected to try to weed out the under-performers. This kind of a thing will take time because both are overly cautious, a Congress source said.

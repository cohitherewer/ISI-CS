          RUDRA BISWAS amp; CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE                              
	Ranchi, Jan. 13: Barely 24 hours after power supply was back to normal, most parts of the state plunged into darkness again with three units at Patratu Thermal Power Station developing technical snags and power generation plummeting to 270MW against a peak time demand of over 850MW.        
	Sources revealed the situation was unlikely to improve over the next two days. The state owned Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) was drawing around 270MW from the eastern grid, but with a deficit of over 300MW, it had no option but to enforce phased blackouts throughout its command areas in Ranchi, East and West Singhbhum, Gumla, Khunti, Simdega, Lohardaga, Garhwa, Chatra, Latehar and Palamau districts.        
	In the state capital, residents woke up to a power cut  accompanied by water supply failure  as JSEB had enforced blackouts from as early as 6am today.         
	However, a ray of hope came in the form of a Jharkhand High Court directive asking both the central electricity pool and the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) to supply 100MW immediately.         
	A bench comprising Chief Justice Gyan Sudha Misra and Justice R.R. Prasad was dissatisfied with the stand of the DVC and the central pool  both supplying power way below the desired level.         
	While the DVC was supposed to provide 150MW, about 507MW was to be supplied by the Centre. However, both the DVC and the central pool were merely supplying 25MW and 267MW respectively.         
	The matter had come up in a public interest litigation filed by advocate M.S. Mittal complaining about the erratic power supply in the capital since 2001.         
	After realising the seriousness of the problem, the court took charge and has been monitoring it ever since.

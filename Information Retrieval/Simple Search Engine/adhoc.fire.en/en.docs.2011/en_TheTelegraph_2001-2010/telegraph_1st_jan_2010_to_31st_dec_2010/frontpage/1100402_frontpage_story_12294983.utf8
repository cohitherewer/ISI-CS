          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                              
	New Delhi, April 1: As 13-year-old Bantu Kumar scrubbed dirty plates under a trickle of tap water and wiped them dry, the light the Prime Minister wants to shine on those like him threatened to pass him by.        
	I read under the dim light of a kerosene lamp. I am what I am today because of education, Manmohan Singh told the nation as his government launched the right to education law today.         
	I want every Indian child... to be so touched by the light of education. I want every Indian to dream of a better future and live that dream.         
	But Bantu does not dream the kind of dream the Prime Minister wants him to.        
	I really wanted to study when I was young. But today, even if the government offers me schooling, I will refuse. I need to work for my family, for myself, said the boy from Bihar, sent by his parents to Delhi seven months ago to work.        
	To accounts teacher Vinod Kumar Singh, 35, capturing the interest of millions of children like Bantu represents the governments biggest challenge as it gives the right to every child between 6 and 14 to legally demand free schooling from it.        
	The government, central or state, can assign the child to a government school or even a private school under a 25 per cent quota for disadvantaged children that private schools are required to ensure.        
	But Vinod Singhs school  one of the capitals best-known government schools, the Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Minto Road  shows why it may prove hard to attract children like Bantu. The school, like most across the country, is desperately short of teachers.        
	Nationally, India needs 12 lakh schoolteachers to meet the student-teacher ratio mandated by the education law. The Centre says India is 5 lakh teachers short of this target.        
	Vinod works almost 70 hours a week  across two shifts a day  instead of the 32 hours he is required to under service rules. The teacher, who earlier taught in a well-known private school, said he decided to shift to the government school system after a friend threw him a challenge.        
	Today, working twice his scheduled number of hours to ensure that students do not suffer because of the vacant teaching posts, he sometimes questions the point of it all.        
	I feel like I am confronting a seemingly endless army of challenges. But when I look over my shoulder, I see that the rows of my soldier colleagues end almost immediately, Vinod said.        
	He does not mind working extra hard but says that some recognition, even a few words, from the government  his employers  would help encourage teachers like him. Par sarkaar me to gadhe ghode ek hai (but in the government, donkeys and horses are treated the same), he said.        
	Government officials accept that the publicly funded schools will have to bear most of the burden of implementing the right to education law. Most children who do not attend school cannot afford private schools, and the 25 per cent quota can accommodate just a small fraction of them.        
	But the state of government schools is such that today our best students are likely to get jobs as peons or lower-division clerks at best. Would a child already earning a living be attracted enough to join school? asked Manvender Singh, principal of another Delhi government school, while lauding the intention behind the law.

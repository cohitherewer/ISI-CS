  - Ouch! The great betrayal         OUR BUREAU                                                    
	April 27: Everybody loves a bandh in Bengal.        
	Correction: everybody, except Mamata Banerjee.        
	One of the biggest betrayals in street politics unfolded today in Delhi when Mamata, once the champion of bandh champions, called the Left general strike hooliganism.        
	In the name of Bharat bandh, hooliganism was unleashed. They locked the toilet at the (Calcutta) airport. Its inhuman and a mockery of democracy. It was a state-sponsored strike in West Bengal, an angry Mamata declared in Delhi, not forgetting to add: The Trinamul Congress is not in favour of strikes.         
	Many a pot has called the kettle black but this is a different kettle of politician, no longer a disrupter but a wannabe builder.        
	Mamata had declared before the Lok Sabha polls that she would not call bandhs at the drop of a hat  a promise she has kept since then.        
	Mamata last called a 12-hour bandh on April 21, 2008  two years ago almost to the date. The issue then was the same as that of the Left now: soaring prices. But something else happened that Monday: she cut short the bandh by two hours, ostensibly because of the wedding season but actually because of lukewarm response from the ranks who did not like the way then newfound ally SUCI was enforcing the shutdown before the panchayat polls.        
	It makes political sense for Mamata to press ahead with an image makeover before the Assembly polls  remember: industrialisation is no longer a red rag and she was the first to speak about Presidency College autonomy. Economic logic is also on her side.        
	At the helm of the railways  once a favourite target of the Trinamul bandh brigade  Mamata has realised that the utility is at the receiving end of all forms of protest. On more than one occasion, she has said in Parliament that Maoist violence and bandhs had cost the railways over Rs 500 crore.        
	Today, she used the bandh to lash out at the CPM and project it as a destroyer in power.        
	In Delhi, they (CPM leaders) showcase a clean image but in West Bengal, they are murdering democracy and the Constitution. Can you imagine that they closed the toilet at the airport? It is the duty of the state to provide relief but here the state forced the passengers to suffer, she declared.

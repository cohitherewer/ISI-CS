	Ranchi, Sept. 6: The man responsible for putting investigating agencies onto Madhu Kodas tail was finally traced by the CBI which presented him in court today, prompting the judge to rebuke the state administration for having failed to locate the mystery petitioner ever since he filed his PIL in September 2008.        
	CBI officials are understood to have escorted a thin, bespectacled Durga Oraon in a white cap to the high court that was abuzz with activity since morning.         
	By the time Chief Justice Bhagwati Prasad took his chair around 10.30am, Oraon was already in court.        
	Justice Prasad asked him his name and clarified whether he was the one who had filed the PIL in the high court seeking a CBI probe into the alleged disproportionate assets of former chief minister Koda and some of his former cabinet colleagues.        
	The judge also asked him if he had indeed signed the affidavits filed in court.        
	Oraon said yes to both, adding that since he did not know English, the contents of his petition and affidavits were explained to him in Hindi. He, however, denied any knowledge of a court order seeking his presence.        
	The CBI traced Oraon, alias Durga Munda, through the person who had identified him  as is mandatory  when he filed his petition in September 2008.        
	Oraon said he was a resident of Simdega and was engaged in the real estate business.         
	The judge then asked him to identify his advocates. He acknowledged their presence in court by pointing towards Ritu Kumar and Rajeev Kumar who have been appearing before the bench in connection with the case.        
	The division bench of Justice Prasad and Justice Amareshwar Sahay was satisfied with the identity of Oraon and therefore disposed of the matter, observing that no further inquiry was required.        
	The court, however, directed the CBI to continue with investigations into an alleged sting operation involving Oraons advocates who were accused of tampering with the case. The matter would be taken up after a month.        
	Oraons PIL became the topic of high-voltage speculation ever since it was filed in September, 2008. That he never appeared in court, citing security reasons, added to the intrigue surrounding the case.                                      
	However, it was his petition that set the stage for the state to launch a vigilance bureau probe against Koda who is now Singhbhum MP, but has been in jail since his arrest on November 30 last year.        
	On August 5, the high court ordered the CBI to take over investigations into disproportionate assets cases against Koda and his former cabinet colleagues including Harinarayan Rai, Anosh Ekka, Dulal Bhuiyan, Chandra Prakash Choudhary, Kamlesh Singh, Bhanu Pratap Sahi and Bandhu Tirkey.        
	Apart from Koda, Rai, Ekka and Kamlesh Singh are also in jail.

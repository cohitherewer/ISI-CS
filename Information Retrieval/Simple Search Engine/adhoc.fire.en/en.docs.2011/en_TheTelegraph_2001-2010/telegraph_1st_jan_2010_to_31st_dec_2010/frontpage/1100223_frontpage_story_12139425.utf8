          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs today decided to set up a political committee to deliberate upon the demand for the separate state of Gorkhaland as well as explore if the DGHC should be replaced by another body with more executive powers.         
	At its meeting today, the CCPA asked the home ministry to request political parties to name their representatives for the political committee. It is not clear whether GNLF chief Subash Ghisingh, the first DGHC administrator, will be invited to be part of the committee. The president of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, Bimal Gurung, had been a close lieutenant of Ghisingh till he broke away, floated his own outfit and chased away the GNLF chief from the hills.         
	Sources said the committee was being constituted as the Centre, the Bengal government and the Morcha believed that the problem could not be solved at the bureaucratic-level but needs political intervention. Union home secretary G.K. Pillai and senior Bengal bureaucrats have negotiated with the Morcha leaders during the four rounds of tripartite talks held so far.         
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee who attended the CCPA meeting refused to speak to the media after the parley. Sources, who attended the session, said the Trinamul Congress chief had vehemently opposed a separate Gorkhaland state. Sources quoted Banerjee as having said Gorkhaland was an impossibility considering that all major political parties from Bengal were against it.         
	The home ministry will decide upon the committees terms of reference in the days to come. The ministry had earlier this month constituted a committee headed by Justice (retired) B.N. Srikrishna to look into the demands of the separate Telangana state.         
	Ministry sources said Morcha leader Gurung had realised that it was virtually impossible for the Centre and the Bengal government to agree to Gorkhaland and needed a face- saver to bring down the political temperature in the hills. There is little likelihood of a separate Gorkhaland. All that can be conceded to the DGHC is some more area and executive powers. It is something that the committee will look into, said a source.         
	The last round of tripartite talks was held on December 23. The Morcha had demanded the fifth round within 45 days. But the CCPA has not yet decided on the date yet.         
	There is near unanimity among Bengals major political parties and the Centre that a separate Gorkhaland is not possible. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had rejected the demand during the chief ministers conference in New Delhi earlier this month. He had offered to give more powers to the DGHC or any other council that would replace it.

	Islamabad, May 8 (PTI): Former President Pervez Musharraf has unveiled plans to return to active politics, saying that he would contest the next general election in Pakistan whenever it is held.         
	Musharraf, who has been living in London for over a year, announced his future plans while addressing a gathering of his supporters in Islamabad via video conference.         
	I have decided to take part in Pakistans politics and I will come forward in the next elections, irrespective of whether they are mid-term elections or end-term elections. I will participate in them, he said.        
	The former President resigned in August 2008 to avoid impeachment by the Pakistan Peoples Party-led government.         
	A raft of civil and criminal cases were filed against him in courts across the country after the Supreme Court declared the emergency imposed by Musharraf in 2007 as unconstitutional and illegal.

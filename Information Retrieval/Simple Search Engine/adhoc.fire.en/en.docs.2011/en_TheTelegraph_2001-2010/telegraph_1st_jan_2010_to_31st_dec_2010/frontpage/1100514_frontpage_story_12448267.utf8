          AMIT ROY                            Mallika Sherawat with Subhash Ghai at the opening of the Indian Pavilion in Cannes                                  
	Cannes, May 13: A museum of Indian cinema, where children can have a fun day out playing around with interactive equipment, will be up and running in Mumbai by 2013, it was announced today at the opening of the Indian pavilion in Cannes.        
	There will be a special place for Bengali cinema in the museum, for the government recognises the quality of its movie-makers. People in Bengal, who collect scripts, programme notes, old photographs, posters and other movie memorabilia, will be invited either to donate or sell their treasures to the museum.        
	Many lovers of Indian cinema have long felt that such a museum was overdue.        
	Now, finally, the government has called action, according to the announcement made today by Raghu Menon, secretary, ministry of information and broadcasting.        
	The museum will be located in the Films Division Complex on Peddar Road in Mumbai  it is in the heart of Mumbai, said Menon. You cannot get a better location than that.        
	So crowded was the Indian pavilion on the Croisette that Menon promised the government would probably increase the space next year.        
	Those present included representatives of the film industry, such as Subhash Ghai and Mallika Sherawat  the bouncy actress is in Cannes to promote her new movie Hiss, assisted apparently by a python of some sort  senior businessmen such as P.P. Hinduja, the Indian ambassador to France, Rajan Mathai, and Sujata Dev, co-chairman, of the entertainment committee of Assocham. The Cannes authorities also attended the opening.        
	Menon said the museum would open in 2013 to mark the centenary of Raja HarishchandraMenon said the museum would open in 2013 to mark the centenary of Raja Harishchandra, the 1913 silent Indian film directed and produced by Dadasaheb Phalke, after whom we have named our highest cinema honour. The movie is acknowledged to be the first full-length Indian feature film. based on the legend of King Harishchandra, recounted in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.        
	 India has a heritage of films extending almost 100 years, continued Menon. We have proposed a national film heritage museum which would take up the preservation and preservation of Indian films over all these years. In fact, a number of priceless films made in India have been lost for ever but with this mission we hope to arrest this and we hope we will be able to not only restore but also digitalise the classics of the past.        
	 He went on: We find that despite our long history and heritage there is really no museum to showcase the achievements and exhibits of Indian cinema for the last 100 years.        
	 The I amp;B secretary said: We will seek the cooperation and support of the Indian film industry for use to get the artifacts which can be displayed. We want to make it an interactive museum, with auditoria where films can be watched, and equipment especially for children. We hope to complete the projects by 2013.        
	Menon said: After the formal announcement, Menon spoke to The Telegraph elaborating on the governments plans. We want to have a society to run it  we dont want government to run it, he commented. Of course, the government is funding the capital expenditure. Once it is set up we would like a society consisting of eminent film people actually to run the place on a private-public partnership model.        
	 He revealed: The capital expenditure is coming to Rs140 crore which includes the building, the equipment, the interiors and trying to get some of the exhibits for the museum because we may not be able to get everything free of cost.        
	 Menon underlined the project was truly ambitious. The museum will be very big. It will be in two parts. Inside the Films Division Complex we have a heritage building already existing called Gulshan Mahal which is almost 150 years old and we are going to use that and also set up a new building. It will be a two building complex  one will be the heritage one, one will be the new one.        
	As for the cost of entry to the museum, Menon said it wont be free of charge but it will be nominal.        
	The idea is not to make money from the tickets but there will be ticketing.

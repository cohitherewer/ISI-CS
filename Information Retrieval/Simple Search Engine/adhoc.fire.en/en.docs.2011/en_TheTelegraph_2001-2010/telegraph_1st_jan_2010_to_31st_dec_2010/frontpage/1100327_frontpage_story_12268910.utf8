                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                State voices power demands
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            DVC power station at Maithon                                  
	Ranchi, March 26: The state government today claimed at least 50 per cent share of the total power to be produced by DVC from its upcoming thermal plant at Koderma in Jharkhand and another 25 per cent from the upcoming Subhansri hydel project of NHPC in Arunachal Pradesh.        
	At todays meeting in Calcutta of Eastern India power producers, including Damodar Valley Corporation, National Hydro-electric Power Corporation, West Bengal State Electricity Board, Bihar SEB, National Thermal Power Corporation, Gridco and Power Grid Corporation, state energy secretary N.N. Pandey pointed out that the total demand of Jharkhand was estimated to cross 1,800MW following increased developmental activities and a spurt in rural electrification.        
	Pandey, who is also chairman, Jharkhand State Electricity Board, pointed out that the state was currently producing an average of 600MW from its two thermal plants at Tenughat and Patratu, apart from its lone hydel project at Sikidiri, Ranchi, which was run mainly during the monsoon.        
	An additional 300MW was coming from the central pool, leaving the state with an overall deficit of more than 900MW. To help meet the states power requirement, we have demanded at least 50 per cent share of power that would be produced by the two upcoming DVC units of 500MW each in Koderma, Pandey told The Telegraph.        
	In addition, we have also demanded a 25 per cent share of the total power to be produced from the Subhansri hydel project (around 2,000MW) that is coming up in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam on the river Subhansri, he said.        
	For receiving additional power from both DVC and NHPC, Jharkhand would be required to enter into bilateral agreements with the two power producers.        
	He pointed out that apart from a spurt in rural electrification projects aimed at covering 32,000 villages, the government was poised to launch free connections for above poverty line families in rural areas.

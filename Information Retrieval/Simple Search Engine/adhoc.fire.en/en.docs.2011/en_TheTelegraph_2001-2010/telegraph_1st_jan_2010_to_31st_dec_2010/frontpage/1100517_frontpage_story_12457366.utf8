          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, May 16: A stampede across the width of a platform, after a last-minute switch of a trains departure from one side to the other, killed a young mother and a 12-year-old boy at New Delhi railway station today.        
	At least 40 others including children leaving on summer vacation were injured in the 2.50pm tragedy, which took place on a platform chock-a-block with two sets of peak-season passengers.        
	Thousands were awaiting the arrival of the Patna-bound Sampark Kranti Express on Platform 13 and the Bhagalpur-bound Vikramsila Express on Platform 12 when the Sampark Kranti suddenly rolled in at Platform 12. Many passengers said they hadnt even heard the last-minute announcement, probably because of the noise around.         
	Numbers 12 and 13 being the two sides of the same platform, the Sampark Kranti passengers needed merely to switch sides by crossing a few yards. But people targeting the unreserved general bogie  many of them hauling young children  started a rush, pushing and shoving others.        
	The chaos deepened as more people descended down the overbridge, and many got trampled at the foot of the stairs. There were no Railway Protection Force personnel, railway staff or civic crowd management officials, who usually make people stand in a queue to board the general bogies, passengers said.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee, who is in Calcutta just as she was when a two-day train drivers strike paralysed Mumbai recently, said: A high-level committee has been formed to probe whether it was an accident or sabotage.

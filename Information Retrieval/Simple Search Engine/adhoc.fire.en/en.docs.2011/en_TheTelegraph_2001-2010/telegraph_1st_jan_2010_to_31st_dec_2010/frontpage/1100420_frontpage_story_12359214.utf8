The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | First rules for deemed label

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                               
	New Delhi, April 19: Institutions seeking deemed university status will first need to acquire the highest possible quality rating from accreditation agencies under tough regulations finalised by the human resource development ministry.        
	Only institutions which earn an A+ quality rating from accreditation agencies will be eligible for deemed university status under the regulations that the HRD ministry today asked the University Grants Commission to notify.        
	The regulations, accessed by The Telegraph from UGC sources, are the first legally binding rules that India will be putting in place to regulate deemed universities, many of which have been misleading students through dubious courses.        
	The move will mean that institutions seeking the deemed university tag will need to meet quality standards not mandatory even for full-fledged central universities, which require no minimum rating grade.        
	Till now, the UGC and the HRD ministry monitored deemed universities through a set of guidelines that were updated every few years but which were not legally binding on institutions.        
	A review panel set up by HRD minister Kapil Sibal within days of taking charge last year found 88 of Indias 130 deemed universities unfit for the tag.               
	The status allows institutions to award degrees without facing legislative scrutiny like full-fledged universities.        
	The new regulations have been finetuned by a task force consisting of the same members that conducted the central review and have been accepted by the HRD ministry, sources said.         
	Institutions are granted the deemed tag through two possible routes -- generally by proving their standards over a period of time, and in exceptional cases if they are offering courses in emerging areas the government wants to promote.        
	The general route required institutions to function first as colleges affiliated to full-fledged universities for a period of 10 years before becoming eligible for the deemed tag, under current guidelines.         
	But the new regulations sent by the ministry to the UGC mandate that institutions will need to exist as colleges for 15 years -- five more than earlier -- to become eligible for deemed university status.        
	The exceptional route -- to acquire what is known as the de novo (fresh deemed university status -- was found by the central review to have been widely misused.        
	Only select government de novo deemed universities were actually pursuing research and academics in the emerging areas for which they won the tag, the review noted in its report.        
	Under current guidelines, the UGC alone needed to be convinced that an institution deserved deemed university status under the de novo category.         
	But the new regulations require institutions to convince a national panel of experts of their ability to deliver in the emerging areas they cite in their application.        
	Under current guidelines, a UGC panel alone reviews a deemed universitys performance each time it need to reapply for the tag, which is granted for a period of time decided by the grants commission.        
	The new regulations make it mandatory for the government to set up an independent panel of experts to review the performance of each deemed university every five years.        
	Sibals proposed common entrance test for admissions into all higher educational institutions will also cover deemed universities, the regulations specify.        
	The regulations ban all deemed universities -- irrespective of their track record -- from offering distance education courses.         
	The distance education mode is abused by some deemed universities to offer sub-standard education, the central review had found. Some deemed universities were even offering PhDs through the distance mode, and allowing students to pick and pay their own guides.

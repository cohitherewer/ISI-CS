  - PC writes to Bihar, Bengal, Jharkhand on Hunt         SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            Dalbhumgarh block development officer Prashant Kumar Layek met chief minister Shibu Soren in Ranchi on Saturday evening. Following his release by Maoist rebels on Friday, Layek first went to Ghatshila and then proceeded to meet his ailing mother in Dumka on Saturday morning. On the way, he stopped in Jamshedpur to pay a courtesy call on deputy commissioner R.K. Agarwal. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                        
	Ranchi, Feb. 20: Chief minister Shibu Soren ticked off the police for implicating innocents in their effort to deal with Maoists and asked them to learn lessons from the abduction and release of BDO Prashant Layek.        
	On a day the state received a letter from the Union home minister on the need for a consensus between states on Operation Green Hunt, Soren held a review meeting attended by home secretary J.B. Tubid, DGP Neyaz Ahmed, chief ministers principal secretary Sukhdeo Singh, and senior police officers from districts.        
	But P. Chidamabarams letter wasnt discussed. Nor was Operation Green Hunt. Instead, Soren said the police, too, were responsible for the fragile law and order situation in Jharkhand.        
	He directed police superintendents to reinvestigate all cases where innocent villagers had been falsely implicated. He said the polices intelligence failure was exposed by the kidnapping of the Dalbhumgarh BDO who was released yesterday after the chief minister agreed to their demand of reopening cases against 14 undertrials who were lodged in Ghatshila sub-divisional jail.        
	Today, two of the 14, father daughter duo of Bahadur Mardi Jasmi, were granted bail by the court of additional district judge Madan Mohan Singh in the presence of Ghatshila sub-divisional officer Sunil Kumar.        
	Soren dubbed the BDOs release as a diplomatic success and not a strategic victory.         
	You must see that funds meant for gathering information reach police stations. You are not getting correct information on time because the resources provided by the government are not being utilised properly, he said.        
	He said every individual visiting a police station ought to be given a patient hearing and his/her complaint registered. Police stations ought to cultivate five to 10 persons in every village or locality who will keep them informed, he added.        
	We should learn some lessons on the BDOs kidnap and ensure such events arent repeated. Some officers did a commendable job, but bigger loopholes in the police machinery, too, have come to the fore, the chief minister said.        
	In his letter to three chief ministers, Chidambaram said,  it is also necessary to be assured that the state governments (Jharkhand, Bihar and Bengal) and the Central government are on the same page before commencing inter-state operations of the Jharkhand-Bihar and Jharkhand-Bengal borders.

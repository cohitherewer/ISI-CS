  - Invite opens up Mamatas chance to expand          ANINDYA SENGUPTA AND AVIJIT SINHA                                    
	Calcutta, Sept. 28: The Adivasi and Rajbangshi outfits of the Dooars and Terai and Cooch Behar district today said they would request Mamata Banerjee to visit the regions, the invitation opening up the Trinamul Congress scope to expand its base in north Bengal where the Left Front has been losing ground since last years Lok Sabha polls.         
	The Adivasi and Rajbangshi pleas also mean the Congress, which in other circumstances could have cashed in on the erosion of the Left support base, will have to yield space to Mamata.        
	We want her to visit the Terai and the Dooars, meet our organisations and get a feel of our problems so that she can make some announcements that could benefit us, said John Barla, the president of the Dooars Terai regional unit of the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, the dominant tribal outfit of the region.                                             
	Like the Adivasis in the Dooars and the Terai, Rajbangshi leaders, too, want the railway minister to visit Cooch Behar.        
	The ministers visit to Darjeeling and subsequent announcements have made us feel positive about her. We sincerely believe that her visit to the Rajbangshi belts of north Bengal will help improve the peoples condition, said Asutosh Burma, secretary of the Greater Cooch Behar Democratic Party.         
	For Trinamul, this is a chance to make inroads in the region. Unlike in the hills where the party can at best ride piggy back on the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, in the plains Trinamul can count on the support of the tribals to set up its own base.        
	The 2009 parliamentary polls revealed that the Lefts vote share had gone down significantly, compared to 2004, in the tribal-Nepali dominated Dooars and Terai and in Rajbangshi-concentrated Cooch Behar.        
	The CPMs vote share in the Darjeeling parliamentary seat dropped from 33 per cent in 2004 to 25 per cent in 2009. Party sources said since then a sizeable chunk of tribals, Nepalis and Rajbangshis in Terais Phansidewa and Matigara-Naxalbari Assembly segments had begun moving away towards Trinamul.        
	In Cooch Behar, the Lefts vote share plummeted by seven per cent in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls as Trinamul put up a stiff fight.         
	Adivasi leader Barla said one of the reasons for the tribals moving away from the Left was that despite several representations, the state government had done little to improve the infrastructure in the region. Besides, tea workers who have been living in the gardens for generations have not been given land rights.         
	A CPM minister of north Bengal said: The tribals and the Nepalis constitute nearly 80 per cent of the population of the Dooars and Terai and that is a cause for worry for the Left. Trinamul is likely to get good support from them.        
	What has also raised eyebrows in the CPM is the unofficial understanding Trinamul had with the Morcha in the Assembly bypolls in November last year for the Kalchini and Rajganj seats which the Left lost.        
	Trinamul stood by the Morcha-supported independent candidate in Kalchini, which they won. The Morcha reciprocated by supporting Trinamul in Rajganj Assembly seat that has a big Nepali and Rajbangshi electorate. Trinamul won this seat. If this continues to happen in the Dooars and Terai, it will be difficult for the Left in 2011, a senior RSP leader said.

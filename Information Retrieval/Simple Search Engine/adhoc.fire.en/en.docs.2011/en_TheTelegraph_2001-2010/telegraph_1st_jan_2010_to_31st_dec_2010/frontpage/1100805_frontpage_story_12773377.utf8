                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                HC hands over Koda probe to CBI

	Ranchi, Aug. 4: Jharkhand High Court today directed CBI to take over the ongoing probe into disproportionate assets of Madhu Koda and seven of his former cabinet colleagues, almost two years after a PIL was filed seeking the intervention of the central agency.        
	A division bench of acting Chief Justice Sushil Harkauli and Justice D.N. Patel heard the matter at length for the entire day and passed the order that effectively puts the former chief minister, now Singhbhum MP, in a tight corner for his alleged involvement in a multi-crore scam.        
	The high court has been monitoring ongoing investigations carried out by state vigilance bureau, income tax department and Enforcement Directorate, while the government of former chief minister Shibu Soren maintained all along that a CBI probe wasnt required as the state vigilance bureau was competent enough to take the case to its logical conclusion.        
	Although todays order meant the vigilance bureau would hand over the case to the CBI, it was unclear whether the central agency had been asked to take over the ED probe too.         
	We can comment only after a copy of the detailed order is available to us, said a senior CBI officer, adding that the ITs job was to assess tax due on the unaccounted wealth and it had nothing to do with the source of funds.        
	 While the IT department has so far traced unaccounted assets worth Rs 1,500 crore owned by Koda and his associates, ED investigations were still in progress.         
	The vigilance bureau has already filed a primary chargesheet.        
	Today, too, senior advocate Venkat Ramni, appearing on behalf of Koda and other former ministers, argued against the need for a CBI inquiry. He said since investigations were on in full swing, handing over the matter to the CBI would only delay matters.         
	 Arguing on behalf of former ministers Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Bandhu Tirkey and Dulal Bhuiya, former advocate-general S.B. Gadodia said, The trio have already submitted details before the IT which has assessed the matter. The IT department has raised a claim which is appeal-able and an appeal has already been preferred before the income tax appellate authority.         
	The bench, however, wasnt convinced with his arguments. It said the former ministers had not disclosed their assets and sources of income since filing nominations for the 2005 Assembly polls till date.        
	Details of assets, along with those belonging to their family, would have to be investigated into to decide whether the former ministers were guilty or not, the court said.        
	Koda, who was given permission to attend the monsoon session of Parliament, was arrested by the vigilance bureau on November 30 last year and lodged at the Birsa Munda Central Jail along with former minister Kamlesh Singh.         
	Two of his former cabinet colleagues, Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai, have also been charged by the vigilance bureau and lodged at the same jail since August 17 last year.        
	Chargesheets filed by the vigilance bureau accuse both Koda and Singh of owning disproportionate assets to the tune of Rs 1.50 crore each.         
	The former chief minister and three ministers have been charged under various sections of IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act.        
	On the other hand, vigilance bureau chargesheets filed on October 5 last year before the vigilance court indicated that Ekka had amassed unaccounted assets worth Rs 6.67 crore though his total earnings grossed a paltry Rs.15 lakh during the four and half years he was minister.        
	It pegged Rais unaccounted assets at Rs 1.63 crore.        
	Today, the high court handed over the probe to CBI almost two years after the PIL seeking such a transfer was filed by Durga Oraon in September 2008.         
	It also asked him to appear in person on August 16, the next date of hearing.        
	The bench had directed Oraon to appear physically and swear an affidavit to disclose his identity with documentary proof. However, neither he nor his counsel, Ritu Kumar, came.         
	The court was told that Kumar was undergoing medical treatment and that Oraon could not be contacted.

	New Delhi, July 16: The UN has informed India that it will have to bear the cost of withdrawing its air force contingent and helicopters from Africa for counter-Naxalite duties if it wants to pull out immediately, a senior officer told The Telegraph.        
	This is likely to delay the withdrawal of the Indian Air Force with its helicopters from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan up to the middle of next year, unless the government decides that the demands of internal security are so pressing that it can risk its commitment to the UN and foot the cost of the pullout that will run into millions of dollars.        
	India deploys its military for UN duties not only to enhance its international prestige  and buttress its claim for a permanent seat in the Security Council  but also so that its soldiers may earn handsome amounts in dollars for short-term duties that could take them years to earn in the country.        
	A pullout immediately will mean not only not getting paid by the UN  whose dues to India run into millions of dollars  but also losing precious foreign exchange.        
	India committed its air force contingent, which includes the air force special forces called the Garud, and 25 helicopters because no other country was ready to meet the force requirement projected by the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations (UNDPKO) for its mandates in Congo and Sudan.        
	But after Naxalite-hit states mounted pressure on the Centre to deploy greater numbers of helicopters for troop transportation, surveillance and casualty evacuation and the Union home ministry asked the defence establishment for assistance, the IAF sought permission to withdraw its helicopters.        
	The UNDPKO has informed India that in its Letters of Assist for the missions in Congo and Sudan, India had committed the Mi-17 multi-utility helicopters and the Mi-35 gunships for specific periods up to the middle of 2011.         
	The IAF contingent with its assets were transported to the operational areas in Africa at UN cost. But if the IAF has to pull out now, it will have to pay the cost of the pullout and cannot ask for UN subsidies.        
	Flagging off another contingent that is replacing the troops in Congo on Thursday, the deputy chief of air staff, Air Marshal N.V. Tyagi, said the withdrawal from Congo and Sudan would be a progressive phaseout.         
	He said the helicopters pulled out of Congo would not necessarily be deployed for counter-Naxalite operations but may be used for the other responsibilities of the air force  like air maintenance of forward posts in high altitude on the borders  but that would allow for other hardware to be redeployed.Our main tasks have been air maintenance and general tasks. The Maoist problem is recent in origin and whatever the requirements are would be met from the assets available, Tyagi said.He added that 17 MI-17s and 8 MI-35 helicopters would be withdrawn by mid-2011. The first contingent to be withdrawn would bring back with them five MI-17 and four MI-35 helicopters.        
	The Indian Air Forces role in Congo has changed since this month. Our contingents basic purpose was peace keeping but from first July it has changed to stabilisation operations. Their primary role is to provide mobility to the (UN) forces and to take actions against those trying to destabilise peace, Tyagi said.        
	The contingent that was flagged off on Thursday is the fifth rotation of IAF personnel to the DRC. The contingent of 285 personnel is led by Group Captain Pradip Waman Ambekar. It will be posted along Congos borders with Rwanda and Uganda operating out of Kivu and Ituri.

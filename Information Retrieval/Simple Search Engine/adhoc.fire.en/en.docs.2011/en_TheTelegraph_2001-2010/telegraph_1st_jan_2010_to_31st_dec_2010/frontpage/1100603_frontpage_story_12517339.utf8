          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, June 2: Suspected Peoples Liberation Front of India (PLFI) members today gunned down the principal of a school in Hardag, about 5km from the police headquarters, in the Dhurwa area.         
	Walls Plus Two School principal Stenis Kindo (35) was taking a class in the school, which has 400 students, when he was called away and shot.        
	Confirming the incident, city police superintendent Sambhu Thakur said the assailants came on a motorbike. While one of them kept watch near the bike, the other two entered the school campus.         
	The two called out Kindo from the classroom and took him to his chamber to talk. After talking for about 10 minutes, Kindo stepped out of the room with one of the men.         
	The other man, who was sitting inside, took out a 9mm pistol and pumped two bullets into Kindos head.         
	As the principal collapsed on the ground, his killer smashed a stone on his head to ensure that he did not survive.         
	An FIR was registered in this connection at the Tupudana outpost.         
	Primary investigations suggested that Kindo had some connection with PLFI, Thakur said.         
	According to the police, Kindos involvement was suspected in the murder of local resident Sanjay Singh in January this year.         
	Two persons were arrested in connection with the murder and both said they had acted on Kindos orders.         
	Another police officer said Kindo also had enmity with one Lilariys Toppo, with whom he set up the school. The principal took the help of PLFI members to threaten Toppo, who established another school at Chand village, the officer said.         
	Local residents also supported the police claims and said Kindo was close to PLFI area commander Mantu Soa and Pankaj Munda.        
	Kindos wife Kamta refused to comment. The victim has two sons Stage (5) and Spell (3). Sources at Khunti said PLFI commander Sao had claimed responsibility for the killing.

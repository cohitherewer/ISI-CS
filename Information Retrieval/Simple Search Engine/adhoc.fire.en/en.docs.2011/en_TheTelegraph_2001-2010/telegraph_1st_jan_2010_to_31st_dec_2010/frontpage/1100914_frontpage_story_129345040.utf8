	Kolkata, Sep 14 (PTI): AICC General Secretary Rahul Gandhi arrived here this morning on a three-day visit to West Bengal in order to rejuvenate the state Congress ahead of next year's assembly elections.  
	First stop Visva-Bharati University 	Santiniketan   
	Rahul Gandhi today visited for the first time Visva-Bharati University, where three generations of his family had been chancellors.  
	Gandhi arrived here by car to interact with students of the University, after covering some distance in a helicopter. He met around 1,000 students at the Rabindra Bhavan and discussed several issues with them for over an hour.   
	He also inaugurated an exhibition 'Three Chancellors' based on the tenures of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi as chancellors of the central university.   The exhibition, organised by the University, consists of photographs and correspondence of the three late prime ministers who visited Santiniketan as the University's chancellors.  
	Gandhi, clad in white kurta-pyjamas and sporting a stubble, was greeted by students of Pathabhavan school. He shook hands with a few of them at the gate of Rabindra Bhavan after alighting from his car. 	The eighty-minute interaction with students from all 50 departments at Rabindra Bhavan was out of bounds for media.  
	After the interaction, he walked back to the gate where hundreds of people, some of whom had climbed trees to be able to see the leader, hailed his presence by calling out his name and shouting slogans of 'Vande Mataram'.   
	Further moves  
	From Visva Bharati, he will go to Basirhat in North 24 Parganas and Garden Reach in South 24 Parganas and interact with potential candidates of the Youth Congress. 	He will tour nine districts in the course of his three-day visit.  
	On the following day, he will visit Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Balurghat in West Dinajpur district. He will address three meetings at Howrah, Bardhaman and Garhbeta in West Medinipur district and hold press conference at Kolkata on the last day of his visit on September 16.   
	This is his second visit to the state within a fortnight. Gandhi had addressed a rally here on September 6 in which he slammed the CPI(M).

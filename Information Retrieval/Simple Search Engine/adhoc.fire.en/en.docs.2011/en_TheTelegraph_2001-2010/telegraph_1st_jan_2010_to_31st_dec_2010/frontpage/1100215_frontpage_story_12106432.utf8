	Jamshedpur, Feb. 14: One of the earliest challenges HM faced upon taking over as MD of Tata Steel had nothing to do with the industry. It required a different kind of steely resolve to stay calm and tide over an unprecedented crisis facing what was till then an orderly Jamshedpur: a spate of random shootings that left one doctor and two businessmen killed, and several others injured.        
	Old timers recall HM as someone with exceptional man management skills. True to his natural instinct, his first action was to back the police and the local administration, even though they were at the receiving end of public ire. That paid off. Within a month of the first attack on December 3, 2009, the police cracked the case and arrested the gang behind the serial shootings.        
	Thats Hemant M. Nerurkar for you. At the helm of the worlds fifth largest steel maker, now a resident of Jamshedpur, the steel city where the sun shines bright all day and the evenings are about rummy at Beldih Club.        
	They (police) werent getting enough support from the state as the new ministry was yet to be sworn in. It was a transitional period. Our first action was to give our whole-hearted support to the administration. We realised there was no point in demoralising them, Nerurkar told The Telegraph over tea on a February afternoon at a plush meeting room at his office here.        
	And if that was the public face, the Tatas had already initiated back channel efforts to ensure that the steel citys crisis reached Delhi. The result: Jamshedpurs police administration was immediately upgraded with a senior SSP to be in charge of two SPs  one for rural (read Maoist infested) and the other for urban areas.        
	Understated and typically Tatas, Nerurkar gets work done. And Jamshedpur is on for a full-scale rejuvenation in terms of infrastructure, now that the economic downturn is behind us.         
	We have done investments in the plant. To that extent investment in the town and in the convenience of people havent happened, he admitted, while underlining key projects that are set to take off during his tenure.        
	First, the modernisation of the airport so flight services can resume. To begin with the runway at Sonari will be extended on a war footing so that ATR services can start. So serious is Nerurkar, that he is even willing to realign the golf course to make way for a runway extension.                                               
	Yes, the issue is about our runway length. We are very serious about sorting this out. We may even have to modify the golf course to gain some land and extend the runway. Also, theres a cricket ground which may have to be shifted.        
	Of the many projects that citizens have long heard about but seen no on-ground action, the City Centre project  a multi-functional utilities-cum entertainment complex with markets and restaurants  has been revived.         
	Two years ago, when we were about to begin, the global meltdown happened. Then there was no point in going ahead. Now, that things are looking up, we are looking at the plan again. Thats something we have promised to the city of Jamshedpur, he revealed.         
	Various long-term projects are also in the horizon. Among them, two ring roads and a couple of flyovers to decongest the city are distinct possibilities. The other far reaching idea is to invite mega developers like DLF or Unitech or Tata Housing to work on creating additional townships on both sides of river Kharkai to ease the pressure on the town boasting adequate water and power supply both managed by Tata sister concerns.         
	Now that the concept of townships has gained ground across the country, we need to talk to a few people to build such townships nearby. It doesnt have to be within the leasehold area. And as we are able to build such townships that are comparable and fully supportable with adequate water and power, I think the pressure on Jamshedpur will ease. This is a plan. Now we need to devise funding.        
	But if theres one thing thats unlikely to happen anytime soon, its the use of Keenan Stadium for Tests, ODIs and first-class cricket matches. Nerurkar is clear that unless the courts rule on the longstanding dispute over who gets to run cricket in Jharkhand (Jharkhand State Cricket Association or Cricket Association of Jharkhand), they wouldnt start work on upgrading the 25,000-seater.         
	The issue is between the cricket associations and the boards. We felt that the way the Jharkhand State Cricket Association was formed, and elections held were not correct. So we said we would not be a party to this. The stadium infrastructure does need a lot of investment. And unless the association problem is sorted out, why should I?        
	Thats Nerurkar for all cricket fans, cut and dry. Though hed love to dwell on the Jamshedpur of the 70s when cycling to the plant was the norm for those who had started off like him, and to think of a car before six to seven years on the job wasnt.         
	Also, there werent too many attractions after the job. The same people would spend time together after work. As a result, far more mentoring would take place, he recalled.         
	Does he miss those days? Nope. HM is a man of the moment.

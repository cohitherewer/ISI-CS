  - Rental offers for flats at Games housing complex        AMIT GUPTA                                                     
	Ranchi, July 27: Want an apartment in state capital Ranchi? May be, nows the time.        
	The private firm that burnt its fingers by constructing the National Games Housing Complex of 1,796 apartments is now offering a deal of a lifetime for prospective buyers  monthly rentals of up to Rs 12,000 till such time they get possession of the flats that can only happen after the Games, now tentatively scheduled for December.        
	The 34th National Games, originally scheduled for November 2007, has been postponed as many as five times, given the political instability that has continued to rock Jharkhand in the last three years.         
	This also meant there were very few takers for the flats ever since bookings opened in 2007  something both the state and Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Constructions Company hadnt factored in when the deal to build the complex was struck in 2005-06.        
	On offer are two, three BHK (bedroom, hall, kitchen) apartments and duplexes (penthouses or row houses) with prices ranging between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 45 lakh depending on the super built-up area.         
	This is a guaranteed rent scheme. We are offering the rental scheme ranging between Rs 8,500 and Rs 12,000 to new buyers for a limited time. We hope to get a good response, said Keerthi Kumar, the assistant general manager of NCC that has spent upwards of Rs 250 crore on the project.        
	The idea, he said, was to push sales. The rental, the company hoped, would act as an incentive for prospective buyers since one would get possession of the flats only after the Games were over  it has been scheduled for December 9 to 22 after the October Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.        
	The Games Housing Complex was developed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model in 2005-06.         
	The state government did not spend anything. In return, it gave over 50-acre land to NCC under a flat-sharing agreement of 12:88.         
	This meant, that out of a total 1,796 flats that were to be built, the government would get 220, while NCC would be free to sell the rest.         
	As of now, we have 976 (of the 1,196 ready) flats under our possession. We have managed to sell around 750 units. Another 200-odd flats are left to be sold, said Jain.         
	As many as 600 more flats are being built under phase II to make the Games complex one of the largest housing projects in Jharkhand with promised amenities like 80 per cent open/green landscaped area, world class club house, swimming pool with a toddlers pool, health club and gymnasium, meditation and yoga hall, in addition to a multi-purpose hall.         
	There are, however, legal issues. Adivasi Unnati Samaj, an organisation of tribal land donors of the area, has filed a PIL in Jharkhand High Court against the 12:88 flat sharing agreement of the state and NCC, citing inadequate compensation.        
	Based on that, the high court has directed the state to cite similar agreements entered into in other states. But the state is yet to reply.

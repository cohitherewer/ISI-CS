	Washington, May 14 (PTI): President Barack Obama has said the growing tendency in India and China to buy more cars will put more pressure on fossil fuels.        
	At a rally in Buffalo, New York, he argued in favour of the public transportation system instead of depending on cars.         
	He said that the mass transit system would be good for the environment.         
	In the long-term, Obama said, with countries like China and India starting to buy cars, the demand on petroleum and fossil fuels will be greater.        
	Because one of the things, obviously, that we have to recognise is, that no matter what we do, oil prices are going to be going up over the long term, he said.         
	Youre not always clear whats going on, but the long-term trend is just because countries like China  theyre starting to buy cars and countries like India are starting to buy cars, and so the demand on petroleum and fossil fuels are going to be greater and greater  weve got to get a first-class transit system, Obama said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lodha smiles and says No
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Lodha smiles and says No
  - Realtor tracks Stephen Courts twists and turns           SAMBIT SAHA                                                    
	Calcutta, March 25: Parasmal Lodha, the self-exiled real estate king known to have built the now-gutted fifth and sixth floors on Stephen Court, said today he had nothing to do with the construction.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph in the ornate living room of his Queens Park residence this evening, the man once called extra-floors Lodha or Fiddler on the Roof, however, admitted knowing Sanjay Bagaria, who is commonly being referred to as the owner of Stephen Court but, according to Lodha, was the leaseholder.         
	I have nothing to do with the development. You will not find my name anywhere. The fact that I am here in Calcutta at my home is clear testimony to that fact. I have nothing to hide, nothing to fear, Lodha said.         
	The developer, who has shifted base to Delhi, said he knew Sanjay, the owner of Stephen Court Ltd now being hunted by police investigating the fire, as they are from the same village, Sujangarh, in Churu district of Rajasthan. His family was our next-door neighbour.         
	He revealed that Stephen Court was owned by a trust of the original owners, Arathoon Stephen, which is managed by the Bengal government. The trust leased the property to Bagarias Stephen Court Ltd for 99 years.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had sanctioned the plan to add three floors on the Park Street property that at the time had five floors. The plan was subsequently renewed in 1984.        
	Asked if he had any role in getting the CMC sanction, he smiled and said no.        
	Didnt he have a way of getting things done, a euphemism for bribery-induced decisions, at the civic body? That may be the popular perception but that is not the case, Lodha said.        
	According to him, Stephen Court Ltd sub-leased the right to construct additional floors to Sujon Viniyoge Ltd, a company owned and operated by Babu Lal Bagaria and his son Tarun, no relations of Sanjay.        
	Babu Lal built two floors  the 5th and the 6th  but Sanjay did not allow the 7th to come up apparently on the ground of lack of infrastructure.        
	During the construction, the tenants association of Stephen Court dragged the CMC as well as Sanjay to court but Lodha claimed even the Supreme Court had upheld the addition.        
	Eventually, Stephen Court Ltd could not manage the property and leased out the flats and showrooms to their then existing occupiers.        
	If Lodhas version is correct, something that The Telegraph has not been able to confirm, Sanjay would appear to have no responsibility in the upkeep of Stephen Court.                          
	Why is he absconding then? Lodha had no reply but said: He is being crucified.         
	Although Lodha insisted he had no role in the construction at Stephen Court, he admitted having added floors on many other properties, including Nicco House, Tobacco House and Bagri Market. I must have added 15-16 lakh square feet then.         
	He shifted base to Delhi as the property market there was more lucrative. Lodha, who burst into corporate limelight with a daring takeover attempt on Peerless, claimed to still hold 31 per cent in the finance company.

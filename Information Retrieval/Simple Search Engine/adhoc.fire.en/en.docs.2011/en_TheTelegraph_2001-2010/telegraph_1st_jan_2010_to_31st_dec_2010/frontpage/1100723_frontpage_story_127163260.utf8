	New Delhi, July 23 (PTI): India and the US today signed a Counter Terrorism Initiative that includes steps to check financing of terror activities, joint probe in cases of bomb blasts besides cooperation in cyber and border security.  
	 "Today, with the formal signing of the initiative, we take several significant steps forward against terrorism," US ambassador to India Timothy J Roemer, who signed the agreement along with Home Secretary G K Pillai, told reporters here.  
	Terming the pact as symbolic of the "indispensable partnership" against terrorism, Roemer said both the countries will work closely in matters like intelligence sharing and probe into bomb blasts.  
	"In the coming days and months there will be even closer information sharing and collaborative efforts on issues ranging from bomb blast probe and major event security to mega-city policing, cyber and border security," he said.

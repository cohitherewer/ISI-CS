The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maker of footballs becomes referee of match
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Maker of footballs becomes referee of match
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Zinab                                  
	New Delhi, June 13: She spent years making footballs as a child labourer. On Saturday, 13-year-old Zinab learnt what it felt like to be part of the game.        
	The teenager from Meerut didnt play a match. She did something more important: she refereed one.        
	The young referee, armed with a whistle and the stern look typical of sports monitors, was trying to rein in the 22 players who looked almost her age. The teams facing off were unusual too: End Child Labour versus Education for All.        
	Zinab appeared to be savouring every moment. It was always a dream for us, those who stitched footballs, to play with one someday, she smiled. A little less than three years ago, she worked 8-10 hours a day in a Meerut factory stitching footballs, some of which reached playgrounds in Delhi and beyond.        
	The match, coinciding with the second day of the Fifa World Cup in South Africa, had been organised on the patchy grounds of a shelter for children rescued as labourers from across the country. The match Zinab was supervising was part of an International Labour Organisations (ILO) campaign against child labour.        
	The campaign, titled Go for the goal  end child labour, kicked off on Friday, the day the World Cup began.        
	Whenever the ball swerved, spun past players and landed in the net, the crowd screamed goal. The teams, dressed in colourful tees and bermudas, backslapped and hugged each other for what seemed like a lifetime. But there was something that seemed to rise above all the din: the sound of Zinabs piercing whistle.        
	Sharing Zinabs feelings was Kailash Satyarthi, president of the Global Campaign for Education, which spearheaded the ILOs campaign in more than a hundred countries.        
	This soccer match was arranged to ensure that such children also become one with the other children of the world who are closely following the World Cup. Every child has a right to play, get an education, freedom and a right to childhood but these rights have been robbed by political, social and economic interests. This is terrible. More than 215 million children are engaged as child labourers today. That is the biggest scandal of our time, Satyarthi said.        
	The match, like international games, saw its share of penalty strikes and rough edges as the children, most of them aged between 12 and 16, jostled for the ball.         
	It was good fun. All the players listened to me and followed the rules. When I blew the whistle, that was enough to make them stop and listen. No one here is playing for any money, so when there is no money involved, there is no fighting among the players, laughed Zinab, the only girl in her village in Meeruts Chandora who has reached high school.        
	Zinab will soon travel to her village, taking with her tales of the match. This match meant a lot to us. It stood for freedom, joy and life, she said        
	Back home, the teenager is also part of a bal panchayat, a national body that deals with childrens issues such as labour and early marriage. Her transformation into a child activist has ensured separate toilets for girls in her school and, as a result, drawn more girls to classrooms.

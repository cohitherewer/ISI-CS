	Ranchi, Oct. 6: The state vigilance bureau today lodged FIRs against National Games Organising Committee (NGOC) working chairman R.K. Anand, organising secretary S.M. Hashmi, treasurer Madhukant Pathak and P.C. Mishra, the then director of sports, among others, for corruption, misuse of official position and embezzlement of public funds in the run-up to the 34th National Games that has been plagued by delays.        
	The FIRs were lodged immediately after the state law department gave the go-ahead to the bureau today to probe the charges levelled by the secretary of the State Wrestling Association, Bhola Nath Singh.        
	The fate of the 34th National Games, originally scheduled for November 15, 2007, is now uncertain. Over the last three years, the Games had been postponed six times  the latest dates, December 3 to 22, were nixed by the state in view of the panchayat polls likely to be held between November 16 and December 31.        
	FIRs have been lodged today with the vigilance thana against several NGOC officials on the instructions of the state government, IG Vigilance M.V. Rao said.         
	On September 27, Bhola Nath had filed a complaint with IG (vigilance) alleging purchase of sports equipment without floating tenders, purchase of equipment much in excess of actual requirement and at prices higher than market prices, and several other financial irregularities.        
	Bhola Nath had moved Jharkhand High Court against the NGOC office-bearers alleging corrupt practices. On September 9, the court disposed of his petition observing that he could file an FIR with the vigilance if he had sufficient proof.        
	His complaint was then forwarded to the state law department which gave its opinion today.        
	In his complaint, Bhola Nath made several specific allegations:         
	 No tenders were invited for the Rs 11 crore spent on putting up high mast lights at Birsa Munda astro turf stadium at Morabadi and another Rs 1 crore spent on furnishing a VVIP guest house and lounge        
	 200 dozen tennis balls had been bought for not more than 100 tennis players (in Wimbledon, 30 dozen tennis balls are purchased annually for 125 set matches played by 128 players)        
	 Electronic score boards were bought from a single supplier at Rs 4.50 lakh for handball, kabaddi and kho kho, at Rs 6.50 lakh for taekwondo and at Rs 8.50 lakh for judo        
	 Then sports director P.C. Mishra withdrew Rs 179.15 lakh for personal use, while lakhs of rupees were drawn as advance in the name of one S. Tirkey, a contract worker at NGOC office

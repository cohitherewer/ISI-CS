          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              
	Jaipur, March 6: Let your wives work, the Rajasthan government has told husbands who are running the show for their spouses who hold key panchayat posts in the state.        
	The government has taken note of several cases where husbands, dubbed sarpanch patis or pradhan patis depending on the post, had taken over the responsibilities of their wives, rendering the women mere puppets.        
	The order coincides with a fresh initiative to get the womens reservation bill passed in Parliament for setting aside 33 per cent of seats in legislatures.        
	In the order, the Rajasthan government has asked women representatives not to delegate their job to family members under any circumstances. If they do, they will be liable to face action under the Panchayati Raj Act.        
	Principal secretary C.S. Rajan said: We received a missive from the Union ministry of panchayati raj that men, especially husbands, should not interfere in the daily activities and financial matters of panchayats, which has been the case in several instances. Although Maharashtra was the first state to implement this directive, Rajasthan is bringing in this order to empower women and help them work independently.        
	Social activists working with panchayats said the government should first plan intensive training and innovative methods of developing skills and leadership qualities for the women.        
	Rupa Mangliani, a college lecturer associated with research on women sarpanches, said: The ground reality is entirely different. There is bound to be a gap between the order and actual implementation. A new government order or rule is not enough to root out the malaise of males, especially husbands, putting forward the women sarpanches as showpieces and actually carrying out their activities.        
	Winning a sarpanch election has become a family legacy. Men do not want the power to go out of their families, so wherever seats were reserved for women, men put up their wives or daughters, so that the power structure remains within the family. After NREGA (the rural employment guarantee scheme), which is a big money-spinner, at least Rs 8 lakh is given to each samiti. Nobody wants to let go of that kind of money, Mangliani said.        
	The recent panchayat elections held under the new order of 50 per cent reservation for women has thrown up the highest number of women sarpanches in the state, which boasts of pioneering the panchayati raj movement in India from 1959.        
	Rajasthan High Court had yesterday cancelled the 50 per cent quota for women in civic and local bodies, but clarified that those already elected would not be affected.        
	Several women who become sarpanches are forced to depend on others also because of lack of education  a malaise that reflects the gender bias in the country.        
	A sarpanch has to maintain at least 21 registers, look after 35 schemes and prepare the below poverty line list tasks not easy for those with little formal education.        
	Belts in western and central Rajasthan see more men acting for their wives, Mangliani said.         
	Not all women sarpanches are spoon-fed. Some work and think independently. Tribal women sarpanch in Udaipur and Dungarpur belt are more enlightened and aware of their duties and work independently, Mangliani said.        
	Kaushalya Devi of Nimoria panchayat in Jaipur district recently stumped chief minister Ashok Gehlot by asking him why the two-child norm applied only to panchayat polls and did not extend to the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.

	July 3: Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, invited six lapdancers to entertain him in his hotel during an official visit to Brazil, according to reports.        
	The 73-year-old Italian leader reportedly watched a private exhibition of lap and pole dancing on Monday during a trip which included meetings with Brazilian businessmen and the countrys President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.        
	The women were reportedly paid around 900 and promised jobs as showgirls and starlets on Italian television channels owned by Berlusconi.        
	The Prime Ministers office admitted that he had been entertained by a group of performers, but classified the show as a typically Brazilian folklore spectacle.        
	But one of the dancers, Alexandra Valenca, 28, said her performance in front of the billionaire Prime Minister included an erotic lap dance. She said she and the other women were invited to attend a dinner in the presidential suite of the Hotel Tivoli S Paulo Mofarrej with Berlusconi on Monday, the second day of his two-day trip.        
	During the dinner they presented to me a plan for a programme on one of the channels that Berlusconi owns in Italy. I was told that he wanted some beautiful Brazilian girls, Valenca told LEstadao, a Brazilian newspaper.        
	Valenca, whose website promotes her as a pole dancing pioneer in Brazil and shows numerous photos of her performing in a bikini, said she danced for about 12 minutes and then left the dinner.        
	But the party with the other women continued, she said, with dining tables loaded with bottles of wine, sparkling Spumante and plates of Italian cheese, ham and salami.        
	Berlusconis aides denied that the women were lap dancers or pole dancers and accused them of seeking publicity. In a statement, his office in Rome said: On Monday June 28, the Prime Minister, accompanied by members of his staff and numerous security agents, participated, at the invitation of a businessman, in one of the receptions held on the occasion of his visit to Brazil.

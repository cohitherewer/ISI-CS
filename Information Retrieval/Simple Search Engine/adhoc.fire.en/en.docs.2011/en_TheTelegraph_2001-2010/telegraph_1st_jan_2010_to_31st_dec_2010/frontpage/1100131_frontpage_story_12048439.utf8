The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Fresh doubts over fate of National Games
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Fresh doubts over fate of National Games

	Ranchi, Jan. 30: The sudden postponement of a scheduled Indian Olympic Association (IOA) meeting on February 4 has once again cast doubts on chances of the 34th National Games being held in the state anytime in the near future.        
	The Games have already been postponed five times. The National Games Organising Committee (NGOC) was all set to host the Games from November 21 to December 5, 2009, when the event was postponed for the Assembly elections amid security concerns.        
	What is worrying NGOC is that the IOA has not communicated fresh dates for the postponed executive council meeting to the Jharkhand Olympic Association (JOA).        
	Earlier, both chief minister Shibu Soren and NGOC officials had hinted that the Games would be held in the last week of April. However, but with the IOA meeting postponed and no intimation about a likely date of the event, time now is running out for the organisers. Every state association has to be given two months to prepare for the National Games, as provided in the IOA constitution, the NGOC organising secretary S.M. Hashmi said today.        
	He added that the ball was now in the IOAs court. We said we were prepared for the Games. Once they announce the dates we will start work again immediately, he said.        
	Hashmi, however, refused to say why and how the chief minister had mentioned April 24 as the likely date when the National Games would be held. As chief minister, Soren is the chairman of NGOC, but he is yet to chair a meeting of the body after assuming office.         
	Preparations for the Games include arranging transport, catering, housekeeping and so on which will require at least a month as fresh contracts will have to be signed with the parties.         
	However, Hashmi said it would not be a problem as arrangements were all in place and only the announcement of dates was awaited.         
	Though the Games was not on the main agenda, this matter is pending with the IOA president since December 7, 2009, when the last executive council meeting was held. At that meeting, IOA president Suresh Kalmadi was authorised to consult the Union ministry and other agencies and finalise the dates for the Games. Something about the Games would have emerged at this meeting, Hashmi said.         
	He also tried to contact IOA secretary general Randhir Singh to figure the reason behind the sudden postponement of the Games, but Singh could not be reached.

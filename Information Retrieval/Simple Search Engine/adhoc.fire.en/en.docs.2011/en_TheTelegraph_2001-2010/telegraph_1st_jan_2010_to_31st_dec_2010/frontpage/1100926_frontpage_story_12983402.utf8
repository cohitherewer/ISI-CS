          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia will head the three-judge bench that will on Tuesday hear the petition to put off the Ayodhya verdict, indicating the utmost priority the Supreme Court is giving the issue.        
	Justice Kapadia, whose core area of expertise is commercial and corporate law and income tax, will sit on the new bench with Justice Aftab Alam and Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan. These three judges make up the courts forest bench which, every Friday, hears cases relating to diversion of forests for non-forest use.        
	Earlier, the two-judge bench of Justice R.V. Raveendran and Justice H.L. Gokhale had imposed an interim stay on the Ayodhya verdict a day before its scheduled announcement by the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court on September 24. The decision came on a plea by Ramesh Chandra Tripathi, a defendant in the Ayodhya title (ownership) suit who feared the verdict would harm communal peace.        
	The two judges had, however, referred the matter to a larger bench in view of the differences between them on the issue.        
	Sources said that whenever there was a tie on a bench, the case usually went to a larger bench that did not include the judges who originally heard the case. But, they said, what was significant was that the Chief Justice would personally hear the case on September 28.        
	On that day, all the 24 parties to the Ayodhya title suit and the Centre, represented by the attorney-general, will appear before the apex court and give their views on whether the Ayodhya verdict should be postponed and mediation given another chance.        
	Ironically, the continued existence of the forest bench has been a matter of dismay for the Centre, which believes that forests are the domain of the executive.         
	The government had even filed an application asking the court to wind up the bench.        
	But the Chief Justice had ignored it and constituted a second forest bench that sits on Mondays, though it only implements the orders passed by the first bench.

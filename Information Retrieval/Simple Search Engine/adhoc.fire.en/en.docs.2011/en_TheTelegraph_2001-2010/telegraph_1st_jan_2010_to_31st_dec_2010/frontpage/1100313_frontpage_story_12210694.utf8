          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                                
	New Delhi, March 12: Delhi High Court today ordered the army and the air force to grant serving women and those who have retired in recent years permanent commission.        
	The order, which comes three days after the Rajya Sabha passed the womens reservation bill, was passed on a PIL by 60 women short-service commission officers  no lady officer from the navy had approached the court  who accused the government of discrimination compared to their male counterparts.         
	The decision came 18 years after women were first allowed into the army in 1992.        
	Women are taken only on short-service commission in the defence forces. In the army, they are allowed in medical services and in support arms such as the Corps of Signals. In the air force, they are inducted into all streams, except as fighter pilots.        
	Last year, the government revised the rules to give women the same tenure as men, but it applied only to new recruits, not to serving officers. Under the earlier policy, women had to retire after 14 years in service, irrespective of their record. This meant they werent eligible for pension and other financial benefits.        
	There were male officers performing the same task. If the male officers can be granted permanent commission while performing those tasks, there is no reason why equally capable women officers cannot be granted permanent commission. It is not a charity being sought but enforcement of constitutional rights (of equality), a bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said in its 32-page order.        
	To ensure that the ruling benefits those out of service, the court said all women officers who had retired while the case dating back to 2006  was going on should be reinstated, with all benefits, along with those now in the jobs.        
	The order delighted the crusaders. Its a historic day. This win isnt only for those women now in the forces but also for those who dream of a future there. Now they will have rights equal to that of men, said Rekha Pali, the lawyer for the 60 officers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Heads roll, big head stays
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Heads roll, big head stays
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Suresh Kalmadi                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Heads rolled today at the Commonwealth Games organising committee over corruption allegations but its head Suresh Kalmadi stayed firmly in place.        
	The committee executive board even suspended a member who had quit as the committees deputy director-general three months ago, claiming it had not then accepted Sanjay Mohindroos resignation.        
	The others suspended were joint director-general T.S. Darbari, a close Kalmadi aide, and a relatively junior functionary, accounts department officer M. Jayachandran, over the allegedly irregular hiring of UK firm AM Films for the Queens Baton relay in London last October.        
	Asked why Kalmadi had been spared, sports minister M.S. Gill indicated that removing him just 59 days before the event might not be wise. With the Games so near, you change horses and you may not even get a horse.        
	Pressed, Gill said he didnt want to say more because there are complications (chakkar). He, however, hinted that Kalmadis removal might not be easy because of clauses in the agreement signed with the Commonwealth Games Federation in 2003 to host the event.        
	Investigation of the London relay-related allegations would be handed over to the Enforcement Directorate, committee secretary-general Lalit Bhanot told a news conference that Kalmadi skipped. He said Kalmadi would face the media only if necessary.        
	Bhanot, however, avoided answering why the committee had not yet lodged an FIR on the doctoring of the email with which Kalmadi had tried to prove his innocence in the London controversy.        
	Committee treasurer Anil Khanna too resigned today after it emerged that Australian firm Rebound Ace, whose Indian branch has his son Aditya as CEO, had supplied surfaces for the Games tennis venue. Khanna, though, said he was not a committee office-bearer when the contract was awarded.        
	A.K. Mattoo has been appointed the new treasurer. Mattoo had resigned from the same post in January after differences with Kalmadi.        
	Asked why senior officials, including Kalmadi, should not own responsibility for the corruption allegations, Bhanot appeared to pass the buck to junior officials. There are 1,500 people working in the committee and its difficult to know what the person on the first floor (the top brass sit on the third floor) is doing. Senior management is not directly controlling all the staff. No individual has any financial authority; its done collectively by the board, he said.

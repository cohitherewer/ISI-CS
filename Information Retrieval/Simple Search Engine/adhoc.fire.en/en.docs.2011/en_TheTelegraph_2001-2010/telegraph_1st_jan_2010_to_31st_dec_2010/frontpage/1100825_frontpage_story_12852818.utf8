The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ore freeway plugged in Singhbhum
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ore freeway plugged in Singhbhum
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 24: A key checkpoint in West Singhbhum district that gained notoriety for facilitating illegal transportation of minerals worth crores has been abandoned by the state in yet another effort at plugging the lifeline of a well-entrenched racket that has been sapping Jharkhand of its natural resources.        
	The Gitilipi check post, 2km on the outskirts of the district headquarters of Chaibasa, has officially stopped functioning from August 22. Instead, another check post has started functioning from Kasim Bazar area, between Chaibasa and Jagannathpur, on the NH-75 (extension) stretch that is the nerve centre of iron ore transportation.        
	Raj Bhavan has already ordered a CBI inquiry into illegal export of iron ore from the West Singhbhum region based on an FIR of May 6 that alleged as many as five companies were using fake challans to take out iron ore from the Gitilipi check post.         
	The entire stocks were transported out by trucks, but since a single truck is not allowed to carry more than 17 tonnes, overloading was adjusted by using registration numbers of more vehicles, sometimes even motorcycles.         
	According to rough estimates, around 700 trucks used to cross Gitilipi check post daily.        
	The decision to shift the check post from Gitilipi to Kasim Bazar was taken with the aim to improve its functioning. Gitilipi check post was situated very close to Chaibasa town resulting in day-to-day traffic snarls and law and order problems, state mines secretary N.N. Sinha told The Telegraph over phone from Delhi.        
	Also, the weigh-bridge was situated some distance away creating added problems for state officials and transporters, he added in an effort to explain that the decision was a pure administrative move not linked to investigations into illegal export of ore from the state.        
	Sinha, in Delhi to attend a central geological programming board meeting scheduled for tomorrow, said the order to shut down Gitilipi check post wasnt linked to the CBI probe decision.        
	The home department brought out the notification to hold a CBI inquiry into the matter. Let the inquiry start and facts come to the fore. We are concentrating on preventing illegal export/transportation of iron ore, he said.         
	The commercial taxes department was already operating a check post at Kasim Bazar, 30km from Chaibasa. Now, the same facility will be used by officials of the mines, transport and forest departments.         
	The state administration will also use two forest department check posts situated in the adjoining Manoharpur region to keep tabs on illegal mining/transportation of iron ore from Saranda reserved forests.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Delhi splurge on Rajiv ads
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Delhi splurge on Rajiv ads
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Priyanka Vadra at an event to mark Rajiv Gandhis 66th birth anniversary in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Union ministries released more ads on Rajiv Gandhis birthday today than on the anniversaries of the rest of Indias Prime Ministers put together in the past one year, Press Information Bureau sources said.        
	In any case, most of the ads on the other Prime Ministers have related to either Rajivs mother Indira Gandhi or grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru, which is expected from a Congress-led government.        
	At a conservative estimate, the Centre spent Rs 5-10 crore on advertisements on Rajiv in leading dailies today, with the ministries outdoing one another to extol the late Prime Ministers contribution to the nation. Most leading English newspapers in Delhi had anywhere from 10 to 20 half-to-full-page colour ads         
	Expectedly, there were advertisements from the Congress. But ministries held by politicians from Maharashtra  such as power, petroleum, heavy industries and food processing  led the way.         
	Other ministries like IT, heavy industries, information and broadcasting, water resources, rural development, and women and child development brought out full-page ads. The exceptions were the big four  home, finance, defence and external affairs.        
	Wall-to-wall posters with Rajivs photograph were plastered on Delhis walls.        
	Rajivs legacy, though, is a matter of debate. Some historians, such as Ramachandra Guha, a columnist for The Telegraph, believe his contribution is overrated. Guha counts the Shah Bano case, Ayodhya shilanyas and Kashmir as three of Rajivs decisions for which India is suffering even today.        
	Another point of debate is whether Rajiv, as many believe, indeed sowed the seeds of economic liberalisation or whether that credit should go to P.V. Narasimha Rao who, as Guha puts it, has become the great unmentionable within Congress circles.        
	However, Guha said he did not see Rajiv Gandhis record in office as wholly flawed. He listed Rajivs achievements: achieving peace with the Mizos, encouraging technological innovation and promoting panchayati raj.        
	In the length of the period he served as Prime Minister and the number of times he unfurled the Tricolour at the Red Fort, though, Rajiv comes a modest fifth in a field of 14.        
	Nehru unfurled the national flag 17 times followed by Indira at 16. On Sunday, Manmohan Singh overtook Atal Bihari Vajpayees tally of six by doing the rites for the seventh time. Rajiv, along with Rao, hoisted the flag five times.

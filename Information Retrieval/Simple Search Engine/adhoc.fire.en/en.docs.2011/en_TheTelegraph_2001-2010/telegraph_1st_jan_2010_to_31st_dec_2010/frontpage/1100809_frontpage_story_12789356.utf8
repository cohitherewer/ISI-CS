          OUR BUREAU                                                          
	Aug. 8: Spy cameras and CCTV on trees and bamboo poles, snipers on rooftops, two rings of security  now the question is, will Mamata Banerjee agree to a bullet-proof car?        
	The state government has turned Lalgarh, where Mamata will hold her apolitical rally tomorrow, into a fortress. Now it is trying to persuade her to use a bullet-proof car when she travels to the venue tomorrow.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief has so far spurned the bullet-proof car the state police have provided her. Senior officers tried to convince her close aides this evening that since she might be passing through the dense Jhitka forests, it would be prudent to use the protected car.        
	A meeting of this scale would prompt Maoist squads from the adjoining states to try to enter in the guise of rallyists. So we dont want to take chances, said a senior officer as he oversaw a mine-detection drill in Jungle Mahal.        
	A close Mamata aide said tonight that the railway minister had left for Kolaghat in an ordinary car. Tomorrow morning, she will decide whether to use a bullet-proof car for the rest of the journey.        
	The joint forces have established domination over stretches of 20km along each of the three roads from Midnapore town to Lalgarh, passing through Pirakata or Dherua or Goaltore. Mamata is likely to take the route via Pirakata.        
	Some 2,500 security personnel have been deployed at the venue  a school ground  and the roads. An officer said a team of handpicked sharpshooters would be part of the inner ring around Mamata in Lalgarh, helping create a sterile zone and allowing in only those authorised to be on the dais. The second ring, within 400m of the venue, will be manned by CRPF men in battle fatigues.                    
	We will place spy cameras and closed-circuit TVs on trees and at various corners of the school building. Well also tie cameras and CCTVs to bamboo poles. At least 20 joint forces personnel will keep vigil from the schools roof with sniper rifles, a police officer said.        
	Police, in uniform or in plainclothes, will guard the routes armed with mine detectors and trace explosive detection devices that can spot any explosive inside luggage of any kind without opening it.        
	All vehicles are being stopped and searched in front of the four CRPF camps on the Pirakata-Lalgarh road  at Patharkumkumi, Changashol, Pirakata and Bhimpur  West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said.         
	Police sources said the Maoists were asking villagers to march to Lalgarh in large numbers and attend the rally.        
	The newly appointed secretary of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, Manoj Mahato, said: We will provide so many people that not only will the Lalgarh school ground be packed to capacity but a large number of people will be forced to remain outside. Tomorrow, the administration will realise how strong the Peoples Committee still is.        
	Following a meeting between Bengal police chief Bhupinder Singh and U.K. Bansal, the special secretary (internal security), in Delhi last week, it was decided that Mamata would be given the highest form of security cover during the rally.        
	She will be provided with two personal security officers and two escort cars. There will, however, be no surveillance from the air.        
	An officer said the Maoists might strike at the forces in areas from where some of the personnel have been shifted to Lalgarh for the rally.                    PRONAB MONDAL, NARESH JANA AND KINSUK BASU

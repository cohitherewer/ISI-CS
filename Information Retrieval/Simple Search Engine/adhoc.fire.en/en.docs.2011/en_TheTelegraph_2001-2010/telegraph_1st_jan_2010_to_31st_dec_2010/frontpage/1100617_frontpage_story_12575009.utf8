                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Jail meetings to firm up RS poll deals
          SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA                                               
	Ranchi, June 16: For all its talk on fighting corruption, the Congress today reached out to the states tainted MLAs and MPs, including former chief minister Madhu Koda in jail, to seek their votes for tomorrows Rajya Sabha elections.        
	Three candidates are in the fray for two Rajya Sabha seats that have been vacated. One by the Congresss Dheeraj Prasad Sahu for having completed his term and the other by Hemant Soren, who quit after being elected to the Assembly.        
	Jharkhand Congress in-charge K. Keshav Rao, along with leader of the Opposition Rajendra Prasad Singh and state party chief Pradeep Balmuchu, met MLA Hari Narayan Rai and MP Koda at Birsa Munda Central Jail for their support for party nominee Sahu.         
	With 25 MLAs, the Congress-JVM combine needs three more votes to ensure victory for Sahu, who met the jailed MLAs on Monday.         
	In their quest for numbers, Rao and Singh later followed up with Anosh Ekka at RIMS where Jharkhand Party MLA is being treated for hypertension since his arrest.        
	The court has granted permission to Ekka and Rai to vote in the biennial polls.         
	Kodas wife Geeta, who is an MLA from Jagannathpur, joined a luncheon meeting thrown by the Opposition leader at a hotel along with JVM chief Babulal Marandi.        
	On Congress hobnobbing with tainted MLAs days after home minister P. Chidambaram spoke of zero tolerance on corruption, Balmuchu scurried for cover.                          
	He denied Rao had met the tainted MLAs, but sources at the Birsa Munda jail and RIMS confirmed the meetings.        
	 On Geeta Koda, he said she had expressed her willingness to cast her vote for a secular party. So, we cant stop her, he maintained.         
	 The BJP made the most of the Congresss weakness. Party general secretary Arjun Munda said the Congress had lost the moral right to lead the fight against corruption.        
	It is a shame for the Congress to enlist the support of tainted MLAs, he said.        
	Reminded that his party nominee, Ajay Maroo, had also met the tainted MLAs a couple of days back, the BJPs Jamshedpur MP said, There is a difference between a candidate and top leaders of a party seeking their support, he said.        
	Munda, who is going all out to keep his MLAs flock together, claimed his nominee would spring a surprise as they had worked out a formula to get extra votes. But he refused to elaborate.        
	State JD(U) president Jaleshwar Mahto has also extended support to the BJP nominee.        
	But as of now, the poll equation looks favourable for both Congress as well as JMM nominees.        
	K.D Singh, the controversial nominee representing JMM-Ajsu, expressed confidence that he would sail through the elections, choosing to ignore questions raised about his true credentials as an outsider.        
	 Singh claimed he was banking on the five RJD votes, though party chief Girinath Singh said that he was yet to get any instruction from Lalu Prasad. RJD sources, however, said that party MLAs may abstain, helping those in the fray by reducing the number of votes needed for a win.        
	All parties have asked MLAs not cast any secret vote, but show their choice to the polling agents.         
	 Under the rules, a candidate getting the highest number of votes is declared first winner. Thereafter, the candidate getting the lowest number of votes is eliminated.

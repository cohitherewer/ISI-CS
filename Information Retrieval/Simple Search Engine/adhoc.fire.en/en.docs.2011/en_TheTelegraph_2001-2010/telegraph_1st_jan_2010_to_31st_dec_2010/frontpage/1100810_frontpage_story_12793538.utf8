The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Coal capital gets its ride, steel hub next
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Coal capital gets its ride, steel hub next
          PRADUMAN CHOUBEY AMP; PINAKI MAJUMDAR                                              
	Dhanbad/Jamshedpur, Aug. 9: After Ranchi, it was Dhanbads turn to flag off its city bus service today while August 18 is set as the tentative date for launching the eagerly awaited project in Jamshedpur.        
	With principal secretary of the urban development department P.K. Jajoria, Dhanbad mayor Indu Singh, deputy commissioner Sunil Kumar Burnwal and other dignitaries as passengers, the first bus rolled onto the streets from the golf grounds in the coal capital for a ceremonial round of the city.        
	Of the 100 buses earmarked for Dhanbad under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), 48 have already been procured by the municipal corporation. The remaining 22 meant for the first phase will be brought from Ranchi as soon as they are declared technically fit.        
	For starters, the buses will run on six routes  Katras to Dhanbad station, Katras More to Govindpur, Jharia to Govindpur, Bartand to Sindri, Dhanbad station to Rajganj and Mahuda to Dhanbad station.         
	Speaking to reporters on the occasion, Jajoria said 70 buses would ply in the city in the first phase, while the remaining 30 would be procured and pressed into service in the second phase next year.         
	The buses would be run by the Bhutpurv Sainik Kalyan Sangh, an organisation of retired army officers. Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation (JTDC) has allocated six acres at Bartand bus stand to park the vehicles.        
	Commenting on the opposition to the project from auto rickshaw owners, Jajoria said the buses had been introduced for the benefit of the common man and the livelihood of auto-rickshaw drivers would not be affected as all authorised three-wheelers would continue to ply along with the buses.         
	Interestingly, several councillors boycotted the inaugural function of the city bus service in support of auto-rickshaw drivers.         
	Administrator of Dhanbad Municipal Corporation Anand Mohan Singh said 24 of the 48 buses would run as a part of the pilot project and the remaining would be introduced gradually.        
	Passenger Prabhakar Prasad, who took the bus from the station to Govindpur, said the initiative was good but the Rs 7 fare was way higher than the Rs 4 he would have paid in a shared auto-rickshaw.         
	The minimum fare has been fixed at Rs 4 and the maximum is Rs 20.        
	In Jamshedpur, JTDCs manager (administration) Alok Prasad confirmed that the service would most probably start on August 18 in the steel city. The launch date is almost final. Our consultant is working out routes and fares. Bhutpurv Sainik Kalyan Sangh will provide the necessary manpower to run the buses, he said.        
	According to him, 50 buses earmarked for Jamshedpur will arrive in the city shortly. The parking lot for the vehicles is yet to be finalised.        
	While Jamshedpur is to get 50 buses, Ranchi and Dhanbad have been allotted 100 buses each. The city bus service was launched in Ranchi on June 26 with 50 buses running on five designated routes.         
	Of the 250 buses required for the three cities, 190 have already arrived.         
	General manager of JTDC Shakeel Jappar said the main aim of introducing the city bus service was to revamp the transport system in the three main cities of the state under JNNURM.         
	At present, Jamshedpur boasts 40-odd buses run by private operators on fixed routes in addition to the usual vans and auto-rickshaws. It is the only city in the state to have a private bus service. The private bus operators charge anything between Rs 4 and Rs 10, depending on distance.        
	Over the last few months, the urban development department has taken a number of steps to pave the way for the bus service in the three cities. It has stopped registering new auto-rickshaws, the backbone of public transport in the capital and all other cities and towns in the state.        
	Erstwhile state transport commissioner Nitin Madan Kulkarni had in March imposed a ban on issuing new permits for auto-rickshaws or any other vehicle meant for public transport in the routes marked for the bus service.         
	Officials of Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC), the local civic body which would keep tabs on the bus service in the steel city, revealed that the society of retired army officers had quoted a daily charge of Rs 500 per bus for Jamshedpur.         
	The routes, fares and other logistics for running the buses would be finalised in the next few days, said J.P. Yadav, special officer of JNAC. According to him, the buses would run on five or six routes.

          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 19: Naxalite rebels today made two abortive attempts to disrupt the fourth and penultimate phase of panchayat elections scheduled for tomorrow.        
	A can bomb was recovered from a polling booth in Chatra, close to the border with Bihar. The 10kg bomb, which had been kept at Dholia primary school in Hunterganj block, was defused later in the afternoon.        
	Another 15kg can bomb was found on Rajpur-Joldiha road in Bashishthanagar police station area of Hunterganj block. The bomb had been planted on a stretch that would have been used by polling personnel and security forces.         
	Following the discovery, government officials and security forces have been stationed at a safe cluster point from where they will move to concerned booths on foot after the bomb was defused, said Chatra SP Prabhat Kumar. He added that the rebels would have detonated both the bombs during the polling process.        
	Elections will also take place tomorrow in Sonua and Goelkera blocks of West Singhbhum district, close to the Orissa border. CRPF and state police have started massive operations in the area in the wake of yesterdays killing of two Naxalites and a jawan of Orissa police in an encounter.        
	Polling will take place in as many as 542 panchayats spread over 36 blocks in 12 districts of the state. Over 17.25 lakh rural voters are expected to exercise their franchise.        
	The fourth and fifth phase are more challenging for us. I appeal to voters to come out in large numbers. Polling parties have been dispatched to booths and by 8pm tonight, they will reach their respective destinations, state election commissioner S.D. Sharma said.         
	IG (operations) R.K. Mallick said tomorrows elections would take place in rebel-prone areas. We have made elaborate preparations to foil any evil plan of Naxalites. As many as 597 companies of security forces, majority of them central paramilitary ones, have been deployed.         
	At many places, polling personnel and security staff have been air-dropped over the last two days. So far, there are no reports of any untoward incident, he said.         
	Lohardagas Peshrar and Kisko blocks, Gumlas Bishunpur block, Palamaus Manatu and Leslieganj blocks, Hazaribaghs Katkamsandi block, Chatras Hunterganj, Kunda and Lawalong blocks, and Giridihs Gawan and Teesri blocks, among others, are considered areas where rebel outfits may try to target police parties and disturb the poll process.        
	The fourth phase will decide the fate of 22,886 candidates vying for the posts of ward member, mukhiya, panchayat samiti member and zilla parishad member.         
	This phase will elect 6,449 panchayat representatives. They will include 5,310 ward members, 452 each of mukhiya and panchayat samiti members and 55 zilla parishad members. So far, in 1,082 seats, the respective candidates secured their win unopposed.

  - Indian killed by muggers amid debate on response to crime          AMIT ROY                            Sukhwinder Singh                                        
	London, Jan. 10: A 31-year-old Indian national, Sukhwinder Singh, was today praised as a have a go hero after he tried to help a woman whose handbag had been snatched and was fatally stabbed by two muggers on an East London street.        
	The incident has led some to make comparisons with the mounting scale of attacks on Indian students in Australia but in Britain, the issue is different: the alleged tendency of the law to show more sympathy for the perpetrators of crime than the victims, often Asian shopkeepers, who seek to defend their property.        
	In a number of cases, violent criminals have been shown more sympathy, the British media have said, than property owners who responded with disproportionate violence.        
	Sukhwinder, who has been in Britain for 10 years, working as a builder, while his wife and son remained in India, died on Friday night at the Royal London Hospital. A post-mortem confirmed the cause was a stab wound to the heart.        
	Alerted by a phone call, his cousin, Harwinder Singh, 27, with whom he shared a house, quickly drove to the scene.        
	Harwinder said: I found his body lying in the snow. The police tried to save him. He was the bravest man, the most selfless person Ive ever met.        
	The police officer in charge of the investigation, detective inspector John Sandlin, said: This is a tragic death of a man. What Mr Singh did was obviously very brave but I would not encourage that members of the public do that.        
	If Sukhwinder had caught the two muggers and been excessively violent with them in the eyes of the law, it is quite possible he would have landed up in jail.        
	On Friday, a 28-year-old woman passenger had got off a train at Barking in East London just before 7pm when her handbag was snatched by the two black muggers.                    
	In a majority of cases, the police have to act with great sensitivity because the muggers are usually young black men, unemployed, uneducated and from broken families, while their victims are almost always non-black and often elderly and vulnerable.        
	Asian shopkeepers and newsagents, who work exceedingly hard, have traditionally had a problem with youths who pilfer from their shops.        
	Sukhwinder, though, had no personal interest. He reacted in a public-spirited fashion when he heard a woman scream: Dont let them run.        
	Bittu  Sukhwinders nickname  chased the robbers, who were younger than him  one was 6ft tall  and cornered them but was knifed during the altercation. It is likely that because Sukhwinder initiated the chase, the courts will accept charges of manslaughter rather than murder if the muggers are caught.        
	A resident, Mohammad Jubran, 22, said: Its terrible, but its a brave thing he did.        
	The case of a TV presenter, Myleene Klass, who waved a knife at intruders who were attempting to break into her home in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, was highlighted today.        
	She was terrified when she saw teenagers trying to break into her garden shed. She grabbed a kitchen knife in an effort to wave away the intruders. But when police arrived, Myleene was aghast when she was told that the law did not allow her to defend herself in her own home, according to her spokesperson.        
	Last month two brothers, Munir and Toker Hussain, were jailed for 39 and 30 months, respectively, when they fought off and badly beat one of three masked and armed burglars who had broken into their home.

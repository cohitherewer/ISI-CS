The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A horse is set prancing in Left camps
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                A horse is set prancing in Left camps
          MANINI CHATTERJEE                                              
	New Delhi, May 24: Nearly three years after his famous if they want to withdraw support, so be it challenge which eventually led to a bitter divorce between UPA I and the Left over the Indo-US civil nuclear deal, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today expressed an almost wistful longing for the support once provided by the group but left the possibility of any future rapprochement entirely at its door.        
	Singhs remarks were made in course of his media conference to mark the first anniversary of UPA II this morning.        
	Asked if in his second term in office, he missed the structured support received from the Left for most of his first innings, the Prime Minister said: Well, if wishes were horses, even beggars would ride. I know it cannot become a reality.        
	He did not stop at that. But I would like all like-minded political parties, who care about the well-being of our people, who support the general approach towards inclusive growth, which we are trying to put in place, to come and join us in carrying forward this process of sustained and equitable development.        
	If the first part of the answer made it clear that the Prime Minister harboured no bitterness towards the Left and wished for  but did not expect  a return to status quo ante, the second part put the ball firmly in the Lefts court.        
	Significantly, the Prime Minister chose to emphasise the left-of-centre aspects of his government and made a broad-brush appeal to parties which care about the well-being of our people and support inclusive growth  aims that the CPM and the CPI claim to champion.        
	Besides adopting a statesman-like approach towards a bitter adversary who almost brought his government down, the Prime Ministers deftly worded response also appeared to be a politically astute double-edged overture. According to sources, it was aimed as much at the internal dynamics within the CPM as it was a veiled signal to existing and potential allies such as Mamata Banerjee, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati that UPA II could explore other possibilities in case their support came at too great a price.        
	The immediate reaction of Left leaders was far from positive. CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan told The Telegraph: We are not taking it (the PMs comment) seriously. On whether Singh had opened the door just a little for future ties, Bardhan said: Let them keep the door open  it does not matter to us. The Left is where it is.        
	CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury was less dismissive. He told reporters that the Left did not have a wish list the last time round and supported the first edition of the UPA on the basis of an agreed common minimum programme. The support was withdrawn when this programme was breached.        
	Notwithstanding these public statements, it is no secret that sections in the CPM, particularly in the Bengal unit of the party, are keen to drive a wedge between the Congress and Trinamul and are not averse to a supportive or at least non-hostile attitude towards the Manmohan government at the Centre.         
	Ever since the Left Fronts debacle in the Lok Sabha elections a year ago, these sections have felt the withdrawal of support to the UPA I government which facilitated the Congress-Trinamul alliance, coupled with the chimera of a Left-Third Front combine floated on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls, played a big role in the Lefts defeat.        
	Although the CPMs official line  identified with general secretary Prakash Karat  has remained staunchly anti-Congress to the extent that the CPM was often seen in the same corner as the BJP during the budget session of Parliament, those with a dissenting view have not given up efforts to work out a more nuanced, less hostile attitude towards Indias Grand Old Party.        
	The immediate concern of this section revolves around next years Bengal Assembly elections. They believe that a breach between the Congress and Trinamul would help them fight the most difficult polls they have been up against since 1977 and would not mind, in exchange, informally supporting the Manmohan Singh government or at least keeping it afloat by not voting against it for the rest of the term. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who shares a warm personal rapport with Singh, is often identified with this viewpoint.        
	The dominant view is totally against any such arrangement and does not buy the argument that the Congress-Trinamul alliance can be blamed for the fronts dismal showing.         
	The results of the Bengal civic polls, where the two parties are fighting separately, might give an indication on which way the wind is blowing. If Trinamul sweeps the polls, it will strengthen the central line that the Left Front has only its lack of performance to blame. Conversely, if the absence of Opposition unity makes the Left do less badly than expected, the non-hostile line towards the Congress may get a fillip.        
	Apart from the Bengal elections, the attitude to the Congress has been the central fault line in the Indian communist movement for decades. At periodic junctures, the movement has faced a crisis over differences on whether to be implacably hostile to the Congress or support its progressive credentials.        
	This was manifested as early as 1948 in the P. C. Joshi-versus  B.T. Ranadive battle, led to the historic split in 1964 and the formation of the CPM, coloured inner party debates in the 1980s when the CPM was made to give up the all-inopposition unity line to recognise the twin danger thesis (i.e. the BJP and the Congress were equally dangerous) and finally to a situation when the CPM  under the leadership of Harkishan Singh Surjeet and Jyoti Basu  ensured the formation of a Congress-led government at the Centre.        
	Since July 2008, when the CPM-led Left withdrew support, anti-Congressism has been revived. But if the Left fares badly in its strongholds next summer, it might ignite a fresh debate within the CPM and the wider Left movement  and the Prime Ministers offhand offer today could acquire a resonance that seems distant as of now.

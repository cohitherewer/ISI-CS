	Raipur, Jan. 22: Union home minister P. Chidambaram has expressed satisfaction with the ongoing operations in the Naxalite-hit states and clarified that the Jharkhand chief minister would be called for discussions at another meeting scheduled for next week in New Delhi.        
	The government in Jharkhand is new and hence, it has been kept out of todays meeting, Chidambaram said after reviewing the operation against Maoists with two chief ministers  Raman Singh (Chhattisgarh) and Naveen Patnaik (Orissa)  and Maharashtra home minister R.R. Patil.        
	Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren will be reaching New Delhi on January 28 for a discussion on the issue, Chidambaram said amid speculation that the Centre had left him out deliberately because of his oft-repeated advocacy for initiating dialogue with the rebels.        
	During the meeting in New Delhi, all issues will be discussed with the Jharkhand government and the state will be involved in the anti-Maoist operations, Chidambaram added after todays meeting, also attended by senior police officials of the three Naxalite-infested states and paramilitary forces engaged in operations there.        
	Yesterday, Jharkhand home secretary J.B. Tubid clarified to The Telegraph that there was no question of stalling ongoing operations against Maoists, seeking to end speculation that because of differences with the Centre on the question of tackling rebels, the police had been instructed to go slow.        
	The joint operation is just a few weeks old and the progress made is satisfactory, Chidambaram said, adding that as the operation continued the progress would be even more satisfactory.         
	The goal of the operation is not to engage in gun-battles, Chidambaram said, adding that the operation would re-assert the establishment of civil-administration in the affected pockets.         
	For that, Orissa was today promised five more battalions of central paramilitary forces and two helicopters.        
	The administration will be allowed to exercise the co-ordination of taking up development works in the areas, he said. The Union minister clarified that the government intended to avoid unnecessary violence and collateral damage through the operation.         
	All that the operation will do is to move the security forces inside (the disturbed areas) and regain control from the Naxalites, he added.        
	The three states (Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Maharashtra) had agreed to cooperage and co-ordinate in the joint operation, he said and insisted there was no difference of opinion among the states.        
	The Union minister said there was no Operation Greenhunt going on in the country. For convenience, a senior officer of a state had coined the name, he clarified.        
	The joint operation, he said was nothing but troop and technology that the Centre was providing to states to deal with the Naxal menace, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | From Melbourne to masses, fight for legacy 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                From Melbourne to masses, fight for legacy 
          NALIN VERMA                      Amit Sarkar (right) at a market in Purnea. Picture by Ashok Sinha                          
	Purnea, Oct. 19: Na jahar khao na mahur khao, marna ho to Purnea jao (Swallow neither poison nor venom; if you want to die, simply go to Purnea).        
	So went a British district magistrates entry in the official gazette on this Bihar township, as swarms of mosquitoes buzzed and bred in its waterlogged, dirty streets, and hundreds suffered and died of malaria.        
	Nothing much has changed in Bihars Purnea, some 400km from Patna, even 63 years after Independence. Things are as bad as ever, as though time has been standing still. But Amit Sarkar couldnt care less.        
	The 30-year-old IT engineer has chucked his job in Melbourne  annual salary of Rs 60 lakh  and left European wife Blaga and kids Josh and Jai behind to revive the legacy of his father and CPM leader, Ajit Sarkar, in his hometown.        
	Over a months campaigning in the streets ahead of the Bihar elections has taken its toll on his hair, which looks frizzy and unkempt. Rashes have erupted on his skin, and rough patches bother him. But shod in hawai chappals like his numerous supporters, Amit has been connecting with the voters.        
	So, what drove him to take the poll plunge? In my blood and flesh, I am the son of the man who fought for the masses till he was killed by criminals on June 14, 1998, said Amit.         
	I am a Bihar boy and an Indian. I simply want to live and die for the poor people I was born and brought up among.        
	On the last day of campaigning for Bihars first phase of elections on Thursday, Amit today stood ringed by emaciated men and women in Muzaffar Ahmad Nagar, on Purneas outskirts. Many cheered at the sight of him; others wept at finding him among them.        
	He is like our son. We are happy to see him among us. These are tears of happiness. We see in him his father who fought for us. Allah in par rehmat kare (May Allah bless him), an elderly woman said.        
	The Muzaffar Ahmad Nagar residents, over 4,000 of them, have an emotional bond with the Sarkars. A crusader for the poor, Ajit Sarkar had snatched about three square acres of gamazrua (government) land from landlords and distributed it among poor Muslim families. Purneas rich still refer to Muzaffar Ahmad Nagar as Loot Nagar.        
	Tarun Bose, Amits maternal uncle and a trade union leader, said the term Loot Nagar was proof of the landed gentrys defeat at the hands of the masses mobilised by Ajit Sarkar.        
	Although the CPM does not have much of a presence in Bihar, Ajit Sarkar had kept the party flag flying in Purnea till his death. He won Purnea in 1980 and represented it without a break till he was murdered, allegedly by Pappu Yadav and his goons, in June 1998. Pappu is serving a life term for the murder.        
	See, the factors that led to Ajit Sarkars killing still exist, said Amit. The system is not working for the liberation of the poor. Musclemen and criminals patronised by the system are still at work. I am organising the youths to liberate the people from the shackles of slavery and deprivation.        
	But what if he doesnt win the elections?        
	I will never lose for I am not fighting to become a mere MLA, Amit said. I am always there to fight for the poor. I have left my job to mobilise the people in Purnea to continue the battle my father began. Winning or losing the seat makes no difference. I will not return to the job and the luxury I have left for the cause.        
	Asked what would become of his family life, Amit said: Its not a problem. If I understand what my father stood for, my kids too will understand. And my wife is quite co-operative and capable. She has allowed me to fight for the people. Thats why I am here.        
	Amit said he didnt quite get what the Congress and Rahul Gandhi were trying to do in Bihar. Rahul has been talking of guiding the youth to build a new India. But see how his party has given tickets to Pappu Yadavs wife Ranjita and Anand Mohans wife Lovely from Bihariganj and Alam Nagar? Can a forward-looking leader change India with the help of criminals and goons?        
	Amit studied at Vikas Vidyalaya in Ranchi and Ram Mohan Roy Seminary in Patna before leaving for Australias Central Queensland University in 2000. He graduated in information technology in 2005 and joined Primus Telecom, an MNC. He quit his job a little over a month ago to jump into the Purnea fray.        
	After Ajit Sarkars death in 1998, his widow Madhavi was briefly the Purnea legislator. In 2000, the seat was won by BJPs Rajkishore Kesri who remains the sitting MLA and is contesting again.        
	For Amit though, its the first brush with elections. If Amit wins, it will be a dawn after 10 years of darkness in Purnea, said local CPM secretary Sunil Kumar Singh.

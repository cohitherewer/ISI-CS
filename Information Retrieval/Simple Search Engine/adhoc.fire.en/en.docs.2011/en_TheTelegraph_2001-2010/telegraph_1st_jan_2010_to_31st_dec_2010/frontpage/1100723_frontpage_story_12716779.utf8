          G.S. MUDUR                            Urbasi Sinha                                  
	New Delhi, July 22: A Jadavpur University-educated Indian physicist in Canada has helped perform a high-precision experiment to test for the first time one of the most fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics  a bedrock theory of physics.         
	Urbasi Sinha and her colleagues in Austria, Canada and France have confirmed what physicists call Borns rule, a law formulated by the German physicist and quantum mechanics pioneer Max Born in 1926.        
	Their experiment reveals how nature works at the tiniest of scales and may nudge scientists closer towards their long-standing goal of unifying the two grand theories of physics  quantum mechanics and gravity.        
	A research paper by the five-member team of physicists describing the experimental results will appear in the US journal Science on Friday.         
	Quantum mechanics describes perfectly, among other things, the sometimes bizarre behaviour of the universe at its smallest scales  for instance, it can explain how a subatomic particle may appear to occupy two places at the same time.        
	Sinha and her co-workers used lasers to fire single photons towards three whisker-thin slits to test Borns rule, a quantum mechanics law that assigns probabilities for events to occur.         
	This gives us a clean, precise test for Borns rule, said Sinha, a postdoctoral scientist at the Institute of Quantum Computing (IQC) at the University of Waterloo, Canada.        
	This is the first-ever experimental verification of Borns rule. Although it has been decades since Max Born postulated this Nobel prize-winning work, its amazing there has not been a single dedicated precision test for it, Sinha told The Telegraph.        
	The London-born Bengali, who studied BSc with physics honours at Jadavpur University before pursuing a masters and a PhD at Cambridge University and moving to Canada, helped design the experiment, extracted data and analysed the results.         
	Sinha, whose parents are now settled in Calcutta, said the experiment was motivated by IQC director Raymond Laflamme, a physicist who specialises in attempts to unify quantum mechanics and gravity and who was once a student of Stephen Hawking.        
	The experiment they have designed is very hard  it is technologically very challenging, said Joseph Samuel, a theoretical physicist at the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore, who was not connected with the study.                                 
	It tests an aspect of quantum mechanics theory that has not been tested so far, Samuel told The Telegraph. There has been no reason so far to doubt quantum mechanics, but it is good to test something like this with high precision.        
	The motivation to perform a three-slit experiment, Samuel said, has grown since the mid-1990s when a physicist, Rafael Sorkin, from Canadas Perimeter Institute invoked the theoretical possibility that there may be versions of a quantum mechanics theory where Borns rule may not be valid.         
	Sinha and her colleagues performed measurements in which there were three possible paths  three slits  that a single photon could take. By blocking off combinations of slits, they computed the detection probability, obtaining results consistent with Borns rule.         
	While Borns rule has been verified only indirectly in the past, physicists have had lingering worries that the indirect tests may have missed out very small violations. The three-slit test has only bolstered physicists faith in what Sinha once dubbed the Born supremacy.         
	Physicists believe the results could guide attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics through a grand unified theory. Small modifications to quantum mechanics may be necessary to achieve a consistent theory of quantum gravity, said James Franson, a physicist at the University of Maryland, commenting on the experiment in the same issue of the journal Science. Experiments of this kind may be useful in setting limits on what modifications are allowed, Franson wrote.

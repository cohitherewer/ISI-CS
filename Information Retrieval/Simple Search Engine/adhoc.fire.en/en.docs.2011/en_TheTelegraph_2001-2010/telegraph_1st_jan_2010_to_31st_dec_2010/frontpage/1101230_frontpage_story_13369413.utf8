The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Extortion twist in Sanjay case
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Extortion twist in Sanjay case
          SADAF MODAK                             Sanjay Dutt                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 29: The payment row involving Sanjay Dutt just got murkier.        
	The actors lawyer today claimed Sanjay had never taken money from Shakeel Noorani for signing for a film and it was the producer who had threatened him with extortion calls.        
	Rizwan Merchant said Noorani, who claims Sanjay took Rs 50 lakh from him but refused to shoot for his film Jaan Ki Baazi, made extortion calls time and again through goons.        
	Merchant said a case had been registered against the producer in 2008 by the anti-extortion cell of Mumbai police and the case was being probed by Vijay Salaskar.        
	That was before the police officer died in the 26/11 attack.        
	The statements of both Dutt and Noorani were recorded by the police and investigations are on in the case which was being headed by Vijay Salaskar, Merchant said.        
	The lawyers allegations came a day after the Mumbai sheriffs office slapped notices of attachment on two of Sanjays properties following a nod from Bombay High Court, which allowed an arbitration award passed by the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association.        
	The IMPPA award, passed in January, had asked the Munnabhai star to pay Noorani over Rs 2 crore as compensation for losses he suffered for the stalled film.        
	If Dutt fails to pay or respond within 30 days, the property will have to be auctioned to repay the losses incurred by Noorani, Nooranis lawyer Ashok Sarogi had said yesterday.        
	Merchant claimed the IMPPA had in 2005 dismissed Nooranis complaint as he had no evidence that the actor had been given the signing amount. Dutt only attended the muhurat and shot for two days. As Noorani kept delaying the payment of his fee, Dutt refused to shoot any further, said the lawyer, who questioned the IMPPAs decision to allow a complaint it had rejected in 2005.        
	Noorani dismissed the lawyers allegations as false and said he had paid Sanjay in cash.        
	In 2001, when I paid him, most of such payments were based on mutual understanding. Why else would he attend the muhurat? he said.        
	The producer also dismissed the allegation that he had threatened Sanjay. You will find no such record with the anti-extortion cell. Dutt had been convicted for his connection with the underworld, while his lawyer claims that I used the underworld to extort money from Dutt, he said.         
	Noorani claimed it was Sanjay who had threatened him. Dutt told me if I troubled him he would shoot me dead. Dutt still has links with the underworld. I will now file a police complaint, PTI quoted the producer as saying.

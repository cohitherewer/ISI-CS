          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jamshedpur, Jan. 23: S.S. Razi, the registrar of Kolhan University, has stopped meeting people in the evenings. Gynaecologist Renuka Chowdhury has cut down on her hectic social life. And youngsters dont go out for late night movie shows any more.        
	Welcome to a scared Jamshedpur where evenings are no longer about a leisurely stroll in Jubilee Park, a game of cards at Beldih Club with dinner of soup and roast chicken or simply, a visit to a friends house for adda.        
	Ever since a spate of murders  Tata Main Hospital doctor Prabhat Kumar and traders Tushar Vagadia and Inderpal Singh were the victims of the attacks that started on December 3, 2009 and shootings rocked the steel city, life hasnt been the same (see chart).         
	Heres how: the 59th edition of Steel City Golf Championships, a calendar event of the city, had to be put off for security reasons.        
	I am avoiding meeting people after dusk. I dont want to risk it. The situation in the city is uncertain and it is better to take precautions, said the bespectacled Razi, a resident of Bistupur.         
	Doctors like Chowdhury have cut down on professional calls and the Indian Medical Association is talking to private security firms to provide their services to physicians who ask for it.        
	The president of the Jamshedpur chapter of IMA, A.C. Akhauri, went to the extent of saying that doctors were so distressed two of their colleagues, P.K. Mishra and Ashis Roy, are still recovering after being shot at in their own city that they may even stop attending to patients if the attacks continued.        
	Shes not attending gatherings anymore, said a friend of Chowdhury. After all, nobody would like to risk their lives when the law and order situation in the city has nosedived.         
	On January 13, a delegation of industry, led by Tata Steel MD H.M. Nerurkar, met the deputy commissioner of East Singhbhum to draw his attention to the worrying trend.        
	Based on the delegations suggestions, the Shibu Soren cabinet cleared the creation of a new post of senior superintendent of police who will head a team of two SPs  one for rural areas and the other for urban to comprehensively upgrade the level of policing that the steel city has been subjected to.        
	The police, too, have got cracking. With newly appointed director-general Neyaz Ahmed stating that restoring law and order in Jamshedpur was priority, the police have detained as many as 150 suspects in connection with the recent cases of murder and attempt to murder, but have failed to make any significant headway, except in jeweller Tushar Vagadias case.         
	They have also taken a number of other measures, primarily a drive against unscrupulous SIM card vendors who were tampering with documents of genuine customers to aid local gangs.        
	But is this enough?         
	The Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry has taken the initiative of training members who have licensed arms, in collaboration with the Jamshedpur Rifle Club.         
	Carrying a gun isnt enough to take on criminals in crisis situations. The licence holders must also be trained to handle arms, said Suresh Sonthalia, the general secretary of SCCI.        
	But Jamshedpur was never like this. Not one of its loyal residents ever thought they would have to carry weapons to protect themselves from goons who have struck at random and in places like Kadma-Sonari Link Road, Northern Town, Mango and Sidhgora.        
	The citys cinemas are also feeling the heat. With the police stepping up their security checks, especially on youngsters on motorbikes, the regular clientele of the citys four movie halls has stopped showing up.         
	Recent crimes in the city have indirectly affected our business, rued Amit Agarwal, owner of Gaushala Talkies. The youth are avoiding movies because of strict checking, especially those who ride pillion. We used to sell tickets worth about Rs 3,000 for night shows. But now it has dropped to a meagre Rs 400.         
	Members of the Marwari Mahila Manch, one of the more visible social organisations in the city, have also cut down on their activities. We have several members who are doctors. Now, whenever we have a programme, we think of safety first, said secretary Manju Khandelwal.        
	Life in Jamshedpur has changed. The roads are deserted even before its night time. Shopkeepers down shutters early. Perhaps Gyan Taneja describes it best. The situation is very uncomfortable, says the hotelier.        
	Yes. Tatanagar was never so.

  - VENKY'S IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE BLACKBURN ROVERS          AMIT ROY                                                
	London, Oct. 26: An Indian poultry group appears poised to take over an English Premier League football club, although it will know better than most that its wise not to count ones chickens before they are hatched.        
	Pune-based Venkateshwara Hatcheries is set to acquire Blackburn Rovers  the 1995 league champions now languishing fourth from bottom  for an undisclosed sum, it was announced today.        
	In an upbeat declaration, Venkys chairperson Anuradha Desai said: We expect to be the first Indian company to acquire a (Barclays) Premier League team and we are particularly delighted that the team is Blackburn Rovers, with whom we believe we have many shared values and ambitions.        
	Lakshmi Mittals family bought a 20 per cent share in the Queens Park Rangers football club three years ago, but it plays not in the Premier League but in the next division, the Football League Championship.        
	The buying of football clubs can be uncertain affairs, though, as proved by the premature reports that appear from time to time linking Anil Ambani to the possible acquisition of this or that Premier League club, such as Liverpool, Newcastle United and Everton.        
	Blackburn, though, signalled that the Venkys deal was almost done by prefacing todays news release with the words: Almost there!        
	An optimistic statement from club chairman John Williams said: A series of meetings, including discussions with the Premier League, have followed an extensive due diligence process. Both parties are hopeful that the transaction will be completed in November.        
	The talks are expected to value the indebted Lancashire club at about 46m, B. Ventakesh Rao, managing director of Venkys, told Indian news channels.        
	Founded in 1875, the club, known as Blackburn or Rovers, is currently 17th among the leagues 20 teams  within sniffing distance of the relegation zone, though its early days yet.         
	Every year, the bottom three clubs are demoted to the next division, from which three are promoted to the Premier League. Blackburn had finished tenth last season.        
	It is a friendly club, a family-friendly club, Blackburn MP and former foreign secretary Jack Straw, an honorary vice-president of the club, told The Telegraph today.        
	He estimates that about 30 per cent of Blackburns population is Asian  half of them Indian and the other half Pakistani. The club is no longer a whites only place: There are Asian staff and supporters, Straw said.        
	The clubs Latin motto is Arte et labore, which means by skill and hard work. But currently it needs a lot of money as well.        
	Sources said the global sports agency Kentaro, which specialises in selling international TV rights to football, could also be involved in the new ownership structure at Blackburn.        
	In 1991, Blackburn was taken over by local steel baron Jack Walker, who formed a trust that put the Rovers up for sale two years ago looking for buyers willing to invest in the club. Venkys is the first potential buyer to have satisfied the current owners with its future intentions.        
	It is also the third Indian company to have considered a takeover of Blackburn. Saurin Shah, owner of an entertainment group in Mumbai, had made an unsuccessful 25-45m offer. Another approach from Ahsan Ali Syed, a Bahrain-based Indian businessman, was rejected too after he apparently offered 300m but doubts were expressed about his company.        
	Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce stressed the need for investment. I think its necessary there is a conclusion because it does leave the club in limbo, he added.        
	Anuradha, 47, who runs the Venkateshwara Hatcheries group, is the daughter of its founder. She is also a director of Lavasa Corp Ltd, which is building a new-age city near Pune.        
	She recently explained her approach to business: You have to invest in building up relationships with people, give them the freedom to work towards goals and when you spend time with them and understand them, they are ready to put in their best for you, be it man or woman. You cant hold a stick and frighten anybody into working for you. Instead, if you sit with them and work with them, you can be assured of results.        
	Dr B.V. Rao and Uttaradevi Rao founded the group in 1971, when Venkateshwara Hatcheries Pvt Ltd (the flagship company of the group) was established.        
	The group has a turnover of Rs 1,300 crore and is largely associated with the poultry business in India. It has 11 units, most of them unlisted. Venkys (India) Ltd is the only listed company within the group with a turnover of Rs 705 crore. Its stock is currently quoted at Rs 913 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Some of the unlisted companies in the group are: Venkateshwara Hatcheries Pvt Ltd, Venco Research amp; Breeding Farm Ltd, and VJ Equipment Ltd.        
	Venkys (India), which started operations as a producer of layer and broiler chicks, is now into other related products such as processed chicken products, pellet feeds and pet food.         
	The group has a small presence in pharmaceuticals through BV Biologicals, a bio-generics company, which means it focuses on off-patent drugs that are produced through biotechnology. BV Biologicals is into products like vaccines and also undertakes contract manufacturing for other players.

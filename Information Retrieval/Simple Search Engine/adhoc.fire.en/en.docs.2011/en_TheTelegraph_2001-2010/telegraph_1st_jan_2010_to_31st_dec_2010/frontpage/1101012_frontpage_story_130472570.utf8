	Kolkata, Oct 12 (PTI): This Durga Puja, the Goddess will be seen adorned in a sari resembling the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) jersey, a unique idea which the team believes would help them receive her blessings in the next IPL tournament.
    The SRK Fan Club of Kolkata has come up with a six-foot- tall idol of Durga, attired in a purple and golden-coloured sari inspired by the jersey of the Shahrukh Khan-owned team.
    One hand of the ten-armed Goddess is seen clutching the team's flag.
    KKR is owned by Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment in partnership with actress Juhi Chawla Mehta and her husband Jay Mehta.
    On all four days of Durga Puja, around 400 members of the fan club would worship the deity, installed at the club's premises at Rajarhat on the north-eastern outskirts of the city, praying for their team's success.

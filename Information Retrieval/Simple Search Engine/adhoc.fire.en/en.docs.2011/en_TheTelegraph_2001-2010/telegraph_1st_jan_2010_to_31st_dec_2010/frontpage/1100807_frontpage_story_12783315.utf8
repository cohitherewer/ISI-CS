The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PC ready to resume Kashmir quiet dialogue
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                PC ready to resume Kashmir quiet dialogue
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Chidambaram                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: P. Chidambaram is banking on the courage of Hurriyat moderates, possibly even hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani, to resume his quiet dialogue on Kashmir.        
	I think it is important to win hearts and minds in Jammu and Kashmir. The fact that there was no civilian strife for five out of six years gave me a lot of encouragement when I embarked upon the path of quiet dialogue, the Union home minister, who had started talks with moderate Hurriyat leaders in the middle of last year, said.        
	The quiet dialogue did yield result. Between May and December 4, 2009, there was hardly any civilian strife. I am not attributing it entirely to the quiet dialogue. But certainly the quiet dialogue contributed to the fact that there was, largely, peace and order in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	Chidambaram hoped that Geelanis appeal to Kashmiris on Wednesday to stop pelting stones and protest peacefully marked a shift of his stand and said if it was indeed a shift, he would welcome it.        
	However, sources said security agencies did not believe that Geelani would change overnight after decades of having a pro-Pakistan attitude.        
	The home minister was replying to Arun Jaitleys apprehension on why Geelani was making conciliatory remarks. Is it a change of heart or is it part of a concerted strategy that these statements have been made? Jaitley asked in the Rajya Sabha, adding that the current protests in Kashmir might be part of a changed strategy as there was no global acceptability for terrorism.        
	Chidambaram, Jaitley and CPM leader Sitaram Yechury seemed to agree that Pakistan had changed strategy from terror strikes to provoking protests. Yechury said the strategic paradigm had shifted from individual terror attacks to inciting of mobs and this required a restrained approach by security forces.         
	The home minister said Pakistan had altered its strategy in influencing the events in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	The BJP and the Left, however, differed on Article 370 that recognises the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. While Jaitley favoured removing the provisions, Yechury wanted them properly implemented. But Chidambaram rejected Jaitleys suggestion.        
	On restoring law and order, Chidambaram said security forces had exercised restraint but fired in self-defence. Despite the Oppositions insistence that the current situation had its roots in the months preceding June 11, he said he would speak only of the current crisis.        
	The home minister said he would resume the quiet dialogue that got derailed late last year. After news broke that Mirwaiz Umer Farooq had held talks with Chidambaram, a moderate Hurriyat leader had been killed.        
	We have to find courage that allowed us to hold dialogue. We have to get on, Chidambaram said.         
	Yechury said the time had come for all parties to tell Kashmiris: We are with you and you are with us.        
	We will resume the political process. The answer to the problem lies only through the political process, only through dialogue, Chidambaram said.

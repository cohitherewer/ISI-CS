  - Burn Standard and   Braithwaite go to rail        OUR BUREAU                                                          
	New Delhi, June 10: Wagon makers Burn Standard and Braithwaite, monuments to the rise and ruin of industry in Bengal, have been transferred to Mamata Banerjees railway ministry.        
	The Union cabinet, which cleared the transfer and helped Mamata keep an election promise, has decided to write off Burn Standards accumulated loans and dues of Rs 1,139.16 crore. The dues were standing in the way of private proposals to take over the sick company that owns lucrative real estate.         
	Burn Standards profit-making refractory unit in Salem will be shifted to steelmaker SAIL.         
	Burn Standard had turned sick 16 years ago. Braithwaite had also slipped into the red but has now clawed its way back to profits. The twists and turns had come to symbolise not only the condition of industry in Bengal but also step-motherly attitude of some central ministers towards units in the state. ( )        
	We are taking them over (Burn Standard and Braithwaite). After all, the railways need huge numbers of wagons and in-house wagon makers will be an asset, Mamata said.        
	The railways are planning to buy 18,000 wagons this financial year and the demand will go up when the east-west freight corridor is commissioned. A significant part of these orders will go to the two Bengal-based wagon makers, officials said. Cash advances for the wagons will be used for modernising the factories and expanding capacities, a Railway Board official said.        
	Keeping in mind local concerns  the two companies together employ around 1,500 people in Bengal  the railways said Rs 20 crore would be pumped in immediately to bring the pay scales of the wagon makers on a par.         
	The pay of Burn Standard employees is lower than that of Braithwaite now. There is no question of anyone losing their jobs, Mamata said.         
	The news of the takeover sent a wave of hope surging among employees of the two public sector units. Sipra Mukherjee, wife of Swapan Mukherjee who works in the Burn Standard unit in Burnpur, said: For 16 years, we had suffered mentally. My husband looked worried all the time. But today we are all happy.        
	Sipra gave a hint of the political dividends Mamata hopes to reap. We are all hardcore CPM supporters. But today, I must thank Mamata Banerjee for her bold decision, Sipra said.        
	Trinamul leaders were quick to point to the cabinet decision as another piece of evidence of Mamatas growing acceptance in Delhi after the civic poll triumph.        
	Mamata had mooted the proposal in last years railway budget but the clearance came today. The two companies were under the heavy industries ministry, now headed by Vilasrao Deshmukh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lack of firefight tools shocks Samaritan tourist
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Lack of firefight tools shocks Samaritan tourist
          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                          
	A US citizen, who reached Calcutta on Tuesday morning, tried her best to help firefighters rescue people trapped inside Stephen Court for around an hour before she gave up hope and joined the hundreds of helpless onlookers.         
	When I saw that trapped residents and employees of offices in the building were trying to jump to safety, I rushed to firefighters requesting them to arrange for nets or soft mattresses to cushion their fall. But the firemen didnt even have a safety net, said Natasha Dedrick, a resident of California.         
	The tourist in her 30s, a specialist in medical massage, had checked into the Young Womens Christian Association (YWCA) hostel, adjacent to Stephen Court, and was shopping on Park Street when the flames were first spotted on the upper floors of the seven-storeyed building.         
	According to her, a call to 911 is enough in her country to alert the firefighters, who reach the spot in a flash. But the delay in the arrival of fire tenders to Park Street  before which some people started jumping off balconies and ledges  came as a surprise to her.         
	The scenes of people jumping off buildings to escape the flames did not spark memories of 9/11 but shock at the lack of resources in a major Indian city to save lives.         
	The firefighters were so ill-equipped. They didnt have any special clothing unlike the firefighters in our country. Initially, they did not have ladders tall enough to reach the affected floors. In my country, I have seen ladders going up to the top floors of highrise buildings, said Natasha, who checked out of the YWCA hostel after the tragedy.         
	The sight of firefighters yelling at each other instead of using modern communication equipment stumped the American.        
	I have seen some small fire incidents in my country. But this one was big and many people lost lives. Had there been better firefighting equipment and prompt response, many of these people probably would not have died, said Natasha.              
	Park Street Tweets        
	Abhimanyu Chirimar, whose office is in Park Plaza, tweeted live from the fire scene till he saw a group of families in tears and didnt want to do this anymore. Metro reproduces his description of the disaster on Twitter              
	A landmark building in Calcutta has been on fire for over 45 mins before the brigade showed up. 7 ppl stuck               
	8th guy shows up at the other end of the building in Calcutta and ppl are begging him not to jump         
	The fumes are getting worse amp; the fire fighters are obviously grossly ill equipped to battle              
	Its a bleak scene in Park Street Calcuttas prime commercial area. There are more civilians helping than officials               
	60 min amp; finally the second truck arrived. Flames have started erupting outside in the Calcutta Flurys building fire               
	Last 3 need to be rescued. No clue how that single (storey) ladder will help               
	The fighters couldnt get ropes up so the victims themselves broke out cable tv wires and are setting up a line               
	Water pressure was inadequate to reach the top floor amp; they are now out of water. 2nd ladder emerges               
	More than an hour in and they finally bring out the big guns               
	All rescued.This is such a tragic sight. Our offices are in Park Plaza amp; this has been a regular hangout forever Calcutta Fire Brigade doesnt have the equipment to battle a fire this high up. Its Bara Bazaar 2008 all over again. Crowds furious               
	Another gas burst apparently worsening the blaze and the Calcutta Fire Brigade isnt able to cope competently 4 jumpers, few minor injuries, 0 deaths reported (so far). Last of the blaze remains               
	I have never seen Calcutta Park Street this grim and I hate it         
	A third loud noise worsens the blaze; crowd actually cheering when they manage to aim the water right               
	Finally some more water power seems to get the blaze to relent, everyone apparently evacuated safely               
	Music World, Peter Cat and Flurys and other retail places are all safe but soaked. One side of the buildings ok now Just saw a whole group of families in tears rush towards Flurys. Dont want to do this anymore partying, music at Park Street.. my deepest condolence to the ones who lost their life in the Park St blaze               
	Uttiya Das

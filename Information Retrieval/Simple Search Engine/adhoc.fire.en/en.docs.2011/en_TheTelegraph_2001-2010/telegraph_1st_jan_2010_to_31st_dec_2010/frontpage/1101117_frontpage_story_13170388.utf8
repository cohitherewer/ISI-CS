The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Old edifices regain youth
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Old edifices regain youth
          SOUMITRA DAS                            The restored buildings on Lenin Sarani and (above) Jatindra Mohan Avenue. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                 
	Calcutta has become the graveyard of all buildings old and beautiful. Entire neighbourhoods have become unrecognisable after low-rise dwelling houses were razed to the ground and multi-storeyed buildings came up in their place. But, as they say, wonders will never cease.        
	Two corner buildings, one in deep north and the other in central Calcutta, which looked like they had been abandoned and were beyond repair, are gradually regaining their youth. If they looked forlorn yet grand in neglect, now they are stunning after makeover. Even more surprising  all their architectural features, including the detailing, remain intact.        
	The building at 73 Lenin Sarani, opposite Union Chapel, had gained the reputation of being haunted. The four-storeyed structure has a central bay facing the busy thoroughfare with two wings, one stretched along Lenin Sarani, and the other extending to Taltala right up to the office of the Hindi daily, Dainik Viswamitra, behind it.        
	It has two porte-cocheres on both sides and the rows of windows with most panes and woodwork missing on all the floors give it a light and airy look, although it is a massive though elegant structure.        
	Under one of these porte-cocheres is a tea stall and the other provides shelter to a few families. Its exterior had become sooty with dark, gaping apertures for windows. Only the ground floor shops were tenanted. The rest was, to all appearances, empty.        
	But a well-known doctor who has lived in Ram Chandra Das Row, in the neighbourhood, says it used to be known as Sirajuddin House, named after a man who owned coal mines in the pre-Independence era,        
	Balram Singh, who is on the editorial staff of Dainik Viswamitra, says Sirajuddin fled the city during the riots in 1947 and apparently moved to Dhaka. The gate still bears the insignia of double S.        
	Thereafter, it was declared as enemy property and was, in all probability, taken over by Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), which let it out to the state government against a pittance. For years, it served as the students hostel of Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, which left it in a dilapidated condition. Later, it went back to LIC, which is renovating it.        
	An LIC official said a branch office of the company would be shifted to the Lenin Sarani building, which will be centrally air-conditioned. The missing shutters will be replaced but they will remain shut. The electrical wiring and floor tiles, too, will be replaced.        
	The official said that before the LIC was formed, insurance companies used to grant loans to well-known people, and when these could not be recovered their property was attached. This building could have been one of them.        
	The second building is in north Calcutta  opposite Lal Mandir, at 57 Jatindra Mohan Avenue, which is the extension of Chittaranjan Avenue. Its art deco in inspiration like some of the mansions on the opposite side of the street.        
	The building, so much like an ocean liner, bears a distinct resemblance to Hindustan Building on Chittaranjan Avenue. Old residents of the neighbourhood said it originally belonged to a member of the Bhagyakul Roy family and should be of the same vintage  about 70-80 years old  as the Taltala building. During BC Roys regime, it was let out to the CMDA and it served as the road development office.        
	Later, the state government was reportedly evicted following a court case. After changing a few hands, it serves as the office of a religious sect and has been renamed Satsang. It has been scraped clean and gleams with whitewash. It has gained a new lease of life.

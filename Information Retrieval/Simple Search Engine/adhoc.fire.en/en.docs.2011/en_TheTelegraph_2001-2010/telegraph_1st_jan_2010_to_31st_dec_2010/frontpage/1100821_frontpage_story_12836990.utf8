The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | MPs pay up three times   Some members not happy, want more
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                MPs pay up three times     Some members not happy, want more
          OUR BUREAU                                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Indias MPs today had their pay more than trebled from Rs 16,000 to Rs 50,000 a month but some of them paralysed the Lok Sabha demanding more.        
	The cabinet rejected a House panels recommendation of a fivefold hike to Rs 80,001 but in private, even senior ministers favoured a reversal of that decision.        
	The MPs, among the few people in the world who decide their own salaries, will have to pass a bill enacting the current hike.        
	The Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (who led the charge against the meagre three-fold hike) will not allow the bill to be passed. So, theres no harm revisiting the subject since most MPs want a bigger hike, a cabinet minister who didnt wish to be named told The Telegraph.        
	MPs yearly pay is now Rs 21.8 lakh, even leaving out various allowances, putting them in the top 3 to 5 per cent of the population in earnings. All the allowances are tax-free.        
	The cabinet apparently didnt go for a higher raise because that could put off the price rise-hit voters. Last year, the Centre had junked a plan to hike MPs salaries after Sonia Gandhi asked her ministers and MPs to take a 20 per cent pay cut because of a drought threat and grim economic outlook        
	Mamata Banerjee was a rare voice today, ridiculing the idea of a larger hike. If I were to take the decision, Id have reduced it further, she said.        
	She recalled: When I was elected the first time in 1984, the salary was just Rs 1,500. I could hardly afford Delhi prices, so I often brought rice and vegetables from Calcutta when I attended House sessions.                  
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee seemed to hint that no further increase was likely as he gave the main details of the hike to the media. (See chart)        
	He said an MP now got at least 10 days allowance a month even when Parliament was not in session. Whenever an MP comes for a (House) committee meeting, he gets two days daily allowance before the meeting and (that) for another two days after the meeting, Pranab said.        
	Many Congress MPs, however, had egged Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav on as they pushed for a bigger raise. Later, a BJP member was heard telling them: What you two did needs guts. Youre our hero.        
	BJP members, though, did not join the protest on L.K. Advanis advice that they should keep the public mood in mind.        
	The Congress was divided, many MPs saying even Rs 80,000 wasnt enough. A Delhi MP said: In the past month, I received 6,000 guests from my constituency. I offer tea and water; even snacks to some important people. You can calculate the expenses.        
	Even Congress MP Sanjay Singh, a royal, backed the Rs 80,000 demand saying: We have to spend Rs 30,000 on tea alone.        
	It isnt as though most MPs have no other sources of income. A non-government poll watchdog had last year counted 300 crorepatis among the Lok Sabhas 543 members. Some industrialist Rajya Sabha MPs are even wealthier.        
	Yet, till 1984, an MPs monthly salary was Rs 500 and his daily allowance Rs 51  far less than a deputy collectors pay. The salary was raised to Rs 1,500 in 1985, to Rs 4,000 in 1998, to Rs 12,000 in 2001 and to Rs 16,000 in 2006.

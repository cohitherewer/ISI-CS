The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mr President, private means 70
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mr President, private means 70
          K.P. NAYAR                            Obama                                  
	Washington, Nov. 2: Barack Obama, who used the power of words two years ago to catapult his underdog presidential bid into a winning White House proposition, is discovering 96 hours before he arrives in India that words have an altogether different meaning in New Delhi.        
	When preparations began for their journey to India, the American President and First Lady Michelle Obama expressed interest in spending their first evening in New Delhi  prior to the start of formal engagements next Monday  at a very private dinner with their friends, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur.        
	The Indian side readily agreed. But as preparations proceeded, Obama was told by his aides that in India the word private does not really mean what it is supposed to: a very private meal between the two leaders and their spouses.        
	Based on rapid-fire cables, email exchanges and conversations in New Delhi and Washington between the respective embassies and those in the two governments planning minute-to-minute details of the visit, it was agreed that the dinner on Sunday night at the Race Course Road residence of Singh would be actually small and private.        
	Yes, of course, Obama and Singh and their spouses would be at one table and that would afford them ample opportunities to have a private conversation, but there would also be a small group in the room having dinner at a few other tables.         
	Obviously, in the Indian protocol lexicon, the two words, small and private, mean the same and will pose no problem of contradiction.        
	As of yesterday, however, this private dinner at Singhs residence, which subsequently became a small affair, has become the most coveted invitation during the entire US presidential visit of three days.        
	An official in the Prime Ministers Office told The Telegraph today that the small list of invitees for the Sunday night meal had expanded to more than 70 and is still growing.        
	Obviously, small in India means only slightly smaller than the usual number of invitees to a White House dinner for visiting foreign leaders. If between 70 and 80 guests are at the private dinner on Race Course Road on Sunday, that will be only about 50 less than the entire guest list for the White House dinner hosted in honour of Singh by former President George W. Bush on July 19, 2005.        
	Indian officials look at these arrangements as necessary in view of the high-profile and historic nature of the first visit by an African-American President to India and are taking the evolving nature of the dinner in their stride.        
	But American officials believe that the changes represent a smart, tactical approach by the Indians to use a social occasion to build and cement relations with the Obama White House in its new avatar at the half-way mark of the Obama presidencys first term.        
	Indians will have a unique opportunity from Saturday for three days to befriend on their home turf a White House team which is not only driving Obamas visit to Mumbai and New Delhi but will probably run the White House during the remainder of his first term as President.        
	According to Ben Rhodes, a White House deputy national security adviser, Obamas India trip will be the longest trip that the President will have taken as President to a foreign country.        
	But Indias opportunity is unique because this team and the President  are leaving for Mumbai just 48 hours after what is expected to be a drubbing for Obama in the mid-term elections to both chambers of the US Congress and several governorships in key American states.        
	Obama has already put in place a partly new, partly reshuffled team to ensure that he does not become a lame-duck President for the next two years because of loss of control by his party of one  if not both  House of the US Congress as an outcome of todays elections.        
	In the process, India lost three top White House officials with whom the Prime Ministers Office and the external affairs ministry had painstakingly built a working relationship after Obamas election as President in November 2008: Lawrence Summers, the outgoing director of the White House National Economic Council, the most important economic decision-maker in Obamas team; Gen. James Jones, who last month resigned as national security adviser; and Rahm Emanuel, the powerful White House chief of staff who has always had Obamas ear.        
	The rising star of the reshuffled White House is Mike Froman, deputy national security adviser for International Economic Affairs, a long-time friend of the President since both men served as editors of the Harvard Law Review.        
	Coincidentally, Froman has emerged in recent weeks as the main driver of Obamas dealings with India because of his twin responsibilities in the NEC and in the National Security Council as part of a White House drive to integrate the work of both the bodies in an effort to deal with global economic troubles and global economic security with a co-ordinated approach.        
	Froman is also the chief liaison between the White House and the Group of Twenty, which Obama will tout in Mumbai as the key to his countrys global interaction with a rising India.        
	Behind the scenes, the Americans have been trying to smoothen the rough edges in preparations for the presidential visit -- especially strategic and security matters -- through Bengal governor M.K. Narayanan.        
	During a whirlwind visit to India 10 days ago to finalise Obamas agenda and itinerary, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, William Burns, and the assistant secretary of state for South Asia, Robert Blake, made a whistle-stop trip to Calcutta to meet Narayanan.        
	An announcement by the US embassy in New Delhi understated the meeting for obvious reasons by insisting that the two-member advance team visited Calcutta to pay homage at Mother Teresas grave.        
	It is an open secret that the mercurial Emanuel had a very special relationship with Narayanan when the governor was national security adviser and made it a point to spend an evening with him even when he was on a private visit to New Delhi and refused to have any official engagement.         
	Similarly, the Prime Minister asked Narayanan to speak to Gen. Jones unofficially to sort out some difficult issues with the White House even after he shifted to the Raj Bhavan in Calcutta.

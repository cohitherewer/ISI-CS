The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cong stiffens JPC stand
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Cong stiffens JPC stand
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: The Congress core committee today decided that the Opposition demand for a JPC probe into the 2G spectrum controversy could not be conceded just because it had led to a parliamentary deadlock.        
	The government is now unlikely to accept the demand for a joint parliamentary committee even if the entire winter session is washed out without any substantial work.         
	Allies such as Mamata Banerjee have said they would be happy if a JPC was formed but added that they would not make such a demand and it was up to the Prime Minister to take a decision. ( )        
	Sources said the Congress leadership was united in the decision to fight the Oppositions political ploy. The core committee felt that the government had taken enough measures to unearth the truth even as parties like the BJP chose to brazen out corruption charges against its Karnataka government.        
	The sources said the partys main troubleshooter Pranab Mukherjee reported to the core group the views of the allies and asserted that they were fully with the Congress in this fight. Mukherjee may again meet some of the leaders of the coalition partners if there are any misgivings.        
	The core committee meeting was attended by both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.        
	The sources said the Congress leaders also discussed parliamentary strategy for the next few days, the political situation in Andhra Pradesh and congratulated Sonia for pursuing the food security bill.         
	The leaders expressed shock at the BJPs hypocrisy and double standards on corruption and laid stress on the need to counter the false propaganda instead of succumbing to it.         
	Mukherjee and parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal had denied reports suggesting the possibility of a JPC in the morning itself, soon after both Houses were adjourned for the day amid protests.        
	Sources in the party and the government emphatically denied any difference of opinion between Singh and Mukherjee on the JPC demand and asserted that both leaders were mature enough to see through the Oppositions game plan.        
	The Prime Minister, too, understands these games. He knows that the Opposition is not interested in fighting corruption and the main purpose is to unfairly defame this government, a source in the PMO said.         
	He added: The BJP knows the Prime Ministers image is an important factor for the Congress and they are cleverly targeting it. It is a political battle that the party will fight politically. The government is conscious of its image and we will take steps to undo this damage but no decision will be taken under pressure.

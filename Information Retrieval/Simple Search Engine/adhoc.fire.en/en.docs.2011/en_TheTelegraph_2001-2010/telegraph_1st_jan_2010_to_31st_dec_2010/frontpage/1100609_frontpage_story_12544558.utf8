                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Lakra, Prasad to advise Farook
          OUR BUREAU                                                Wilfred Lakra and Rajiv Ranjan Prasad      
	Ranchi, June 8: A week after Presidents rule was imposed in the state, the home ministry today appointed Wilfred Lakra and Rajiv Ranjan Prasad as advisers to Governor M..H. Farook.        
	Lakra, a retired 1973-batch IAS officer from Chhattisgarh cadre, was also adviser to former Governor K. Sankaranarayanan during the earlier stint of Presidents rule in Jharkhand. He was also appointed member of the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) by former Governor Syed Sibtey Razi.         
	Prasad is a Jharkhand cadre IPS officer of 1970 batch who retired as director-general (home guard) in 2007. Earlier, he served as director-general of police (DGP) from 2001 to 2004. The sudden transfer of Prasad from the hot seat of the DGP by the Arjun Munda government is still a mystery in the police establishment.        
	Known as an upright officer, Prasad took up teaching and taught human rights in the political science department of St Xaviers College after retirement.         
	Following his appointment today, Prasad said he no more had any contact with the police department. I will have to be briefed first by departmental officials about what is going on in the police establishment. Only then will I be able to say anything, he said.        
	Lakra, who was in Bhopal today, said he was not aware how things had moved in the last five months. I can comment only after reviewing the situation, he said, adding that the appointment had come as a surprise for him.        
	The delay in appointment of advisers was attributed to reluctance of bureaucrats to serve in Jharkhand. One never knows when there will be a realignment of political forces. The advisers are redundant once the government is in place, said a senior IAS officer.        
	Others, who were said to be in the reckoning were former Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta, retired Union agriculture secretary T. Nandkumar and former chief secretary P.P. Sharma.        
	Incidentally, there were three advisers during the earlier stint of Presidents rule. A third adviser can be appointed after Rajya Sabha elections on June 17, said an IAS officer.

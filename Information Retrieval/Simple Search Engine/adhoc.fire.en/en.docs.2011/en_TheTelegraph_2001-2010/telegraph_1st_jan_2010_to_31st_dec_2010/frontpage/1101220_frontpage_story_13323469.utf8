The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sonia waves Singh, not magic wand
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sonia waves Singh, not magic wand
          SANJAY K. JHA                                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: Sonia Gandhi today flagged Manmohan Singh as the best bet to pull the government out of the rut of scandals, saying the Congress solidly stood with him and suggesting the party should not bank solely on the Nehru-Gandhi magic wand.        
	The plenary saw Rahul Gandhi sharply seconding Sonias concern over a disconnect between ministers and party workers, triggering an adulatory response that signalled he is being showcased as the future leader.        
	But Sonia appeared to suggest that the time for change had not come yet, asking the Congress to focus on hard work rather than resort to quick-fix solutions that rely on the family name.        
	I want to say something about our Prime Minister. He is the embodiment of sobriety, dignity and integrity. The BJPs personal attack on him is downright despicable. On your behalf, I want to compliment him for his wise leadership, for remaining calm amidst the storm and for his unwavering devotion to the progress and prosperity of the nation. The party stands solidly with him, Sonia told the Congress plenary today.        
	Sonia listed with deliberation the strengths of Manmohan and underscored his personal integrity at a time an air of despondency hung around Congress workers and some whispers have risen about the need for strong leadership.        
	The Prime Minister sat listening with his trademark impassive expression, but leaders and workers from across the country interpreted Sonias assertion as the final word from madam to nurture no doubts about Manmohans continuance.        
	Digvijay Singh, when his turn came to speak later, said: Most of us leaders are reaching the expiry date. The nation is now looking up to youths. Let Rahul Gandhi and his team take over now.        
	One section said Digvijays statement was intended to nip the hopes of some Congress seniors who may be nursing dreams about succeeding Manmohan.        
	However, if Digvijay was suggesting that Rahul is the immediate answer to the ills plaguing the party, Sonia had indirectly referred to the subject in her speech.        
	Our future will be shaped not by a magic wand or by any single individual. Our future will depend on our partys capacity to work together as a team and to ensure that our organisation does not pull in different directions, she said in a veiled reference to over-reliance by many Congress leaders on the Nehru-Gandhi family charisma.        
	She was speaking in the context of the recent elections in Bihar, where Rahul has been trying to revive the party that remained a poor also-ran. Sonia said the Bihar polls had proved there were no short-cuts that could substitute for hard work.        
	She rebuked ministers for ignoring the party interests, saying she had received complaints about their apathy. Many party workers in non-Congress states have complained to me that our ministers at the Centre do not fully appreciate their concerns. They make a valid point, she said. The attitude to ignore party workers is very demoralising for those who work in hostile environment. The statement ignited a thunderous round of applause.        
	Not surprisingly, Sonia devoted the maximum time of her plenary address to issues linked to corruption. Her emphasis on corruption was exceptional: the aftershock of the omission of the subject at last months AICC session was spread over one full page of her nine-page speech.         
	Sonia asked her partys chief ministers and ministers to relinquish discretionary powers which, particularly in land allocation, breed corruption.

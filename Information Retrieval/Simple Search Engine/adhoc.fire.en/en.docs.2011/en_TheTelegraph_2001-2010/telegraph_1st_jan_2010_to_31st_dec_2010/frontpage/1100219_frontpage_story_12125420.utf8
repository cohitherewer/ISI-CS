The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | After purge, CPM veteran missing
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                After purge, CPM veteran missing
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Feb. 18: The CPM has stripped a central committee member and Citu leader of all party posts for moral misconduct unbecoming of a communist, following which he has disappeared after leaving behind two notes, one of which said death is better than dishonour.        
	W.R. Varadarajan was removed from the posts by the central committee that met in Calcutta from February 4 to 6 but the purge was not made public then. The action was taken on his wifes complaint that alleged he was having an extramarital affair.        
	The 64-year-old Varadarajan has not only been removed from the central committee, the CPMs highest decision-making council between party congresses, but also from the state committee of Tamil Nadu, his home state.         
	Varadarajan is also a national secretary of Citu. Since the CPMs mass-based organisations have a different procedure, it is not clear if the formality of removal from the labour wing has also been completed.        
	The issue, which unfolded in the middle of a rectification drive by the party that has suffered stunning electoral debacles, took on an ominous hue when Varadarajan, who had returned to Chennai on February 11, could not be traced subsequently.        
	The Tamil Nadu state committee met the next day and during a three-day session, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat was understood to have briefed local leaders about Varadarajans ouster. The party rules require such a briefing after the central committee takes disciplinary action.        
	However, the party could not keep the matter under wraps as Varadarajans wife Saraswati filed a police complaint about his disappearance. This morning, the CPMs Tamil Nadu organ, Theekathir (Spark), carried an announcement of the leaders removal from the party posts.        
	State CPM leaders also met the director-general of police, Letika Saran, and requested that the veteran be traced immediately.         
	The discovery of the two unsigned notes from his home added to the alarm among his family and the party. The first note dated February 6, the last day of the central committee session in Calcutta where he was reportedly allowed to speak, says: I have won many political battles but failed in my personal life.        
	The note also quotes a Thirukkural  a Tamil couplet  that says death is better than dishonour.         
	The other note dated February 11, the day Varadarajan returned to Chennai, says the money in his two bank accounts be donated to the party, and his books and laptop to Theekathir. The note adds that his body be donated for medical research.         
	The action against Varadarajan, who rose from the ranks to become a prominent face associated with the Citu nationally and the CPM in Tamil Nadu, followed the formal complaint by his wife to the state committee. After an inquiry, the state committee recommended to the central committee that he be removed from all posts.        
	Varadarajan has a daughter from an earlier marriage and two sons by Saraswati whom he married after his first wife died. He used to play the interpreters role at meetings addressed by national leaders of the party.        
	If Varadarajan has committed suicide as some party leaders fear, it will be the second such instance in the CPMs history. Desh Raj Chaddha, a central committee member who ran the party office in Delhi, had killed himself, the reason for which was never known.        
	But this is not the first time a central committee member has been removed on moral grounds. Balwant Singh, the chief of the Punjab unit, was removed for moral turpitude in 2008.        
	In Bengal, too, a CPM Rajya Sabha member was accused of dishonouring an alleged promise to marry a woman but the party let him off with a warning in the absence of a formal complaint.

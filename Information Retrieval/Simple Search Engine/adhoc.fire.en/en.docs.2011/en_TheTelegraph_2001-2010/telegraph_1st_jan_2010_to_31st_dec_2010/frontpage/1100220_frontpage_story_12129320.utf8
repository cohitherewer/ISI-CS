                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Jesus was gay, says Elton
                                Fame for lunatics                            
	London, Feb. 19: Sir Elton John has claimed that Jesus Christ was gay.        
	In an interview to Parade magazine, he said: I think Jesus was a compassionate, super-intelligent gay man who understood human problems.        
	On the cross, he forgave the people who crucified him. Jesus wanted us to be loving and forgiving.        
	The 62-year-old also confessed that fame has now lost its shine for him. He explained: Princess Diana, Gianni Versace, John Lennon, Michael Jackson, all dead. Two of them shot outside their houses.        
	None of this would have happened if they hadnt been famous. Fame attracts lunatics. I never had a bodyguard, ever, until Gianni died. I dont like celebrity anymore.        
	He also spoke of his past cocaine use. For some people, a gram of cocaine can last a month. Not me. I have to do the lot, and then I want more. At the end of the day, all it led to was heartache.

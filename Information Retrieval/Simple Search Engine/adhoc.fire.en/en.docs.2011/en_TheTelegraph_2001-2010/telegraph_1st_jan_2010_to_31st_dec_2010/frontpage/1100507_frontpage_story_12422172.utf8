The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Death sentence handed but still a long way to the gallows for Kasab
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Death sentence handed but still a long way to the gallows for Kasab

	New Delhi, May 6: Ajmal Kasabs conviction may have been fast but law experts say a long legal process remains to be completed before the Pakistanis fate is determined.        
	The death sentence will have to be confirmed by the (Bombay) high court. The first appeal will lie to the high court and eventually to the Supreme Court, said Supreme Court lawyer Kamini Jaiswal, who had defended the Parliament attack accused.        
	Then Kasab can file a mercy plea to the President, which could get stuck in the long queue of similar petitions pending with her office.        
	Senior lawyer Uday Lalit agreed with Jaiswal that the normal process  an appeal to the high court and then to the apex court  would have to be followed.        
	The high court will examine the evidence all over again before deciding whether to uphold the conviction/sentence or commute the sentence to one less harsh.        
	If it upholds the death sentence, Kasab can challenge it in the Supreme Court. The apex court, too, will look at all the aspects of the preceding judgments, including the evidence and the arguments.        
	If the apex court confirms the death sentence, Kasab can file a clemency plea before the President under Article 72 of the Constitution.        
	Anyone (irrespective of nationality) can file a clemency plea before the President, constitutional expert Rajeev Dhavan said.        
	Some 29 clemency appeals are believed to be pending with the Presidents office, including those from Parliament attack convict Mohammed Afzal and Rajiv Gandhi assassination plotters Murugan, Santhan and Arivu.        
	Any decision on such appeals, though figuratively taken by the President, is prompted by the Union home ministry. Home minister P. Chidambaram had said each case would be decided in serial order, which means it could be years before Kasabs fate is decided as he will be 30th in the queue.        
	Some lawyers, though, are hoping that the 26/11 convicts petition would be disposed of before the others.        
	The appeal hearings in the two higher courts, however, are unlikely to be over in a jiffy. The lawyers said the appeals in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts were yet to be heard by the Supreme Court. The trial in that case had taken over 14 years in the Tada (anti-terror) court, and resulted in the conviction of 100 of the 123 accused, including Sanjay Dutt.        
	The CBI is struggling to streamline the voluminous records in that case. It has digitised all the papers and is said to be exploring the drastic option of dropping charges against those peripheral to the blasts conspiracy.        
	Also, the speed of the 26/11 trial, which led to the fastest terror conviction in the country, may  paradoxically  prove the prosecutions Achilles heel. The swiftness of the trial may later spawn the charge that it was not fair, the lawyers said.        
	They cited several points that could help Kasabs case during appeals. The defence may first raise the question why the Indians were acquitted, Dhavan said.        
	Kasabs co-accused, Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed, were acquitted for lack of evidence that they had passed on maps of the 26/11 targets. Their acquittal may also impact the Pakistani trial of seven 26/11 accused, including Lashkar commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi.        
	Lakhvi is accused of supplying the maps of the targets  an accusation that will be difficult to establish after the same charge failed to stick against Fahim and Sabauddin in an Indian court.        
	The next line of defence could be the alleged lack of effective legal aid for Kasab. Jaiswal, also a rights activist, questioned the circumstances under which the first two defence lawyers quit their brief.        
	The first, Anjali Waghmare, left amid a controversy over how she could defend Kasab when she was herself a witness. The second, Abbas Kazmi, was sacked by the court for non-cooperation. It was the third lawyer, K.P. Pawar, who saw the trial through.        
	Although Kasab did get a trial, his lawyer does not seem to have got a full opportunity to defend him, Jaiswal said.        
	Jaiswal also questioned special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikams near-daily briefings to the media. The way the public prosecutor went about briefing the media is the strangest thing I have seen in this trial, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | When India contributed seven Gandhis to Italy
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                When India contributed seven Gandhis to Italy
  - Europe tops list of 34 countries where busts were sent since 2001          ARCHIS MOHAN                                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: Barack Obama this week got the biggest pulpit from where he could recall his debt of gratitude to the Mahatma but Europe has found more pedestals for the apostle of peace than America.        
	Germany and Italy top the list of countries that were supplied bronze busts or statues of Mahatma Gandhi by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations since 2001, according to a reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.        
	Yes, an MP did actually ask such a question, wondering about the count from 2001, and the foreign ministry collated the figures. The answer to Question 379 was provided by S.M. Krishna, who was missing from the frontline during the Obama visit.        
	As many as 68 figures of the Mahatma have made it to 34 countries in the past nine years, according to the data provided in the answer. Of them, the largest numbers have gone to Germany and Italy, eight and seven, respectively, followed by the US, Canada and South Africa with five each. Not to forget that Obama was gifted a bust when he visited Rajghat on Monday.        
	But dont blame Obama, who said on Monday he wouldnt have made it as US President had Gandhiji not shared his message with America and the world, for not topping the list. If hairs are split, the data could be used to suggest how unprepared Indian diplomats were for the ascent of the Mahatma-admiring Obama to the White House.        
	Officials of the ICCR, an arm of the foreign ministry, said the statues were supplied on the requests of Indian missions abroad for installation on their premises or in parks, libraries or other significant buildings.        
	However, the officialdom has tried to make amends since Obama took over. Of the five statues that went to the US, two were installed since January 2009.        
	If the officials had been caught napping in America, their counterparts in Italy seemed to have been on the ball. All the seven statues or busts supplied to Italy were transported after May 2004. For those not good with dates, a minor detail: the Sonia Gandhi-led UPA came to power at the Centre for the first time in May 2004.                    
	The life-size statues/busts, of Gandhi either meditating or taking a stride, have been installed in cities like Milan, Naples and Turin, a park in Genoa and a school in Narni.        
	Technically, Germany leads Italy in the number of statues the ICCR has sent to a particular country. But one that went to Germany was for non-permanent installation for the duration of the Asia Pacific Week Festival in Berlin in 2003. Which means Germany and Italy are tied at the top of the heap.        
	ICCR pays for making of the busts/statues by select sculptors and their transportation to the missions who have requested them, Krishna said.        
	America need not fret too much, though. Canada, which has that morally superior air about it when it comes to the US, and South Africa, where the Mahatma began his life of crusade, have both settled for five statues each  the same number as America.        
	In South Africa, where Gandhi spent over 20 years, statues have been installed in a hospital named after him in Durban and at a university in Cape Town.        
	Statues have also been installed in schools and universities in Morocco, Ivory Coast, Fiji, Kazakhstan, France, Australia, in the Library of the Russian State Federation, in parks and squares named after him in Djibouti, and in town halls and city councils. One notable exception is Pakistan.        
	Calcutta-based Gautam Pal has sculpted some of the statues. A few busts are the works of Ram Sutar, Ratnabali Kant and Ramesh Bisht.

          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Dec. 9: The rains may have failed this monsoon, but the winter showers are more than making up for the dry spell so far.         
	The first nine days of December have been the wettest Jharkhand has witnessed in the last five years. While the state capital has been drenched by almost 30mm of rain this month, Jamshedpur has recorded 42mm.         
	The unusual winter rain across the state is the fallout of a deep depression along the Andhra Pradesh coast. On December 22, 2005, another depression over the state had poured 64.5mm of rain on Jamshedpur, 3mm on Ranchi and 5.2mm on Daltonganj.        
	The next three Decembers were, however, dry. In 2009 again, Ranchi recorded 9.6mm of rainfall, while Jamshedpur received 6.4mm in December.         
	The heaviest showers this month have been over the last 24 hours. The state capital received close to 20mm rain, Daltonganj experienced 17mm, while Jamshedpur once again bore the brunt with 34.5mm of rainfall.        
	And the forecast is not very bright with more wet weather expected over the next 24 hours. The rainfall is due to the impact of the deep depression which is gradually weakening. Its impact will be felt for another 24 hours with most parts of the state witnessing inclement weather and overcast sky, said a senior official of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore in Calcutta.        
	Weathermen at the Patna Meteorological Office, which keeps a tab on Jharkhands weather conditions, also confirmed that dry weather would only prevail after another 24 hours.         
	With wet weather all around, the chill cant be too far away. Met officials have warned of an abrupt fall in minimum temperatures in the next 36 hours. The chart analysis suggests that the cloud cover over most parts of the state is set to clear. The wind pattern will also change and night temperatures could drop by four to five degrees, said A. Kujur of the Patna Met office.         
	Last year, the minimum temperature hovered between 13 and 15 Celsius in most parts of the state, while the maximum remained within 28 and 30 Celsius.

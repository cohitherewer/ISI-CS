          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                
	Mumbai, Nov. 6: How do you make Michelle Obama hop and dance with joy? Just ask her easy questions like Whats the capital of America?        
	The US First Lady made a group of poor childrens day here this evening, playing hopscotch with them and swaying to a Bollywood number.        
	If the poll-scarred Barack Obama, away at Hotel Trident to talk business, was worrying how to match predecessor Bill Clinton in winning Indian hearts, his wife did it for him.        
	The venue was the Mumbai University library on the heritage Fort campus where Michelle, wearing a coffee-coloured top and a multi-coloured skirt, arrived to meet 23 poor children and 18 volunteers from four NGOs.        
	 I love dancing, she told the children, perhaps remembering how Clinton had charmed women at a Rajasthan village with an impromptu jig a decade ago.        
	Someone started playing the title track of Rang De Basanti, composed by A.R. Rahman. Michelle, joined by the children, began shaking a leg to the number sung by Daler Mehndi.        
	She chatted easily during the half-hour interaction. A girl said meeting Michelle had made her dreams come true. No. You are my dream, the American mother of two said. We are very proud of you.        
	She added: President Obama is trying to make this world better so that kids like you can get better opportunities.        
	Soon, they began a game of hopscotch, in which the players hop across a court, advancing a square each time after answering a question correctly.                  Michelle embraced me and the President invited me to meet them in the White House. Ushaben Gokani: The Mahatmas granddaughter who is the chairperson of Gandhi Smarak Nidhi. After the Obamas visit to Mani Bhavan       
	We asked her to spell Washington, DC and asked her whats the capital of America? said one of the children. The First Lady also spelt happiness and correctly named the Father of India  she had just visited the Gandhi Museum at Mani Bhavan. Her audience clapped and cheered.        
	Michelle, though, advised the children that all lifes questions would not be easy, and that education was the key to success.        
	She said the children could rise (in life) just as she had with the power of education. She said her journey had not been an easy one, but she could do justice to all her responsibilities as the First Lady only because of her education, said Vikas Hotwani, a volunteer for one of the NGOs, Making A Difference or MAD.        
	Michelle gifted the children stationery, an autographed bag carrying a White House picture, and toys, one of which was a stuffed canine resembling the Obama family dog. She autographed the childrens T-shirts and hands.        
	Dancing with her was the best part. I have taken her autograph; she was very nice, said Sagar Jadhav, 12.        
	I have learnt from her that education is important in life, said Johny David, 13, who danced with Michelle and played drums.

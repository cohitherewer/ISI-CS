	New Delhi, Nov 8 (PTI): The US today joined hands with India to set up a Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership for research and development of secure and proliferation resistant reactor systems.
    India had announced at the Nuclear Security Summit in April in Washington to set up the Centre as part of its efforts to promote non-proliferation.
    A Memorandum of Understanding for coooperation in building the Centre was signed by Srikumar Banerjee, Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy and Timothy Roemer, the US Ambassador to India, on the sidelines of the talks President Barack Obama held with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh here.
    "The Centre will facilitate deliberation and discussions of international experts on various issues including innovation in nuclear reactors and the nuclear fuel cycle, development of proliferation-resistant reactors, security technologies and the effects of radiation exposure," Banerjee told PTI here.

  - Scam-struck Delhi devises arsenal        SANJAY K. JHA                                                     
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The government will shortly set up an anti-corruption mechanism in the backdrop of scandals in which the Opposition has targeted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. As legislative measures will be required to introduce certain provisions, it can even pilot an ordinance.        
	Sources said the Prime Minister was giving serious thought to this mechanism with a blueprint having already been prepared, incorporating the suggestions given by Congress president Sonia Gandhi at the party plenary on December 19.         
	The Prime Minister had publicly promised to pursue the suggestions given by Sonia.         
	The sources said Singh was perturbed by the BJPs persistent attacks on him despite his repeated assertions that he had nothing to hide and that every scandal was being investigated thoroughly. His exceptional offer to appear before the public accounts committee was also rejected by the Opposition, which has been insisting on a joint parliamentary committee to probe the alleged telecom scam.         
	Apparently, the government has received the feedback that public perception is beginning to change and the Prime Minister has decided to exploit this to the hilt by introducing a new anti-corruption mechanism. The issue may be discussed at the next cabinet meeting as the government would like to start the New Year without the negativity that engulfed it in the latter half of 2010.         
	Although the provisions of the mechanism are not known, Sonias suggestions (see chart) cast light on the path the government could follow. Other than the specific institutional suggestions, she had pressed for avoidance of vulgar display of wealth. But this cannot be legislated.         
	After making the suggestions in her inaugural speech, Sonia had followed it up in her closing remarks, saying: We will take the issue of corruption head on and demonstrate, through actions, and not words, that we mean what we say. I had made specific suggestions in this regard and the Prime Minister has assured us they will be taken forward.        
	Congress sources said Sonia would not have repeated the commitment in such unambiguous terms had there been no understanding with the Prime Minister.         
	Singh, too, said in his speech at the plenary: If there are any shortcomings in the functioning of our government, we will address them so that we can be more effective in our efforts to contain corruption.        
	Although the Prime Minister made an elaborate presentation on the charges levelled against his government and his record in fighting corruption, he clearly hinted at pending administrative and legislative measures by mentioning shortcomings.         
	With this move, the Congress hopes to win the war of nerves with the Opposition that has broken out over what has come to be known as the loot in the Commonwealth Games and the scandal over allotment of telecom spectrum.        
	The government has been dismissive of the amount of notional loss  up to Rs 1.75 lakh crore  mentioned in the comptroller and auditor generals report, but there is a realisation that some of the decisions taken by the telecom ministry might have denied the exchequer substantial revenue.         
	It is hoping the CBI would complete its investigation into the telecom scam before the start of the budget session of Parliament.

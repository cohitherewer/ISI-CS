          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	Dhaka, July 25: During the Bangladesh war, when Pobontara was 61 and couldnt stand the sound of guns, a canal was dug so she could hide there, huge ears and all, whenever firing erupted.        
	Four decades later, the tears being shed for the countrys oldest and most loved elephant are copious enough to have filled up that canal at Dhaka zoo.        
	When Pobontara died of a cardiac arrest on Thursday afternoon, aged exactly 100, a huge crowd gathered before her enclosure to say a final farewell. There were former zoo officials and her past mahouts, children who so loved to see her trunk raised in salaam and their grandparents who had taken rides on her back decades ago.        
	She was one of a kind, not lesser than a human in any way. Although age had turned her completely blind, she would do a salaam each time I clapped my hands, zoo curator A.B.M. Shahid Ullah said.        
	She had lived through all the ups and downs this country faced the war of independence, the political upheavals. She was part of Bangladeshs culture and an asset to the zoo; she earned the government lakhs in revenue.        
	Pobontara had been brought to the zoo from the Bandarban hill tracks of Chittagong in 1957, the year the zoo opened.        
	Rehman Ali, an elderly Dhaka resident who had sat on her back as a child and enjoyed the tremendous view from up there, was planning to take his granddaughter to the zoo to share the experience during the upcoming holidays. He was left devastated.        
	I cant believe she is no more, Ali said. My granddaughter is so unlucky.        
	The zoo had declared three days of mourning till Sunday, during which there were no fun rides on the other elephants. Special prayers were held at the zoo mosque. Pobontaras two companions, Kusumtara and Kajaltara, appeared mournful, their mahouts said.        
	All the mahouts and all those who knew her cried like babies. Many who had retired from the zoo travelled from faraway places to be with her during her last journey. Today we buried her 15 feet deep under the earth on the zoo premises, the curator said.        
	The 753,000sqm zoo is home to 2,000 animals but Pobontara was special. She was like a family member. I cant bear to look at her empty enclosure, said Mansur, her caretaker of 25 years, his eyes filling with tears.

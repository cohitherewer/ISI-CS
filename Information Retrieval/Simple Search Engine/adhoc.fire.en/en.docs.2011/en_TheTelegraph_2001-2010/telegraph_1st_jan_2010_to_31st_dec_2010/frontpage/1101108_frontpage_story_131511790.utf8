	Panaji, Nov 8 (PTI): Stringent visa norms have forced chartered flight operators from Poland to delay operations to Goa, depriving the state of nearly 1500 tourists, tourism officials said.
    Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) spokesman Ralf D'Souza said Poland was supposed to start their regular operations to Goa from this year onwards but their flights will now be delayed.
    "We were expecting the first chartered fight to arrive by first week of November but due to time-consuming visa formalities they will not begin operations before December 15," D'Souza said.
    The delay will result in cancellation of seven flights from this country, which means we will lose out on 1500 tourists, he said.
    "If things on Indian front does not improve, then these tourists might be diverted to other destinations," D'Souza said, adding, "If not Goa, they will offer them other destination".

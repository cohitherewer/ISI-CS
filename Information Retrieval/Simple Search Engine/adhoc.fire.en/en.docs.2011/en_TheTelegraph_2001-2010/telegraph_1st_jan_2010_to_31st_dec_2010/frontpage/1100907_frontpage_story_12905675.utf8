          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Silchar, Sept. 6: In a move to intensify vigil along the 38km India-Bangladesh border in Cachar district of Assam, district magistrate Harendra Kumar Dev Mahanta has issued a nine-hour night curfew for a period of two months within a 1km radius along the border.        
	The prohibitory order was imposed under Section 144 CrPC on Saturday.        
	The order comes at a time when the BSF has claimed that infiltration of illegal migrants has considerably declined since 2008 in the wake of stepped-up border surveillance. This is ascribed to the BSFs acquisition of latest surveillance gadgets like thermal imagers.         
	According to a BSF document, the paramilitary force has apprehended 155 Bangladeshis without valid visa and passports during the past three years.         
	Under the prohibitory order, no individual will be allowed to move within this restrictive radius between 8pm and 5am.         
	The plying of boats on the Surmaon during the curfew hours is also prohibited.        
	A senior official of the district administration also said nobody would be allowed to move within this radius along the border, mostly unfenced.

          UDDALAK MUKHERJEE                            Rosie Llewellyn-Jones in Calcutta. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	While researching for her book, The Great Uprising in India, 1857-58: Untold Stories, Indian and British, at Delhis National Archives Reading Room, Rosie Llewellyn-Jones came across an old scroll.        
	Despite the frayed edges of the parchment, she could clearly discern on the paper names and addresses of rebels who were being pursued by the British. Suddenly, the nameless mass of people, who had actually fought the battles during this tumultuous period in Indias history, acquired a face. Even after all these years, Llewellyn-Jones remembers how excited she had been with her discovery.        
	The authors enthusiasm for her subject enlivens some of the chapters of her work, which pieces together little-known accounts to reconstruct an unconventional history of the Uprising. For instance, Llewellyn-Jones talks of Indians  merchants and aristocrats  who had fought against the sepoys, renegade Europeans  the mysterious Felix Rotton in Lucknow  who fought for them, the Companys prized agents, who were responsible for confiscating and distributing rebel properties, and so on.        
	These lesser-known voices not only offer a holistic perspective, but also prove that numerous people became unwilling victims of the circumstances. The humanisation of the perpetrators also raises the intriguing possibility that, so far, historians have shown an inclination to idolise or demonise agents of the Uprising.        
	Llewellyn-Jones is aware of the sentiments  British and Indian  surrounding the Uprising. But as a trained historian, she found it not too difficult to remain objective and raise new questions. To call the Uprising a Mutiny would be too simplistic, given the complex network of factors that led to its inception, she says. But it could not have been a War of Independence either, as the idea of India itself is incongruous at that point of time.        
	The criticism by British historians that her book isnt Anglo-centric enough sits lightly on her. I was trying to tell a story in my own way, she says with an amused smile.        
	What also intrigued this expert is the apathy  in India and in her own country  towards the less charismatic individuals who participated in the chain of violent events. The bodies of the 700 brave men who took a last stand at the Begum Kothi Palace in Lucknow were rolled into a ditch unceremoniously after they died. There they lie today, obscured and forgotten, under the busy traffic on the Vidhan Sabha Marg.        
	Indias own indifference to some of these characters can perhaps be explained by the general unwillingness among its people to engage with their own history. But, given historys potential to unearth uncomfortable truths, the effacement of some facts, Llewellyn-Jones argues, could also be wilful. Re-igniting an interest in the subject can only erase this apathy. However, for that to happen, historians would have to shun the comfort of their ivory towers and reach out to people, especially to young minds, says she.        
	Murshidabad is Llewellyn-Joness next stop: she is researching on Wajid Ali Shah and his times. Admirers of her work will be hoping that she will shed new light on yet another old story.

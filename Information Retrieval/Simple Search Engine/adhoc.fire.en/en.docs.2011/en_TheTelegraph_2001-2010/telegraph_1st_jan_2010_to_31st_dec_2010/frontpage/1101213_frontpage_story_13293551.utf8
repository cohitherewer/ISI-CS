The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Stress takes toll of army in Assam 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Stress takes toll of army in Assam 
          RIPUNJOY DAS                                               
	Dibrugarh, Dec. 12: A soldier who killed a colleague at an Assam army base today and another who committed suicide last night have deepened worries about stress overtaking the force in an insurgency zone.        
	A rifleman pumped 11 bullets into another after a brief quarrel at Dinjan in Dibrugarh district around 4.35am in an incident of fragging  an American term for a soldier killing a comrade or a senior  before turning the gun on himself. Hours earlier, a jawan from the 8 Garhwal Rifles had shot himself at Kakopathar in Tinsukia district.         
	A shocked army brass has told all the camps in eastern Assam to keep a close watch on jawans behaviour. Generally, when one such incident occurs, two or three others follow in quick succession, a senior officer explained.        
	Dipesh Bhagawati, professor of psychiatry at the Gauhati Medical College, said the counter-insurgency duties that defence personnel increasingly have to carry out often lead to stress and frustration. The constant threat to their lives, strict leave rules and long separation from their families take an emotional toll.         
	When they become vulnerable, they show aggressive and extreme behaviour. They may then kill themselves or eliminate an immediate senior or a colleague whom they hold responsible for their situation, Bhagawati said.        
	Eyewitnesses at the Dinjan headquarters of the 2 Mountain Division said Balbir Singh of 23 Rajputana Rifles sprayed lance naik Chandrabir Singh of the 19 Mahar Regiment with bullets.        
	Chandrabir, a driver, had just come out of the shower when he and Balbir had a brief quarrel on some issue. Balbir then fired from his Insas rifle, local police officer Binoy Barman said. Balbir kept firing till he had emptied the magazine, injuring several soldiers, before shooting himself.        
	Army sources said depression or fatigue from overwork could be the reason. When a soldiers leave application is rejected, he sometimes loses his cool and behaves dangerously, a source said.        
	In Tinsukia, Mukesh Rayal shot himself around 10.45 last night while on sentry duty, district police chief Diganta Bora said. It is not clear why the jawan from Garhwal killed himself, he said.         
	Atul Sarma, a retired army captain and former director of health services, Assam, said there could be many reasons for fragging, including family problems and discrimination by seniors.        
	Gauhati Medical College principal M.M. Deka said defence personnel must be given enough mental and physical rest and must undergo regular health check-ups. Bhagawati advocated psychological tests too.

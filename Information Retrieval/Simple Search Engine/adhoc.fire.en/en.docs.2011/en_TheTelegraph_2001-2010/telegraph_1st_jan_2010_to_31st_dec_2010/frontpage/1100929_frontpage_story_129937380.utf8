	Mumbai, Sep 29 (PTI) In a major overhaul of the Indian Premier League, the BCCI today dropped cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar from the Twenty20 league's Governing Council, which was reduced to a seven-member panel with a tenure of just one year instead of five.
    The decision to drop Gavaskar from the IPL Governing Council was taken by the Cricket Board in its Annual General Meeting here, which also appointed interim chairman Chirayu Amin as full-time chief of the Twenty20 league.
    "The IPL Governing Council constitution was changed today at the AGM. The period of the Governing Council, which is a sub-committee, of the Board has been reduced to one year from five years," BCCI president Shashank Manohar told reporters at a press conference after the AGM.
    "It will have five members and two cricketers will be part of the committee.

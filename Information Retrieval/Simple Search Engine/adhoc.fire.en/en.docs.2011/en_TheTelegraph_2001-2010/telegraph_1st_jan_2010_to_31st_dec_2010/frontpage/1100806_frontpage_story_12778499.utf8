                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Joust over 26/11 Pak deposition
          OUR BUREAU                          Krishna, Chidambaram                          
	Aug. 5: The ministries of home and external affairs have renewed their skirmish over Pakistan, exposing a fractured approach to making headway in normalising ties with the neighbour.        
	On the eve of the Friday deadline set by Islamabad for co-operating in Pakistani court trials of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, sources in the home ministry suddenly let slip that India was ready to allow a police investigator in the case to depose before judges there either through video conferencing or by travelling across the border.         
	A Pakistan anti-terror court had sought a commitment by Friday that Indian officers who had recorded Ajmal Amir Kasabs statement would make a deposition to the court, home ministry sources said.        
	The revelation took the ministry of external affairs (MEA) by nasty surprise and elicited insinuations of a deliberate leak to embarrass the foreign office. Sources in the MEA said they knew nothing at all of any move much less a decision to make the 26/11 investigating officer available to the Pakistani courts.        
	We have absolutely no inkling of this, you have to ask the home ministry when, how and on whose concurrence such a decision was taken, a source said.        
	Although the home ministry is nodal to the 26/11 probe, any move to present an Indian police officer before Pakistani courts would necessarily have to be routed through the MEA. Indeed, sources suggested that its a decision of such import that it would have to be cleared at the highest level, meaning the offices of the Prime Minister and the national security adviser.        
	South and North Block -- headquarters to the MEA and the home ministry, respectively -- have been locked in an extended and public spat ever since S.M. Krishna made it known he thought home secretary G.K. Pillais remarks on the ISIs involvement in the Mumbai attack played spoiler in his mid-July talks with Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi.         
	Qureshi had openly attacked Pillai at a joint news conference in Islamabad and Krishna had pointedly chosen not to defend the Indian home secretary. Since then, the two bureaucracies have been at odds.        
	Krishna repeated his criticism of Pillai in the Rajya Sabha today, saying: The home secretary may be a seasoned, experienced and consummate civil servant... I still maintain that as for the timing of that statement, according to my own sources, I think, there has been some mess-up between the news agency and the home secretary.        
	Krishna conceded that whatever Pillai had said was reflection of what David Headley had confessed to the FBI, but he put a rider that again seemed to undermine the home ministry.        
	As a result of that, we have also come to the conclusion that whatever Headley has said to the FBI and to our own interrogators, more or less, matches with what the home secretary has conveyed, Krishna said, implying his ministry had no knowledge of the correlation between the Headley investigation and Pillais statement when the latter made his first statement on the issue.         
	Reacting to todays suggestion from North Block that India was ready to send an investigating officer to Pakistani courts, an MEA official said: This might be their way of saying they are ready to co-operate with Pakistani requests, it is the MEA which is playing spoilsport. That is not the case, and that is surely not the way to conduct such delicate ties as we have with Pakistan.        
	A demand for sending the magistrate conducting the 26/11 trial in Mumbai had come up during talks between home minister P. Chidambaram and his Pakistani counterpart Rehman Malik during the formers June visit to Islamabad. India is categorically unwilling to send the magistrate, but has not rejected Islamabads plea on sending a police investigator.        
	In this case, it would probably be senior inspector Ramesh Mahale of the Mumbai police who is the principal investigating officer in the 26/11 case. Mahale is also among those who took the confessional statement of Ajmal Kasab and initialled the chargesheet in the case.         
	But top police officials in Mumbai told The Telegraph they were unaware of any request from the home ministry on presenting the 26/11 investigating officer to Pakistani courts. We have not received any communication from Delhi yet. But if the home ministry wants to send an investigating officer to Pakistan, we would be willing to send one, a senior officer in the Maharashtra home department said.         
	Home ministry sources in Delhi said they were still exploring the possibility of a video conference between Pakistani judges and the Mumbai police investigating officer. In case that is not permissible in the Pakistani legal system, the IO (investigating officer) can always go, of course, after ensuring safe passage et cetera, a source said.         
	Since November 2008, New Delhi has sent reams of paper and computer diskettes containing evidence of the involvement of Pakistan-based elements in the Mumbai attacks, evidence that Islamabad has consistently rebuffed as not sufficient.        
	Islamabads demand than an Indian magistrate or police officer depose before its courts was repeated during talks between Krishna and Qureshi in mid-July. Earlier this week, home ministry sources suggested, a written communication regarding the demand was received by the ministry of external affairs. The MEA did not confirm this.

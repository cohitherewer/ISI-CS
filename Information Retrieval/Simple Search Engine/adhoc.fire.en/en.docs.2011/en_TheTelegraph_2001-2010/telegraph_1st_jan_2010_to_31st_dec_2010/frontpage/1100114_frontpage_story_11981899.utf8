          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: A Meghalaya police constable was found hanging in the mess of his battalion at Vikaspuri in west Delhi today.         
	Kursom Sangma, 32, from West Garo Hills, is believed to have committed suicide, though the reasons were still not known.         
	Sources said his death could be related to the escape of three Pakistani terrorists awaiting deportation from the Lampur detention home in Outer Delhi on January 1.         
	Sangma was deployed at the home when the three terrorists fled from the custody of another Meghalaya police, sub-inspector D.M. Singh, who was escorting them to a hospital for a medical check-up. Singh was suspended for dereliction of duty and a departmental inquiry initiated against him.         
	I dont know if there is any connection between Sangma and the three Pakistan terrorists who fled. He hasnt left a suicide note so we cannot ascertain the reason behind the suicide. I can only say that he was working at the home when the terrorists escaped and was moved to the arms repository unit later. I dont have any knowledge about him being interrogated in that matter, deputy commissioner of police (West) Sharad Aggarwal said.         
	Sources claimed that a CRPF battalion, comprising 21 policemen, had replaced the Meghalaya police IRB after the alleged lapse. Sangmas brother is also working with Meghalaya police.

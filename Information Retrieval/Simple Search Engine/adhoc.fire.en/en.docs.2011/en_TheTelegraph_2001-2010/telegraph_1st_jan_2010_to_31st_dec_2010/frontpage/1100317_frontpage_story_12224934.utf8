The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Centre to consider ANVC demands 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Centre to consider ANVC demands 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, March 16: The Centre has decided to examine the Achik National Volunteers Councils demand for an autonomous body like a Garoland Territorial Council.         
	The demand came up during the first political-level talks with the Centres interlocutor, P.C. Haldar, and joint secretary, home, in charge of the Northeast, Naveen Verma, in Shillong today.         
	Haldar told reporters after the meeting that ANVCs demands would be further discussed in the days to come.         
	This was our first meeting and there will be series of meetings before arriving at any decision, he said.         
	According to Haldar, as the ceasefire expires on March 31, the joint monitoring committee will meet shortly to discuss the matters related to the extension of truce.         
	On ANVCs demand for a development package for the entire Garo Hills, Haldar said that, too, would be discussed.         
	ANVC spokesperson Torik Jangning Marak said they would not go back on their demand for an autonomous body like the Garoland Territorial Council.         
	We had earlier demanded a separate state for the Garos. Now we have come down from that demand but want to insist on an autonomous status for Garo Hills, Marak said.         
	The ANVC has agreed to a periodical ceasefire as opposed to an indefinite one, as suggested by the Centre.         
	The outfit had earlier threatened to pull out of the truce after the Centre insisted on a periodic ceasefire agreement.        
	Todays meeting also dwelt on charges that ANVC rebels were involved in extortion and had been venturing out of their camps.         
	The outfit denied both allegations.         
	We are not all engaged in extortion in the Garo Hills, Marak said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PC wants limited mandate revisited
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                PC wants limited mandate revisited
          OUR BUREAU                             Chidambaram                                  
	New Delhi, May 17: Todays Maoist assault turned to ammunition in the hands of Union home minister P. Chidambaram, who lost no time seeking an expansion of his mandate to include, among other measures, air power support for security forces.        
	Signs are that the security campaign against Maoists will turn more aggressive, at least in the immediate.        
	Initially stunned by the reverse, both the government and the Congress appeared to respond with renewed resolve to fight off and resolutely defeat acts of terror against innocent people and against the state.        
	Chidambaram, who was in a pre-scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh when news of the Dantewada bus blast broke, told NDTV in an interview that he had requested the Prime Minister to revisit the limited mandate he had been given to meet the Maoist challenge.        
	A meeting of the cabinet committee on security (CCS) is being called soon to discuss a revision of strategy and the home ministry is hopeful it will get a larger mandate that includes a go-ahead to employ air support.         
	Chidambaram said he had the support of all chief ministers on the use of air power and even claimed the chief ministers of Bengal, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh had actively sought it in the past.        
	The home minister, whose security drive has been under attack from sections within his party, also fired tangentially at critics, telling the TV channel: We have a two-pronged strategy (on tackling the Maoists) both the Prime Minister and Congress president Sonia Gandhi are very clear on this. But I concede that some discussion in recent weeks may have weakened one of the two prongs. He also said civil society groups had a lot to answer for todays attack.        
	Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh and Rajya Sabha member Mani Shankar Aiyar are among those who can be said to have weakened one of the two prongs of the governments strategy with their open, and repeated, criticism of what they have often called the home ministers one-eyed policy.         
	The sceptics feel the policy is too heavily accented on the security offensive and too little on development and socio-economic measures to address problems in the backward areas where Maoists have gained the upper hand.        
	Chidambaram  and his senior-most official G.K. Pillai  sought to project todays blast as an illustration of the Maoists being ruthless, indiscriminate killers whom the state needs to neutralise.        
	Naxalites dont discriminate, only kill, a sombre Chidambaram told the channel.         
	Briefing journalists around the same time, home secretary Pillai said: The killing of civilians has been a hallmark of Naxalite violence over the years. They are known to have conducted condemnable killings of civilians even in the past. They have killed CPM workers and alleged police informers. Even if they were police informers, what is their crime? How can they kill people just because they are CPM workers?         
	Justifying Chidambarams policy, the home secretary said the security grid was helping villages in Maoist-affected areas.        
	After the deployment of the BSF in Kanker district of Chhattisgarh, for instance, ration shops had reopened in villages and a tribal festival in Parthapur was held after 15 years, he said.        
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi tried to allay the sense that there was a division in the party on acting against Maoists. Our resolve to root out such despicable acts is firm and unwavering. We also want all stake holders of the civil society to remain united in this fight, Singhvi said.        
	Another party spokesperson, Manish Tiwari, said todays incident had exposed the barbarity of the Maoists who take a leaf out of Pol Pots book.        
	Asked about the duality of the partys approach, another senior Congress leader referred to the party presidents article in the latest issue of Congress organ Sandesh and said: Sonia Gandhi wrote that acts of terror must be dealt with decisively and forcefully when she talked of targeted development in backward districts.        
	Civil society groups feared the worst from the consequences of what is an exploding confrontation in south Chhattisgarh. Kavita Srivastava of the PUCL condemned todays attack but alleged that through its policies, the government was handing over entire populations to the Maoists.

          A STAFF REPORTER                       Arjun Atwal with the silver salver during the felicitation at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Thursday. (Santosh Ghosh)                                 
	Calcutta, Nov. 18: Arjun Atwal, the first Indian to win a US PGA Tour title, was felicitated by his club  the Royal Calcutta Golf Club  on Thursday.         
	The golfers close friend Gaurav Ghosh said: Golf may be an individual sport but Atwal is always there to help out Calcutta golfers. I remember how he helped SSP (Chowrasia) when he became eligible for the European circuit. He helped SSP to get a sports management company and that made sure SSP was in good hands.        
	Arjun fielded questions from members of the Royal as well as the media. Excerpts:        
	Q: Arjun Atwal is an achiever. But there are many on the Tour who are just happy being a journeyman. What is that one thing which separates a journeyman from an achiever?         
	Atwal: Hard work. The other day, I was talking to a bunch of young athletes in Jamshedpur. Someone asked me the same question. I told them the secret to being an achiever is hard work. That doesnt mean you work hard from morning to night. You work hard smartly. I mean you work hard for seven months and see no improvement. Then you have to realise somewhere something is going wrong. You have to change your style. You have to be smart enough to understand which way you are going.         
	Q: Something about your friend Tiger Woods. Whats so special about Tiger?         
	Atwal: Tiger is a different animal altogether. When I play in my top form I can beat anyone in this world. But against Tiger, its a different ball game altogether. He has this ability to beat anyone. I am not saying hes superhuman but he is born with this ability to beat anyone. He is very much aware of himself. I do yoga which helped me to be aware of myself. Tiger is born with that awareness. An amazing guy, I must say.         
	Q: But then 2010 hasnt been a good year for him. Do you think its possible for him to make a comeback?         
	Atwal: Why not? Mentally, he has changed a lot in the last two months. Post-divorce, he is a different person. He has had a couple of top 10 finishes and slowly he is getting back to the groove. I can bet 2011 will be his year.         
	Q: Is Tiger the most dominant player ever in an individual sport?         
	Atwal: No. I think Jack Nicklaus and Roger Federer. They are the two most dominant players ever in individual sport. But Tiger can be the most dominant player. Nicklaus has won 18 Majors. Tiger can be the most dominant player if he manages to win 18 or more.         
	Q: Coming back to you, when will we see Arjun Atwal winning a Major?         
	Atwal: Majors are very tough to win. Because of the pressure and the hype built around them. Sometimes that pressure of delivering takes a toll on a player. I have spoken to some Major winners. They told me they treat Majors just like any other PGA tournament. If you can do that, then you have a very good chance of winning a Major.                           
	Q: Golf is a very lonely game. How do you keep yourself motivated?         
	Atwal: My wife Sona keeps me motivated. She has been with me through thick and thin. I had a very lean phase. Got involved in a car accident from where I got a clean chit later on, and then my shoulder injury. I was really down that time. Sona has been with me throughout. She is my strength.         
	Q: Your coach Dale Lynch played a big role        
	Atwal: Surely. He brought in the consistency in my game. I wasnt winning many but was performing consistently ever since I became associated with Lynch. Consistency is very important in golf. When you become consistent, then only you start winning.         
	Q: Jeev Milkha, Jyoti Randhawa and you. Do you guys discuss golf while playing in the same tournament?         
	Atwal: Never. We are different persons with different circle of friends. We may have lunch together but no discussion on golf. You dont discuss golf or something about the course with a competitor, do you? But one thing, together we are trying to change the idea of golf in the country in our very own ways. Golf is not a very popular sport in India. But our success can make it a game kids will like to prefer as a career.         
	Q: You message to the kids who want to make it big in golf         
	Atwal: Believe in yourself. I think its more about the individual than the infrastructure.         
	Q: How do you plan to give back to this game?         
	Atwal: Once I am done with as a pro, I will teach kids the nuances of the game. Allow them play for free. Thats very important.         
	Q: Your take on Lee Westwood         
	Atwal: Oh! He is the new No.1. Removed Tiger from the perch. But frankly, I never understand anything about the rankings. No golfer will be able to tell you how it works. Very Frankly.         
	Q: Your next target         
	Atwal: I will be playing the Indian Open in New Delhi in a couple of weeks time (from December 25). I will try to win that.         
	Q: Do you remember your first trip to the Royal?         
	A: Yeah. I think I was 13 or 14 years. My father brought me to the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC). I met this caddie called Paltu who showed me around the range. I hit a few shots and got hooked into the game. Rest as they say is history.

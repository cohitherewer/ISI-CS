The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Raju gets bail, Satyam all out
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Raju gets bail, Satyam all out
  - Long trial helps, CBI to file appeal         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Ramalinga Raju                                        
	Hyderabad, Aug. 18: Byraju Ramalinga Raju, the man behind the biggest corporate fraud in India, has obtained bail, a little over 18 months after he confessed that he had padded profits, fudged bank balances and created an army of ghost employees at Satyam Computer Services.        
	Andhra Pradesh High Court today granted bail to the 54-year-old Raju, who is undergoing treatment for a liver infection in a hospital. A similar plea had been turned down by the Supreme Court in March.         
	With Rajus release, all nine accused in the Satyam fraud case have now been released on bail.        
	 The CBI said it would contest the bail for Raju in the Supreme Court. The counsel for the CBI, additional solicitor-general Harin P. Raval, had argued against the grant of bail on the ground that Raju would be able to influence the 250 witnesses  mostly former employees of Satyam  whom the prosecution planned to examine.        
	Judge Elango clarified that he was not considering bail just on health grounds, though it is one of the main reasons. He concurred with the defence counsel that it might take longer than six months  the time cited by the CBI  for the trial to be completed.        
	The court noted that mere long detention of the petitioners cannot be a ground to consider their bail applications, but at the same time, coupled with the fact that there is no possibility of completion of trial in the near future, the petitioners can be considered for grant of bail.        
	The delay in proceedings had prompted the counsel for the CBI and Raju to bicker. The case is up for trial before an additional chief metropolitan magistrate.        
	The proceedings have been stalled as Raju has not appeared in court. The court eventually sent a questionnaire to the hospital to which Raju has not replied yet.         
	Rajus senior counsel said the trial could drag on for six years with the CBI unlikely to receive responses to the letters rogatory, sent to six countries such as the US and the UK, for another two years.        
	The high court judge directed Raju to deposit his passport and ordered him not to leave Hyderabad without the courts permission. He was asked to furnish two sureties of Rs 20 lakh each.        
	The CBI plans to file a special leave petition before the Supreme Court tomorrow to contest the bail. We will go in appeal once we have a copy of the high courts order, said CBI deputy inspector general V.V. Lakshmi Narayana. We will also press ahead with our petition seeking the appointment of a special team of doctors to look into Rajus health. He has been avoiding court proceedings on health grounds.        
	Lawyers representing Raju have been arguing his case for a bail after an independent medical report confirmed that the mastermind of the multi-crore scam was suffering from hepatitis C  an infectious disease affecting the liver -- and would not be able to attend courts for questioning.        
	Raju has been undergoing treatment at the state-owned Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) here since September 2009. Before that, he was incarcerated at the Chanchalguda prison for about nine months.         
	Doctors treating Raju told reporters after todays court order that he would need treatment for another 16 to 17 weeks and was not likely to be discharged from hospital for another four months. He has already taken 30 injections to treat the condition, the doctors added. The family will now decide whether to continue with his treatment at NIMS or shift him to a private hospital.        
	Ajit Kumar, the head of gastroenterology at NIMS, had told the court last month that there was serious risk to Rajus life if he was forced to appear in court. He may suffer internal bleeding and a heart attack, he had said.         
	On January 7, last year, Raju had stunned investors, clients and regulators when he confessed that he was responsible for a Rs 7,800 crore accounting fraud at what was then the countrys fourth biggest software exporter. Last November, the CBI bumped up that figure to Rs 14,000 crore.        
	With Rajus release, all nine accused in the Satyam fraud case have now been released on bail. Last month, the court released five of the accused, including Ramalinga Rajus brother B. Rama Raju and Satyams former chief financial officer Vadlamani Srinivasan.        
	Two former auditors with PricewaterhouseCoopers -- Srinivas Talluri and S. Gopalakrishnan  were granted bail in February and June respectively. Another brother  B. Satyanarayana Raju  had obtained anticipatory bail last year.        
	The CBI has already filed three charge sheets in the Satyam case and intends to file another relating to diversion of money abroad. The agency has already sent out letters rogatory to the authorities in six countries  the US, the UK, Belgium, Mauritius, Singapore, and the British Virgin Islands  seeking information on his bank accounts.        
	Interestingly, a US district court has granted Raju and his brother Rama Raju pauper status in US litigation, which means they will not have to pay filing fees and other court costs linked to the litigation there because of their financial condition.        
	Investors in the US, who had bought American depositary rights floated by Satyam in 2001, had filed class action suits against the Raju brothers in several courts there. All these cases have since been consolidated before US District Judge Barbara Jones in New York.         
	Officials at Mahindra Satyam  the company formed after the sale of the software giant to Tech Mahindra Ltd  said the restatement of Satyams accounts were expected by the end of September.        
	The ministry of corporate affairs had appointed KPMG last year to restate the Satyam accounts. It has already missed two deadlines in March and June.         
	Vineet Nayyar, CEO of Mahindra Satyam, said today that the bail granted to Raju would not alter the situation or compromise the investigation into the fraud.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Brown looks to Tata
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Brown looks to Tata
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Jan. 2: Gordon Brown has given an assurance to three members of parliament that he will telephone Ratan Tata directly as last ditch attempts are made to stop Tata-owned Corus steel plants in Teeside from being mothballed at the end of January with the loss of 1,700 jobs.        
	One of those MPs is Dr Ashok Kumar, a former British Steel scientist who is now the Labour member of parliament for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland.        
	Many of my constituents work at the Redcar plants in Teeside, Kumar told The Telegraph today.        
	 As a graduate trainee I worked at Redcar and later for 14 years, when I was with British Steel, I had a lot to do with the steel plants in Teeside, he added, explaining my deep emotional attachment to the threatened plants.        
	The Corus and Tata Steel boards had taken the hard decision to mothball the complex on Teeside after a year of agonising over whether it could be kept alive. The blame has been pinned on an international consortium which pulled out of a 10-year agreement to buy the steel slabs made at Teeside.        
	But the wider effect on the community, where steel has been the biggest employer, will be catastrophic, local politicians such as Kumar have emphasised.        
	Along with two other Labour MPs from the area, Solicitor General Vera Baird, whose constituency of Redcar includes the complex, and Dari Taylor, from Stockton South, Kumar met the prime minister for an hour at his home near Edinburgh on December 30.        
	The prime minister said, I have no problems picking up the phone and talking directly to Ratan Tata but first I need to do some sums, said Kumar, who declined to put a figure on the money required to save the jobs.        
	The MP said he had been closely in touch with Tata Steel which had lost 130 million between July and September in keeping Teeside open.        
	Executives of Corus and Tata had been in and out of the offices of Lord Mandelsons Department of Business, Skills and Innovation but felt they had not made any progress and were now fed up. According to Kumar, we now want a steel summit at Downing Street and direct intervention by the Prime Minister.        
	Bairds assessment is similar to Kumars  the Prime Minister has given an undertaking that he will intervene personally in an effort to save the jobs. Brown has agreed to work behind the scenes to try to revive a deal with the international consortium to take over the plant by offering government help.        
	Brown was going to see if there is any way to revive these purchasers by indicating through diplomatic channels that the government will help make that deal.        
	Once he had something positive to suggest, the Prime Minister had indicated that he would speak directly to Ratan Tata.        
	I feel that we are leaving literally no stone unturned if we have the Prime Minister involved personally, said Baird. There was a real sense of urgency, which we welcomed. We have now got to keep going - anything that has to be done, will be done.        
	 Just before Parliament broke up for the Christmas holidays, Kumar was successful in getting an emergency debate on the Teeside closure.        
	Steelmaking has been central to our economy since the mid-Victorian age, and has evolved over the decades to the position that it is now in, Kumar told the Commons. The main works line the River Tees and the core of those works is found in the Teesside Cast Products iron and steel-making complex, whose mothballing has been announced.        
	He estimated that apart from the 1,700 steelworkers who would be made unemployed, another 8,000 people down the supply chain will lose their livelihoods.        
	Kumar also told parliament: I have made every effort and used all my links with Tata to find possible solutions. In the many conversations that I have had with the members of the Tata board, it has been clear that they feel that the (UK) government have not done enough to help the industry; they had lost confidence in the (UK) governments support for steel.        
	The problem for Brown, who will probably call a general election in May, is that Corus has slipped down his list of priorities. He has called a summit over Yemen as he faces Muslim unrest both inside and outside Britain.        
	He has ordered additional security measures to be taken at airports following attempts by a Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, who was a student at University College London, to blow up an American airliner on Christmas Day.

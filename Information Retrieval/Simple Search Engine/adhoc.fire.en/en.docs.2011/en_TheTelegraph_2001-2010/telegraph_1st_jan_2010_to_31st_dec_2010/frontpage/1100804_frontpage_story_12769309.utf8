	Srinagar, Aug. 3: Thousands of freedom-chanting protesters, including women and children, broke curfew to march in Srinagar today, the defiance sparked by the killing of a teenage protester by troops enforcing the curbs.        
	Anees Ahmad was among the five youths who lost their lives in firing by the security forces. Sahil Ahmad, 22, also succumbed to his injuries tonight, as did another youth who had suffered bullet wounds on Sunday.        
	The deaths took to 27 the civilian casualties in the past five days and to 44 since the present unrest began on June 11.         
	Anees was part of a group of youths who had defied curfew in the Narwara area, near Eidgah, prompting the firing. Thousands joined his funeral procession towards Jamia Masjid  Srinagars main mosque which has been closed for the past several weeks to prevent people from gathering.        
	The Omar Abdullah government has been trying to prevent big gatherings but appeared helpless today when waves of people hit the curfew-bound streets to protest the death of Anees.         
	The troops watched helplessly. A large number of women and children joined the protests as Anees was later laid to rest near Eidgah. Even after the burial, many sat on streets in their localities chanting pro-freedom slogans.        
	Syed Ali Shah Geelani had called an Eidgah Chalo march, prompting authorities to enforce the curfew strictly. But the Hurriyat hardliner, released recently and in hospital, was arrested before he could step out.        
	Earlier in the day, another youth, Mehraj-ud-din was killed in Srinagars Qamarwari area. He was part of a group of marchers stopped by the forces who opened fire after the protesters did not retreat.        
	Mehraj was brought dead to the hospital while Anees succumbed to his wounds here, Dr Waseem Qureshi, superintendent of Shri Mahraja Hari Singh Hospital, said, adding another youth injured brought this afternoon was critical.        
	The fourth casualty took place at Frisal in Kulgam where a mob allegedly set a police post on fire.         
	Houses of cops were set on fire by the ramping mobs. As they did not relent, security forces had to open fire in self-defence in which one person was killed and a few others were injured, said a police spokesperson.         
	Another youth, Riyaz Ahmad, who was injured in the firing at Khrew on Sunday, died in a Srinagar hospital today. Riyaz had been hit when a mob had set fire to a storehouse at Khrew police station, 20km from the state capital, not knowing that explosives were kept inside. The explosion that followed had killed five on the spot.        
	As the violence continued, the Centre rushed 24 more companies of paramilitary forces  around 2,400 personnel  including three of the anti-riot Rapid Action Force.         
	CRPF spokesperson Prabhakar Tripathi said 21 companies had already reached Kashmir and three companies were on their way. They will reach anytime. We are here to help maintain law and order but it is the local police that decides our deployment, Tripathi said.         
	The government, which had sought more forces yesterday, is facing an acute shortage of personnel, partly because the violence has spread to all the 10 districts in the Valley and many battalions are guarding the ongoing Amarnath yatra.         
	Official sources said 15 of the companies sent today had come from Jammu, and the rest from other states.         
	We already have some 70 battalions of the CRPF in the state (which includes Jammu), most of which are present in Kashmir (the Valley). Given the scale of violence, we still need more men, an official said.        
	Sources said some 35,000 police and CRPF personnel are deployed in Srinagar alone. We will have adequate men only after the Amarnath yatra ends on August 25, a CRPF officer said.

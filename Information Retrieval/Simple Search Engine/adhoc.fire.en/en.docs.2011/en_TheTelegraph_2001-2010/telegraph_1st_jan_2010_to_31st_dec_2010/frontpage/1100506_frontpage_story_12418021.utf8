										      SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, May 5: No person can be forced to undergo lie-detector tests, the Supreme Court ruled today, clearing the air on a grey area police were often accused of exploiting and protecting mental privacy as well as the right against self-incrimination.        
	The court described the controversial processes  known variously as lie or truth tests  cruel, inhuman and degrading, putting individual liberty ahead of new-age security compulsions that have prompted law-enforcement agencies to seek powers to use investigative techniques such as narco-analysis, brain mapping and lie-detector tests.        
	Forcible interference with a persons mental processes is not provided for under any statute and it most certainly comes into conflict with the right against self-incrimination, the court said.         
	Forcible tests are illegal even now but it had rarely been spelt out as explicitly as the court did today.                  
	Besides, the police often cite in lower courts a section (161 of the CrPC) that allows medical examination to wangle permission to conduct lie tests. The section was originally decreed to allow DNA tests, blood tests, blood-profiling and semen swabs in case of sexual offences.         
	A three-judge bench, headed by outgoing Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, dubbed any involuntary narco-analysis, brain mapping or lie-detector tests an unjustified intrusion into the mental privacy of an individual and an affront to human dignity.         
	These tests also violate Article 20(3) of the Constitution, which protects a person from incriminating himself, the top court said. Denial of the right against self-incrimination would vitiate fair trial, the court said.         
	The court gave three reasons for not permitting such tests against a persons wishes. One, the claim that results obtained from these techniques will help in extraordinary situations was questionable, it said.         
	Two, if the court were to permit forcible use of these techniques, it could be the first step on a very slippery slope as far as standards of police behaviour were concerned. Discounting arguments that the tests may reduce the high incidence of third-degree methods, the court said that one form of improper behaviour could not replace another.        
	Three, the claim that the use of these techniques will be restricted to heinous offences rings hollow, the court said, since there was no basis for restricting it once investigators were given the discretion to do so.         
	No individual should be forcibly subjected to any of the techniques. Doing so would amount to an unwarranted intrusion into personal liberty, it said.         
	However, the court left room for voluntary tests provided certain minimum standards were adhered to. The conditions include consent secured before a magistrate, presence of a lawyer during the test and conduct of the test by an independent agency. The court clarified that even in this case, the outcome would not be admissible as evidence.         
	However, any information subsequently discovered with the help of voluntary tests can be admitted, it said.         
	The court admitted the possibility of hardened criminals benefiting from the judgment, but justified it on the ground that it was duty-bound to protect the liberties of individuals from encroachment by the state.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sonia showers rich praise     PM to skip   last farewell
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      A mourner waits outside AMRI for a glimpse of Basu after his death was announced. Pabitra Das				                                             
	New Delhi, Jan. 17: If some eyebrows were raised by the decision of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh not to be present at the final farewell to Jyoti Basu on Tuesday, the UPA moved swiftly to rubbish them, clarifying there was nothing political or personal to his absence.        
	They cited not merely Prime Minister Singhs visit to Basus hospital bedside last week  a board of expert doctors was set up for Basus treatment during the trip  but also Sonias rich and elaborate tribute to the departed communist patriarch to rebuff speculation of anything other than pragmatism having motivated their decision.        
	They hinted that the funeral was likely to be more a party affair than a formal funeral.        
	The Prime Minister himself paid rich tributes to Basu in a message today, stating he had often relied on the senior communist for advice.        
	There is no formal word yet on Sonia Gandhis plans; top party sources did not rule out the possibility that she may decide to attend the last rites.        
	She held him in singular regard, as is clear from her tribute, said one Congress leader, and she could well decide to go; such decisions are taken by her at a very personal level.         
	Top Congress leaders led by veteran Pranab Mukherjee, who will represent the central government in Calcutta on Tuesday also flagged the fact that Basu was the architect of the first UPA government in the summer of 2004.        
	They said that if there was one politician in India whose rapport with Sonia transcended political barriers, it was Jyoti Basu. The reason is more personal than political; Basu was the first and the most powerful non-Congress leader who openly discounted Sonias foreign origin, helping her acquire the legitimacy she required to head a ruling combine.        
	Although Sonia herself refused to become the Prime Minister, Basus bold gesture, at a time when regional pillars of Indian politics like Mulayam Singh Yadav, J. Jayalalithaa, Sharad Yadav and others had joined the BJPs chorus on her foreign origin, went on to cement a personal bond that didnt come under strain even as the Left was trying to pull down the Manmohan Singh government.        
	Several other top politicians will be present at Basus funeral. Among them are BJP leader L.K. Advani, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan, Trinamul Congress boss Mamata Banerjee, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Lalu Prasad, Nationalist Congress Party leader and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, the Lok Janshakti Partys Ram Vilas Paswan and some regional party leaders.        
	The unanimous view in the Congress is that Basu, along with communist ideologue Mohit Sen, enjoyed an excellent relationship with the first family of the Congress. Against this backdrop, even the speculation about political factors influencing Sonias decision not to attend Basus funeral is leaving Congress members enraged.        
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told The Telegraph: Basu transcended political barriers. In his death, no question arises of any political considerations.        
	Sonia wrote a letter to his son Chandan Basu saying she was deeply saddened. She said: Jyoti Basu did not go gentle into the good night  he fought bravely until his last breath, just as he did throughout his life. And what a rich, fulfilled and glorious life he had! He served his country, his party and his state with whole-hearted dedication for over half a century. He was a tireless crusader against communalism, fundamentalism, casteism and all kinds of obscurantism.        
	Sonia further said: Basu was a warrior for social justice and equality, and for the eradication of poverty; a true patriot who put the national interest above all else. He was a towering figure in our national life whose noble vision, superb judgement and depth of experience we all valued greatly. He contributed to the formation of the UPA government in 2004 and we continued to count on him for his wise counsel even after he retired from political life.        
	Sonia also took care to highlight the personal bonding, saying: Together with Indiraji and Rajivji, I held him in the highest esteem. I have the warmest memories of our many meetings  of his charm and grace and his deep humanity. At this time of grief, my thoughts are with you and your family. Not only the people of West Bengal and his millions of followers the entire nation mourns for him.        
	Congress leaders cannot seem to recall when Sonia had been so effusive in her expressions before and insist that no other leader had such a place in Sonias heart.        
	Singhvi explained the sentiments, saying: Even if you violently disagreed with communist politics, you couldnt but be instantly drawn to Basus personality. He was a disciplined soldier of his party and a leader who paid a price as high as the Prime Ministers post for his discipline. If the CPM in Bengal has become the longest-serving party, it is because of his personality.        
	The Congress is evidently gripped by a sense of loss; there were, after all, few communist leaders whose national vision transcended ideological confines as Basus did.

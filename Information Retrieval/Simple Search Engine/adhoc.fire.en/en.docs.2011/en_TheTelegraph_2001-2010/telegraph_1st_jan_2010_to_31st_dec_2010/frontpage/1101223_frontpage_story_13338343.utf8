          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                             IIT Kharagpur: Under glare                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The HRD ministry has decided to set up a two-member committee to probe a fake institute at IIT Kharagpur and the alleged complicity of the premier engineering colleges faculty members and officials.        
	Pradeep Mathur and Sudhir Jain, the directors of IIT Indore and IIT Gandhinagar respectively, will be on the panel, a source said.         
	They will examine complaints from students of the Institution of Electrical Engineering (IEE), the fake institute that was running on the Kharagpur campus with the alleged connivance of some IIT authorities.        
	A.K. Ghosh, a senior faculty member and former chief vigilance officer of the IIT, was president of the fake institute, which did not have any recognition from the All India Council of Technical Education.         
	The institute was offering diploma courses in electrical engineering and was managed by J.K. Tiwary, who had nothing to do with the IIT but lured students to the IEE claiming it was a branch of the top engineering school.        
	The students of IEE have also alleged that former IIT Kharagpur directors K.L. Chopta and S.K. Dube supported the fake institute, a claim denied by both professors. It has been alleged that the present officiating registrar T.K. Ghosal  then a deputy registrar  had issued Tiwary an I-card in 2006 with the IIT emblem.        
	The two-member committee will investigate if other faculty members and administrative staff had any role in running the fake institute functioning from staff quarters on the campus from 2002 to 2007  and the manner in which the IIT facilities were misused. It will recommend punishment as well as a roadmap to check such incidents.        
	The IIT has suspended Ghosh, the senior IIT professor who headed the IEE, and filed an FIR against him. An internal IIT committee has found evidence of Ghoshs involvement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Protestors in Kashmir face stones, their own bitter pill
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Protestors in Kashmir face stones, their own bitter pill
        
	Srinagar, Aug 23 (PTI): Fed up with repeated strikes by separatists in Kashmir Valley, shopkeepers are up in arms against protestors, who are tasting their own bitter pill as locals are attacking them with stones.
    Clerics have also started making fervent appeals from mosques to open shops and restore normalcy in violence affected areas.
    An incident of clash was recently reported from Peerbagh in Budgham district of Central Kashmir - the scene of violent protests during the last few weeks.
    As separatists and their goons reached the area to enforce the strike, they were greeted with stones. Local shopowners showered stones on these rowdy elements who tried to force them to close down their establishments.
    The police could not do anything to quell the locals and shopkeepers as securitymen were outnumbered.

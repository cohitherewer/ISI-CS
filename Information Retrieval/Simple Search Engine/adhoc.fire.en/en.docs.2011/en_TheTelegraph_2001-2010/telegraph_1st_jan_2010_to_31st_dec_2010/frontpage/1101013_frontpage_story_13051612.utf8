          SHASHANK SHEKHAR      
	Bokaro, Oct. 12: Vigilance officers probing misappropriation of over Rs 2 crore from funds meant to build schools in Bokaro district today revealed how a schoolteacher siphoned off money and kept his opponents at bay by threatening them with punishment postings in Naxalite-hit areas.        
	DSPs Narendra Singh, Jayant Kumar, Dhaneshwar Ram and inspectors Shashi Bhushan and Tej Narain, who arrived here from Ranchi two days ago following a high court censure over the tardy pace of investigations, said Ashok Bharti was solely responsible for the Rs 10 crore that had been allotted to build schools in the district under the Centres Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.        
	Bharti, a former teacher at Bangla Girls Medium School in Sadam, was appointed junior engineer to oversee construction of school buildings by the then district superintendent of education in December, 2006, apparently with the blessings of former chief minister Madhu Koda who Bharti claimed to be close to.        
	During their visit to Petarwar, Gomia, Mahuatand, Ordana, Birni, Nawadih, Bermo and Chas, vigilance officers found that Bharti randomly changed designs of proposed school buildings to cut costs.        
	While studying the original blueprint of Chas Kasturba Girls School, vigilance officers found that Bharti had ordered a kitchen to be built sans shelves, racks and even dining space, which are mandatory in boarding schools. Moreover, the building material used was of inferior quality.        
	The warden of the school, Anita Kumari, alleged that Bharti started constructing the school in the last week of 2007. Over the next 19 months, he constructed just the ground floor at a cost of Rs 23 lakh.         
	On June 24, 2009, he forced the warden to shift into an incomplete building and took the entire Rs 40 lakh allotted for the project. Despite repeated requests, he refused to complete the unfinished building.        
	When the matter was raised with the then deputy commissioner Satyendra Singh, he ordered another reminder, following which an FIR was lodged against Bharti at Pindrajora police station.        
	DSP Ram said Bharti was suspended in June, 2009, and asked to report at Jaridih, which he never did.         
	Ram added that despite FIRs and suspension, Bharti went about threatening anyone who dared to question his style of working. He would speak about his political clout and threaten to get detractors posted in remote areas.        
	According to official records, Bhartis last posting was at Sadam in Gomia where no one seemed to recall when he was seen last.         
	As the vigilance team is keen to interrogate Bharti, Bokaro superintendent of education S.K. Sah was today asked to present him in front of the vigilance officers, failing which necessary action would follow.        
	On October 7, Jharkhand High Court had hauled up DGP Neyaz Ahmed and IG (vigilance) M.V. Rao for the vigilance bureaus failure to investigate the scam. The high court was responding to a PIL filed by the Yuva Shakti Manch of Bokaro.

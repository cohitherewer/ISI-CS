	Ranchi, March 26: A Maoist, who had tried to kill a teenager for filing an FIR against fellow rebels alleging gangrape on March 4, was arrested from Tarwadih village in Latehar today.        
	Latehar superintendent of police Kuldeep Dwivedi said the Maoist was identified as Arun Yadav, named in more than six cases of rape, murder and explosion registered at Town police station.         
	Dwivedi said Yadav was the right hand member of self-styled Maoist sub-zonal commander Pappu Lohra and wanted to eliminate the 17-year-old girl, who had lodged the complaint at Town police station against Lohra and several others.        
	Dwivedi added that Yadav had abducted a contractor, Amrendra Singh, on November 7 for ransom and had also set a house on fire in the Town police station area. The arrest of Yadav from Tarwadih village, about 120km from here, is a big achievement. The innocent girl has been knocking the doors of police for safety from Maoists-turned-rapists, he said.         
	At Latehar railway station on March 4, three Maoists, including Lohra, came on a motorbike. They accused the girl of being a police informer and pumped three bullets in her stomach. The fled towards Saryu forests, thinking the girl was dead.        
	However, the girl was rushed to Sadar hospital and later shifted to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi where she underwent surgery.        
	In Khunti, a PLFI activist and four other criminals were also arrested today. He was identified as Suresh, a close aide of PLFIs self-styled zonal commander Pawan.         
	The others were Francis Nag, Bhaiya Ram Soy, Anup Topno and Mahavir Chikbaraik  all local criminals  who shot dead a farmer, Sunil Horo (22), on March 10 in the district. A pistol and five rounds of ammunition were also recovered from them.                          
	Khunti superintendent of police Asim Vikrant Minz said the arms recovered were the same used in Sunils murder.         
	Minz said Suresh had given a lot of information about the presence of extremists in the town area and also accepted his involvement in two more crimes. All of them were forwarded to Khunti jail, he said.        
	PLFI is a breakaway faction of CPI(Maoist), active in Khunti and Gumla areas.

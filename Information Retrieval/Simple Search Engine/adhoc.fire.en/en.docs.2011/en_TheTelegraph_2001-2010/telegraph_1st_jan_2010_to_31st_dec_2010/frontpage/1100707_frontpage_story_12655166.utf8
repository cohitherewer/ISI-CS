	Guwahati, July 6: Merapani town, located in the disputed D sector along the Assam-Nagaland boundary, has turned into a battle zone since last night as residents clashed with the CRPF over reconstruction of houses that were damaged in a fire a few days back.         
	Several persons, including CRPF personnel, were injured in the clashes. The mob also damaged a CRPF checkpoint on Uriamghat-Merapani road this morning.         
	The situation was brought under control today following the intervention of Golaghat deputy commissioner Harendra Nath Bora and senior CRPF officials.         
	Merapani has witnessed bloody clashes earlier too, with police forces of both the states exchanging fire several times over the disputed boundary. Several policemen from both the states had died in 1985, the worst clash so far. Soon thereafter, the CRPF was deployed as a neutral force to man the border in this sector.         
	Trouble between the central paramilitary force and the residents started last evening when CRPF personnel in civvies, led by sector commander Radheshyam Choudhury, tried to stop a group of people from re-building one of the houses that was damaged in a fire a few days ago.        
	The CRPF personnel argued that work should be stopped immediately since the owner of the house, Rajesh Singh, had not taken permission for construction from the border magistrate as is mandatory in the disputed Assam-Nagaland border areas.         
	An argument broke out between the CRPF personnel and the people, many of whom had gathered at the spot by then. The agitated residents finally attacked the CRPF personnel and chased them back to their camp, nearly 100 metres away. They also blocked the Uriamghat-Merapani road and demanded that the CRPF commander be transferred immediately.         
	The situation was brought under control late last night after senior police officials from Golaghat town rushed to Merapani and assured the people that the deputy commissioner would visit the place today and give permission to carry out construction of the damaged houses.         
	Trouble erupted again this morning, when CRPF personnel resorted to caning to disperse a large group of people who gathered on Merapani High School premises to meet the deputy commissioner who was supposed to visit the area. More than 12 persons were injured in the lathicharge. The mob again clashed with the CRPF personnel and chased them back to their barracks. The people also damaged a checkpost located in front of Merapani High School.         
	On getting information of the clash, the Golaghat deputy commissioner rushed to the area with senior CRPF officials to pacify the crowd. The situation came under control only after Bora issued written permission to go ahead with the construction of the houses.         
	The CRPF officials accompanying him also assured the people that the sector commander would be transferred immediately.

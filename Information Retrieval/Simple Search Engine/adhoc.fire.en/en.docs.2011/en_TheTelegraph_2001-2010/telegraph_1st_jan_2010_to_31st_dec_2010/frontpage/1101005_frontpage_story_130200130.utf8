	Teluk Wondama(Indonesia), Oct 5 (AP): Heavy rain unleashed flash floods and mudslides, killing 29 people in a remote corner of Indonesia that rescuers were still struggling to reach days after the storms began, officials and witnesses said today.
    With dozens still missing, residents in West Papua province's hillside village of Wasior were combing the mud in search of survivors, some with their bare hands. Hundreds of homes were destroyed.
    "I heard a roar and suddenly the river near my home broke its banks," said Ira Wanoni, describing the scariest deluge, which occurred early yesterday.
    "Water mixed with rocks, mud and logs gushed out.  Many people didn't have time to save themselves." recounted Wanoni.
    With many roads underwater, rescue workers were having a hard time reaching the area, which has also been hit by power blackouts and downed telephone lines.

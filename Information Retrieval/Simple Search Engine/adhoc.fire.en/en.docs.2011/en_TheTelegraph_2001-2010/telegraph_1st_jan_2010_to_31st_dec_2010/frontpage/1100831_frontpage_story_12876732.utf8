          SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA      
	Ranchi, Aug. 30: The Supreme Court reinstated H.B. Lal as chairman of Jharkhand State Electricity Board today, but the 83-year-old found no respite as the state vigilance bureau named him in an FIR alleging he and several of his former colleagues in JSEB received bribes to favour a company while awarding contracts for rural electrification projects.        
	Lal had been removed by former governor Syed Sibtey Razi on April 29 last year in pursuance of a Jharkhand High Court order that had declared his re-appointment to JSEB as illegal because of his age, allegedly 90 according to a petition.        
	Today, a Supreme Court division bench comprising Justice P. Sathasivam and Justice B. S. Chauhan quashed the high court order saying there was no age limit prescribed for the chairmans post under the Electricity Act.         
	Besides, the record of services rendered by Lal has also been good, the court noted. So, Lal is permitted to join forthwith, it added, prompting the present incumbent Shiv Basant to relinquish his office.         
	The apex court, however, granted the state administration liberty to reconstitute the electricity board under section 5 (5) of the Electricity Act.        
	Lal told The Telegraph from Patna that he had faxed a letter to Governors advisor V. S. Dubey, chief secretary A. K. Singh and Basant, among others, to inform them that he had assumed charge as JSEB chairman in view of the SC order reinstating him.        
	But Lal did not comment on the vigilance bureau FIR against him and 28 others, including former chief minister Madhu Koda.        
	Dubey, who holds charge of the energy department, said the apex court order would be complied with. Lal will be allowed to join, he said. We are studying the judgement to see what can be done next.         
	On April 27, 2009, the high court quashed the September 27, 2008, appointment of Lal as JSEB chairman, questioning the states role in selecting a 90-year-old for a second term, ignoring government rules for appointments.        
	Lal, who was first appointed JSEB chairman in 2004, moved the Supreme Court challenging the high court order.        
	But, on April 29, 2009, then governor Razi decided to act on the high court order and appoint A.K. Chugh as the 10th chairman of JSEB.        
	On May 1, 2009, the apex court ordered an interim stay on the Jharkhand High Courts order to remove Lal. But, the apex court vacated the stay order on May 12, paving the way for the state to appoint Chugh again as chairman.

	Washington, Oct 26 (PTI): Kashmir issue is unlikely to figure during talks between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Barack Obama in New Delhi next month as US considers this an "internal" matter of India, Indian sources have said.
    But, the two leaders will discuss the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as in South East Asia and how India and the US can increase their co-operation at the global level, a source, familiar with the preparatory talks between officials of the two countries, said.
    The source said Kashmir issue is unlikely to figure during the talks between Singh and Obama as the US' firm stand is that Kashmir is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan and it has to be solved by them, despite Pakistan asking it to play a role.

          AMIT ROY                            Miliband an Rahul                          
	London, April 30: The two men are busy politicians in Britain and India, they stay in touch and though nothing in certain in politics, one day they may well be prime ministers of their respective countries.        
	 David Miliband, Britains 44-year-old foreign secretary, spoke warmly today about his friend Rahul Gandhi, four years his junior, when he met Indian journalists in London to discuss the general election campaign.        
	If Gordon Brown loses on May 6, as polls suggest he will, the chances are that Labour will elect a new leader  and it could be Miliband.        
	In the past, he has been urged to stand against Brown but Miliband held back. Now, if Brown is forced to stand down following a Labour defeat, Miliband may feel his time has come.        
	 So he could be the next British Prime Minister but one who will have to deal with Rahul possibly as his Indian counterpart.        
	Asked whether the new generation of Labour politicians to which he belonged will forge a close but a different kind of relationship from the one that followed the transfer of power under Clement Attlee in 1947, Miliband responded: Yes, we will  it will be a different kind of relationship because decolonisation was a seminal moment obviously for India and also for Britain.        
	 He said: My generation does feel that India is a success story from which we can learn, a success story with which we want to co-operate.        
	 Miliband, who is descended from a Jewish immigrant family, then disclosed he was friends with Rahul. As it happens when I went to India I was able to spend a lot of time with Rahul Gandhi and stay in touch with him and the Labour partys sense of fellow feeling with many Indians, whether they be in politics or culture or sport, is very strong.        
	 Pressed further on his contacts with Rahul, like him a rising star, Miliband was cautious. Rahul Gandhi is certainly a rising star  may be just a star, I think  but we obviously stay in touch privately. I wouldnt want to talk about that. I think he always says  which is very powerful  he wants to use the forces of democracy to help propel the country forward and that commitment to mobilise people as well as mobilise governments is very, very strong and very, very important.        
	 Having a friend like Miliband may be useful for Rahul and vice versa.        
	 Addressing the current state of bilateral relations, Miliband observed: Britain and India have a relationship now which I would argue is better than ever. The first plank of that better-than-ever relationship is the relationship of our two Prime Ministers. Prime Minister Singh of India, Prime Minister Brown of the UK have a remarkably close relationship, a relationship of shared values, shared priorities, shared experience and also shared work together over a very long period.        
	 He did not say so but perhaps he could foresee that eventually the relationship between Prime Minister Miliband and Prime Minister Gandhi would be equally close.        
	 Miliband made it clear his interest in India had not developed since he was appointed foreign secretary when Brown took over from Tony Blair as Prime Minister in June 2007.        
	 He pointed out: As schools minister I went to India in 2003 or 2004 so this isnt a new thing  it is a long standing interest and it is shared with a lot of colleagues, not least because they represent constituencies with significant Indian populations.        
	 At the London Book Fair last year, he had interviewed Amartya Sen when the Nobel Prize winner had launched The Idea of Justice.        
	 It was a great honour to appear with Amartya Sen, who makes anyone feel inadequate despite his own modesty and humility, said Miliband, with the reverential tone of a good student recalling his favourite professor. He is a man of such teaching and learning that you feel somewhat daunted by his stature but he is a good friend as it happens as well as a shining example of cosmopolitanism.        
	 Miliband paid tribute to the tremendous contribution that British citizens of Indian origin have made to our country.

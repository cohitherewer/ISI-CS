          NARESH JANA                            Residents of West Midnapores Radhanagar village who gave chase to Maoists on July 22                                  
	Midnapore, July 31: More and more villages in West Midnapore are rising to defy Maoist coercion despite the rebels yesterday striking back at those who lit the first spark of resistance.        
	Defence groups armed with sticks, scythes and daggers, called gram bachao (save the village) committees, have sprung up in at least 45 villages nine days after Radhanagar, a Jhargram hamlet, had chased away 20 armed Maoists.        
	We are fed up of being forced at gunpoint to join the Maoists marches and protests. Earlier it was police atrocities; now its Maoist atrocities. We wont tolerate this any more, said Gopinath Soren in Radhanagar.        
	Villages that have formed gram bachao committees include Makla and Pathorpara in Goaltore; Goaldanga, Kashijora and Satpati in Salboni; Upordanga in Jhargram; Harda in Binpur; and Nishchinta in Beliabara.        
	Jhargram superintendent of police (SP) Praveen Tripathi said these villages had mixed populations and that both tribals and non-tribals were joining the resistance committees. Gopinath corroborated this: We tribals are as much part of the gram bachao committee as the others.        
	West Midnapore SP Manoj Verma said something really brutal was needed for the villagers to overcome their fear of the Maoists, and the rebels had provided that in Radhanagar by assaulting a young mother and her three-week-old baby.        
	Ranu Sahoo, a homemaker in Radhanagar, said that when some women refused to join the Maoists march on July 22, saying they had too much work at home, the rebels slapped us and chased us around the village.        
	Gita Pal, who had given birth a few weeks ago, said she did not have the physical strength to join the march, Ranu said. The Maoists snatched the baby from her arms and flung it to the ground. They threw her too on the ground and started beating and kicking her. This was just too inhuman, and our anger overcame our fear.        
	Haripada Soren of Goaldanga, near Pirakata, said Radhanagar was the inspiration the other villages were looking for. After we learnt on TV about Radhanagar, we too chased the Maoists away when they ordered us to join a march, he said.        
	The police said that in the next few days, more resistance groups were likely to come up in at least 10 villages, including Akhrasole, Muraboni, Kusumghanti and Indraboni near Rajabandh where the Jnaneswari Express was sabotaged on May 29. Officers said the plot had been hatched in these villages, then considered rebel hotbeds.        
	Now many activists of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities have left these villages after receiving threats from fellow residents. We told them they should leave or surrender to the police, an Akhrasole resident said.        
	The Maoists are retaliating. Yesterday, they threw bombs and fired bullets at the Radhanagar defence committee, injuring four. In Belpaharis Sakundanga, the rebels hacked to death a CPM supporter who had on July 28 led an anti-Maoist march by thousands from 10 villages.        
	We wont be deterred, said Pashupati Sau, a retired government employee in Radhanagar.        
	As these resistance groups are growing, so are requests for police camps in these villages, the Jhargram SP said. So many of these groups are coming up across Jungle Mahal  its not possible to set up camps at so many places, Tripathi said. We are providing patrolling.        
	In Beliabaras Nishchinta, villagers had caught a Maoist on July 24 but released him in frustration at the polices inability to promise a security camp there immediately.        
	The villagers provided various reasons for their willingness to defy the rebels.        
	The Maoists indefinite bandhs had led to a total shutdown. We were forced to form a resistance committee so that people could make a living, said Manishankar Mondal, a medical representative in Chandra village.        
	The panchayat had stopped functioning; so people were not getting any work, said Bidesh Samanta, a farmer in Makla.

	Calcutta, Sept. 12: Theres bad news for investors: the entry barriers  read minimum premia  have been raised for unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips).        
	Ulips have been riding a high for a couple of years now, and insurers have been able to pit it against mutual funds in a scramble for investors money.        
	In April, capital market watchdog Sebi had triggered a battle of wills with insurance regulator IRDA when it tried to bring Ulips within its fief. The storm blew over when the finance ministry restored the IRDAs oversight over Ulips. But that dust-up meant no insurer could come out with a new, feature-rich Ulip between April and August.        
	The new plans have opened since September 1 and they dont make for pretty reading.        
	Till August 30, you could buy a unit-linked pension plan for a premium as low as Rs 500 a month. But under the new regulations that came into force from September 1, most insurers have increased the minimum premium for their unit-linked pension and unit-linked life insurance plans.        
	For example, the Life Insurance Corporation of India has increased the minimum annual premium for its Pension Plus scheme (launched after September 1) to Rs 15,000 and the minimum monthly premium to Rs 1,500. The minimum annual premium under Market Plus 1, a unit-liked pension plan of the corporation that closed on August 30, was Rs 5,000 and the minimum monthly premium, Rs 1,000.        
	Similarly, the Aegon Religare Life Insurance Company has raised the minimum annual premium for its Future Protect Plan, a unit-linked life insurance plan (launched after September 1), to Rs 25,000 from Rs 12,000 under its older Invest Maximiser plan. It has raised the minimum monthly premium to Rs 3,000 from Rs 2,000.        
	Under the new regulations, Ulips with low-ticket premium will not be viable. Insurers are bound to increase the minimum premium size in Ulips launched after September 1, said Kamesh Goyal, CEO, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company.        
	The average premium in Ulips will go up from around Rs 15,000 earlier to Rs 30,000 now because, under the new regulations, insurers cannot pay their agents as high a commission as they used to, said R. Krishnamurthy, managing director (products, distribution and markets), Towers Watson India, a US-based global financial management and consulting company.        
	The changed rules will also hurt the insurance industry, which had turned the Ulip into its most successful product. Krishnamurthy, former chief executive of SBI Life Insurance Company, said the sales volume of life insurance firms would fall by 20-30 per cent in the short term because Ulips accounted for over 80 per cent of the total business, especially in the case of private-sector life insurance companies.        
	Distribution channels will now get a much lower commission, below 10 per cent, and many marginal distributors and agents may actually have to quit. Life insurance companies could see their army of agents shrink by 40 per cent.        
	Lower sales volumes along with the restrictions on policy surrender charges, Krishnamurthy said, will put a strain on the capital requirements of private life insurers. They will, therefore, need to pump in more cash by way of equity capital just to stay viable.        
	Rajiv Jamkhedkar, chief executive officer, Aegon Religare, said insurers that are able to ensure their policyholders dont drop off midway and stop paying their premia would be better off.         
	Our experience is that the lapse rate is higher in case of policies with monthly premium. So we have decided to focus more on selling policies in annual premium payment mode, he added.        
	Some insurers have decided to shun policyholders who want to pay monthly premia. Bajaj Allianz Life has scrapped the monthly premium option in its new unit-linked plan Max Advantage.

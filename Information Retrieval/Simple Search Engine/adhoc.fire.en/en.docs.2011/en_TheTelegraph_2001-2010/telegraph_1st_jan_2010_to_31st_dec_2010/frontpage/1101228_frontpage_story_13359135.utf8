          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 27: Buddhadeb Bhatacharjee today admitted receiving P. Chidambarams leaked letter this morning and promised a fitting reply tomorrow.        
	Even before he had finished speaking, Mamata Banerjee was on her way to Raj Bhavan for an unscheduled visit that triggered the usual speculation about the Bengal polls being advanced.        
	For the past few days, I have been hearing that Union home minister Chidambaram has sent a letter to me. The media kept writing about it for five days, the chief minister told a Left Front rally on the Dum Dum Central Jail grounds.         
	The letter, which mentions armed CPM camps in Jungle Mahal, has been in the news for three days since it was leaked on December 24. It was purportedly written on December 21.        
	Where was the letter that the media got a few days ago but I didnt? I got it this morning. I will send a reply tomorrow. I will give a fitting reply, Bhattacharjee said.         
	I shall ask Chidambaram whether he knows about a joint Trinamul Congress-Maoist morcha (front) and that they hold meetings secretly as well as in public? Does he support that?         
	An aide said Mamata had been glued to the TV to hear the chief minister. Around 5.30pm, towards the end of Bhattacharjees speech, she left to meet governor M.K. Narayanan. They spoke one-to-one for about 25 minutes.        
	She requested the governor to intervene and cited the home ministers letter, which justifies her call for advancing the polls, a source close to Mamata said. Mamata refused to reveal what was discussed, saying: This was a courtesy call to the governor before the New Year. Raj Bhavan sources confirmed the meeting was an unscheduled one.         
	The CPM dismissed Chidambarams charges. At a news conference, state party secretary Biman Bose described the letter as politically motivated and its media leak as dangerous.

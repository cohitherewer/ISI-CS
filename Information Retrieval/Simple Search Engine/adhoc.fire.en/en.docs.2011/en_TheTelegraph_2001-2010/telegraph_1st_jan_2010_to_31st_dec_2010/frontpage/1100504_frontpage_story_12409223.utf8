The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In DU, storekeeper smarter 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                In DU, storekeeper smarter 
  - Radiation-spewing device sold after elaborate exercise           G.S. MUDUR                       DU vice-chancellor Deepak Pental                                
	New Delhi, May 3: An elaborate 36-day exercise involving an eight-member Delhi University faculty committee cleared the sale of a radiation-spewing instrument as scrap, lifting an unofficial two-year freeze rooted in a storekeepers words of caution, documents and varsity sources suggest.         
	The revelation indicates that the sale of the DU chemistry facultys gamma irradiator, which led to Indias first death from radiation exposure, was not an unscripted, spur-of-the-moment decision.        
	Scrap dealers who bought the instrument dismantled it, exposing themselves to radioactive cobalt-60. One scrap worker has died and seven others are ill from radiation poisoning.         
	Radiation safety regulators have expressed surprise at the facultys decision to sell, breaching safety guidelines. DU vice-chancellor Deepak Pental had last week declined to reveal who within the university had taken the decision to write off the irradiator and auction it as scrap.        
	Pental said he had asked a three-member panel to investigate the circumstances under which it was sold.         
	A former member of the chemistry faculty and non-teaching staff have said a storekeeper had expressed concern at the first suggestion from the faculty to dispose of the gamma irradiator about two years ago.        
	The storekeeper, who has been in the department for more than 20 years, informed the faculty in 2007 or 2008 that this was a dangerous instrument, the faculty member and non-teaching staff said.              
	The disposal of the gamma irradiator appeared to have been kept in abeyance after these words of caution until January this year when the chemistry faculty initiated a fresh exercise to get rid of old and unused instruments. The gamma irradiator procured from Canada in 1968 has been unused since 1985.         
	Documents made available to The Telegraph suggest that the head of the chemistry department, Virinder Parmar, had sent a note on January 20, this year seeking approval for the disposal of old and unused equipment.         
	On February 6, DU approved an eight-member committee with Parmar as chair and four other chemistry faculty as members, as well as a faculty member each from the departments of botany, zoology and plant molecular biology.         
	The documents suggest this committee was to meet on February 10 to work out a plan to write off the unwanted equipment along with steel and wooden furniture of the department.         
	Besides Parmar, the committee included S.M.S. Chauhan, R.C. Rastogi, A.K. Prasad and R.K. Sharma from the chemistry faculty, Roop Lal from zoology, I. Usha Rao from botany and J.P. Khurana from plant molecular biology.         
	Parmar and another chemistry faculty member declined to comment on how the irradiator had been discussed in the meeting. Radiation regulators say the cautionary signs for radioactivity on the instrument should have alerted the committee.         
	Six days after the meeting, on February 16, DUs engineering department announced that the public auction would be held on February 26 through a note circulated to various university divisions and to scrap dealers.         
	This sale appears to have gone through the standard write-off and auction procedure, said a former faculty member.         
	Pental had earlier this week hinted the faculty members may have miscalculated the radioactivity from the instrument. But radiation safety regulators say the faculty was not authorised to engage in any such calculations.         
	In the first week of April, eight scrap workers in Delhis Mayapuri area fell ill with symptoms of radiation exposure. Scientists have determined that radioactivity from the cobalt-60 was millions of times the normal background level.

  km of new railway lines promised by Mamata in a year. Annual average in 58 years is 180km a year					 					      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Graphic: MANOJ                                
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Mamata Banerjee pulled several tricks out of her hat today by calling a freeze on passenger fares and freight for the second successive year and trundling out a wagonload of projects  many for Bengal  but didnt say what money magic will turn them into reality.        
	This is the seventh year in a row passenger fares havent been raised.        
	In the present economic situation, when the country is about to return to a high growth path, I do not wish to impose any burden on citizens, Mamata said in her 110-minute speech punctuated by angry interruptions over her bias towards Bengal.        
	Not only did she not raise fare and freight but she also responded to concerns over food price inflation, running at close to 18 per cent, with a token effort to tamp it down by trimming the cost of moving foodgrain and kerosene by Rs 100 per wagon.        
	Badly strapped for cash, the railways are looking to rope in private companies to build tracks, train stations, logistics parks and high-speed train corridors. PPP (public-private partnership) appeared to be the magic mantra.        
	At the same time, Mamata took care to allay fears of privatisation. We have no plans to privatise the railways.         
	She announced the upgrade of 94 stations and the launch of double-decker trains, 522 hospitals and diagnostic centres, but what stood out for its vaulting ambition was the target to lay 1,000km of new lines this year against the past average of just 180km.        
	In the run-up to the rail budget, several reports had suggested anxiety in the cabinet about where the money for her long wish list was to come from. It doesnt seem to have deterred Mamata who would have had both eyes on next years Assembly polls in Bengal as she wrote her speech.                    
	To repeated cries of Bengal bias, she replied at times with humour. You want a train for Jaunpur, I am giving you one (she wrote it down on her speech), she told an MP from the region. At other times, she responded with hot temper.        
	Mamata proposed to take the railways down tracks that are outside their area of competence with plans to establish 10 auto ancillary hubs and six drinking water plants and start door-to-door freight services. She also promised housing for all railway staff in 10 years.        
	Her proposals involve a total expenditure of Rs 87,100 crore against gross earnings of Rs 94,565 crore. The lack of clarity on the cost of new projects masked a harsh truth: railway projects have a long gestation period and there often is a huge gulf between promise and performance.        
	Mamatas big trick is that she expects to close the year ending March 2011 with a revenue surplus of Rs 3,173 crore after paying the railways full dividend liability of Rs 6,582 crore to the Centre. The sceptics are asking questions about her assumptions.        
	The railways are assuming that the 17,000 trains they run every day will run to capacity once again. Passenger earnings are forecast to rise 7.47 per cent to Rs 26,126 crore. Earnings from goods traffic are expected to grow 6.8 per cent to Rs 62,489 crore.        
	Mamata plans to spend Rs 41,426 crore in the coming year  the highest-ever plan expenditure  on gauge conversion, doubling railway lines, new trains and services and new projects on a cost-sharing basis with either state governments or private players.         
	S. Murli, former financial commissioner of the railways, said: This is a wish list. So much emphasis is being laid on the PPP model. But why would private investors stump up money for projects that have a poor rate of return on investment?         
	Mamata hopes to catalyse private investment of Rs 858 crore  8.5 times more than last year.

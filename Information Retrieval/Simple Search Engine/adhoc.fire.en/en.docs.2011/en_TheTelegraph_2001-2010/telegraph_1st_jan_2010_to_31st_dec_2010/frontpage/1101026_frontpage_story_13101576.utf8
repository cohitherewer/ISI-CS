	New Delhi, Oct. 25: Scientists have found 50-million-year-old insects entombed but exquisitely preserved in amber deposits in a mine in western India, a discovery that may change current views of Indias biogeographical history and Asias earliest rainforests.        
	A team of Indian, German and US scientists has identified ants, bees, termites, spiders and scorpions among nearly 100 species in amber  fossilised tree resin  from the Vastan lignite mine, 30km northeast of Surat, in a geological zone called the Cambay Shale.        
	Insects of similar antiquity have previously been observed in amber from multiple sites, including the Baltic, Ukraine and France.        
	But a unique chemical structure of the Cambay amber has allowed scientists to extract for the first time whole insects and study them at a level of detail never achieved before.         
	A research paper describing the insects will appear in the US journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, tomorrow.        
	Its astonishing  weve got finely preserved, whole insects, said Jes Rust, a professor at the Institute of Paleontology at the University of Bonn, Germany. Its almost like looking at a live insect from 50 million years in the past, Rust said.        
	The earliest insects emerged about 400 million years ago. Amber  which can preserve insects in a lifelike form  from a site in Spain has shown insects from 110 million years ago. In contrast, the oldest preserved Egyptian mummies are about 4,500 years old.        
	Scientists say the Cambay insects provide fresh insights into Indias biogeographic history.        
	India broke away from Africa about 160 million years ago and was an isolated island as it drifted northward until it collided with Asia 50 million years ago. Paleontologists believe the long isolation would have led to the evolution of distinct species.        
	But microscope-aided studies suggest that some Cambay insects  a bee, a scuttlefly and a bug  are closely related to extinct species from northern Europe, Australia and even tropical America.        
	This was a complete surprise, said team member David Grimaldi, the curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History. We expected to find species that were extremely distinct from having evolved in isolation so long.        
	The relationships of the Cambay insects to other insects on distant continents suggest that even before India collided with Asia, insects were migrating through arcs of islands between India and Asia.        
	Insects are small in size and can raft on storm-induced platforms of natural vegetation across island arcs and nearby continents, said Ashok Sahni, a senior paleontologist at the University of Lucknow and a team member.                 
	Sahni and his colleagues had first stumbled upon a spider, a fly, and an ant in amber from Vastan about five years ago. Since then, the researchers have found more than 700 specimens, representing 55 families and 100 species. As the numbers climbed, Sahni sought out collaborations with other institutions with expertise for amber analysis.         
	The Cambay amber has so far yielded 15 species of ants, representing a great diversity.        
	We know ants evolved around 120 million years ago. But for about 60 to 70 million years, they were sparse and primitive, Grimaldi told The Telegraph. They exploded in abundance. The amber records in Cambay and in France are the earliest of this explosion.        
	The amber deposits in Vastan also provide the earliest evidence of a tropical rainforest in Asia. The Cambay amber comes from a family of hardwood trees that make up 80 per cent of forest canopy in Southeast Asia.         
	The 50-million-year-old rainforest in India would thus be the earliest record of such plants in Asia and pushes back the antiquity of Asian rainforests by nearly 25 million years.        
	Such rainforests now dominate Southeast Asia but are found only in patches of southern India. This suggests that a dramatic climate shift has taken place during the last 30 million years that left India a somewhat drier place than present day Southeast Asia, Sahni said.        
	We believe the continued study of the Vastan insects will clarify to a great extent the true biodiversity of the first equatorial deciduous forests of the earth, Sahni said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Shillong, March 15: The Meghalaya government today told the interlocutor for peace talks with the Achik National Volunteers Council (ANVC), P.C. Haldar, that it was necessary to extend the ceasefire with the outfit beyond March 31 for the sake of peace and tranquillity in Garo hills.        
	Haldar, who arrived here today, met chief minister D.D. Lapang, deputy chief minister Mukul Sangma and senior government officials before his meeting with the outfit, scheduled for tomorrow. The chief minister told Haldar that during his trip to Delhi on Wednesday, he would meet Union home minister P. Chidambaram and urge him to extend the truce with the ANVC.                                       
	The outfit had said that it would prefer Tura to Shillong as the venue for holding the meeting, as the demands of the outfit are pertaining to Garo Hills.        
	The ANVC publicity secretary, Arist Sangma, said following a request from the state government, the militant outfit has agreed to come to Shillong for talks with the Union home ministry official.         
	During the last joint monitoring committee meeting held in Tura February 23, both the Central and state government officials had told the outfit that the ceasefire would expire on March 31.         
	The government also did not give any assurance to the ANVC on its demand for a Garoland Territorial Council.         
	After the meeting, the ANVC expressed displeasure over the unilateral decision taken by the Centre of not adhering to the indefinite ceasefire agreement arrived at during a Delhi meet in 2008.         
	The ANVC was also unhappy with the governments lukewarm response on the demand for an autonomous body like the Garoland Territorial Council.         
	The militant outfit threatened to pull out of the tripartite ceasefire agreement last week, claiming that the Centre took an arbitrary decision by suggesting periodic truce, ignoring the earlier decision for an indefinite ceasefire.         
	Haldar told reporters today that ANVCs demands would be examined during tomorrows meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM sips from cola bottle
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CPM sips from cola bottle
  - Besieged partys style reflects cola strategy           DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                                     
	Calcutta, May 31: Lie low after a big blow.         
	Blasphemous as it may sound, the CPM took for the just-concluded civic polls the path paved by Coke and Pepsi seven years ago when the pesticide controversy buffeted the soft drink multinationals, symbols of all that the Left stands against.        
	Such parallels are certain to make the Left recoil in horror. But if a management student were to explore how a besieged market leader (the CPM) responded to the threat from a street-savvy challenger (the Trinamul Congress), it would be difficult to miss the deliberate shift in the sales strategy.         
	Tweaking the traditional carpet-bombing strategy of holding big-ticket rallies and painting the town red with screaming billboards, the CPM chose a direct approach  door-to-door campaign, group meetings and personalised and interactive communication.        
	There was indeed a shift in the strategy and the stress was more on intensive campaigning, reaching out to voters personally and listening to what they had to say. We did not want too much noise and preferred lying low, said CPM leader Manab Mukherjee.         
	Such departures  from above the line (ATL) to below the line (BTL) activities  are regular affairs in the marketplace. Companies employ a more direct, one-on-one approach to win over disgruntled customers who scout for change.         
	Following the pesticide controversy in 2003, both Coke and Pepsi chose to lie low for some time before embarking on a calculated BTL path by launching a silent campaign  first among trade partners and then among consumers  in an attempt to remove the misgivings associated with colas.                                 
	The cola majors were simply not visible in the media after the controversy. But they retained their focus on their trade partners by offering them more incentives. Then they started various programmes under consumer schemes and slowly the pesticide issue died. Their experience is a classic example of how such a strategy can help companies tackle crises, said Debraj Bose, a marketing professional-turned-entrepreneur.         
	After three successive blows  the outcome of the 2008 panchayat polls followed by the humiliation in the Lok Sabha polls in 2009 and by-elections to 10 Assembly seats in the same year  in less than two years, the CPM had gone into the civic polls as a battered and bruised force.        
	The Left leaders opted to innovate while deciding on the campaign strategy. The changes  interactive website carrying answers from Left Front chairman Biman Bose, direct letters addressed to city voters from the CPMs Calcutta district committee secretary Raghunath Kushari  reflected a virtue that bubbles up in the face of adversity: humility.         
	Direct communication and interactivity are very important. We should be seen as people who are willing to listen and are flexible enough to admit mistakes, said CPM leader Mohammad Salim while heading for a small group meeting in Garden Reach last week.         
	Usually, banks, hotels and clubs send such direct letters to their target group.        
	Another deviation was a personalised attack on Mamata Banerjee as some posters claimed that she was not allowing her party MPs to attend Parliament and get projects for Bengal. Trinamuls alleged links with Maoists also remained a main theme of the CPMs campaign strategy.         
	Trinamul has so many MPs and is part of the central government with six ministers. Why wont we highlight the negatives? asked Salim, who sounded confident about an improvement in the CPMs vote share.         
	Such attacks on competitors define marketing warfare  just think of Ariel versus Rin or Sprite versus 7Up across products and services.         
	The aggression was, however, missing in the CPMs campaign approach. A resident of Salt Lake was pleasantly surprised when comrades removed the festoons and party flags from his garden the moment he raised an objection.         
	Many in the CPM believe that the changed approach will help the party recover ground.        
	But is it too late? Adman Anurag Hira believes so. Winning over disgruntled voters will be easier said than done, he said.         
	There was this smug arrogance about them and now, all of a sudden, they are going to their voter base with such humility! Unlike other brands, services or corporations, the strategy of winning over unhappy customers by going and talking to them and thereby hoping to retain them is hoping for a lot, and a little too late, said Hira, executive creative director, 141 Designs.         
	By Wednesday morning, it will be clear if the fizzy colas have helped the CPM accomplish what fiery comrades could not last time.

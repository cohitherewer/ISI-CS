The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cloud on Buddha politburo trip   Questions fly but state CPM resists early poll

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Bhattacharjee                                        
	Calcutta, June 3: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees attendance at the weekend politburo meeting of the CPM has become uncertain, it emerged on a day the state party leadership faced withering questions on the civic poll debacle.        
	At least two CPM leaders told The Telegraph that the chief minister was unlikely to attend the politburo meeting in Delhi on Saturday and Sunday because of prior engagements in the state. However, sources in Writers Buildings said the final decision would be taken only tomorrow.        
	If Bhattacharjee does stay away from the politburo, which is certain to discuss the civic poll outcome, it will follow a pattern that was set in the immediate aftermath of the Lok Sabha poll debacle last year.         
	The chief minister had then skipped a few politburo meetings, which was seen as an expression of displeasure towards the central leadership for blaming the state government for the shock result. Bhattacharjee had also offered to step down as chief minister then.        
	The key issue before the CPM now is whether to advance the Assembly polls from May next year, a demand voiced by Mamata Banerjee amid an increasing perception that the chief minister has lost the popular mandate to govern because of the successive setbacks to his party in elections over the past two years.        
	The central leadership so far has not directly blamed Bhattacharjee for the civic poll result but it had more or less washed its hands of the affair yesterday.        
	The party mouthpiece, Peoples Democracy, rejected in an editorial today the need to bring forward the Assembly elections. Sources said the weekly, edited by Sitaram Yechury whose rapport with the Bengal unit is well known, ran the editorial after some initial disinterest from the top leadership. ( )        
	At the CPM state secretariat meeting in Calcutta this evening, participants felt that the party had failed to recover ground lost to the Opposition in the Lok Sabha polls and there were major organisational lapses.        
	But they added that the setback did not justify bringing forward the elections.        
	Most secretariat members backed state party secretary Biman Bose in iterating that the votes of 17 per cent of the electorate did not warrant an acceptance of Mamatas demand that the polls be held this October along with that in Bihar.        
	If the Election Commission goes only by the time guideline, the Bengal Assembly polls can be held anytime after December 12. If the commission gives primacy to logistical convenience, the election can be brought forward to October but the Pujas also fall in the same month.        
	At the state CPMs stocktaking meeting, where Bhattacharjee was present, the leadership said the matter would be further discussed by the politburo this weekend.        
	The sources said the chief minister mostly listened to what the other secretariat members said, interjecting only occasionally.        
	At the meeting, some leaders said the party had to introspect why it suffered stunning reverses in the Red bastions of Burdwan, Hooghly, Bankura and Purulia. The loss in this belt, where the party had managed to weather the Lok Sabha poll onslaught, is expected to figure at the politburo meeting.        
	 The claim by several leaders, including Bhattacharjee, that the party had been able to stem the winds of change was questioned by some who said the false assumption made cadres complacent. On what basis was this assumption made? a party leader asked at the meeting. Obviously, there was not an iota of truth in it.         
	Another leader wanted to know the basis of the claim that the 15 lakh people who had deserted the party in 2009 were on their way back.        
	Reports will be sought from the district leadership on the reasons for the reverses so that corrections can be carried out. The feedback will be discussed at a two-day state committee meeting from June 26. A Left Front meeting will be held on June 9 to review the civic poll results.

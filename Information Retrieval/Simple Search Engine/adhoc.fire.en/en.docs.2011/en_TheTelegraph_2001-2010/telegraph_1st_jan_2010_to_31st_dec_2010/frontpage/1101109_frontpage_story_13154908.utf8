          OUR BUREAU                              
	Nov. 8: The anti-talks faction of the NDFB gunned down 16 people today, hours after security forces shot dead one of its cadres and a week after the outfit threatened to kill 20 Indians for every member killed in fake encounters.         
	The first attack was on a bus.        
	A youth waved down the private bus on its way to Sijusa in East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh from Tezpur in Sonitpur district, in a secluded forested area at Boimara around 5.15 this evening.        
	Two of his accomplices, who were hiding in the jungle, boarded the bus and forced seven passengers to alight at gunpoint.        
	They were lined up by the three militants and gunned down, said a senior police official.        
	The victims have not been identified yet, said the inspector-general of police, northern range, S.N. Singh, over phone on his way to Boimari. But they were all working in Arunachal Pradesh, Singh said.         
	The second attack came at 5.30pm, when at least six militants on three motorcycles opened fire on a barbers shop and an eatery outside Belsiri railway station under Missamari police station, killing five persons.         
	The barber, Parmeswar Thakur from Motihari area in Bihar, was killed along with his wife, Mona Devi Bodo.         
	Those killed at the eatery, Narayan Shah and Bijit Shah, were from Bihars Ara district, while the third, Ramji is also from Motihari.        
	Around 6.30pm, a 70-year-old man, Mohan Das, and his wife Sakuntala, were gunned down at their residence in Kekerikuchi under Tamulpur police station in Baksa district by unidentified assailants.        
	Bhubesh Bhuyan, who was with the couple, was also injured in the attack.        
	Late this evening, a 30-year-old woman, Mali Mandal, was shot dead by suspected NDFB militants at Majbali in Dhekiajuli police station area in Sonitpur.         
	Suspected rebels of the outfit struck again around 8pm, this time in Karbi Anglong district.         
	A team of NDFB militants in fatigues opened fire on a basti in Basu Tiklong village. Dhanjay Gour, 44, died, while Kartik Sahu, 30, was seriously injured.         
	Two persons, Phani Kalita and Dwipen Kalita, were also injured when they were shot at by suspected NDFB rebels at Batashipur area under Dhekiajuli police station.         
	The apparent trigger of the attacks is an encounter in which an NDFB rebel was killed by troops from the 51 Gorkha Regiment in the wee hours today.         
	However, two cadres of the outfit escaped.         
	The deceased militant is yet to be identified.         
	A hunt is on to arrest the rebels and others linked to the NDFB.         
	The security forces recovered a 9mm pistol and three rounds of live ammunition from the slain militant.        
	On November 1, the anti-talks faction of the outfit had threatened to kill 20 or more people for every cadre killed by security forces.         
	From today onwards, if any innocent NDFB cadre were killed by Indian forces in the name of encounter, the Boroland Army (armed wing of the NDFB) would take action against any Indian, B. Jwngkhang, deputy chief of the outfit had said, adding that the threat would be carried out anytime.         
	The warning to the government came on a day when a team, led by Bodoland Territorial Council deputy chief Kampha Borgayary, met anti-talks NDFB chief Ranjan Daimary to prepare the ground for Bodo unity and peace.        
	The army has also launched a massive operation in areas where the attacks have taken place, with troops fanning out to the jungle areas along the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border.         
	Defence spokesperson Col. Rajesh Kalia said troops have begun operations to apprehend the culprits involved in the killings.         
	The killings have come at a time when the state Assembly is in session.        
	According to a reply to an unstarred question by former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta in the Assembly today, it was stated that as many as 1,835 civilians, 266 police personnel, 197 paramilitary and 69 army personnel have been killed in insurgency-related incidents in the state between 2001 and October 31, 2010.         
	The government is likely to face the heat from the Opposition in the House tomorrow.

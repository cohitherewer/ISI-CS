The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ice cream and drive after quiz
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ice cream and drive after quiz
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            Sania Mirza and Shoaib Malik in Hyderabad on Monday (AP)                                   
	Hyderabad, April 6: Under fire from a woman scorned? Pour ice (cream) over her.        
	Shoaib Malik and Sania Mirza cooled off at an ice cream parlour last night on a day police impounded the cricketers passport and after the two had cut a brave face before the media.        
	They poured ice over Ayeshas attempts, smirked a local sports critic after the couple, who plan to tie the knot on April 15, went for a drive long after journalists camping outside Sanias upscale Jubilee Hills home had left.        
	Police today again questioned Hyderabad girl Ayesha Siddiqui, who claims the cricketer married her over phone in June 2002. Sources said she had given the cops the clothes she wore during her alleged stay at a city hotel with Shoaib.        
	The sources said they would send the clothes for a forensic test. After a formal arrest, if any, we will take his blood for DNA, said a source.        
	Hyderabad police commissioner A.K. Khan said the nikaahnama released by the Siddiquis had been sent for forensic tests and Shoaibs passport was being verified for visits Ayesha claims Shoaib made to Hyderabad since their alleged wedding.        
	Sleuths of the central crime station also questioned Shoaib again, but the murky saga of the alleged phone wedding did not appear to have dampened the mood at Sanias residence.        
	Music wafted from the tennis stars bungalow this morning as relatives and friends thronged No. 12 Jubilee Hills.        
	Shoaib, Sania and some family friends visited a mall this evening to buy casuals for the Pakistani all-rounder. He didnt come with much luggage as he expected to return and come back with his family tomorrow, said a family friend who had accompanied them.        
	A PTI report from Delhi quoted the cricketers brother-in-law Imran Malik as saying that Shoaib would not file for anticipatory bail in the case Ayesha had filed.        
	We are not moving any anticipatory bail application as Shoaib is co-operating with the police in the investigation. However, we may go for quashing of the FIR afterwards, PTI quoted Imran as telling a media conference.        
	In Hyderabad, sources said the Mirzas had asked qazis to prepare for the wedding. Shoaib will have to declare his marital status at the time of the nikaah, whether it is his first marriage or second. Based on his declaration, the qazi solemnising the marriage will fill in the detail in the relevant column in the nikaahnama.        
	Anwar Ahmad of Jamia Nizamia, an Islamic deemed university, said both the groom and the qazi were equally liable for penal action if the declaration on the marital status turned out to be false.        
	Both parties have to declare their marital status and sign the nikaahnama at the time of the wedding, said chief qazi Lateef Ali Quadri, under whose jurisdiction Sanias residence falls.        
	Jaffer Javed, a family friend of the Mirzas, said there was no room for any doubt about the wedding.        
	Astrologer Bejan Daruwalla, however, said he was not at all excited about the match.        
	By the grace of Ganesha, the marriage will definitely happen within six months. But six months later, troubles will start again. I dont want to say anything about the future of the marriage because both of them are looking forward to a dream. But things look very difficult.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | I was completely stumped, says Contractor
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                I was completely stumped, says Contractor
                            
	Mumbai, April 30 (PTI): Former India skipper Nari Contractor, who had to return home after being stopped at the gate of the D Y Patil Stadium on last Sunday for not carrying a valid ticket for the IPL final, said that he was flummoxed and wondered how this was allowed to happen by the ticket issuing authorities.        
	I was completely stumped when I was asked for a badge to accompany the ticket. I did not have the badge, as it was not given to me along with the ticket. I just turned around and went back, Contractor told PTI today.        
	I would not blame the gatekeeper. He was doing only his duty. The main issue is how the Mumbai Cricket Association issued these fake tickets (by IPL), the former India Test opener said.        
	Contractor had travelled all the way from his residence in South Mumbai to Nerul in the satellite city of Navi Mumbai  a distance of around 35 km  only to return home without witnessing the summit clash between eventual champions Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians.        
	The former India skipper had not seen any IPL match this season after the MCA boycotted all home matches of Mumbai Indians that were played at the Cricket Club of Indias Brabourne Stadium.        
	The final was the first IPL match I would have seen this season as no passes were issued to me (or others) by MCA for the matches held at the CCI because of the dispute, Contractor said.

          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Ranchi, May 30: Unable to garner support of others after the BJP pulled out of his five-month old coalition government, chief minister Shibu Soren put in his papers with the governor tonight to end 33 days of political uncertainty and paving the way for a possible realignment of political forces to avoid imposition of Presidents rule.         
	Farook asked Soren to act as caretaker chief minister till an alternative arrangement was worked out.         
	Clad in spotless kurta-pyjama and black leather shoes, Soren arrived at Raj Bhavan at 10pm sharp and put in his papers in the presence of a large number of reporters, his principal secretary Sukhdev Singh, a host of MLAs belonging to the JMM and Ajsu camp and Independents Chamra Linda and Videsh Singh.        
	After tendering his resignation, Soren was escorted by his party workers and MLAs to his SUV. He left the Raj Bhavan premises without making a statement, leaving it to Sudesh Mahto and Hemlal Murmu to face the waiting army of mediapersons.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Murmu said the party decided to call it quits as there was no other way out.         
	Now we expect the governor to act according to the constitutional framework. However, we are against imposition of Presidents rule and a mid-term elections in the state, he said.         
	The Soren government, which was formed on December 30 with the support of the BJP-JDU and Ajsu, could complete only five months in office.         
	Farook now has limited options. He can either invite the biggest party or biggest alliance to stake claim to form a new government in the state.         
	The next few days will see hectic political activity to cobble together an alternative government as most parties would not like to see another bout of Presidents rule.         
	The Congress, of course, held its cards closed to its chest. We will get active in forming another government only if the high command asks us to, said the partys legislature party leader, Rajendra Prasad Singh.         
	The Ajsu, perhaps the real loser in the this game of oneupmanship between a desperate BJP and an unpredictable JMM, has been relegated to an also-ran with chief Sudesh Mahto saying that they, too, were against Presidents rule.         
	Our role is over. We will engage ourselves in gardening under Sorens leadership. Those interested in forming an alternative government are always welcome for talks, he said.        
	Sorens resignation today did away with the necessity of the scheduled floor test tomorrow.

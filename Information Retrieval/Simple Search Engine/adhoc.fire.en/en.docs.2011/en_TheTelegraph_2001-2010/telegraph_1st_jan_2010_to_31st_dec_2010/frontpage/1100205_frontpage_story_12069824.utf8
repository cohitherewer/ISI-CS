The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bullet-hit Maoist in city clinic
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bullet-hit Maoist in city clinic
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 4: Police claim to have zeroed in on a Maoist guerrilla lying critically ill at a city nursing home after taking three bullets in a January 27 encounter in Belpahari, West Midnapore.        
	Plain-clothes police have thrown a ring round the Ekbalpore nursing home, which they say belongs to a rebel sympathiser, in an undercover operation after receiving a tip-off from Bankura on Monday.        
	Officers said they were told three other Maoists, injured in the same encounter, were at other city nursing homes that the force had not yet succeeded in identifying.        
	According to police sources, the guerrilla being treated at the Ekbalpore nursing home has remained critical ever since he was admitted exactly a week ago. His code name is Nirmal and investigations suggest he is an important catch.        
	So why are the police not arresting him?        
	He is fighting for his life. If we take him into custody, we too will have to get him admitted to hospital. He is in no position to be interrogated even for five minutes. Well arrest him as soon as he can be questioned, said an officer of the special task force that specialises in probing Maoist activities in Calcutta.        
	He cited a second reason: the need to draw the net around a businessman from Calcuttas Posta area who the police believe is paying for Nirmals treatment. The benefactor apparently runs a successful transport business in the states Maoist-dominated areas.        
	Had we arrested Nirmal immediately after locating him, we would have alerted his well-wishers and possibly not been able to track down the Posta businessman, the officer said.         
	He said the businessman was under watch and that action would be taken against him at an appropriate time.        
	Nirmal is believed to have taken a bullet in the stomach and two in the lower abdomen, one of them in his colon. He will not get a chance to give us the slip, the officer said.        
	Police sources said Nirmal was one of the 150 Maoists who had ambushed a patrol of 30 policemen in Barikul, Bankura, on January 25, killing an assistant sub-inspector and injuring three constables of the India Reserve Battalion.        
	Two days later, the state armed police intercepted the same Maoist squad in the Belpahari jungles and engaged the guerrillas in a four-hour gun battle. The 100-strong police team killed a jeans-clad Maoist and injured Nirmal and the three others now being treated secretly in Calcutta, the sources said.        
	The nature of their injuries was so serious that it was not possible to get them treated in the jungles. They had to be brought to the city, an officer said.        
	He said that some of Nirmals comrades had brought him to the nursing home on January 28 and, having admitted him there, returned to their base in the districts.

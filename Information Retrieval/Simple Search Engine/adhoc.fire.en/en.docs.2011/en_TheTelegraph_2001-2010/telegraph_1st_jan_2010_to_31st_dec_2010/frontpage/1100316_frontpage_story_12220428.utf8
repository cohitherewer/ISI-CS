          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Kalimpong, March 15: The Centre had during the last tripartite talks proposed more powers for a new dispensation under the direct control of the Bengal governor, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha claimed today.        
	The executive committee of the proposed body  to be called the Gorkhaland Autonomous Authority (GAA)  was promised the power to make by-laws on the basis of laws already passed in the Bengal Assembly. The GAA was also given legislative powers on 54 transferred subjects like theatre and culture, management and maintenance of cremation grounds, minor minerals and mineral development, management of land and markets, and town and country planning.         
	The current dispensation, the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, is under the state government and has executive powers only on 45 subjects.        
	Amar Lama, a central committee member of the Morcha, while disclosing the Centres proposal, said: The delegates representing the Centre had come with this proposal during the fourth round of tripartite talks (on December 21, 2009). We did not allow it to be tabled then but the Centre forwarded it to us through the interlocutor. We had not even glanced through the report but we are disclosing it before the public so that they can compare it with the proposal that we had sent to the Centre.         
	The GAA would comprise 20 members of whom 15 were to be nominated by political parties in proportion to the number of seats won by them in the gram panchayat elections. The rest would be nominated by the governor. The Morcha would have to agree to panchayat elections before accepting the GAA.         
	After a year, formal elections would be held to the GAA that would be an interim authority till 2011. Its term could be extended if all the parties to the agreement so wished. In that case, election would be held in every five year.         
	The major drawback that the Morcha found in the proposal was with the territory as only the current DGHC area will then be under the jurisdiction of the new body.         
	The grant-in-aid to be provided to the new body had, however, been kept blank. The Government of India will provide a financial assistance of Rs  crores per annum to the GAA for three years for specific projects identified by the GAA to develop the socio-economic infrastructure in the GAA area, the proposal read. The proposal also considered the absorption of the Gorkhaland Personnel into the existing security forces.

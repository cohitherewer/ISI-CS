          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Priyanka                                  
	Durgapur, April 29: A Class XII girl was found hanging from a tree near Durgapur town last night, the tragedy taking on an unusual edge because she belonged to a family loyal to the Trinamul Congress and had fallen in love with a CPM supporters son.        
	Police have ruled out neither suicide nor murder, especially as Priyanka Haldars knees were bent and touched the ground. Her father Paritosh said he had been receiving threat calls for two weeks and alleged that Priyanka, 18, had been murdered because he was a Trinamul supporter.        
	In a typical case of hanging, the full body weight acts as the strangulating force, tightening the noose around the neck. But if the feet or knees are in contact with the ground, even part of the body weight (such as the weight of a bent head) can strangulate the victim in what doctors call partial hanging  which is why suicide cannot be ruled out though murder must be suspected.        
	In suicide by partial hanging, the victim often has a chance to save herself, for instance by lifting her head or getting up, but may be too confused to do so with the noose restricting blood supply to the brain.        
	The police said preliminary investigations revealed that Priyanka was suffering from depression because her family did not approve of her relationship with the boy, also a Class XII student.        
	Priyanka, a resident of Ambedkar Colony in Durgapur town, had gone to her coaching classes last evening but did not return home.        
	Paritosh, a clerk at a factory in Panagarh, about 25km from Durgapur town, waited till 9.30pm before setting off in search of her, accompanied by some Trinamul workers. He also lodged a missing person diary with the local police. The searchers found the body around 1km from her home.        
	An officer said Priyanka had been in a relationship with a CPM supporters son for the past three years. The police detained the boy and a friend for interrogation but later released the friend.        
	Priyankas boyfriend said she was depressed because her father objected to the relationship as their families had different political views. It could be suicide or murder, said Tapas Pal, the officer in charge of Coke Oven police station.         
	Paritosh said the threat calls would warn him that if he did not leave Trinamul, his daughter would be murdered. I received a threat call yesterday afternoon too, he said.        
	Trinamul supporters led by councillor Biswanath Padial demonstrated in front of the police station this morning. Paritosh has been receiving threat calls from the CPM. The culprit must be immediately arrested, Padial said.        
	Trinamul is trying to give it a political colour, said CPM zonal committee secretary Naren Sikdar, denying any party worker had threatened Paritosh.

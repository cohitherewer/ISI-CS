	Bokaro, Jan. 31: Bokaro police have stopped a local builder from constructing on a 37-acre plot at Maganpur in Chas belonging to chief minister Shibu Sorens wife Rupi.        
	According to records, Soren purchased the land in his wifes name in 1998 by paying Rs 66.75 lakh in cash vide deed No. 6932. He bought the land from businessman Rajendra Kanodia, a resident of Cooperative Colony in Bokaro steel city.        
	The police said the builder, whose identity was not revealed, started construction of a boundary wall two days ago. He was reportedly misled by a group of villagers who claimed that the 37.7-acre plot belonged to them. When the builder began demarcating the plot at Maganpur, under Pindrajora police station of Chas block, about 14km from here, on Thursday, word immediately reached some JMM workers.        
	Villager Pan Babu Ansari said some unidentified people descended on Rupi Sorens plot with earth-movers and started digging and plotting the land on Thursday. Hearing about it, two local youths rushed to the spot and asked the builder to stop construction immediately. They then passed on the message to local JMM leaders and the chief ministers home here.        
	The chief ministers family got in touch with the police, following which the officer in-charge of Pindrajora police station, Nunu Dev Rai, rushed to the spot and stopped work. As soon as we heard that the land belongs to Guruji, we forced the builder to stop work and posted a few securitymen there, said Rai.        
	Bokaro SP Saket Singh told The Telegraph that after getting information from the chief ministers house in Ranchi that the land belongs to the Sorens, he instructed the officer-in-charge to maintain strictly vigil at the spot.        
	All construction works has been stopped and the builder, whose name I do not remember, has been asked to show the documents based on which he undertook construction. Police and senior officials are investigating the matter, said the SP.        
	Though the plot belongs to the chief ministers wife, failure to mention the purchase in the nomination papers filed by Rupi Soren when she contested the Dumka parliamentary elections in 2005 as well as in her income tax return, led to her questioning by the income tax department. This was revealed by Ujjwal Chowdhury, director (investigation), income tax, today.

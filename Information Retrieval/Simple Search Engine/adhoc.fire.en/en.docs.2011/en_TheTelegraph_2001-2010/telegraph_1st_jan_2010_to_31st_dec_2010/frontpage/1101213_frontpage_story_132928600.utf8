	Beijing, Dec 13 (PTI): Terming Premier Wen Jiabao's visit to New Delhi as a "big event" in Sino-India relations, China today said it would address the contentious issues like stapled visas to residents of Jammu and Kashmir as well as India's bid for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.
    "We will not exclude the possibility of discussions on any issue. For the issues such as visas, I believe the working level staff will talk about it between our two countries," Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Hu Zhengyue, who briefed the media here about Wen's visit to India and Pakistan, said.
    Indian officials had said that China has promised to come up with some solution to solve the issue amid reports that some residents of Jammu and Kashmir already started getting regular visas.

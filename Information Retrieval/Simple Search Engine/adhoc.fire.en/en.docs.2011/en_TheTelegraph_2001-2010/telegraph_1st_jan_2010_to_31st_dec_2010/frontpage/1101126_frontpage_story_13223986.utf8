	Washington, Nov. 25: New vistas of cooperation between India and the powerful Jewish lobby in America, which may finally call Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to account, have been opened up with an unusual lawsuit in New York last week.        
	The lawsuit, filed just before the second anniversary of the 2008 terrorist attacks on Mumbai is over the ISIs role in the conspiracy which made 26/11 possible.        
	The significance of the lawsuit does not lie in the summons issued by the court a few days ago to the ISI chief, General Ahmed Shuja Pasha,        
	Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and his deputy Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi, none of whom are likely to appear in a US court.        
	But the case filed by relatives of rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka, who were killed by terrorists at Chhabad House in Mumbai, promises to be a milestone in US-Pakistan relations because Pakistans Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani will be drawn into it as the case unfolds.        
	Kayani, who is now the umpire of Pakistans ruling establishment with a veto on everything from Islamabads relations with India to the course of the US war in Afghanistan, was the ISIs chief when the Mumbai attacks were being planned.        
	If the lawsuit is to run its course in New York, Kayanis role in the ISIs deadly plots against India will be exposed: that will make him a terrorist enabler and render his continuance as Army Chief untenable.        
	Even two decades ago when Washington had absolute double standards on global terrorism, it was then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs acquiescence on paper for the serial bombing of Mumbai in 1993 which got him the boot by then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.        
	Khan, his bitter rival, used those documents in a secret court hearing to press the case against the continuance of Sharif as Prime Minister, arguing that Sharif was unfit to rule because he brought the country almost to war with India through terrorist actions.        
	Although no one will go on record, the latest case is the reflection of a view that has crystallised among a big segment of the American Jewish community that the Pakistani bull must be finally taken by its horns.        
	For several decades, Israel toyed with the idea of having some working equation with Pakistan in the hope that such an arrangement with a large Muslim country would give it elbow room in dealing with the Islamic world with its obvious benefits.        
	That the lawsuit is not some amateur attempt by bereaved relatives of the victims of Pakistan-supported terrorism in Mumbai is evident from the plaintiffs choice of their lawyer: James P. Kreindler was the attorney, whose similar lawsuit in a US court led to a series of diplomatic initiatives culminating in Libyas admission of its role in the terrorist bombing on a Pan Am aircraft over Scotland in 1988, killing all 259 people on board.        
	Kreindler lists his success in securing a $2.7 billion payment from Libya for the victims of Pan Am flight 103 among his proudest professional accomplishments, pointing out that it was the only time any foreign state ever made such a payment to terrorist victims.        
	A press release announcing the case against the ISI acknowledges, however, that lawsuits against terrorists and terror organisations are extremely challenging. Kreindler amp; Kreindler has undertaken this difficult litigation (for Mumbais victims) in order to obtain justice for innocent American victims of terror abroad.        
	As the lawsuit in the Federal Court in the Eastern District of New York state takes its inevitably long-winded course, several things are likely to happen. One, The White House will use the case to twist Kayanis arms into reining in the ISI and cooperating more with Washington on dealing with the Taliban and al Qaida.        
	When that happens, India could benefit from its spin-off if New Delhi monitors the US moves and applies its hand on the right pressure points at appropriate times.        
	Yesterday the Obama administration added the Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, an LeT front, to its terrorist blacklist in a growing recognition that Lashkar is no longer a terrorist outfit with a regional agenda that threatens only India.        
	But if New Delhi works with American Jews in the New York case, the Obama administration will find it that much harder to push under the carpet all it would like do towards insulating Kayani from the case and giving the ISI immunity for its actions against India.        
	With a mountain of evidence that India possesses about the Mumbai attacks, it has a whip hand in the case, but what remains to be seen is whether New Delhi will cave in to the inevitable pressure from the Pentagon and from Langley, the CIA headquarters, not to expose all it knows as the lawsuit progresses.

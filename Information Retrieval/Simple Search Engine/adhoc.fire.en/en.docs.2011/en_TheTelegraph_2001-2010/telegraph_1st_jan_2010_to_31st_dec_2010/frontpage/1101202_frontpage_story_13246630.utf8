	Imphal, Dec. 1: The people of Manipur have demanded that Sana Yaima, chairman of the United National Liberation Front (UNLF), whose arrest from Bihar was finally announced yesterday, be treated with respect.         
	A large number of supporters gathered at the airport expecting him to be brought here today. When they realised that he would not arrive today, Yaimas supporters demonstrated at Kwakeithel, along Imphal Airport Road, shouting slogans and demanding a democratic settlement to the Manipur conflict.        
	Bihar police yesterday claimed Yaima was arrested from Motihari in East Champaran district. He was produced before the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Motihari, and given a three-day transit remand.        
	East Champaran superintendent of police Paras Nath said Sana Yaima was holed up somewhere on the Indo-Nepal border for some time to avoid detection.         
	Manipur director-general of police Yumnam Joykumar Singh today said a fax message was received late last night about the arrest and his family was immediately informed.        
	The police chief said he might not be sent to Manipur immediately and could be taken to Delhi for questioning.        
	The development came as the people of Manipur and the Okram Ibobi Singh government were seeking the whereabouts of Yaima after reports that he was arrested from Dhaka in September.        
	Yaima has not been to his Imphal city home for more than 30 years.        
	At the airport, the reaction of Yaimas supporters was a mixture of relief and anger. Delhi is playing a dirty game and its dishonesty has been exposed by the Sana Yaima case. He should be given respectable treatment while in custody because he is a leader of Manipur, a relieved Th. Ramani Devi, general secretary of Nupi Samaj, a powerful womens organisation, said.        
	It is because of peoples voice that the government produced him, said Soibam Momon, president of the All Manipur Tammi Chingmi Apunba Nupi Lup (another womens organisation).        
	Oinam Bikramjit, general secretary of United Peoples Front, demanded a political solution to the armed conflict in Manipur.        
	Those gathered at the airport were unanimous that the people would support any decision  political dialogue or rejection of talks  taken by Sana Yaima, but he should first take into account what the people wanted before coming to any conclusion.        
	There should be a political solution to Manipurs problem. But the Sana Yaima case is not the right approach. The governments role in the arrest drama smacks of dishonesty, former chief minister and NCP president Radhabinod Koijam said.

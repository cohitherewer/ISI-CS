The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Model code axe on police transfers
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Model code axe on police transfers
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 1: The election commission today stayed the transfer of 15 IPS officers, issued by the state government on November 25, citing the model code of conduct imposed for the ongoing five-phased panchayat polls in Jharkhand.        
	We have declared the transfer orders null and void after going through the nitty-gritty. The model code of conduct is in vogue and concerned IPS officers were directly or indirectly involved with security arrangements for the elections, state election commission secretary M.K. Jha told The Telegraph.         
	The state election commission, which allowed the reshuffle of a dozen IAS officers also announced on November 25, however, left room for the government to order transfers of an emergent nature but only if it sought permission from the commission with proper justification.        
	The state government had approached the commission with a list of about 30 police officers, including inspectors, sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors, but today, it allowed the transfer of only two junior officers not associated with election duty.        
	Rest of the police officers were found to be involved with election work, said a poll panel source.         
	On November 25,the state government transferred as many as 15 senior police officers  all IPS officers with ranks ranging from inspector general to sub-divisional police officer posted in various districts of the state.         
	The names also included Dhanbad SP Suman Gupta who is in the eye of the storm over a custody death in her district. The government also reshuffled a dozen IAS officers, including home secretary Rajbala Verma.         
	But, the transfers invited the wrath of the election commission. The next day, it sent a letter to chief secretary A.K. Singh, asking the government to refrain from transferring IPS officers directly or indirectly involved with the elections.         
	Later, the government temporarily stayed the transfers and approached the poll panel for a post-facto approval. Accordingly, DGP Neyaz Ahmed did not issue movement orders for the police officers.        
	Todays poll panel decision sets back the transfers by at least a month, as the model code will be in place throughout December.

          CITHARA PAUL                                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: This Independence Day, two of the three winners of the Presidents Police Medal for Gallantry were Muslims.        
	By giving their lives for the country, Mushtaq Hussain Shah and Nissar Hussain, both Kashmiris who won the highest police honour posthumously, appeared to have highlighted what should have been obvious in the first place.        
	We Muslims are forced to wear our patriotism on our sleeves unlike any other community in the country. That many Muslims have won the police award posthumously should be an eye-opener, said Ifthikhar Ahmed of Al Ilahiya Education Trust, an NGO.        
	Also, for the first time, almost 10 per cent of all the police medal winners were Muslims  70 out of 718.        
	It is indeed a proud moment for the entire community whose loyalties have always been under suspicion. The fact that 10 per cent of the award winners are Muslims shows that we are not behind anyone when it comes to patriotism, said Amanulla Khan of the NGO Jamia Islamia, which works with the minority community.        
	Two Muslims from Bengal  Sheikh Mohammed Kalimuddin and Sahadat Hossain  won the Police Medal for Meritorious Service.        
	In my working life there could be nothing better than this. Im grateful to everyone in my department. In the police force, we are all equal; no one discriminates between a Muslim and a Hindu, said Sahadat, a constable in Murshidabad.        
	Kalimuddin, an inspector at Calcuttas Alipore police station, said: Im very happy. This will help my juniors realise that hard work and dedication is always rewarded.        
	The medals tally looks even better when read with the Sachar Commission report, which revealed that only 4 per cent of Indian Police Service officers were Muslims. The report said Muslims were under-represented in police forces across the country.        
	Andhra Pradesh is the only state with a higher percentage of Muslims in the police (15) than in the population (10). The other states with over 10 per cent Muslim representation in their police are Jammu and Kashmir (57 per cent), Kerala (14) and Assam (12). The states with the lowest figures are Tamil Nadu (2 per cent), Delhi (3), and Bihar, Gujarat and Maharashtra (all 5 per cent).

          SANJAY K. JHA                            Singh at the summit in New Delhi on Saturday. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, accused of silence in the past few days, slipped into a chatty mood today and said he sometimes felt like a high school student, going from one test to another.        
	It is often said that these are testing times. In fact, I cannot help feeling that we in India are living always through testing times. Indeed, as Prime Minister I sometimes feel like a high school student, going from one test to another, Singh said, drawing laughs and loud applause at the Hindustan Times Summit.        
	Appearing relaxed amid all the noise over the 2G spectrum issue, the Prime Minister added: The good news is that despite all the difficulties we have to go through and for which we are being tested, we as a nation are winning. Indians are winning.... We must be doing at least some things right.        
	Singh, whose party and government yesterday went on the front foot to counter the Opposition onslaught, said India had a way of turning crisis into opportunity and even allowed himself a rare pat on the back.        
	Looking back at how we have handled crises in the past, I am struck by the brighter side of things. Each time, we have been able to turn a crisis into an opportunity, he said, before going on to cite the reforms initiated in the nineties when he was finance minister as one such instance. Looking back after two decades, one can say we did manage to do reasonably well.        
	If Singh appeared to be at ease at the morning meeting, the mood stretched to a lunch he hosted for former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at home. Some of those who attended the lunch felt that a relaxed Singh was enjoying the company of Brown, who was chancellor of the exchequer for 10 years.        
	The Prime Minister played the gracious host not just to Brown but to all the guests, and had a word or two and a warm smile for every one of them.        
	Accused by the BJP of being part of a conspiracy of silence on corruption following adverse comments from the Supreme Court, the Prime Minister today said: There should be no doubt in anybodys mind that if any wrong thing has been done by anybody, he or she will be brought to book. We are ready to discuss all issues. We are not afraid of discussions. I appeal to all political parties to let Parliament do its work.        
	The government today filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, which had questioned the Prime Ministers delay in replying to Subramanian Swamys letters on the 2G spectrum issue. Singh had directed his legal team to restrict its response to the factual position but the Congress is happy with Kapil Sibals media offensive yesterday and relieved that the minister had sent across the message that Swamy had no locus standi in the matter.        
	Although the party would not comment on the courts observations on the delay, spokesperson Shakil Ahmed said: It was truly laudable for a Prime Minister of 120 crore people to have responded to the letter of a non-serious person.        
	Asked why the court should pull up the Prime Minister over a non-serious persons petition, Ahmed said: I have nothing to say on the Supreme Court. But the nation should understand that the Prime Minister gets hundreds of letters daily. Hats off to the Prime Minister for taking note of the complaint. He referred it to the department concerned and wanted to ascertain the facts. This has to be appreciated.        
	The party also went on the offensive on the larger issue of corruption, with spokesperson Manish Tiwari describing the BJP as an epitome of immorality with no right to preach.

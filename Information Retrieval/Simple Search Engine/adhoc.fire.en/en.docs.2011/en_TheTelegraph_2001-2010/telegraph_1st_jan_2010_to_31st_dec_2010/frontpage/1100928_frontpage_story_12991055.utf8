	New Delhi, Sept. 27: Computer scientist Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay credits her parents and her husband with allowing her  at times even pushing her  to seek out the molecular mechanisms that underlie cancer, which has got her picked for Indias top science prize.        
	Bandyopadhyay, a professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta, has been applying computer science techniques to search for and analyse the working of micro-RNAs  a set of molecules implicated in several diseases, including cancer.        
	She is among three women in the group of nine scientists selected for the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prizes for 2010  a record in the 52-year history of Indias highest science awards that have so far gone to only 14 women among 463 scientists.        
	While the number of women among Bhatnagar winners is disproportionately small, the 2010 awardees and senior scientists said this shouldnt surprise anyone given the challenges women scientists encounter in attempts to balance lab with home.        
	Only scientists below 45 years of age can receive the Bhatnagar Prizes given for outstanding research achievements. Instituted by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), each award carries a citation, a plaque and a cash reward of Rs 5 lakh.        
	Time just runs out for many women scientists who take a break for the family, said Mitali Mukherjee, a scientist at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, who won the 2010 prize for medical sciences for her role in exploring the genome of Indian populations.        
	Several things have to fall in place, said Shubha Tole, a scientist at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai, a 2010 prize winner for biological sciences. Tole has spent the past decade unravelling the genetic mechanisms that dictate the structure of regions of the brain that control language, memory and emotions.        
	I had a great team of students and post-doctoral fellows, a very supportive department, and family support, said Tole, whose husband Sandeep Trivedi, a physicist also at the TIFR, had himself won the Bhatnagar Prize in 2005.        
	With all that, you need to pull off your research before competitors in the West do it, said Tole, whose work has revealed key mechanisms involved in the development of the hippocampus  the centre of learning and memory  and the amygdala, the zone of emotions in the brain.        
	At the IGIB, Mukherjee has co-ordinated a nationwide project to analyse the genomes of Indian population groups  different communities  that is expected to provide new insights into the links between diseases and genes.        
	The project on genome variations has also revealed the historical proximity or distances between different population groups in the country.        
	Its heartening to see a third of the prizes go to women  were hoping our future leaders emerge from these winners, said Samir Brahmachari, the director-general of the CSIR.        
	In earlier times, social conditioning encouraged women to compromise  and any compromise on research would make women drop out of the competition, said Bandyopadhyay who has been selected for the 2010 prize in engineering sciences. But this is changing now.        
	It was while doing her PhD at the ISI, Calcutta  after studying physics at Presidency College and switching to BTech in computer science at Jadavpur University  that Bandyopadhyay gravitated towards machine intelligence, a branch within the quest for artificial intelligence.         
	The search for molecules in biology is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Machine intelligence allows us to significantly reduce the size of the haystack  and the search becomes easier, she said.        
	Eventually, Bandyopadhyay said, knowledge of the functions of micro-RNAs and how they disrupt specific cellular machinery in cancers is expected to contribute to the design of new lines of therapy. Pharmacologists could use such knowledge to create new molecules that cancel the effects of misbehaving micro-RNAs, she said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, March 23: The hopes of 150 workers to be made permanent employees of Rani tea estate were burnt to ashes yesterday when a mob went on the rampage and set ablaze parts of the garden.        
	The proprietor of the estate, Mridul Kumar Bhattacharjee, shot dead a Class VIII student and injured four others while trying to disperse a crowd that had gathered near his bungalow to protest against his alleged assault a woman yesterday morning.        
	The killing triggered mob frenzy, turning the picturesque tea estate into a war zone by afternoon.         
	After the fire died down today, labour leaders began counting the losses.        
	The labourers were to be made permanent from April 1 and were to get free medical aid, subsidised ration and all other facilities like other tea estates in Assam.         
	Its gone now. With the factory reduced to ashes, it is unlikely the estate will reopen soon, said S.S. Gaur, secretary of the Kamrup district Asam Chah Mazdoor Sangha, the apex body of tea labourers in the state.         
	Gaur, along with the office bearers of ACMS, visited the garden today to meet the labour leaders but found no one.         
	All the labourers have fled as the mob burnt down their residential quarters. Some houses were still smouldering this morning, he said.         
	Most of the quarters were burnt from inside with only the barren structure remaining.        
	The general secretary of the Assam Tea Tribes Students Association (ATTSA), Pallab Lochan Das, said no one noticed the mob burning the labour quarters, located about 2km south of the factory.         
	We have no idea where they (labourers) have fled and whether anyone was injured, Das, who also visited the garden today, said.         
	The tea estate has only 11 permanent workers and others are temporary.         
	The owner ferried experienced workers from his other tea estate, Satrupa in Tinsukia, during the peak production season.                                       
	The process of making 150 employees permanent was almost complete and the final papers were supposed to be signed on April 1. It is a great loss for the labourers, the ACMS secretary said.         
	He said the ACMS would approach the government to provide a rehabilitation package to the labourers so that they can get some relief till the estate reopens.         
	With the tea-producing factory almost in ashes, it is unlikely that the estate will reopen soon, but the security personnel are taking no chances.         
	A posse of police personnel has been deputed to guard the factory, or what remains of it, and the proprietors bungalow.         
	Rani tea factory only produces orthodox tea and exports its product to European countries.         
	Bhattacharjee was today remanded in judicial custody by the chief judicial magistrates court here. He has been booked under Section 302 for murder and relevant sections of the Arms Act.         
	A case has been registered at Palasbari police station in this connection.         
	The body of Pradip Murari was consigned to flames amidst a large gathering near his village today.         
	The villagers are not agitated as they were yesterday but their mood said: It is unlikely that Bhattacharjee can return to rebuild Rani again.

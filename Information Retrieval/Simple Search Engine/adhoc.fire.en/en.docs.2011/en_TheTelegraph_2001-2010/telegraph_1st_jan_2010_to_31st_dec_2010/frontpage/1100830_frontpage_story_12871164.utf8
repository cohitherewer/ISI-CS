The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Talks begin as Ayodhya day nears

          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: The Congress has started a quiet dialogue with Hindu and Muslim leaders ahead of the court verdict on the disputed Ayodhya site title suits expected in September.        
	The dialogue, being conducted both formally and informally, is aimed at limiting the possibility of a violent eruption after Allahabad High Court gives its verdict, not to attempt any out-of-court settlement. The verdict has the potential to rock the largely steady political order, particularly in the Hindi heartland.        
	The Manmohan Singh government is worried because the Congress is likely to be the worst loser in a polarised political atmosphere. Both the BJP and forces like the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal revel in a surcharged political climate. Hence, they are eagerly waiting to interpret the verdict to suit their political agenda, a Congress leader said.        
	Government sources said consultations had been held with Muslim clerics, heads of ulemas, All India Muslim Personal Law Board members and Muslim political leaders on the ramifications of the verdict.        
	The effort had been to convince all that the verdict should not be treated as political fodder because the government/party had nothing to do with it, the sources said. The Congress had suffered much after the Babri Masjid demolition and did not want the wounds re-opened, they added.        
	A Congress source said the party was also trying to reach out to Hindu religious leaders not deeply entrenched with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Some channels of communication have been opened with some leaders, including shankaracharyas, who are not in the VHP clique. The government will appeal to the BJP too, but their course of action will be decided by the RSS.        
	Besides, the government and the Congress core committee had already discussed related issues and measures to maintain law and order, the sources said.        
	Congress leaders said the minorities were unlikely to create problems if the verdict went against them and would possibly opt to move the Supreme Court. However, the VHP had already started making ominous noises that a negative verdict would not be acceptable to it. It had also asked the Prime Minister to enact a law awarding the Ramjanmabhoomi to Hindus as matters of faith could not be decided by the courts.        
	In contrast, a Muslim group had recently given the impression that it favoured an out-of-court settlement in a letter to the Prime Minister, the sources said. Javed Habeeb, All India Babri Masjid Action Committee chairman, wrote: Make another effort by yourself and through any representative of the central government to bring together L.K. Advani and other national leaders to find out an out-of-court settlement of the matter even before the court verdict is spelt.        
	The suggestion was, however, rejected by other Muslim groups who insisted nothing should be done before the verdict. Zafaryab Jilani, an All India Muslim Personal Law Board member, told The Telegraph: Habibs letter has been misunderstood. What he meant was that there will be need for negotiations even after the verdict and the government should try to bring both the sides together at that stage.        
	Jilani asserted: There is no question of talks before the judgment. There is no question of direct talks with the VHP even after the judgment. The government should act as a mediator in that case.        
	Such posturing has deepened Congress fears that the Sangh parivar might go to any extent to exploit the verdict for its political revival in Uttar Pradesh. Congress leaders said the BJP and the VHP would likely take credit if the verdict went in their favour and launch a Hindu pride movement, which would spark high-voltage tension.        
	Again, if the verdict went in favour of the Muslims, the Sangh could go berserk and launch an agitation against Hindu hurt, they said.        
	The leaders feared the Samajwadis and the RJD would exploit Muslim anguish if the verdict went against them.         
	We cannot speak the language of either these forces or the BJP, and be a loser. We can only pray this issue doesnt flare up beyond a point. We hope the leadership of Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Nitin Gadkari wont be able to do what Advani did in the eighties, a Congress leader said.        
	There are four title suits on which hearings have been completed. They were filed by Gopal Singh Visharad of Hindu Mahasabha (1950), Nirmohi Akhara (1959), UP Sunni Central Wakf Board (1961) and a group of Hindus (1989).         
	The court has to decide whether a temple existed at the site before the Babri Masjid was built.

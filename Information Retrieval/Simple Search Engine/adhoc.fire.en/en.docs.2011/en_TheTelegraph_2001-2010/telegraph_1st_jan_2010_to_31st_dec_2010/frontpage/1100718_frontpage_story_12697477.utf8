                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Qureshi call
                            
	Pakistans foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi telephoned external affairs minister S.M. Krishna late on Saturday night in an attempt to make up for his undiplomatic behaviour during the just concluded Indo-Pak talks and proposed at least a pull aside meeting between them next week in Kabul, where the two ministers will attend a conference on Afghanistan.        
	Qureshis attempt to make amends is partly said to have been prompted by a phone call to Krishna from US secretary of state Hillary Clinton on Saturday, during which the Indian minister discussed his trip to Islamabad with his US counterpart.

  - SC order on Meghalaya tribals plea        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: The Supreme Court today ordered Lafarge Umiam Mining Pvt Ltd and Lafarge Surma Cement Ltd to halt mining limestone at Phlangkaruh in Nongtrai of Meghalayas East Khasi Hills district for use in their cement plant in Bangladesh.         
	The orders were passed by a three-judge green bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, on the basis of a petition filed by Shella Action Group, an association of tribals from the state.         
	The two companies, units of French industrial company Lafarge, had been mining limestone from captive mines in the hills under interim orders of the apex court. The mined materials were transported through an elevated conveyor belt passing through Shella village in East Khasi Hills.         
	The apex court had permitted the two companies to resume mining on November 23, 2007 as an interim measure after the ministry of environment and forests, in a letter issued on April 30, 2007, directed them to stop all non-forest activities, including clearing any natural vegetation, breaking fresh area and mining of any mineral.         
	That letter had pointed out that mining activities were being carried out on land bearing thick, natural forests on the basis of an environmental clearance obtained by allegedly misrepresenting facts.         
	These companies allegedly procured the clearance by stating that there was no diversion of forest land or displacement of people involved in the project. Natural, virgin forest land was declared as wasteland and non-forest areas, a petition, filed by the action group stated.         
	These are scheduled tribal lands, the groups counsel, P.S. Narasimha, said. Such lands cannot be transferred to non-tribals under the Sixth Schedule.         
	The petition also alleged that these lands had been mortgaged to foreign banks and institutions such as the ADB and the International Finance Corporation.         
	The illegal mining activities have destroyed the environment and ecology of the area and denuded tribal villagers of their precious assets like mines, agricultural lands and forests, adversely affecting their economic empowerment, economic justice, social status and dignity of person, the petition stated.         
	The illegal mining activities, if allowed to continue, would be disastrous to the environment and ecology of the area, it stated. Cherrapunjee, once the wettest area in the world, falls in this area.         
	The petition stated that mining and subsequent denudation of hills had affected rainfall in the state. In 2007, Meghalaya recorded 40 per deficit rainfall which was alarming.               
	The state counsel, however, urged the court not to stay the mining, saying it was against the states investment climate and its aspirations.

	Beijing, Nov 29 (PTI): About 100 children were injured today in a stamped at a primary school in northwest China, the official media said today.
    Students of the school in Aksu City of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region were heading downstairs to the playground for after-class exercise when some of them fell and triggered the stampede, said a spokesman with the Municipal Publicity Department.
    The injured students were immediately taken to a local hospital and no death has been reported so far, state-run Xinhua news agency reported quoting the spokesman.
    The school has more than 1,800 students in its rolls.

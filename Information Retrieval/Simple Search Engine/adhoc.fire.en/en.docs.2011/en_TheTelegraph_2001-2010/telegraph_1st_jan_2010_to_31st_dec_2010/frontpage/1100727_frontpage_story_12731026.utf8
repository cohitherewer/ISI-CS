The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bose steals bosss distant thunder
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bose steals bosss distant thunder
  - Biman confirms what Karat wont: Basu did write note in 2008           OUR BUREAU                                                          (From top) Prakash Karat, Jyoti Basu and Somnath Chatterjee      
	New Delhi, July 26: Alimuddin Street playing hard to get, Prakash Karat has fired at Somnath Chatterjee from the more hospitable terrain of AKG Bhavan in Delhi.        
	Not that Alimuddin Street, where the CPM Bengal hub is located, did not pay lip service to general secretary Karat but it ended up confirming what the central leadership would not: Jyoti Basu did write a note to the politburo in 2008.        
	A CPM politburo statement from Delhi termed Chatterjees disclosures on the events that followed the partys withdrawal of support to UPA I in 2008 post-facto justifications of a person who defected to the ruling establishment. The statement stressed that Chatterjee had made false assertions in his memoirs that will be released by the Prime Minister on August 21.        
	However, the politburo maintained a studied silence on the former Speakers disclosure that Basu had written the note saying he should preside over the proceedings on the confidence motion in 2008. Karat had wanted Chatterjee to step down as Speaker after the CPM withdrew support to UPA I over the nuclear deal with the US.        
	The politburo today neither denied nor confirmed Basus note but Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose, apparently fielded to discount suggestions of differences, let the cat out of the bag, unwittingly or otherwise. The late Basus handwritten note was sent to the politburo. So, how did Chatterjee get access to it when he was not a member of the apex body? Bose asked today in Calcutta while fulfilling his party-assigned task of rubbishing the expelled veterans charges.                            
	While Bose did try to live up to the communist tradition of circling the leaders wagon, the Bengal unit he heads had resisted pressure from Karat to issue a rejoinder yesterday itself to Chatterjees revelations.         
	The Bengal unit, many leaders of which share a good rapport with Chatterjee, holds Karat responsible for making the Left Fronts task more arduous by driving the Congress into the arms of the Trinamul Congress.        
	Sources said that at one stage on Sunday, when Karat was in Calcutta for a party meeting, a proposal was mooted to get the politburo issue a rebuttal in the name of the state party unit. But eventually, the statement had to wait till Karat, who had said yesterday my party will respond, returned to Delhi.        
	Even then, the politburo glossed over Chatterjees specific disclosure that Basu had written the note.        
	The statement sought to dismiss the Basu episode, saying it was unfortunate that Chatterjee has sought to draw Comrade Jyoti Basus name into this matter when he is no more.        
	Bose also laid stress on the same point. Jyotibabu is no more. So, one should not put words into his mouth. Communist etiquette does not allow such a behaviour, he said.        
	But Chatterjee, who is sometimes seen on the dais with CPM leaders at meetings in Bengal, put Boses comments in perspective with a disarming question: What should I say about Biman since he is like my younger brother?        
	But what I felt about the situation after I was expelled, I had put it in words. Now people would judge me when my book is officially launched. The present controversy around my yet to be released book is unwelcome, Chatterjee told The Telegraph.        
	Bose was speaking to reporters after a Left Front meeting on price hike, before which he was closeted with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for half an hour.        
	A CPM state committee member pointed out that party discipline demanded Bose contest the charges levelled by Chatterjee. We may have a soft corner for Somnathda. We often invite him to our events. But that does not mean we shall publicly go against Karats decision. After all, he is our boss, the member said.        
	The politburo statement accused Chatterjee of betraying the party. It claimed that Chatterjee in a letter to the party had agreed to abide by the party decision and step down as Speaker. He later backed out from this commitment to abide by the party decision, the statement said.         
	It also contested the claim that the decision to expel Chatterjee from the party was taken only by five members of the politburo. The decision to take disciplinary action against Somnath Chatterjee was taken at a full politburo meeting held on July 19, 2008, the statement said.         
	The statement claimed that the politburo had decided to convey to Chatterjee its decision that he should forthwith resign and expel him if he refused to do so. The politburo concluded that if he refused to do so, he should be expelled from the party as it would amount to helping the Congress-led government.        
	Making an effort to make the expulsion foolproof on technical grounds, the statement said the central committee of party had met a day after the politburo meeting on July 20, 2008, and authorised the politburo to take disciplinary action if Chatterjee violated the party line.         
	The former Speaker strongly reacted to the politburo statement. Ask them how many were present at the July 23 meeting. I had spoken about the July 23 meeting, Chatterjee said.         
	Chatterjee was expelled on July 23, 2008, a day after the trust vote in the Lok Sabha.

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                        
	Hyderabad, July 2: Andhra Pradesh police claimed to have killed the Maoists number three leader, Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad, in a pre-dawn forest gunfight today but the rebels alleged a fake encounter.        
	Azad, a member of the CPI (Maoist) politburo, had last week rejected an offer of talks by P. Chidambaram, saying the terms set by the Union home minister were unacceptable.         
	In the rebel hierarchy, Azad was next in importance to CPI (Maoist) chief Muppalla Laxmana Rao alias Ganapathi and M. Koteswar Rao alias Kishan. He is the highest-ranked Maoist leader killed by the security forces.        
	Azad was among several Maoist leaders who had been scouting for safe hideouts in Andhra after the security forces stepped up the heat in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.        
	However, this policy has cost the rebels the lives of several operatives at the hands of Andhra police in the past few months, including those of Shakamuri Appa Rao and Kondal Reddy.        
	Andhra has repeatedly shown an ability to strike hard at the Maoists, which the Centre feels is the result of nurturing of local strengths.        
	This mornings alleged encounter took place near Jogapur in the Wankhidi forests of Adilabad district, about 300km from here and 15km from the Maharashtra border, the police said.        
	Another guerrilla, Sahdev, who had apparently come to escort Azad to the Dandakaranya forests, too was killed. The police claim to have seized an AK-47, a 9mm pistol and two kit bags.        
	Azads mother Karuna and poet Varavara Rao have approached Andhra Pradesh High Court saying Azad and Sahdev had been arrested yesterday at Bitaburdi in Nagpur, brought to Adilabad and shot in cold blood.        
	Azad had been in the news recently for his answer to Chidambarams letter of May 31, written to rights activist Swami Agnivesh who had agreed to mediate between the Centre and the rebels. Chidambaram had said talks were possible if the Maoists abjured violence for 72 hours, and did not demand that the guerrillas lay down arms.        
	On June 25, Azad wrote to Agnivesh: The government is not keen to pursue the talks sincerely. It only wants to buy time and find out about our strategies.        
	The Maoists had paid a heavy price in Andhra after participating in talks with the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government in October 2005.         
	After the talks failed, the police  who had tracked the Maoists routes as they emerged from their forest lairs  launched a series of successful raids on their hideouts, virtually driving them out of the state.        
	Azad was accused in 16 cases of murder, arson and attacks on the security forces. He was arrested by the Andhra police last March but escaped.        
	Azad had studied at the Korukonda Sainik School and done his MTech from the National Institute of Technology, Warangal. He had been a Maoist for four decades.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Govt averse to Ayodhya role 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Govt averse to Ayodhya role 
  - UPA not to initiate mediation efforts         SANJAY K. JHA                      Rahul Gandhi has dubbed the RSS lsquo;fanatical rsquo;, equating it with Simi.                                
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: The UPA government has decided not to initiate any mediation for an out-of-court settlement on the Ayodhya dispute as it prefers the Supreme Court take the final view.        
	Top government sources today told The Telegraph that a reconciliation process was welcome but it was not the governments job.        
	The government has its own limitations vis--vis judicial proceedings. If the two parties agree to reach a settlement in a societal or religious dispute, they can do that. Non-government agencies, civil society representatives and community leaders can help the process, one of the sources said.        
	These sources feel that the leadership wants to send out a message that some redress mechanism was still available to all the parties and the high court verdict should not be treated as the final word.         
	Debate in the society is normal. But nobody should feel vindicated or disappointed at this stage, a source said, explaining the governments thinking on the issue.        
	The Congress Working Committee, too, had indicated that the party would not get involved in the conciliation process.         
	One of the reasons the Congress and the government are wary of mediation is the absence of a clear representative structure on the two sides. We cannot accept that the BJP or the VHP or the RSS represents Hindus. Similarly, there is no clear representative of the Muslim community. The best option is to wait for the Supreme Court to take a view, a source in the government said.        
	Although there was some concern about the dismay in the Muslim community initially, the government is confident that the situation change sooner than later.        
	Hoping that people will take into account the comprehensive picture before reaching a conclusion, the source pointed to the unprecedented mobilisation of forces throughout the country in the run-up to the verdict that ensured an incident-free phase after the judgment.        
	A senior Congress leader said: We have proven that the government is not weak and the mischief-makers would be crushed with full force.        
	He added: The government proved that 2010 was not 1992. There was a shadow of doubt over the governments intention in 1992 (when P.V. Narasimha Rao was in power) but the kind of efforts this government made should convince every Indian citizen that the state was in full control and committed to its agenda of development for which peace is a pre-requisite. There is nothing to fear  both Hindus and Muslims should rest assured. There should not be even the slightest doubt about the governments intentions.        
	Government sources have chosen to stress this point only after intelligence reports suggested unease among Muslims.        
	The mood of the nation has changed, peoples concerns are different. This is a tribute to what Singh and Sonia Gandhi have done to the collective way of thinking. These leaders have decisively set the national agenda which is so different from what was done to the nation by L.K. Advani and associates in the nineties. This should not be forgotten, a PMO official told The Telegraph.        
	He said the Prime Minister took personal interest in the issue in the past few weeks and ensured that the state machinery was fully geared up to meet any untoward incident.        
	Asked if Manmohan Singh was happy with the nature of the verdict that has been viewed as weak on legal grounds, the PMO official said: The government has no control over the judicial process. Our concern is to ensure safety of every citizen and nobody will be allowed to vitiate the atmosphere. The Prime Minister is very firm on that.

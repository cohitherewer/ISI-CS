The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ulfa to decide on talks soon
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ulfa to decide on talks soon
  - Jailed leaders mull issue, says peacenik        A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, Jan. 29: Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa has said a decision on a dialogue with the government would be taken soon, with jailed leaders of the outfit holding marathon discussions on the issue.         
	Quoting Rajkhowa, whom he met yesterday, former commander of the outfits 28 battalion Mrinal Hazarika said he had offered co-operation of his group towards resolving the issue at the earliest.         
	Hazarika had a brief meeting with Rajkhowa, when the outfits chairman was brought to the Regional Dental College for treatment.         
	During our meeting, we explained our position to him and offered our wholehearted co-operation. He told us that the central leaders of the outfit at Guwahati Central Jail were holding discussions on the issue and are likely to arrive at a final decision (on holding talks with the government) very soon, Hazarika said.         
	If they wish, then we are also willing to join them in the greater interest of the state, he said.         
	Hazarika was part of the group which declared unilateral ceasefire in June 2008 and then submitted a charter of demands to the government listing, among other things, full autonomy for the state.         
	He said the government should not impose preconditions vis--vis the talks.         
	Both sides should not impose any precondition as it may create hurdles in holding dialogue. The agenda for the talks can be finalised at the negotiating table, Hazarika said.         
	He also appealed to the government to release the jailed central Ulfa leaders to facilitate early talks.         
	No meaningful talks can be held with handcuffs on. If we have to find a permanent solution to the insurgency problem, talks must be held with full dignity and honour, he said.         
	Ulfa leaders need to be released from jail so that they can hold consultation with a cross-section of people and mobilise public opinion for talks. Otherwise, any agreement reached between them and the government will not be accepted by the people, he said.         
	Hazarika also made an appeal to Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua to come forward for talks.         
	We want Paresh Barua also to join the peace process but one cant wait for him endlessly. Dialogue must start even if Barua refuses to be a part of the peace process, he said.         
	Hazarika said greater autonomy for Assam would be a pragmatic solution to fulfil the aspirations of various ethnic communities of the state.         
	Greater autonomy for Assam will solve the problems. It will function like a federating unit where all indigenous groups will have political roles to play, he added.

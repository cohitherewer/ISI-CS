          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 9: Raj Bhavan today declared four more districts as drought-hit, in a measured reaction to an ongoing political clamour to classify the entire state as parched.        
	Todays decision, taken a week after Governor M..H. Farook declared 12 of the states 24 districts as drought- hit, pertains to Gumla, Deoghar, Hazaribagh and Garhwa since it was found that these four districts, too, were facing rain deficit, adversely affecting plantation of paddy and other crops.         
	The governors advisory council will be giving post-facto approval to the decision tomorrow, adviser V.S. Dubey told The Telegraph.        
	Under the criteria fixed by the Centre, a state/district should have received less than 50 per cent of the normal rainfall and achieved less than 50 per cent of the targeted crop coverage. On August 3, the governors council declared 12 districts as drought-hit. These were Latehar, Ramgarh, Chatra, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Khunti, East Singhbhum, Jamtara, Palamau, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Ranchi and Giridih.         
	According to the agriculture directorate, rainfall in Gumla till August 9 was 431.9mm against a normal of 1,125.7mm, while in Deoghar, it was 364.7mm against a normal of 915.8mm. In Hazaribagh, rainfall was 303.1mm against a normal of 789.8mm, while in Garhwa, it was 295.4mm against a normal of 889.4mm.         
	Political parties, including Congress and BJP, have been making a hue and cry over the governor not declaring the entire state drought-hit.         
	While a BJP delegation is scheduled to meet him with this demand on Thursday, the Congress launched a padyatra today in Garhwa to mount pressure on the administration. Dubey would not comment on the demands from parties, but said, We are constantly reviewing the situation and will bring more districts under the dry zone if the situation warranted it.        
	A declaration of drought helps the administration divert resources to speed up relief operations, waive agriculture loans and implement various welfare schemes.         
	According to the directorate of agriculture, 483.088 hectares have been covered by paddy cultivation against a target of 1,692 hectares. The state received 354mm rainfall till August 9 since April against a normal of 907.8mm.         
	Paddy coverage in Garhwa has been 4.08 per cent of the target, 43.39 per cent in Gumla, 18.25 per cent in Deoghar and 6.93 per cent in Hazaribagh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Investors fail land deadline, face curbs
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Investors fail land deadline, face curbs
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 27: The state government has decided to impose restrictions on mega investors in the steel sector who have proposed units here, but failed to abide by the October 31 deadline of purchasing at least 200 acres of land each.         
	Henceforth, the water resources and forest departments will freeze processes of water allocation and mining allotment to these investors.        
	The directive was issued by chief secretary A.K. Singh during a four-hour review meeting this evening. It was attended by industry secretary A.P. Singh and industry director Manish Ranjan.         
	The officials interacted with representatives of 16 companies, including ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel amp; Power Limited (JSPL), Abhijeet Group and Essar Steel.        
	The chief secretary has issued a directive to stop allocation of mines and water to companies that have failed to purchase land directly from villagers, the industry secretary said. This means the state will not process any forest diversion proposal.        
	All the 16 shortlisted companies, which have proposed to invest over Rs 5,000 crore in respective units, voiced their problems in purchase of land directly from villagers.         
	The land records are not in place. Besides, processes such as obtaining clearance from competent authority for tribal land takes time. We have been unable to purchase land for our project because we cannot buy land in small and irregular chunks, a senior official of a company said, requesting anonymity.         
	Sources said steel behemoth ArcelorMittal, which has been successful in buying 2.34 acres of land, had been specifically asked to concentrate on more land purchase.        
	Earlier, the government had threatened to cancel MoUs of players who failed to meet the October 31 deadline of buying land.        
	Notably, a majority of steel sector investors have been earmarked either a prospecting or mining licence for iron ore in Saranda reserve forest in West Singhbhum.         
	Forest diversion proposals of a couple of them have also been sent to the Union ministry of environment and forests by the state. But the Centres clearance is pending in all the cases.         
	Recently, during an inter-ministerial group meeting in Delhi, hosted by the Union steel ministry, the Centre had asked the forest ministry to carry out a detailed study of Saranda and suggest ways to mine in the region.

          ALAMGIR HOSSAIN                              
	Behrampore, June 23: His right thumb severed, Santosh Mondal didnt know how he would harvest his crop. So he killed himself last night.        
	The tragedy mirrors the desperation of not only a poor Murshidabad farmer but also of a state where politics revolves around farming even if it does not make economic sense.        
	The suicide over a digit that most take for granted becomes all the more stark against the backdrop that Santosh could have rebuilt his life with a mechanised harvester.        
	Such a harvester costs Rs 2 -3 lakh. No longer a mean amount in an India that today reported a 51 per cent rise in the number of dollar-millionaires to 1.26 lakh but out of reach for someone like Santosh who owned a 2-bigha farm.        
	Concepts such as mechanised farming do not go with the romanticised slogans once propagated by the Left and now by the Trinamul Congress. The small size of the farms usually stands in the way but not for mechanised harvesters.        
	Agriculture here remains a gamble in the monsoon and the right thumb is life. Stiff or supple, its part of everyday toil.        
	The world closed in on Santosh once he lost a thumb, possibly making him feel that he had few options left.        
	The 40-year-old farmer was found hanging in a hospital, a day after surgeons had removed his right thumb after a freak accident while cutting grass. Police said preliminary investigations pointed to suicide.        
	Yesterday, he kept worrying how he was going to hold the sickle. How can a farmer survive without his right thumb? he kept saying. He said it at least 50 times, Santoshs widow Basanti said, weeping as she waited for his body at Lalbag subdivisional hospital. I tried to console him but he was very depressed.        
	When Santosh was not tilling his plot, he worked as a farmhand. He made about Rs 1,500-1,800 a month, she said.        
	Agricultural scientists said it was not possible for a farmer who owned 2 bighas to buy a mechanised harvester. A man who owns 2 bighas is obviously a poor farmer. How can he afford a mechanised harvester when the small ones cost around Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh? So a farmer like Santosh Mondal is dependent on his sickle, said Santanu Jha, a teacher at Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University in Kalyani.        
	Jha said a small, mechanised harvester could harvest paddy in a 2-bigha plot in one-and-a-half days. But if the farmer has to harvest it by hand, it will take him 12 to 15 days.        
	So why wasnt mechanised harvesting being promoted? In a state like Bengal, that would mean loss of jobs for thousands of farm labourers, Jha said.        
	Santosh was snipping the roots of the grass he had cut from his field in Asanpur village, 235km from Calcutta, when his sickle slipped. The sharp blade sliced through his thumb. His right thumb was almost severed, his brother Tapan said.        
	The doctor at a local health centre referred him to the Lalbag hospital. His thumb was hanging by a thread. There was no other alternative other than amputating the thumb. The surgeon took the right decision, hospital superintendent Bijoy Prasad Shaw said.        
	This morning, Santoshs body was found hanging in a hospital bathroom.

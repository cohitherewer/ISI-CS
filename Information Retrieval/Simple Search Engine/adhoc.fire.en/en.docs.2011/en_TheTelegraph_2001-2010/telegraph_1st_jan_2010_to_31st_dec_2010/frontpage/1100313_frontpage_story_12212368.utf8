The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sonia and PM on film set
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sonia and PM on film set
  - Karunanidhi scripts dream sequence with fake dome          G.C. SHEKHAR                                                    
	Chennai, March 12: No chief minister ever pulled off anything like this before, but then they were not movie scriptwriters like M. Karunanidhi.        
	At 86, the Tamil Nadu chief minister has probably written his boldest lines yet to get Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi to unveil a film set in the heart of Chennai.        
	There will be no song or dance sequences, though: just speeches by the two leaders.        
	For, strictly, what they will be inaugurating on Saturday is the states new Assembly building  except that its most imposing part is virtually a movie set.        
	Since the Assemblys main hall is not yet complete, Karunanidhi has given it the finished look by getting award-winning film art director Thotta Tharani to fill in the missing piece.        
	So, the giant dome crowning the hall will not be one of granite and steel but of iron pipes and plywood planks, painted over to make it appear the real thing.        
	The real dome, which will cost Rs 25 crore and weigh 800 tonnes, will take weeks to finish because its builder, Bangalore-based Geodesic, is still assessing if the design would withstand the heavy sea breeze and saline air from the Marina beach, less than a kilometre away.                          
	To wriggle out of the jam, Karunanidhi asked Tharani to ensure the building did not look embarrassingly topless during the inauguration. The make-believe dome has cost Rs 2 crore.        
	After Sonia and Singh have done their bit, Tamil Nadus MLAs will gather under the duplicate ceiling for a week from March 19 to pass the state budget. The rest of the budget session will take place in May when the building is expected to be complete.        
	State PWD secretary Ramasundaram bristled at suggestions that the temporary dome was a film set. Its a trial dome to test if the design can withstand high-velocity winds and corrosion, he said.        
	Karunanidhi calls the Rs 450-crore building his dream project and visits the site regularly to inspect progress. He is keen that this years budget be presented in the new Assembly complex since it will be the last full budget placed by his government before the May 2011 state elections.        
	So he has been pushing his engineers to complete at least the Assembly portion of the complex on the first two floors in time for the March 13 inauguration. The ministers chambers and senior bureaucrats offices, planned on the remaining five floors, will be completed later.        
	Critics say the building is being rushed through without ascertaining safety.        
	Since the complex is close to the sea, wind shear and corrosion should have been factored in at the design stage and not this late, a leading architect said. Why were not these tested out using computer-generation techniques, which is the norm these days?        
	PWD secretary Ramasundaram, however, insisted that normal building standards had been followed and the green certification obtained. We are actually three months behind schedule ---- there has been no special rush because of the March 13 inauguration, he said.        
	Besides, we used the latest technology, called post-tensioning technique, that allowed concrete to form in seven days against (the usual) 21 days. The same building would have been completed in the West in a years time.        
	The Assembly has so far functioned out of Fort St George, built by the British in 1640 and still standing solid, just 2km from the new complex in Mount Road. Since the fort is a protected monument, it became difficult to install modern facilities.        
	Besides, the Assembly had become too cramped over the years because of the increased number of journalists covering its proceedings, a senior protocol official said. Also, there is no space for more ministers chambers in the fort complex.        
	So, after Karunanidhi decided on a new building in 2006, it became a race against time to finish it during his current tenure.        
	Thuglak editor Cho Ramaswamy suggested astrology may have had a role in fixing the inauguration date so that it could ensure the continuance of the DMK government after the next elections.        
	An astrologer said March 13 was the last day of the Tamil month of Masi, considered ideal for moving into a new house or office. The next two months are inauspicious for housewarming, he said.

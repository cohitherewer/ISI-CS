The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Betrayed and befooled, BJP dumps Soren
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Betrayed and befooled, BJP dumps Soren
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND OUR RANCHI BUREAU                      Shibu Soren                          
	April 28: The JMM-led government in Jharkhand was reduced to a minority today after the BJP withdrew support to avenge the humiliation heaped by chief minister Shibu Soren who voted with the Congress yesterday and supped with Nitin Gadkari within a few hours.        
	As the Congress suggested it preferred a short spell of Presidents rule in the Maoist-infested state, the JMM went on the defensive late tonight and claimed that Sorens vote was cast by mistake.        
	Hemant, Sorens son, expressed regret to the BJP leadership for his fathers error. He claimed the chief minister was ready to resign and urged the NDA to take a fresh initiative to form a government with a new leader.        
	The BJP leadership insisted that deputy chief minister Raghubar Das would meet governor M..H. Farook tomorrow to formally withdraw support, but it also appeared to be keeping its options open.        
	Asked whether Hemants offer would prompt a rethink, senior leader Venkaiah Naidu said: We can hear out the father and son. We are going to meet the governor tomorrow. But we will also discuss with the partys state unit and get a sense of what they feel.        
	Hemant said the state wasnt ready to face another poll. The JMM is ready to make a sacrifice for Gurujis (Sorens) mistake, he said.        
	Several senior leaders from the state, including MPs Yashwant Sinha and Arjun Munda, are opposed to striking another deal with Soren but deputy chief minister Das, who has the support of the BJPs 18 MLAs, is said to be in favour of continuing the alliance.        
	One formula being floated is to let Das take over as chief minister and let Hemant become his deputy. The elder Soren has to get elected to the Assembly in less than two months but so far, he was unable to find a safe seat.        
	However, the BJP leadership in Delhi is wary of a fresh deal. Some leaders feel Soren and the Congress have already struck a deal but are not going public immediately.        
	After the BJPs pullout, the ruling coalition has been reduced to 28 from 46 in a House of 82.        
	Vote amp; dinner shock        
	Whatever the outcome of the current instability, the BJP has come out badly bruised from the cut-motion misadventure. A Delhi meeting, headed by party chief Nitin Gadkari, was quick to decide to withdraw support.        
	Other BJP leaders are still struggling to come to terms with the betrayal. Lok Sabha Opposition leader Sushma Swaraj said she was specifically told by L.K. Advani that she should ensure Soren did not turn up to vote. In 1999, the Vajpayee-led government was voted out on a single ballot cast by Giridhar Gamang.        
	So Advani said Soren should make himself scarce. I told him that if he comes on his own and if his one vote is as useful as Gamangs was to the Congress, we should allow him to press the button. But that was half in jest, Sushma said.        
	Sushma said she did not see Soren sneak into the House. But a sharp-eyed Nishikant Dubey, the Godda MP from the BJP, spotted Soren pressing the red button to negate the BJP-sponsored motion. Sushmas jaw dropped when she was informed.        
	Then the machine packed up and voting on slips began. Dubey, a first-time MP, went up to Soren, a veteran, to advise him to vote on the right slip. He said, Yes, yes, I probably made a mistake the first time. But he sought the red slip, a BJP leader said.        
	Sushma tried to trace him after voting and was in for another shock. Soren was dining at the residence of BJP president Nitin Gadkari. She was taken aback. He had just voted against the BJP and then he coolly ate with the party chief, a leader said.        
	Around 9pm, Gadkari had no idea of what had happened.         
	This morning, when the BJPs parliamentary board met in Sushmas official chamber, Gadkari, who apparently looked a bit sheepish, called Soren a masterly actor.        
	 The rest agreed.

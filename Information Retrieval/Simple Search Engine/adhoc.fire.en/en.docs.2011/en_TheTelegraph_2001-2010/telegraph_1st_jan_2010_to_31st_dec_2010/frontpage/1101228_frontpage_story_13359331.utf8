The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Singh writes to Joshi
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Singh writes to Joshi
          J.P. YADAV                                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today put it in writing that he was ready to face a parliamentary committee on the 2G spectrum allocation in a move unprecedented in the countrys parliamentary history.        
	In a letter to the public accounts committee headed by the BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi, Singh said: In view of recent propaganda that the Prime Minister is unwilling to be questioned by a parliamentary committee, I would like to inform you that I am willing to appear before the PAC should the committee seek clarifications from the Prime Minister, though I believe there is no precedent of the Prime Minister appearing before a PAC.        
	Joshi acknowledged receiving the letter but skirted questions on what he proposed to do. According to rules, the PAC has to secure the Lok Sabha Speakers permission to summon even a minister, he said. The committee has received the letter from the Prime Minister in which he has repeated the offer he had made at a public function. Appropriate decision at the appropriate time would be taken by the committee on his letter.        
	Singh had verbally made the offer at the Congress plenary last week. It was seen as a masterstroke capable of puncturing the Opposition clamour for a joint parliamentary committee on the scam.        
	A BJP leader said getting a unanimous decision from the 22-member PAC, which also has Congress representatives, would be very difficult.        
	Sources said Singhs offer seemed part of the political manoeuvring between the Congress and the Opposition to outwit each other over the JPC.        
	We had sought some papers from the Prime Minister and he has sent several bundles. They have to be studied in detail. It will take time, Joshi said.        
	BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said: The Prime Minister can go wherever he chooses to. That is not going to change our stand. If the PM is clean, then why is he scared of a JPC probe?

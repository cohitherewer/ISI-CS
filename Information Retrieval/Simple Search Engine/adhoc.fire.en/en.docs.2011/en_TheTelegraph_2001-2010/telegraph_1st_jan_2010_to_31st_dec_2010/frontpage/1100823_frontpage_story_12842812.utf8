  - Cops launch confidence-building measure        OUR BUREAU                                          
	Aug. 22: Police personnel from both Assam and Arunachal Pradesh began jointly patrolling the border as a confidence-building measure amid allegations of firing on innocents and renewed attacks by goons on a Sivasagar garden.        
	Trouble broke out on August 14 when a mob, backed by armed goons and suspected militants, attacked Charaipung police station.        
	Since then, there have been a spate of attacks, on tea estates, homes and people in Charaipung and cross-border firing.         
	Two huts and another shed used for weighing green tea leaves belonging to a small tea grower, Dilip Hondique, were torched by mischief-makers from Arunachal Pradesh in Naharani in the wee hours of today.         
	A source said a worker of the small tea garden owned by Hondique, Monglu Gowala, was also allegedly abducted.        
	The fresh attacks came when authorities from both states have been trying to defuse the tension.         
	Deputy inspector-general of police of eastern range, Robin Hibu, today said police forces of both the states began joint patrol along the border at Simhokho in the presence Sivasagar deputy commissioner, N.M. Hussain, his Arunachal counterpart, W. Lowang, Tirap superintendent of police of the district, Paldan, and superintendent of police from Sivasagar district, Akhilesh Singh.        
	Hibu also blamed Assam police for the border flare-up, saying sensible handling of the matter by Assam authorities could have prevented the situation from turning volatile.        
	He alleged that Assam police fired on five villagers from Tirap around 2.30pm on August 20 when they went to a nearby jungle to collect firewood.         
	Assam police fired 50 rounds on five innocent youths, who went to collect firewood from jungle on August 20. We took exception to such unprovoked firing, as after that the situation turned volatile. Despite frequent discussions and repeated assurance from Assam police to discourage any provocative activities and talks of constituting peace committee consisting of high officials of both the states to tackle any border flare-up, we found such activities unjustified, Hibu added.         
	Assam police also fired on the house of Raja, a villager in Tirap, on August 17, which damaged the walls, though there was no casualty.         
	He also denied the involvement of any militants in the alleged attack on Assam police.         
	We strongly deny involvement of militants from the Arunachal side though we agreed for investigation to find out the reason of the border skirmish. We have our own police forces to tackle underground elements and are constantly seeking the help of the army to tackle any elements involved in subversive activities in the district, he said.         
	Reports, however, stated that Naga militants active in Tirap have asked all Assamese to vacate the district within the next 48 hours.         
	The diktat from militants reportedly came in response to the indefinite economic blockade launched by 12 organisations from Assam on three routes leading to Tirap demanding safety along the border.         
	There is no official confirmation on the reports though.         
	Two battalions of IRB have been deployed in Tirap district and police officials are camping there to arrest further unrest.         
	The Tirap deputy commissioner said over phone that steps were being initiated by the district administration to confiscate all arms from the villagers in the district.         
	First of all we will be issuing a notification asking the people for voluntary deposition of arms. We will go for confiscation in the second step, Lowang said.         
	The Sivasagar superintendent of police who has been camping in Charaipung for the past few days said the involvement of the CRPF in patrolling today would strengthen the position of the security forces.         
	Led by SP Singh, a huge contingent of heavily armed Assam policemen and CRPF personnel marched from Charaipung area and reached the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border, about 6km from Charaipung, and held discussions with Tirap SP Paldan and DC Lowang.         
	Such area domination exercise will definitely boost the confidence of the people of the area. We will continue such joint patrols till the situation becomes normal, Singh said.        
	An army team from the 871 Field Regiment, too, carried out a survey in the area.         
	However, the army has ruled out its direct involvement in joint patrolling of the area.

	Mumbai, Jan. 6: The three Churchill Brothers footballers accused of outraging the modesty of an air hostess received bail last night at a Mumbai police station without having to appear in court and flew into Calcutta today.        
	Okolie Odafe, Ogba Kalu and Arindam Bhattacharya were released on bail at 2am under discretionary powers available to the police which, a former officer said, they often misuse to protect the rich and powerful.        
	The trio were not put in the lock-up, either, after being booked under four sections of the penal code for allegedly molesting a SpiceJet air hostess on the first leg of a Goa-Mumbai-Calcutta flight last evening. They ate pizza, sipped coffee and rested in armchairs provided by the police while their bail papers got sorted out.        
	Top police sources said the bails were granted following a call from Union minister Sharad Pawar, known to be close to club co-owner Churchill Alemao, to city police chief D. Sivanandhan.        
	(The polices discretionary powers) are a completely legitimate device meant for bailable offences. The police have the discretion to accept a surety from the accused and grant them bail at the police station. But it (this discretion) is misused rampantly by the police, said lawyer-activist and former IPS officer Y.P. Singh, who was with Maharashtra police for over two decades.        
	A Churchill Brothers source said: This (molestation) was a wrong allegation. We are not in the wrong if Churchill Alemao used his political connections.        
	A source at Santa Cruz police station said that following instructions from higher officials, they had tried to make the footballers as comfortable as they could.        
	The three players underwent a medical test late last night and the results showed they were not inebriated. They paid a fine of Rs 5,000 each and were granted bail around 2am, said assistant commissioner Amitabh Gupta, who is handling the case.        
	He denied that the footballers received privileged treatment.        
	We are not in the business of turning police stations into restaurants --- there was no preferential treatment. There is enough evidence against the three --- they have just been released on bail, not let off. The victim has filed a complaint and we have lodged an FIR. We will file a chargesheet against the three soon, Gupta said.        
	Alemao and the clubs Brazilian coach Carlos Perreira defended the accused, who arrived in Calcutta today with the rest of the squad.         
	When we spoke to the police, the lady who alleged Odafe had tried to molest her couldnt substantiate her claim, Perreira said.        
	He said that after Odafes hand had accidentally touched the air hostess, he had apologised and she had at first accepted the apology.                        Ogba Kalu in Calcutta.

	Kalu and Arindam were not even involved (but) when the crew members started making false allegations against Odafe, the two protested as any team-mates would do. Suddenly, they detained (the) three for questioning after landing (in Mumbai), Perreira said.         
	Alemao, speaking to The Telegraph from Goa, said the air hostess was lying and threatened legal action against SpiceJet. The air hostess is the wife of an Indian naval officer and a resident of the Mazgaon Naval Colony.        
	Shes lying. I trust the players. It is the word of the girl against the word of the players. My boys are innocent. I stand by them. How can one molest someone in a flight full of people? I will file a defamation case against SpiceJet. I have spoken to Odafe -- even he is mulling legal action against the airline for the false accusation. We will not let this pass easily, Alemao said.        
	Alemao was Goa chief minister for about a fortnight in 1990, and later headed several state ministries. He was elected MP in 1994. Now a state vice-president of the Congress, he is a little miffed with the party for denying his daughter a ticket in the last general election. He is being wooed by Pawars Nationalist Congress Party.

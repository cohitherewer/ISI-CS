	Jamshedpur, Sept. 1: Finally, it was Jamshedpurs turn today to flag off its city bus service as mandated by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).        
	To be operated by Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation (JTDC), the fleet was flagged off this morning by additional secretary in the urban development department and erstwhile deputy commissioner of East Singhbhum R.K. Agarwal from Gopal Maidan in Bistupur.         
	The much-awaited bus service has been launched. We hope it will benefit common people and help reduce transportation glitches, Agarwal said, referring to the service that was supposed to begin in the steel city on August 18 but could not as the Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee failed to finalise a parking bay.        
	JTDC managing director Siddharth Tripathi, who was also present at todays launch, said of the 50 buses earmarked for Jamshedpur, 30 would ply in the first phase, while the remaining 20 would hit the roads next week.         
	The buses would ply on eight routes  NIT Junction (Adityapur) to Mercy Hospital (Baridih), Transport Colony (Road No-28 at Adityapur) to Mercy Hospital, MGM Medical College (Dimna) to railway station, Sakchi court to Ram Mandir (Telco), Pardih (on NH-33) to Sundernagar, Ashiana (Sonari) to Baridih bus stand, Kandra bus stand to railway station and Mango bus stand to Birsanagar (Telco).         
	The longest route will be Ashiana to Baridih (20km) while the shortest route will connect Mango bus stand with Birsanagar (9km).         
	The minimum fare has been fixed at Rs 3 while the maximum is Rs 15. But, Tripathy added the routes and fares had to be reworked as the corporation wasnt happy with the recommendations of Delhi-based consultants Urban Metropolitan Transport Authority.         
	The Swaraj Mazda buses can accommodate 29 passengers each. Fifty per cent of the seats have been earmarked for women passengers while two seats have been allotted for the disabled.                                 
	Manpower to run the buses is being provided by Ranchi Security, a private agency promoted by Sainik Kalyan Board. The agency has provided 50 drivers and as may conductors as well as six security personnel for the Baridih depot where the vehicles would be parked, he said.         
	Incidentally, Sainik Kalyan Board, which is the operator for the service in Dhanbad, wants to opt out as it claims it has been incurring losses.        
	Ranchi was the first to start the service on June 26. The JTDC is running the show there. It was followed by Dhanbad on August 9.         
	In Ranchi, out of the earmarked 100 buses, 70 are plying on five routes. In Dhanbad, 24 of the 100 allotted buses, were on the roads.         
	JTDC officials said that Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company, (Jusco) refused to accept the offer of running the service in Jamshedpur as it felt it would be a loss-making venture.        
	Speaking about the opposition of auto-rickshaw owners, Tripathi said the buses had been introduced for the benefit of people. The JNNURM bus service is aimed at revamping transportation in Ranchi, Dhanbad and Jamshedpur. We want healthy competition. The livelihood of auto-rickshaw drivers would not be affected as three-wheelers would continue to ply, he said.         
	Vice-chairman of Adityapur Municipal Council Purendra Narayan Singh, who boarded a bus along with a group of councillors soon after the launch, lauded JTDCs efforts to implement the central project in Jamshedpur.         
	Also, present were deputy commissioner Himani Pande, senior SP Akhilesh Kumar Jha, vice-president (corporate services) of Tata Steel Sanjiv Paul and other dignitaries.

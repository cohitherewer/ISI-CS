 New CM cool to JVM barbs          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                       Chief minister Arjun Munda flanked by deputies Sudesh Mahto and Hemant Soren (top) after winning a trust vote in Ranchi on Tuesday. Among those whose votes helped the BJP-JMM-Ajsu government shore up 45 votes was jailed JMM MLA Paulus Surin (above) who was allowed by a district court to attend the one-day session. (Prashant Mitra)                                  
	Ranchi, Sept. 14: Arjun Mundas government sailed through a confidence motion in the Assembly today by securing 45 votes, egged on by good wishes from Congress and RJD, but had to negotiate brickbats from Babulal Marandi-led JVM which is upset its ally allowed the BJP and the JMM to form a government with such apparent ease.        
	There werent any surprises in the voting patterns of parties. Only, the absence of a Congress MLA, Yogendra Saw, raised a few eyebrows among those in the Congress, including leader of the Opposition Rajendra Prasad Singh, who said he would seek an explanation from him.        
	A three-hour-long debate preceding the vote saw several personal attacks against Munda, but the chief minister chose not to get provoked, insisting he wanted to run the government by consensus.         
	The government will run smoothly with the participation of one and all, he declared.         
	Apart from the votes of MLAs belonging to BJP, JMM, JD(U) and Ajsu, the government also got support from Anglo-Indian member Glen Joseph Gaulstan and Independents Chamra Linda and Videsh Singh to comfortably win the motion of confidence moved around 11am by deputy chief minister Hemant Soren as Munda is still a Lok Sabha MP.         
	JVM legislature party leader Pradeep Yadav said the Munda government would be short-lived. Dubbing the BJP-JMM alliance as bemail gathbandhan (out of sync coalition), he said Munda had only managed to extend the expiry date of the government.         
	The RJD, which had walked out during the confidence vote against the Shibu Soren government in order to prove a point to the Congress, stayed on this time but took a dig at the Congress for not taking the initiative to form a government.         
	Singh assured Munda of the Congresss cooperation. Development kijiye sahyog karenge, par galat kam ka virod karenge. (Do good work and we will support you. But do wrong and we will oppose you).         
	Like she did the last time, Geeta Koda ended up supporting the Opposition, a move aimed at placating the Congress at a time when her husband and former chief minister Madhu Koda was in jail facing CBI investigations into corruption charges to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore.                     
	In the end, 30 MLAs, including those of the Congress, JVM and the RJD, and two others, voted against the confidence motion (see chart).         
	Munda remained calm through the jibes as he replied to the debate that included spirited demands for declaring Jharkhand famine-hit. I will soon call an all-party meeting to find a solution to recurring drought in the state, he declared.         
	Development of infrastructure would be another of his priorities.        
	Munda, who was sworn in chief minister for the third time on September 11, said the fractured mandate after successive elections had also given birth to several problems.         
	We accepted the fractured mandate as a challenge and turned it into an opportunity and formed the government, he said in reply to Opposition barbs questioning the formation of the BJP-JMM government.         
	Its unfortunate that no party got full majority in the state, though every party wanted it. It is a subject of research for people working in the field of politics as to why the state has been throwing a fractured mandate, he said.        
	The chief minister asked the Opposition to debate issues with seriousness and not for the sake of argument. For example, malaria happens to be an old problem of the Jharkhand region. Even in 1855, the then British administration had ordered soldiers, sent to curb the rebellion by Sidho-Kanho, to carry malaria medicines. We will have to find a solution to the problem, he pointed out.         
	But, heading a new government means Munda will have the weight of expectations on him.         
	Holding long overdue panchayat polls should also be on his immediate agenda, feel senior officials in the administration. If the new government can hold panchayat elections by November-December, it will change the contours of Jharkhand, V.S. Dubey, the former adviser to Governor M..H. Farook, told The Telegraph.        
	Dubey said the administration had been put on alert to complete preparations for the panchayat elections. The new government should not let them relax, he added.        
	Combating drought, something Munda mentioned today, should also figure in his plans. The next major challenge for the Munda government will be to draw up short-term and long-term plans to deal with recurring drought in the state, said Harishwar Dayal, the regional director of Institute of Human Development.        
	Dubey also listed power as one the states major concerns and hoped Munda would act on it too. The state cant move without power. The government should decide on over handing over Patratu Thermal Power station as a joint venture. It It will take at least three to five years to get adequate power from PTPS if it gets modernised, he pointed out.

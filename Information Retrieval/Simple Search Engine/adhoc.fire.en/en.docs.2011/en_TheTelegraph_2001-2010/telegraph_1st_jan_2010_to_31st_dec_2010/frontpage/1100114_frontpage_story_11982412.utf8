          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: The Centre today moved to increase the availability of wheat, rice, sugar and oil in the open market to tame the demon of rising food prices but also rapped state governments for the spiral.        
	The Centre cannot regulate mandis (markets), agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said after a meeting of the cabinet committee on prices (CCP) chaired by the Prime Minister.        
	Pawar said states should take anti-hoarding measures and enforce the Essential Commodities Act as he blamed them for not lifting the allocated quota of food grains.        
	Sources said Manmohan Singh would call a meeting of chief ministers later this month, probably January 27, to address the food inflation.        
	The decisions taken at todays cabinet meeting include selling 2-3 million tonnes of wheat and rice in the open market over the next two months and asking state-owned trading firms to intensify import of pulses.        
	To increase the availability of sugar, now selling at nearly Rs 50 a kg, the government has relaxed the norms for processing raw sugar and allowed duty-free import of white sugar till December-end.        
	Prices would come down in four to eight days, PTI quoted the minister as saying.        
	The decisions came on a day an NGO, Home Makers Front, moved the Supreme Court for a directive to the government to rein in prices to prevent food riots.         
	Pawar hinted the sugar crisis was largely because of the Uttar Pradesh government, but said the CCP had devised a route to escape the states restrictions on allowing in imported raw sugar.        
	The Centre requested the state government several times to lift these restrictions in the face of the nation-wide sugar crisis but to no avail, Pawar said, adding that the Centre had decided to relax Central Excise Rules to allow processing of raw sugar in any other state.        
	Till now, imported raw sugar could only be processed in mills it had been brought for. The relaxation means around 9 lakh tonnes of raw sugar lying in ports can be processed outside Uttar Pradesh.        
	The Centre has decided to engage co-operative major Nafed and the National Consumer Co-operative Federation in distributing wheat, rice and subsidised pulses and edible oils through their outlets.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 2: Like the proverbial cat with nine lives, the National Games has risen from the dead once again.        
	Yesterday, the Indian Olympic Associations (IOA) rescheduled the 34th edition of the sports meet to be held in Jharkhand from February 12 to 25 next year, even as the state vigilance is conducting an investigation into the affairs of the National Games Organising Committee (NGOC).        
	NGOC working chairman R.K. Anand, who attended a meeting held at IOA president Suresh Kalmadis house in New Delhi, said the new dates had been finalised at chief minister Arjun Mundas request.         
	This means, the 34th National Games, originally scheduled for November 2007, has now been postponed seven times.        
	Anand, NGOC organising secretary S.M. Hashmi, treasurer Madhukant Pathak and former director of sports P.C. Mishra are facing a vigilance investigation for alleged embezzlement of public funds in the purchase of sports equipment and construction of infrastructure for the proposed Games in Ranchi.         
	Anand said he had communicated the new dates to the chief minister and requested him to ensure the vigilance probe was completed before the Games begin.         
	I have also made it clear that no JOA member will participate in the Games unless the probe is completed, he added.         
	Anand said 90 per cent of the equipment had been procured. Now, officials have to procure the rest which they cant unless the probe is completed, he said.

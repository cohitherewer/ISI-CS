                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Upper storey a different story     Lodha reveals option of getting CMC nod for adding floors
				       Four Calcutta buildings Parasmal Lodha was linked with or knows about      SAMBIT SAHA                                                
	Calcutta, March 27: Parasmal Lodha, the realtor who is understood to have facilitated the construction of the top floors of Stephen Court but has denied any hand, has told The Telegraph that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had sanctioned the plan for the additional storeys before they were actually built.        
	Lodha also spoke of his direct involvement in a building that apparently used the same sanction route to add floors  a rare instance when the real estate player acknowledged such an association.         
	I had direct involvement in Bagri market, he said, referring to the towering structure off Brabourne Road.        
	Lodhas claim about Stephen Court runs counter to what the state government and civic authorities have been saying so far  that the gutted floors were built illegally and then regularised against a penalty. So far, 33 people have died in the fire. ( )        
	It also sheds light on a shadowy overworld of upper-floor management in Calcutta where several buildings have fiddled with their roofs.         
	The players take recourse to two options to add floors. The well-known option: break the law, build more floors and then regularise after pulling strings and paying a penalty.        
	The other, little-known alternative: get the CMC to grant a sanction.         
	Until an amendment last year, the CMC Act did not mention any provision for additional floors once the original plan had been sanctioned.         
	So, how did the CMC grant the sanction Lodha has spoken about? Lodha did not elaborate but CMC sources said the trick was to get what is being termed a plan sanction. Low on too many specifics and without mentioning the existing building, such sanctions allowed a said number of floors on a particular plot  a virtual approval for fresh construction, the CMC sources said.        
	There was sanction for three additional floors on Stephen Court in 1979 and it was renewed again in 1984. It was not regularised by paying penalty, Lodha said this afternoon. He clarified that such CMC sanctions used to come for a limited period  five years till further scrutiny as in the case of Stephen Court.        
	Lodha did not say so but one of his replies provided an insight into the way the CMC gave the purported sanctions.        
	Asked if the building plans allowed extra FAR (floor area ratio, which indicates how much square foot of construction is allowed on a particular slice of land), Lodha said such concepts were alien those days. Once it is sanctioned, its sanctioned, he said.        
	The developer, who earned the nickname fiddler on the roof because of direct or indirect association with various projects where top floors were added, said most of the prominent additions were sanctioned by the CMC before they were built.        
	By Lodhas account, at least three well-known buildings in Calcutta  Stephen Court, Nicco House and Bagri Market Building  had added floors after they got pre-approvals from the CMC.        
	But Lodha dissociated himself from all except one  Bagri Market Building. He had earlier denied any direct involvement in the development of Stephen Court with a smile playing on his lips.        
	According to Lodha, the additional floors of Nicco House and Bagri market were sanctioned by the CMC. Corporation sources said they had no record of regularisation of the top floors of either building. But they refused to either confirm or deny if the additions were sanctioned before they were built.        
	The extra floors atop Tobacco House were built first and then got regularised against a penalty, Lodha said. But CMC sources said they had no record of any additional floor being built or regularised. In Bagri Market Building, around 4 lakh square feet were added.         
	How did Lodha get, or help others get, the sanctions from the CMC? Its not what you think. Its not money. That many others had. I earned peoples trust from top to bottom, he said.        
	Old-timers claimed that he used more than gentle persuasion  a euphemism for deploying goons. But Lodha denied dealing with goondas. I never needed them, he said.        
	What about his links with a section of CMC officials and police officers? Did they help?        
	Lodha smiled and tapped his pristine white linen-shirt pocket  it was not clear whether he was suggesting he had the officials where he wanted them or whether he was placing his hand on his heart to drive home the depth of the goodwill he enjoyed.

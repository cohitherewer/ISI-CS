                                Garfield                            
	Los Angeles, July 2 (Reuters): A virtual unknown has landed the coveted lead role in the upcoming resurrection of the Spider-Man movie franchise, ending an intense search that attracted virtually every eligible actor in the business.        
	Andrew Garfield, 26, will take over the Peter Parker/Spider-Man role played by Tobey Maguire in a trilogy that generated more than $2.5 billion at the worldwide box office, distributor Columbia Pictures said yesterday. The Sony Corp unit will release the film in 3D on July 3, 2012.        
	Garfield, who was born in Los Angeles and raised in Britain, has headlined only one movie, the little-seen UK crime drama Boy A, for which he won a Bafta award in 2008. His upcoming releases include the thriller Never Let Me Go, in which he co-stars with Keira Knightley and Carey Mulligan, and the Facebook movie The Social Network.

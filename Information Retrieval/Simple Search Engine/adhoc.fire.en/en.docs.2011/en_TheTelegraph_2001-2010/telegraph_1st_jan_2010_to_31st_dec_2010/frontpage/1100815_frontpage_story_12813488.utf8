The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Message for Delhi in Canada Tamil influx
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Message for Delhi in Canada Tamil influx

	Washington, Aug. 14: The rumbling volcano of displaced Tamils in Sri Lanka abruptly erupted half way across the globe in British Columbia yesterday when a shipload of asylum seekers tumbled out of a cargo vessel on to the provinces quaint Victoria Island, triggering an intense debate about Canadas refugee laws which has the potential to shake up Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harpers minority government.         
	The row also considerably complicates the task of an Indian envoy to Sri Lanka to assess Tamil rehabilitation, whose visit was announced by Union home minister P. Chidambaram a few days ago.        
	The MV Sun Sea, a Thai ship merely 59m long, carried a human cargo of 500 Tamils in its cramped hold for over two months in the high seas. Among the asylum seekers were several recent mothers with babies in arms and children.         
	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) intercepted MV Sun Sea with a flotilla of naval frigates and boarded the refugee ship without incident before being led into port.        
	In October last year, a cargo vessel carrying 76 Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seekers arrived in Canada in what is now feared to have been a trial run for a possible influx of boat people from areas once controlled by the recently vanquished Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).        
	There are worries in Ottawa that more such ships with Tamils are on their way to Canada, which is prohibited by its liberal laws from boarding vessels on the high seas even if they are suspected of smuggling people to its coast.        
	Already, the Opposition has begun carping about the treatment of Tamils seeking refuge in Canada from alleged persecution in Sri Lanka.        
	Bob Rae, the Opposition Liberal Partys foreign affairs spokesman, said on Canadian television last night: Obviously, in the aftermath of the war in Sri Lanka, a great deal of hardship was experienced and there are a lot of people who want to get out of Sri Lanka. Others urged the government to judge the case of each asylum seeker individually.        
	 The Civil Liberties Association in British Columbia demanded that the Harper government should respect the human rights of people who arrived by MV Sun Sea. The associations president, Robert Holmes, severely criticised the governments conduct in dealing with those who came to Canada on a similar ship last October.        
	Given that the government had no evidence showing that the refugees posed any danger to Canada, it is incredible that they were held in detention for months, Holmes said. Canada needs to ensure that the migrants now landing in British Columbia are not subjected to the same unjustified detentions.        
	Canada is already home to about a quarter million Sri Lankan Tamils who left their native country during the ethnic conflict. Some of them built up a robust LTTE network in Canada, which has indulged in extortion and other illegal activity to aid the outfit back home.        
	Leaders of several Tamil organisations across Canada travelled to Victoria Island yesterday to offer legal, medical, financial and humanitarian assistance to the new arrivals even before the cargo vessel docked in British Columbia, suggesting co-ordination between human traffickers in South Asia and Canadian Tamils.        
	Canadas public safety minister Vic Toews said at a news conference yesterday that Canada has very generous refugee laws and my concern is that individuals not take advantage of the existing laws in order to further criminal or terrorist activities.        
	Already, a record high number of Sri Lankan Tamils since 2001 have reached Australia in boats this year.         
	A rise in the number of such boat people could considerably complicate the tightrope walked by political parties in Tamil Nadu over the aftermath of the LTTEs defeat in the civil war in Sri Lanka.        
	Besides, at the UN, there has been considerable concern over the human rights situation in Sri Lanka.        
	Chidambaram made the announcement of a special envoy in an effort to mollify Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi, who wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on July 17 drawing attention to the paramount importance and urgency of allowing displaced Tamils to return to their native places a year after the military campaign against the LTTE.

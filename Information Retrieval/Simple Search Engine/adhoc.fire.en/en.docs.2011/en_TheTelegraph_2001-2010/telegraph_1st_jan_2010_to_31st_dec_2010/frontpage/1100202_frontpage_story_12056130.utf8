The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lanka sacks coup officers
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Lanka sacks coup officers
          S. MURARI AND AGENCIES                              
	Feb. 1: Sri Lanka has sacked 14 senior army officers, among them five majors general and as many brigadiers, for allegedly planning a coup to topple the elected government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.        
	The pro-government online newspaper Asian Tribune reported that the officers, all close to defeated presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka, had been sent on compulsory retirement with effect from January 30.         
	Of the other four, one is a colonel, one a lieutenant colonel and two hold the rank of captain.        
	Quoting army sources, the paper said the 14 officers had been retired off as their conduct was unbecoming of officers and gentlemen and they were a threat to national security.        
	An army source said Rajapaksa ordered the crackdown following fears of a coup after the January 26 presidential elections, which he won by a massive margin of 1.8 million votes.        
	Immediately after losing the polls, Fonseka, a former army commander, had moved into a hotel with what the government said was a group of army deserters and retired officers to plot a coup.         
	Although Fonseka was allowed to leave the hotel following international media focus, about a dozen deserters were arrested from the hotel. In a subsequent raid on the former army chiefs office, the police seized computer diskettes and other documents, which, sources said, suggested a conspiracy against the government of Rajapaksa.        
	The government has already scaled down the security provided to Fonseka, who is a US green card holder.         
	Reports say Fonseka is facing charges of having given an arms contract to a US-based firm run by his son-in-law when he was the army chief. His arrest is imminent in this case.         
	Fonseka also faces arrest for an allegation he made against the Presidents brother and defence secretary Gothabaya Rajapaksa. The defeated leader had alleged that Gothabaya, during the closing stages of the war with the LTTE, had ordered regional commanders to shoot down top Tiger chieftains who came forward to surrender.        
	Although Fonseka retracted the charge, made at the height of the campaign, Gothabaya told BBC World Service Radio last week he would see to it that action was taken against the retired general.        
	The running feud between Gothabaya and Fonseka had led to the army commander being kicked upstairs and given the sinecure post of chief of defence staff from which he retired ahead of tenure to jump into the electoral fray.        
	Newspaper gag lifted        
	A court today revoked a government order to seal the pro-Opposition newspaper Lanka, saying its article criticising an official did not pose any threat to national security. The newspaper is affiliated to the opposition Marxist JVP party.

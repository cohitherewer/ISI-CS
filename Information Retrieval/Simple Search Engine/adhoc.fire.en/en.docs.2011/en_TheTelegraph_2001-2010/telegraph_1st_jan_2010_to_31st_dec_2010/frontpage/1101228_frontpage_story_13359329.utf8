The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Zero Hour adds glow to MPs
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Zero Hour adds glow to MPs
  - No time for Parliament, long queues at salon           IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                            The salon at Delhis Constitution Club. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Our MPs may have given Parliament the miss this winter but they have not missed zero hour.        
	Make that Zero-Hour  the new salon-cum-spa at the Constitution Club of India in New Delhi.        
	They are having as much silky smooth fun there in New Year week as they had been skipping work earlier, having shut Parliament down over the telecom scandal.        
	Spa sources said the biggest hit with the MPs, their spouses and their children has been the silky smooth body polishing therapy.        
	Thats because it adds glow to their skin. We first scrub them with oil and then give them a massage with hot aromatic oil, a spa expert said.         
	Everybody wants this treatment since it grooms them for the party season.        
	The MPs have also taken eagerly to the Balinese hot-oil rejuvenating treatment, manicure and pedicure, hair dyeing, bleaching, aromatic facial, ancient Asian foot ritual and moustache trimming.        
	The footfall has shot up over the past 10 days, an official of the unisex salon said.         
	It was so crowded last weekend that many MPs had to wait for over two hours.                                
	The Constitution Club is only for MPs, former MPs and their families but Zero-Hour is open to all. Opened last year, the spa was renovated recently to attract the lawmakers in a bigger way.        
	The response has encouraged the spa to offer a 25 per cent discount on three special packages this party season: Asian Experience, Groom Yourself and Pamper Yourself. The first, which costs Rs 3,500 per person after the discounts, has become a craze among the lawmakers and their families, the official said.        
	Each session can take four to five hours --- nearly as long as a working day in Parliament --- but the peoples representatives dont mind.        
	Because of the length of time involved, we often request the MPs to split it over two days, a spa official said.        
	Could they name a few MPs who frequent the salon?        
	They are from Bihar, Bengal, UP and elsewhere. We dont remember their names. Even if we did, we have been instructed not to reveal them. We would lose our jobs, a hairdresser at the salon said.        
	He said it felt nice to show his skill on MPs hair. We feel very happy to serve them as they are the people who run the country. We have seen them on TV, discussing important things. So we try our best to provide them with good service, he smiled.        
	Some of them are very particular about their haircut and moustache. It feels good to hear praise from these big people. It means recognition, and they tip us too.        
	Has Mamata Banerjee ever visited the spa or the unisex salon?        
	Wed love to have her, but she doesnt come here. She works for the common people and doesnt care about her looks, a woman employee said.        
	The club also has a multi-gym for MPs and their families. The multi-gym has 150 members, the salon official said.        
	I have never been to the unisex salon-cum-spa at the club, said Congress MP Sandeep Dikshit, son of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit. But I go to the multi-gym regularly.        
	Would he visit the spa since it is offering three special packages till the New Year? I am not in Delhi at present, Dikshit said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wanted, all-season man
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Wanted, all-season man
          SANJAY K. JHA                            Ghulam Nabi Azad in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: When Sonia Gandhi handed Ghulam Nabi Azad the job of dousing the political fire in Andhra Pradesh, the decision underscored how the party was continuing with its ad hoc ways despite the jolt received in the Bihar election.        
	Many in the party find it curious that the Union health minister, who is from Jammu and Kashmir, is grappling with disgruntled leaders down south when the Congress already has an organisational arrangement to handle such issues.        
	While Veerappa Moily happens to be the All India Congress Committee official in charge of Andhra Pradesh, Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel too has been deeply involved in tackling the crisis in the state. But Sonia still drafted in Pranab Mukherjee and Azad for the job when Kiran Kumar Reddy was chosen to replace K. Rosaiah.        
	Although Pranab has been the man for all seasons for both party and government, whether its a parliamentary deadlock or political turmoil, Azads inclusion raised eyebrows because he is no longer seen as a member of Sonias core team.        
	One leader told The Telegraph: Does this indicate that Sonia is aware of the limitations of her organisational apparatus?        
	Although Azad remains a party general secretary after becoming a Union minister, the one-man-one-post rule that Sonia appears keen to implement would have seen him vacating the organisational post.        
	Azad had earlier excelled as the parliamentary affairs minister because of his good relations with leaders across party lines, so much so that many party MPs now wonder if the gentleman Pawan Bansal has been the right choice for the job.        
	Murmurs have also begun in the Congress about alleged divisions in the cabinet, with many MPs asking if all the senior ministers were working in sync during this crisis.        
	Some of them feel the 2G spectrum issue was mismanaged, leading to one of the worst stalemates in Parliament. Sources said the Prime Minister too was anguished at the way the crisis was dragging on and felt let down by some of his colleagues.        
	Like Azad, many other ministers have been continuing with their dual responsibilities for years. This arrangement seems likely to continue for sometime longer as the much-awaited All India Congress Committee reshuffle appears to have been delayed again.        
	Sources say Sonia is likely to reconstitute her team only after the plenary in December. Within the party, there are divergent views on the subject.        
	Some say the new team should be in place at the earliest because a sense of drift is deepening by the day. Others, mindful of the Parliament deadlock and the Andhra problems, argue that the first priority is not a reshuffle but restoration of normality.        
	Still, many feel that this ad hoc way of functioning is taking a toll on the ability of the government and the party to manage crises.        
	While most parliamentary problems fall on Pranabs soldiers, Ahmed Patel looks after the bulk of organisational hitches. When crises arise, the party rarely involves the general secretaries like B.K. Hariprasad, Janardan Dwivedi, Mohsina Kidwai, Mukul Wasnik, Rahul Gandhi or V. Narayansamy. Rahul has, anyway, restricted himself to the affairs of the Youth Congress.         
	Digvijay Singh, ever willing to get involved in any affair, is disliked for his pro-active attitude. Prithviraj Chavan, who too was a general secretary, has now become the Maharashtra chief minister. Theres no one now to look after the states that were under Chavans charge. The appointment of new state unit presidents too has been postponed.

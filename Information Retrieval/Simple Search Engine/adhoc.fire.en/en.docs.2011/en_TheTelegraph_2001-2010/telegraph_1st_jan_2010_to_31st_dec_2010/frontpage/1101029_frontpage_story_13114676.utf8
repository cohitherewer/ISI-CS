          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and wife Gursharan Kaur with representatives of the Indian community in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. (PTI)                                   
	Kuala Lumpur, Oct. 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh refused to tangle himself in Malaysias ethnic issues, saying the country had inbuilt flexibility to handle them.        
	Addressing a joint news conference with his Malaysian counterpart Mohammed Najib Tun Razak yesterday morning, the leaders were asked if the subject of discrimination against the people of Indian origin living in the country figured in their discussions.        
	A visibly disturbed Najib said: This is purely a domestic matter, it is for us to handle it. We are handling it in a positive way and we do not have to discuss such matters between two countries.        
	Singh said: Like India, Malaysia is a democracy, it is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic entity that respects the fundamental human rights of all its citizens. The Malaysian system has in-built flexibility to tackle problems of the nature mentioned.        
	Malaysias problems with the people of Indian origin (PIO), mainly Tamil-speaking, began in 2007 when the Hindraf or Hindu Rights Action Force organised a rally to draw attention to their plight and the discriminatory policies pursued by the government.        
	The country has a bhoomi putra (sons of the soil) policy that gives 30 per cent reservation to the Malay-speaking people in government jobs, education and other spheres.         
	While the Chinese, a major ethnic group, has created a niche for itself by controlling the economy, the PIOs, who were brought as indentured labour to work in the rubber and teak plantations, enjoy less rights after all these decades.        
	Their numbers, however, in services and other professions and their presence in 35 of the 222 parliamentary constituencies have given them some clout, enough, they think, for them to stand up to the government.        
	The government had cracked down on the protesters and arrested the Hindraf leaders, some on sedition charges. The cases were dismissed by the court.        
	The Malaysian government, however, had then taken exception to Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhis objections against the arrests. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Karunanidhi had exhorted him to take appropriate action to end the sufferings and bad treatment of Malaysian Tamils.         
	Senior Malaysian minister Nazir Aziz took note of Karunanidhis missive. In a news statement, he advised him to mind his business and worry more about the problems in Tamil Nadu.

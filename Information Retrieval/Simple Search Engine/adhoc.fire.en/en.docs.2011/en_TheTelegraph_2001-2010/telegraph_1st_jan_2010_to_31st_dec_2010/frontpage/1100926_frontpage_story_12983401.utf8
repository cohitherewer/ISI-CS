The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Scorned Delhi wags finger at Games critics
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Scorned Delhi wags finger at Games critics
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                            Anand Sharma                                  
	Sept. 25: Commerce minister Anand Sharma today asked nations trying to run (India) down over the Commonwealth Games preparations to treat the country with respect and warned them of the possible economic consequences of their derision.        
	Speaking to journalists in Ottawa, Canada, Sharma said the criticism was unwarranted and unfair.        
	Stressing Indias status as an economic power, he said: It would be a mistake not to engage with India with respect, and when it comes to business, whose loss (would it) be?        
	There is no major project anywhere which is concluded to perfection.... Trying to run down the country is not acceptable to us, Sharma said, citing that Canada too had faced criticism when it hosted the Winter Olympics.        
	Sharmas remarks coincided with the foreign ministrys measured response to Australia Prime Minister Julia Gillards two-day-old travel advisory reminding her countrys athletes of the terror threat in Delhi.        
	Terrorism... recognises no political borders. It is incumbent on all countries to join hands to tackle this scourge, the Indian statement said. It added that the Centre had taken effective measures to ensure safety and security during the Games and was in close touch with all participating countries, including Australia, about the steps taken.        
	The lack of respect that Sharma referred to appeared to be reflected in a demand from some of the foreign teams in Delhi today. These teams chefs de mission asked that all cars with direct access to the main venue, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium  including the cars of Indias Prime Minister and President  be checked before being allowed in.        
	Would you check the Queens car in England? an Indian official told the visiting team chiefs before rejecting the demand at a meeting held to review preparedness for the Games.        
	India has come under severe criticism  particularly from Australia, Canada, Scotland, England and New Zealand  following serial setbacks in the run-up to the Games, including a dengue breakout, corruption allegations, a footbridge collapse near the main venue, and reports of slow and shoddy construction, security fears and filthy surroundings in the Games Village. Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates has said India should never have been awarded the hosting rights.        
	Sharma, however, dismissed suggestions that India would fail to appropriately welcome its foreign guests to the event. We have very rich cultural traditions, and we know how to receive our guests. Our guests will be welcomed, and the Commonwealth Games will be rejoiced and remembered, he said.        
	At todays review meeting in Delhi, the Indians turned down a second request.        
	Some foreign teams had asked that the CWG lanes  dedicated lanes on some roads for vehicles carrying athletes  be blocked to all other traffic from 6am to 11pm.        
	The Indian officials said such a restriction would snarl city traffic and that the lanes would be blocked only during athletes journeys between the Games Village and the venues.        
	The team chiefs were briefed about the cleanliness measures taken at the Games Village. Later in the day, home minister P. Chidambaram said the security lockdown of the 11 Games venues had taken place and the Games Village had been handed over to the security agencies.         
	The army today began building a Bailey bridge  a sort of portable bridge  at the site of the collapsed footbridge outside the main venue. A government official said the bridge was expected to be complete in five days.

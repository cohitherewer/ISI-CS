  - Students disqualified for fake papers        OUR BUREAU                                           
	Feb. 18: The Board of Secondary Education, Assam, has barred over 400 students from taking the High School Leaving Certificate examination, starting tomorrow, for adopting fraudulent measures.         
	Altogether 3,79,610 candidates will sit for the examination at 780 centres across the state.         
	The SEBA secretary, D. Mahanta, said the board has disqualified 414 candidates.         
	He said 307 candidates from Daphalakata examination centre in Lakhimpur district and 107 from Tamulpur centre in Baksa district were caught with fake papers.         
	The SEBA has detected that the candidates submitted fake documents to appear in the examinations. Supporting documents like age proof and authorisation letters from their respective schools, along with the examination forms of the candidates, were also found to be fake. As soon as the fraud was detected, the board cancelled the admit cards of the candidates and disqualified them from appearing in the examination, Mahanta said.         
	Forty-two candidates of Udaychal Jatiya Vidya Niketan in Dibrugarh district, on the other hand, were left in the lurch after headmaster Nasiruddin Ansari fled without issuing admit cards.         
	A source said the private school, started in 2008, was yet to receive registration from the education department and affiliation from the SEBA.         
	I have paid Rs 4,000 to the school authorities to appear in the examination. The headmaster and the proprietor, Bhuban Gogoi, had assured us that all candidates from the school would be able to sit for the HSLC examination without any hassle. But we have not yet received the admit cards. Our career has been ruined and now we are left nowhere, Poonam Mandal, one of the candidates, said.        
	Deputy commissioner of Dibrugarh, G.D. Tripathi, said he had asked the district inspector of schools, Phatik Doley, to conduct an inquiry into the incident and submit his report as early as possible.        
	The administration has issued instructions to file FIRs against the erring persons, Tripathi said.         
	Police said the owner of the school has also fled and efforts are on to arrest both Ansari and Gogoi.         
	Speaking about measures to prevent cheating, the SEBA secretary said the board has declared 231 examination centres as highly sensitive and adequate security personnel would be deployed in such centres.         
	The deputy commissioner of Cachar, H.K. Dev Mahanta, said an adequate number of police personnel, under the supervision of five magistrates, would be deployed at various sensitive examination centres to prevent any malpractice.         
	The deputy commissioner of Hailakandi district, Debashis Chakravarty, said police and paramilitary forces would keep an eye on mischief-mongers who smuggle notes and answersheets into the examination centres.

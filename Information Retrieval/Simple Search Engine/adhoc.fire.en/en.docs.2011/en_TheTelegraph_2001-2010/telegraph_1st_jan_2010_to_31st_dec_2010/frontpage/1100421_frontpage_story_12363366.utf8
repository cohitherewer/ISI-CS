          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 20: Intense negotiations and lobbying have begun to find an effective replacement with the noose tightening around Lalit Modi.        
	Key BCCI and political players differ on who or what that could be, but they are all one on the bottomline: the IPL has become too profitable a product for stakeholders and too precious a property in the shining India showcase to be allowed to disintegrate for the alleged foibles of one man.        
	A negotiator said: We have a prized baby in the IPL, we cannot throw it away with the bathwater.         
	Modi arrived in Mumbai from Dubai this afternoon and headed to the capital for a meeting with Sharad Pawar, whose task it is to save the IPL governing council the task of voting its current boss out by extracting his resignation.        
	Modi looked shaken of confidence on his arrival in Mumbai but kept a brave front. I will answer all the allegations that are being raised at the governing council meeting (scheduled for April 26, a day after the final match), there is nothing to worry about, he said.        
	It is likely that Modis imminent ouster may not be made public until the governing council meets.         
	The BCCI/IPL movers and shakers are still lost on the post-Modi arrangements, though. Sources said three workable models were being looked at.         
	The first centres around the BCCI chief, Shashank Manohar, seen to be a key interlocutor on the governing architecture of the IPL after Modis departure.        
	This plan envisages Manohars appointment as ex-officio chairman of the IPL and the appointment of one or a set of professional managers as hands-on conductors of IPL affairs. Manohar is widely perceived as a clean administrator and credited with strong advocacy of transparency in the IPL.        
	Manohar was in Delhi today and held meetings with Arun Jaitley and Rajeev Shukla (both members of the IPL governing council, and both currently ranged against Modi) and, separately, with Sharad Pawar.        
	The second alternative is the elevation of Shukla to the IPL commissioners job. Shukla, Congress Rajya Sabha member and cricket busybody, is seen as someone who can ably conduit the cricket-politics relationship. Shukla himself is learnt to be reluctant for the job, at least on the face of it; besides, it is not known what the extent of his backing is in the cricketing establishment.        
	The third option is to give the job to a prominent former cricketer such as Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi or Sunil Gavaskar. A former cricketer to helm the IPL will bring freshness, some believe.        
	But others argue, credibly, that such an experiment has already failed with Kapil Devs doomed skippership of the Indian Cricket League. Besides, sources said, neither Pataudi nor Gavaskar has evinced any interest in Modis job so far.

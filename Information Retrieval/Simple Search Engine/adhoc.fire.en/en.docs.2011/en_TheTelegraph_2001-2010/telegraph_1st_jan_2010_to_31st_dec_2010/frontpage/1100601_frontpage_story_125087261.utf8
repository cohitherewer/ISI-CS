                                              German Chancellor Angela Merkel address a press conference at the chancellery in Berlin after Koehler said he was stepping down.       
	Berlin, Jun 1 (PTI): German President Horst Koehler's unexpected resignation adds a new source of worry to the long list of international and domestic issues Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right coalition government is grappling with.  
	 German President Horst Koehler announced his surprise resignation last day after appearing to suggest the country's unpopular Afghanistan mission was partly motivated by commercial interests.  I am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect, Koehler, the 67-year-old official head of the, said in Berlin.							   
	A visibly emotional Koehler with his wife by his side called it an honour to serve Germany as president.   I thank the many people in Germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work. I ask for you to understand my decision.							   
	Koehler came under fire earlier this month for saying that an export-reliant country like Germany occasionally needed to defend its economic interests by preventing regional instabilities like that in Afghanistan.  Such regional instabilities certainly have a negative impact on us through trade, jobs and income, Koehler told German radio on May 22.  
	 I regret that my remarks about an important and difficult issue for our country could lead to misunderstanding, said Koehler.   After the interview, Koehler said his comments were misunderstood and that they were not meant to refer to the mission in Afghanistan, where Germany has around 4,350 troops in a NATO-led force tackling a Taliban-led insurgency.							   
	The Merkel led government is already burdened with the euro zone debt crisis and regulating the global financial markets. Its struggle to stabilise the national budget, recover the financial crisis into a sustainable growth and revamping the coalition after its debacle in the state elections in North Rhine Westphalia, is now under new pressure to find a successor to Kohler before the end of this month.              German President Horst Koehler resigned, following the criticism of his recent comments about the country's mission in Afghanistan.      
	Under the German constitution, Jens Boehrnsen, president of the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament and Mayor of Bremen, who took over the responsibilities of Koehler soon after his resignation on Monday, can remain in office only up to a maximum of 30 days. 	  However, it would not be as easy as selecting Koehler for the nation's highest office six years ago, according to political analysts. Koehler was the preferred candidate not only of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) but also of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), who were in the opposition in 2004 and he was brought to contest the election from Washington where he was the Managing Director of International Monetary Fund.							   
	Merkel paid tributes to Koehler's great contributions during his six years in office and said his resignation was a big loss for the country.

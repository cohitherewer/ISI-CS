The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Letter blast to Bengal leaked
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Letter blast to Bengal leaked
  - Delhi bid to placate Mamata        OUR BUREAU       
	Dec. 24: The Union home ministry today leaked parts of a letter written to the Bengal government asking it to disarm CPM cadres in the strongest language used so far amid strains between the Congress and Mamata Banerjee over the CPMs misuse of central forces.         
	The letter from home minister P. Chidambaram to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee refers four times to harmad (mercenaries), a word Mamata habitually uses to describe armed CPM cadres.         
	In Calcutta, the chief minister said he did not know about the letter, purportedly written on December 21, which speaks of a virtual collapse of law and order in parts of Bengal.        
	The leak comes two days after Mamata repeated her longstanding allegation about the CPM misusing the central forces to recapture ground in Jungle Mahal and added a sting: she would quit the Union ministry if she failed to prove her charges. Her party has also spoken openly of the possibility of going it alone in the Assembly polls.         
	Chidambarams letter says: I would urge you strongly to... ensure that all armed cadres, either under the name of Harmad Vahini or any other name, are immediately disarmed and demobilised.         
	Indicting the ruling party, it says: There is evidence that Harmad camps are mostly located in CPI(M) party offices and houses of local CPI(M) cadres. There are credible reports that the Harmad are intimidating, and sometimes attacking, members and sympathisers of Opposition parties. This is completely unacceptable in a democratic system.         
	The home ministry claim that the letter was written on December 21  the day before Mamatas quit talk  appears aimed at escaping the charge of having succumbed to the recent pressure from the ally. Ministry officials, though, did not explain why the letter had yet not reached Bhattacharjee.         
	Mamata was silent on the letter. Trinamul sources said it had vindicated her stand but she would prefer to wait and watch. She wants to see whether the Centre takes any action. The Centre has admitted her position but it has to do something, a leader said.         
	Chidambarams letter cites complaints that armed cadres of the CPI(M) were deployed in a covert manner under the guise of village protection groups to guard against Naxal attacks.         
	If these armed cadres continue to take upon themselves the duties of maintaining law and order, what is the role of... the CPMFS (central paramilitary forces) that has been deployed at the request of the state government?         
	The letter says 96 Trinamul cadres had been killed and 1,237 injured till December 15 and mentions corresponding figures for the CPM (killed 65, injured 773) and the Congress (killed 15, injured 221).         
	You will kindly recall that we had occasion to talk about the Harmad Vahini, the opening sentence reads. The reference could be to Chidambarams August 31 alert to Bengal about armed CPM camps in Jungle Mahal.         
	The letter ends with: I shall be grateful for a line in reply as early as possible. I shall also be very happy to discuss this sensitive matter with you personally.         
	Asked if the state government had received such a letter, Bhattacharjee said I do not know on his way out of Writers Buildings at 5.40pm. Chief secretary Samar Ghosh too denied knowledge of the letter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | ISI role hint in spy flight
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                ISI role hint in spy flight
                            
	Washington, Dec. 18: The flight of the CIAs most important undercover boss from Pakistan has prompted suggestions that the ISI deliberately blew the officers cover to settle scores for a case filed in the US on the Mumbai attacks.        
	American officials said they strongly suspected that operatives of Pakistans powerful spy service had a hand in revealing the officers identity  possibly in retaliation for a civil lawsuit filed in Brooklyn last month implicating the ISI chief in the Mumbai terrorist attacks of November 2008.        
	The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not immediately provide details to support their suspicions.        
	In Islamabad, an ISI official angrily denied it was responsible for revealing the name. We absolutely deny this accusation, which is totally unsubstantiated, the official said in a background briefing.         
	The job of the Central Intelligence Agency station chief in Islamabad is perhaps the spy agencys most important overseas post, one that requires helping oversee its covert war and massaging its often testy relationship with the ISI.         
	That relationship has often frayed in recent years. American officials believe ISI officers helped plan the deadly July 2008 bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul and also provided support to Lashkar-e-Toiba militants who carried out the 26/11 attacks.        
	Michael J. Morell, the CIAs deputy director, met Pakistani officials in Islamabad on Thursday, but American officials said his visit was not the result of the station chiefs case.        
	The lawsuit filed in Brooklyn, brought by families of American victims of 26/11, names the ISI chief, Lt Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, as being complicit in the attacks. It says Pasha and other ISI officers were purposefully engaged in the direct provision of material support or resources to the planners of the attacks.         
	A senior Pakistani official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Islamabad believes that the suit in New York does not have a sound legal basis. We did not need to retaliate, he said.         
	American officials said the CIA station chief had received death threats since being publicly identified in a legal complaint sent to the Pakistani police this week by relatives of drone attack victims. The officers name was revealed last month in a news conference by the lawyer who filed the complaint this week. Soon, it began appearing on Pakistani websites believed to have a close association with the ISI. One mentioned the officer on December 14 and asked readers to track down his pictures.

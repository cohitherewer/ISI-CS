          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: Exit polls today forecast a clear victory for the Janata Dal (United)-BJP alliance in Bihar, implying Nitish Kumar was set to retain his chair with an improved majority and voter support for his development agenda.        
	Two exit polls carried out over the six-phase elections that concluded today projected defeat for the Lalu Prasad-Ram Vilas Paswan combine and relegated the Congress to a poor third.        
	The CNN-IBN-The Week survey painted a euphoric scenario for the ruling NDA, giving it between 185 and 201 seats in a House of 243  a huge improvement from its strength of 143 in the outgoing Assembly.        
	The other exit poll, by AC Nielsen for STAR News, gave the coalition 148 seats.        
	According to CNN-IBN-The Week, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Lok Janshakti Party, which have 54 and 10 seats in the outgoing House, would be the biggest losers, notching only 22 to 32 seats together. AC Nielsen-STAR, however, projected 68 seats for the allies, an increase of four, with gains by the LJP (20) offsetting the losses of the RJD (48).        
	Both forecasts give the Congress a chance to better its tally from nine, one predicting 6-12 seats and the other 14.        
	According to CNN-IBN-The Week, the ruling alliance has increased its vote share from 36.2 per cent in 2005 to 46, while that of Lalu Prasad-Paswan has fallen from 34.6 per cent to 27.        
	If the actual results bear this out on Wednesday, it could mean that Nitish has gained the most from the 6 per cent rise in turnout over 2005.        
	CNN-IBN-The Week found a rise in Nitishs personal popularity. While 54 per cent of respondents preferred him as chief minister, only about half as many  28 per cent  chose either Lalu Prasad or Rabri Devi. Before the previous polls, a similar survey had given Nitish a score of 43 per cent.        
	According to the CNN-IBN-The Week survey, 17 per cent said Bihar had seen a high level of development under Nitish and 55 per cent thought the development was medium.

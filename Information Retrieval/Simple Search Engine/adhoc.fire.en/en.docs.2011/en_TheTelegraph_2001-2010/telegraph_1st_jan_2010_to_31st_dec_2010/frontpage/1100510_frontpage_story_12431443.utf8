	Darjeeling, May 9: Holidaying in Darjeeling, actor Govinda today wondered why Bollywood no longer flocked to the hills as it used to.        
	The hills know the answer but are grappling with a more pressing question: how to stem the stampede of tourists to Sikkim.        
	The two-day flash strike called by the Gorkha Janmukthi Morcha this weekend has prompted many tourists to hastily cancel their bookings and try their luck with the nearest other destination in the neighbouring state.        
	Tour operators in Darjeeling fear the losses will not be confined to the bandh days  May 15 and 16  and the ripple effect could bite for at least 10 more days.         
	By that time, the season will have ended. There was a flurry of enquires early this morning and within a couple of hours, most of Darjeelings business shifted to Gangtok, said a travel agent based here.         
	Foreign tourists do not visit India in May largely because of the oppressive summer, but domestic visitors make a beeline to Darjeeling till early June every year.        
	The announcement of the bandh by Bimal Gurung, apparently to keep up the pressure on the government in the run-up to the next round of political talks related to the demand for Gorkhaland, has tripped the tourism trade at a time business was picking up.        
	Darjeeling can accommodate around 8,000 tourists a day. This time of the year, 2,000 to 2,500 visitors arrive here daily and each of them spends around Rs 1,200 per day. Now you know the losses, said an agent.         
	The season was extremely good this year. Darjeeling was fully packed, while Gangtok still had some rooms (left to be booked). Now we are virtually scrambling for rooms in the capital (Gangtok). Many tourists have decided to spend two days in Sikkim, which had been earlier lined up for Darjeeling, added another tour operator.        
	Anasua Mukherjee from Calcutta had planned a getaway to the hills. We were supposed to be in Darjeeling from May 11 to 16, now we have to cut short the visit and return to Siliguri on May 14. Why take a risk? Its too late to get bookings anywhere else, like Sikkim or in the Dooars, she said.        
	 The immediacy of the tourism industrys woes has dwarfed other concerns here but the question raised by Govinda also points to the gradual displacement of Darjeeling from Bollywoods mind space.        
	I dont know why they are not coming to Darjeeling but if I am given a chance to visit here, I will definitely come, said Govinda, who was here along with wife Sunita who hails from Kathmandu. I like the weather here. It is good for health and health is wealth.        
	Govinda, who had a lacklustre political career as a Congress MP, is no longer the darling of the box office but his question came as a reminder that no big-ticket Bollywood movie had been shot in Darjeeling over the past seven years. The last such film shot here was Main Hoon Na in 2003.        
	Last year, an English film starring Ed Harris, Way Back, used a tea garden near Darjeeling as a location but the hills do not feature by name in the film, going by the faceless someplace in India.        
	For a picturesque terrain known for movies such as Aradhana, it is a hard knock.        
	But such is the despondency here in the wake of unpredictable shutdowns, a tour operator said today, referring to Govindas comments: We dont even have the courage to dream so much. Our aim now is to keep whatever little we have left.        
	Adopting caution, the operator added: We are ready to accept the losses, if that brings stability and peace in the days to come.        
	The Morcha, which has called the bandh, said it was concerned about the travel agents plight. We are concerned, but we do not have many options at the moment. We are hopeful that we wont have to call any further strike, said Amar Lama, a central committee member.

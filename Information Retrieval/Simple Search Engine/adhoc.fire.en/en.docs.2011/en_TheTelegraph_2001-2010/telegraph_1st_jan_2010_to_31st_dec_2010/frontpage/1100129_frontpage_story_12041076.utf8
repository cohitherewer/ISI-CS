          OUR BUREAU                                               
	New Delhi/Ranchi, Jan. 28: Chief minister Shibu Soren today cleared the air over his governments stand against Maoists, saying there was no difference with the Centre on the issue and added that his government would support the national policy on fighting Naxalites.        
	Jharkhand has now been invited for the next review meeting on anti-Naxalite operations to be held in Calcutta on February 9, which will be attended by West Bengal, Orissa and Bihar as well.        
	After an hour-long meeting with Soren, Union home minister P. Chidambaram said: The chief minister came with his deputies, home secretary and DGP. He told me that there is no change in policy of the Jharkhand government and that he is on board with other chief ministers of Naxalite-affected states on the strategy being worked out.         
	Soren refuted reports of any difference with the Centre on the issue of controlling Maoist violence and said his government was determined to curb violence. We discussed developmental issues and the problem of Naxalism. We have been trying to control the menace and will continue to do so, Soren said, clarifying that he was not opposed to operation against Maoists.        
	This was Chidambarams first meeting with Soren who had not been invited to the first anti-Naxalite meeting at Raipur last week. There is now a clear shift in Sorens stand and top BJP leaders claimed they had forced the JMM leader to fall in line.        
	One senior BJP leader told The Telegraph: We clearly told Soren that diluting the stand on Naxalites will not be tolerated. We were very firm and conveyed to him that the government would not survive if he didnt join the national fight against Maoists.         
	Soren, who had already indicated his readiness to alter his initial stand of solving the problem through talks and not bullets, assured the home minister of full cooperation. He even welcomed the Centres offer for sending more forces to bolster Operation Green Hunt. Soren also insisted on greater investments in tribal areas and effective implementation of welfare schemes to take the fruits of development to the neglected population.

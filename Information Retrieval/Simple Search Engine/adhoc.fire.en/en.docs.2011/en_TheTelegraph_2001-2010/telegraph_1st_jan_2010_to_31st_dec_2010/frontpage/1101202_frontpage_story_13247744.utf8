          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 1: Jharkhand government is seriously thinking of creating and developing an institutional area on the outskirts of the state capital to permanently house national-level institutes like Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Central University of Jharkhand, among others.         
	A 600-acre area, around 15km from here, has been identified for the plan. Covering Sukurhuttu, Manatu, Jhiri and Gagi villages under Kanke block of Ranchi district, the area was once considered for setting up a new state capital and house Ranchi University (RU).        
	But the plan, mooted after Jharkhand was created in 2000, was never given serious thought.         
	The current idea to develop the place into an institutional area was the brainchild of chief minister Arjun Munda who issued directives to urban development department in October to work out details.         
	The department bestowed the task to Greater Ranchi Development Agency (GRDA) Limited, the authority entrusted with monitoring the execution of centrally sponsored urban infrastructure development schemes under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.         
	Around 600 acres have been identified in Kanke block. We have requested the state government to allot Rs 265 crore to acquire raiyati, or private, land that exists in the area, though most of the land is government owned, a senior GRDA official said.         
	Land acquisition would begin once the government allotted the funds.        
	Both IIM-Ranchi and the central university were operating out of temporary campuses and are likely to welcome any move by the chief minister to set up a permanent area to house such institutes.        
	IIM-Ranchi, which has begun classes, is functioning from Suchana Bhavan, a building owned by the state information and public relations department. The central university, which began classes last year, is operating out of a panchayati raj department premises in Brambey.        
	If the government is planning to give plots to educational institutions in the same areas, then it is certainly a welcome move, said R.E. Patro, the officer on special duty at IIM-Ranchi. Its always better to work in a group then in isolation, he added.        
	Central university vice-chancellor D.T. Khathing has been scathing about the states failure to provide a suitable plot. Three years have passed since the Centre first asked the state to provide land for the central varsity. We are unable to expand our operations due to lack of a permanent campus, he said.

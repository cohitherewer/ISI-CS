                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Farewell from House
  - Route changed to facilitate public viewing at Assembly        OUR BUREAU                                           
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: Jyoti Basu, who headed the worlds longest elected communist government, will be last seen the most in the house of democracy, not in the party office.        
	In a change of plans, the mortal remains of the Marxist leader will be kept in the Assembly between 10am and 3pm, where common people can pay tribute to the founder politburo member of CPM.         
	 The route we had announced yesterday had to be changed to ensure that people get more time to pay their last respects to their leader, said CPM state secretary Biman Bose.         
	Bose had announced yesterday that after setting out from Peace Haven, the private mortuary where the body is kept now, in the morning, the final journey would stop at Writers Buildings, followed by the Assembly, the CPM headquarters in Alimuddin Street and finally SSKM Hospital.         
	But the plan was changed today after Calcutta police suggested another route keeping in mind the sea of people expected to turn up to pay their last respects to Basu.         
	The road leading to the party office is very narrow and if the body is brought there in the afternoon, it will be difficult to manage the crowd. So we suggested to the leaders to wrap up the affair at the party office in the morning before people from far-flung places start arriving, said a Calcutta police officer.         
	The police said people would enter the Assembly premises through the south gate and would be guided out through the west gate.         
	The last journey, covering around 15-16km, will start from Peace Haven at 7.30 in the morning. An hours stop is scheduled at the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street, followed by a 15-minute halt at Writers Buildings.         
	However, party leaders said that if supporters turned up in large numbers as expected, it would be difficult to stick to the schedule.        
	Since a state funeral will be held, the army will join the last leg of the journey along with party leaders, VVIPs and common people.         
	A state government official said the Centre had decided to involve the army, probably taking Basus stature into consideration.        
	Army sources have said the defence force is playing a limited role. Had he died in harness, the army would have been in charge of the funeral as is the case with serving chief ministers. Here, our involvement is in a truncated form and we will join the procession only in the final stage, said a Fort William officer.         
	At the Assembly, Basus body will be placed in a gun carriage and army pall bearers will lead the procession to Citizens Park, where state police will offer a gun salute to the former chief minister before handing over his body to SSKM Hospital.        
	At Writers Buildings, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti will pay their tributes. Other dignitaries will go to the Assembly, a police officer said.        
	Sonia Gandhi and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina are scheduled to attend but few communist leaders from abroad had confirmed attendance till late this evening.         
	According to the officer, it will be easier to handle the crowd at the Assembly House because of the location and multiple entry and exit points. The VVIPs will enter and leave through the north gate, he said.         
	Over 2,000 police personnel are expected to be deployed. The arrangements reminded an officer of the preparations the police had to make after Mother Teresas death in 1997.         
	 Several heads of state had come that time. Although we wont have to handle such international dignitaries this time, the real challenge will be managing the crowd, the officer said.

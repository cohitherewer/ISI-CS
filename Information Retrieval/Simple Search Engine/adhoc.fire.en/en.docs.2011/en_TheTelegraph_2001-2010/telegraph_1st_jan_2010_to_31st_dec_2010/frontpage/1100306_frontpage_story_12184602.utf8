The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Brown: Iraq war was right
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Brown: Iraq war was right
                                Brown in London. (Reuters)                            
	London, March 5 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told an official inquiry into the Iraq War today that joining the 2003 US-led invasion had been the right decision and that he had provided the necessary funding for military action.        
	Brown, appearing just weeks before an election to discuss a war that still rankles many Britons, acknowledged the human cost of the conflict, said mistakes had been made in the chaotic aftermath of the invasion but distanced himself from the most contentious decisions.        
	I believe we made the right decision for the right reasons, Brown told the five-person inquiry that he set up last year to learn lessons from the conflict following the withdrawal of British troops.        
	Brown said that former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was a serial violator of international law and that tackling him had been an important test for world powers after the Cold War. Obviously the loss of life is something that leaves us all sad, the loss of life particularly after the success of the initial military operation to remove Saddam Hussein is something that leaves me very sad indeed, he said.        
	Brown, finance minister at the time of the invasion, is the most prominent figure to give evidence since his predecessor Tony Blair made a highly publicised appearance in January. While Blair was criticised for saying he had no regrets about the conflict, Brown expressed sorrow for the deaths of both British servicemen and Iraqi civilians.

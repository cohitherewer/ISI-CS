	Khuzama/Dimapur, May 4: The Naga Students Federation this evening decided to indefinitely prevent the movement of Manipur-bound trucks on National Highway 39 in protest against the Okram Ibobi Singh governments decision not to allow NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah to enter the state.         
	Last night, suspected Naga militants set on fire five Manipur-bound trucks near Mao Gate, the entry point to the state on NH 39.         
	Eyewitnesses said suspected militants armed with AK-rifles came in two Maruti vans and set on fire the trucks stranded between Viswema and Khuzama villages in Nagaland around 11.30pm. They also fired a few rounds. On receiving the information, police personnel manning the Nagaland checkgate at Khuzama rushed to the spot but the militants had fled by then. Some empty shells were recovered from the spot.         
	As the NSF and Naga militants vent their ire on Manipur-bound trucks, Muivah, in a late night news briefing at Camp Hebron, the NSCN (I-M) council headquarters located 35km from Dimapur, said, We are not going to wage war, we are going to make peace.         
	He will proceed towards Manipur tomorrow afternoon with a large number of supporters and local and national media but will stop overnight at a village in Nagalands Kohima district. The NSCN (I-M) apparently wants to send a message to both the Centre and the Manipur government that it will prove a point.         
	A senior home ministry official told The Telegraph over phone from New Delhi today that the Manipur government is within its rights to stop him but Muivah may have consulted the Centre on his plans.         
	The Manipur government reiterated its decision on Muivahs visit during a cabinet meeting of the Secular Progressive Front government this evening and urged New Delhi for a second time to stall the visit, saying it would create a serious law and order problems in the state.        
	SPF spokesman N. Biren Singh told reporters after the meeting that Manipur chief secretary D.S. Poonia had been asked to inform Union home secretary G.K. Pillai about reports that Muivah was trying to cross into Manipur with Naga civil organisations and the Centre should not allow this.        
	A sit-in against the state governments decision was reported from Chandel district today but no untoward incident was reported.        
	The Manipur government, however, lifted the curfew from Mao town in Senapati district this morning, following which the trucks stranded near Khuzama were escorted to the state. In a show of goodwill, Nagaland villagers escorted Manipur-bound public buses up to Mao Gate. However, prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC are still in force in Senapati and Ukhrul districts and the states border with Nagaland is sealed. There was strict vigil in Mao and on other routes leading to Ukhrul for the second today.        
	Manipur has deployed over 500 personnel of Manipur police, the IRB and Manipur Rifles and 40 armoured vehicles at Mao Gate. CRPF personnel were also seen patrolling the area. The town and its adjoining areas wore a deserted look as all shops, business establishments and schools were closed. The Nagaland government has also deployed IRB and police personnel on its side of the border. Administrative officials of both the states are monitoring the situation in the area.         
	Several Naga organisations tried to cross over to Manipur but were not allowed to do so by the state police. This included a delegation of Naga Mothers Association who were going to attend a protest rally organised by the Mao Womens Association at Mao and Tadubi towns. Mediapersons were also not allowed to enter Mao town. They could enter for a few minutes after the women protesters who had gathered at Mao argued with the police in their favour.         
	Over 5,000 Naga women from Manipur had converged at Mao in protest against the Manipur governments decision to bar Muivah from entering the state. They carried placards saying, Nagas want peace not war and said Muivahs visit was a symbol of peace and unity and not trouble as presumed by the Manipur government. They demanded the immediate withdrawal of security forces from the border. Another protest rally was held at Tadubi, 15km away. The protesters said they would continue to protest till Muivah was allowed to visit his village, Somdal, in Ukhrul.         
	Minutes after the women left the area at 1pm, the police at Mao Gate tore down a banner saying Welcome to Th. Muivah, Ato Kilonser, GPRN.                     WITH INPUTS FROM ROBERT SAPAM IN IMPHAL

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CBI officers grill ex-Bokaro steel GM
          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                                        
	Bokaro, July 23: Continuing its probe on senior Bokaro steel officials for irregularities in promotions in 2008, the CBI today questioned a former general manager after escorting him to his Sector I residence that had been sealed by the agency since the July 1 raids that unearthed documents suggesting the entire process had been doctored to favour a few.        
	Shankar Narainan, former GM (materials), who was a member of one of the two boards set up to interview those who had qualified in the written tests, returned from Chennai yesterday and was staying at the plant guesthouse, Bokaro Niwas, when the CBI officials knocked on his doors.         
	Under orders from Dhanbad CBI SP V.K. Singh, five CBI officials led by investigating officer R. K. Mishra escorted Narainan to his C-458 residence around 8.50 am and questioned him for over one-and-half hours.         
	Todays questioning came a day after The Telegraph published a report revealing the way the system of promotions was vitiated in 2008 with the publication of lists that had to be revised due to various discrepancies in names of those who had qualified for being elevated to executive positions from non-executive posts.         
	(In that report, Narainan was incorrectly referred to as Narain  the error is regretted.)         
	After the first round of questioning today, Narainan was escorted back to Bokaro Niwas where another round of questioning followed. According to sources, CBI officials showed him a number of documents they had seized from the Bokaro steel administrative building on July 1.        
	They verified their contents with Narainan and also went over some recorded statements of the plants computer operators.         
	CBI SP Singh said the first phase of investigations are more or less complete and the second round, which included interrogation of senior Bokaro steel officials, would start from next week.         
	I am now waiting for the report of investigating officer R.K. Mishra, he told The Telegraph. We are very near to cracking the case and should be successful in nabbing the culprits of the scam.        
	Bokaro steel officials refused to comment on the ongoing investigations. But, officials in its PR department admitted that CBI officers had questioned Narainan who was staying at Bokaro Niwas.

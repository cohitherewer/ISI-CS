  - Outsource hope for JTDC staff crunch        AMIT GUPTA                             A city bus plies in Ranchi on the second day of Maoist bandh. Picture by Hardeep Singh                                         
	Ranchi, July 8: The state urban development department is looking for outsourced manpower to run the much-fancied city bus service, having realised the ill-equipped Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation (JTDC), on which the responsibility was thrust upon to beat a court imposed deadl- ine, will not be able to sustain it.        
	With a strength of six regular and 100-odd contractual employees, the JTDC is struggling to run the buses in two of the five scheduled routes in the state capital. The services are yet to be launched in Jamshedpur and Dhanbad even though the state has issued a commitment to start by the first week of July.         
	JTDC managing director Siddharth Tripathi put up a brave front. It is a fact we face an acute manpower crunch but that doesnt mean JTDC will not be able to sustain/expand the city bus services. We have decided to outsource people, he said.         
	The urban development department has come out with an advertisement to look for reputed agencies/service providers with offices in Jharkhand (preferably in Ranchi, Dhanbad and Jamshedpur) to run the buses in the three cities on a three-year outsourcing contract.        
	Understandably, the state is looking for drivers, conductors, cleaners, security personnel etc for the bus service, a project that is being implemented in partnership with the Centre with funds under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.        
	Proposals from interested parties will be accepted till the afternoon of July 12 when they will be scrutinised by a tender committee at JTDC office.         
	The state has been pursuing various options. Yesterdays JNNURM review meeting chaired by chief secretary A.K. Singh discussed a proposal from Sainik Kalyan Board, a society of retired army officials, on running the buses.        
	It quoted a daily charge of Rs 550 per bus for Ranchi and Dhanbad and Rs 500 per bus for Jamshedpur. The offer is being discussed and considered, said an official of the department.         
	For JTDC, running the service in the state capital, albeit truncated, is proving to be a Herculean task. It was only after state transport department provided 20 of its own drivers and conductors that the bus service could be launched in Ranchi on June 26, three days after the extended deadline that was set by the Jharkhand High Court.         
	We have only six regular employees and 100 contractual ones to look after the tourism infrastructure spread across the state. The job of operating the city bus service has been thrust upon us and we do not know how long we can continue, admitted a JTDC official requesting anonymity.         
	He said forming city bus service corporations in each of the cities to run the buses was the only feasible way out.         
	Under JNNURM, Ranchi and Dhanbad are to get 100 buses each, while Jamshedpur is to get 50 buses. So far, 90 buses have been ordered for the capital, of which 70 have arrived. The buses for Jamshedpur and Dhanbad are yet to reach.

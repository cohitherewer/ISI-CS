          ANINDYA SENGUPTA AND AVIJIT SINHA                            Mamata                                  
	Sept. 28: Adivasi and Rajbanshi outfits in north Bengal today said they would request Mamata Banerjee to visit their region and address their grievances as she had done in Darjeeling.        
	The invitation provides the Trinamul Congress with an opportunity to expand its base in the Dooars and the Terai, which fall in Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri, as well as in Cooch Behar district.         
	In the region, the Left has been losing ground since last years Lok Sabha polls and the Congress is facing the threat of yielding Opposition space to Mamata.        
	 We want Mamata Banerjee to visit the Terai and the Dooars, meet our organisations and get a feel of our problems so that she can make some announcements that could benefit us, said John Barla, president of the Dooars Terai regional unit of the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad.         
	Rajbanshi leaders spearheading the Greater Cooch Behar movement also want the railway minister to reach out.        
	We sincerely believe that a visit by her to the Rajbanshi belts of north Bengal would help improve the peoples condition, Asutosh Burma, secretary of the Greater Cooch Behar Democratic Party, said today.         
	Unlike in the hills where Mamata can at best ride piggyback on the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, Trinamul can enlist the support of these communities to set up its own base in the plains.        
	The 2009 parliamentary poll results reveal that the Left vote share has gone down significantly, compared with the 2004 parliamentary polls, in the tribal-and-Nepali-dominated Dooars and Terai regions and in Rajbanshi-concentrated Cooch Behar.        
	The CPMs vote share in the Darjeeling parliamentary seat dropped from 33 per cent in 2004 to 25 per cent in 2009. Party sources said that since then a sizeable chunk of the tribals, Nepalis and Rajbanshis in Terais Phansidewa and Matigara-Naxalbari Assembly segments had begun moving away from the Left towards Trinamul.        
	Barla cited two key reasons for the tribal shift. Despite several representations, the state government has done little to improve infrastructure in the region, especially in health, education and job creation, he said.        
	Besides, for generations, tea workers have been living in the gardens, but they have not been given land rights to their homesteads, Barla said.         
	A CPM minister of north Bengal said: We cant count on the support of Nepalis now but we would be in trouble with the Adivasis moving away from us. The tribals and Nepalis constitute nearly 80 per cent of the population of the Dooars and Terai regions and that is a cause for worry.

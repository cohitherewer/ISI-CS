The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Deb signals end of quota

										      ANINDYA SENGUPTA                      Gautam Deb                          
	Calcutta, Aug. 28: Housing minister and Hidco chairman Gautam Deb has told the CPM brass he would henceforth allot Rajarhat plots only through public advertisements and none through his special quota which has triggered controversy, sources close to him said today.        
	As for the already allotted quota plots, Deb has asked his officials to contact legal experts such as Fali Nariman, Soli Sorabjee and Harish Salve to find out if anyone could successfully challenge these in court, the sources said. They hinted that a favourable legal opinion could help Deb, among other things, to answer questions from the party.        
	The CPM leadership is still unsure if Deb would return the plot his wife Debjani has been allotted through a draw of lots. We havent yet heard from him on this, a CPM state secretariat member said today.        
	On Thursday, tourism minister Manab Mukherjee had announced he had returned the plot his wife had got from the Hidco chairmans quota, in a move seen as the partys way of telling Deb to follow suit. But Deb has so far resisted the pressure on the ground that his wife got the land not from his quota but through lottery.        
	Gautam has told the party he would from now on take out newspaper ads seeking applications for Rajarhat plots. He has said the special quota he had introduced is a one-off and will not be used further. That will make the entire process of land allotment transparent, a source said.        
	Deb today told The Telegraph: Any step regarding land allotment in Rajarhat will be taken keeping the public interest in mind. But I would not like to comment at this stage on the process to be adopted (for allotment).        
	A housing department official close to Deb said: The minister is contacting legal luminaries as he fears that a court case can come up against the Rajarhat land allotments. Any legal opinion in his favour would stand him in good stead and he will be able to face questions from the party as well as the Opposition.        
	There is pressure on Deb from within the party and the Opposition to come clean on the land allotments. The Congress has demanded a white paper while the Trinamul Congress has filed an RTI application.        
	The CPM believes the Rajarhat allotments need to be handled with care since the crucial issue of land has led to the partys defeat in successive polls since 2008.        
	Gautam has been told by the party leadership not to do anything that could spark a controversy, one of the sources close to Deb said.

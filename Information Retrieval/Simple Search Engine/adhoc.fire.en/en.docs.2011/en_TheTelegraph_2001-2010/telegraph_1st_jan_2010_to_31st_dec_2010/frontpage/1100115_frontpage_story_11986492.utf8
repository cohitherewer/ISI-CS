  - Rs 1000cr department   for Ajsu chief        AMIT GUPTA                             Sudesh Mahto addresses the media in Ranchi on Thursday. (Manik Bose)                                              
	Ranchi, Jan. 14: A closed door meeting over dahi-chura on Makar Sankranti broke the ice between two strained allies today, with chief minister Shibu Soren gifting the rural development portfolio to Ajsu, placating its chief, Sudesh Mahto, who was miffed at not being given home.        
	The drama began around 10am when Soren, son Hemant and deputy CM Raghubar Das went to meet Mahto at his Saurabh Kunj apartment on posh Kanke Road.        
	Less than three hours later around 12.45pm, by which time television crew and media persons had gathered around the area, Soren, Das and Hemant came out smiling.         
	Nothing important I came here to have some dahi-chura on Makar Sankranti. There is no problem, Soren said, indicating that a deal was struck with Mahto.        
	Behind them were Ajsu ministers Mahto, C.P. Chaudhary and Uma Kant Rajak.        
	For Ajsu, bagging rural development was a coup of sorts, given that it has one of the highest budget allocations  2009-2010 fiscals budget size is Rs 1,000 crore.         
	Mahto tried to downplay the crisis. He said talks with Soren centred around the agenda for a common minimum programme to be finalised after consultations with the three major allies of the JMM.        
	We werent annoyed. We were only concerned about common peoples interests, claimed Mahto, who had been made in-charge of other important departments like roads, building construction, forest and environment and sports, art amp; culture.         
	Soren had allocated the rural development portfolio to JMMs Mathura Mahto along with agriculture and animal husbandry. But, he said he had no problem giving it up now.         
	I had no specific choice earlier. Let them give the worst department. I will try to perform my best, he told The Telegraph from Tundi.         
	The Ajsu was delighted at the new portfolio for its chief. Thana nahin mila to kya hua, block to mila (what if we failed to get police stations (read home portfolio), but at least we got blocks (read rural development department), said an Ajsu minister.         
	The budget size of the rural development department may be around Rs 1,000 crore, but given the number of central schemes it oversees, the effective allocation could be around Rs 4,000 crore.         
	For one, the department deals with the execution of the MGNREGS for which the Centre had allocated a whopping Rs 3,100 crore for labour this financial year. Among its other responsibilities were Sampurna Gram Swarozgar Yojana and Indira Awas Yojana.         
	This apart, the department also deals with transfers and postings of plum positions like BDOs, among others.         
	But if the Ajsu was rejoicing, the BJP remained nervous. Anxious to see the crisis blow over, Das rushed back to Ranchi last evening from Delhi. Now, he was relieved that things had been sorted out.

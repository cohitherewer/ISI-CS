  - Hostess slur on Odafe, Bengal boy          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            File picture of Odafe                                         
	Mumbai, Jan. 5: Three footballers, including the highest paid in the country and a goalie from Bengal who played a stellar role recently, were arrested by Mumbai police this evening on the charge of outraging the modesty of an airhostess on a plane bound for Calcutta.        
	The three  Okolie Odafe, Arindam Bhattacharya and Ogba Kalu  play for Churchill Brothers. The team was on its way to Calcutta to play against Mohun Bagan on Thursday in the I-League. Churchill Brothers, the defending champions, is now leading the league table.        
	Odafe is the teams captain and the highest paid footballer in the country. Arindam had played a decisive role in Indias SAFF Cup victory in Dhaka last month. The entire team was deplaned at Mumbai airport but the others are expected to leave for Calcutta tomorrow.        
	The alleged episode unfolded aboard SpiceJets Goa-Mumbai-Calcutta flight SG804. The incident happened a little after the flight took off from Goa and the seat-belt signs went off. Arindam and Odafe were sitting next to each other and laughing and joking with Kalu who was in the seat before them. An airhostess was passing by at the time and Odafes hand fell on her as he raised it to tap Kalu. He immediately stood up and apologised to the girl who was a bit offended initially. But when he explained that it was completely unintentional, she accepted the apology, said Churchill assistant coach Mario Soares.        
	A little later, Soares claimed, a male flight attendant came up to Odafe and Arindam and accused them of molesting the girl. We tried to explain, but this steward was arrogant. Though some of us felt an undercurrent of racism in the way he approached Odafe, we are willing to give him the benefit of doubt. But we are not going to accept this horrible accusation. Odafe is a father of two and very civilised, said Soares.        
	A SpiceJet source, however, claimed that Odafe had deliberately touched the crew member. The other players laughed and passed lurid comments. The act seemed like some kind of bet among the three, the source said.        
	I am not aware of any racist angle. We are carrying out alcohol tests on the three. We have charged them under IPC 354  for outraging the modesty of a woman. The commander of the SpiceJet flight got in touch with the ATC while he was mid-air and CISF personnel detained the entire 23-member team before handing over the three offenders to us, said Amitabh Gupta, assistant commissioner of police, west region, Mumbai.        
	Churchill officials were livid that the entire team was deplaned. This is absurd. A most innocuous incident has been turned into a malicious allegation by SpiceJet crew. We will file a defamation case against SpiceJet, Churchill president Joachim Alemao told The Telegraph from Goa.        
	Is there a bedroom in the plane? It was not molestation, PTI quoted Alemao as saying.

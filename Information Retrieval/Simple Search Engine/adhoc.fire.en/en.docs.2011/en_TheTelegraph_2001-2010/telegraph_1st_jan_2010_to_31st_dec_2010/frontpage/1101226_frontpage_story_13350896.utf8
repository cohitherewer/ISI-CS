	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Mamata Banerjees feisty stance on the CPMs alleged misuse of central forces is aimed at pressuring the Centre into advancing the Bengal elections and the Congress into accepting a state alliance on her terms, Congress managers here believe.        
	They feel the Trinamul Congress chief has chosen the right time to strike since the government is on the backfoot as it battles the Opposition attack on corruption. The Congresss dependence on allies has increased now, a party leader said.        
	Mamata has long been demanding central intervention in Bengal but the Centre, embroiled in various controversies, has started taking her seriously only now. Parts of a leaked home ministry letter asking the Bengal chief minister to disarm CPM cadres shows her pressure has worked, Trinamul leaders said.        
	However, CPM state secretary Biman Bose today said the state had not received the purported letter.        
	I had a talk with the chief minister. State government officials also denied receiving such a letter from Chidambaram. How do I comment on a letter that does not exist? he said on the sidelines of a party event in South 24-Parganas.        
	Sources said a feeling of desperation appeared to have set in of late in Mamatas camp because of fears that the Left was getting time to recoup from the string of electoral setbacks it had suffered since the 2008 panchayat polls.        
	Reviving the Rajarhat land acquisition issue was her strategy to keep the anti-CPM momentum alive, sources said. When that failed, she returned to her core allegation on CPM-sponsored violence in Bengal and misuse of the joint forces deployed for anti-Maoist operations.        
	The hurried steps taken by the Bengal government to introduce 10 per cent reservation for backward Muslims and appoint some 50,000 panchayat teachers may have added to Mamatas restlessness, the sources added.        
	Mamata wants elections  they have to be held by June 11, 2011  at the earliest so the model code of conduct kicks in, preventing the government from taking any more popular decisions. She wants the elections over by February-end before the exam season begins.        
	Sources said she was using the ongoing political clashes to press the Centre to pave the way for early polls. A lot of innocent lives would be saved if polls are held early as the CPM is resorting to violence to scare the masses, Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee said after meeting the Prime Minister last week.        
	Mamatas other motive is believed to be to keep the Congress on a leash in Bengal. After Rahul Gandhi mentioned an alliance with dignity in September, Congress leaders have talked of bagging a good share of seats for the polls. But Mamata has lost no opportunity to remind the Congress it would have to accept being a junior partner.

	New Delhi, Sept 28 (PTI): Defending the music maestro A R Rahman over the Commonwealth Games theme song fiasco, melody queen Lata Mangeshkar has said that people should not expect every song of this genius composer to be a rocking hit.
    "I have not heard the song. What I am hearing is continuous criticism, which I don't like at all. Rahman is an extremely dedicated composer and people are getting too harsh because of just one failure," Lata Mangeshkar told PTI .
    "It's just like people should not expect century from Sachin (Tendulkar) in every match. It happens in music also. Even the veterans do mistakes sometimes. I cannot say that every song of mine is perfect. Many a times I am not satisfied with what I have sung," said the Bharat Ratna awardee.  
	Lata turns 81 today  
	The Bharat Ratna winner who has lent her voice to generations of Bollywood actresses from Madhubala to Kajol, is celebrating her birthday in her ancestral home in Kolhapur, said sources close to her.  
	"I don't celebrate my birthday. I performed the Puja and 28th September is just like any other day for me," Lata told PTI.
    Even though Lata chose not to celebrate the occassion wishes have poured in from around the world from fans, including many famous names.
    Her younger sister and fellow singing legend, Asha Bhonsle, led a host of A-listers who wished the singer on Twitter.
    "My favourite Female Singer and also my Elder Sister Latadidi celebrates her Birthday today.

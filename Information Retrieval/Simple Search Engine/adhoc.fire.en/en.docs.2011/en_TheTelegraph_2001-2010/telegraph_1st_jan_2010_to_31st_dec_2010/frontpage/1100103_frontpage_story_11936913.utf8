	Ranchi, Jan. 2: Chief minister Shibu Soren today said his government would not launch a major offensive against Maoist rebels, provided they remained silent.         
	 If they keep quiet, we too wont harass them unnecessarily. Anti-Naxalite operations in the state have virtually been suspended. Our government is ready for talks with top ultra leaders at any time and accept their justified demands, he said.        
	The chief minister was speaking to newspersons at Raj Bhavan after senior JMM leader Teklal Mahto was sworn in as pro tem Speaker of the Assembly. Soren was flanked by Governor K. Sankaranarayanan and senior BJP leader and deputy chief minister Raghubar Das as he aired his views about Naxalism.        
	Commenting on todays bandh called by the CPI (Maoist), Soren said the poor masses bore the brunt of such bandhs. Any organisation may have the fundamental right to call a bandh, but the poor daily wage earners are the ones who are affected by it. If they (rebels) are championing the cause of the poor, they ought to consider these factors as well, he added.        
	Reacting to CPI (Maoist) politburo member Koteshwar Rao alias Kishanjis remark that Soren was not a man of principles and that he had repeatedly sold himself for personal gains, the chief minister said he was in politics for the larger interest of the people and he was not committed to a particular class.        
	Who is stopping him (Rao) from selling himself? Does he have any takers? I am fed up of answering such frivolous questions. I have always fought for the welfare of the downtrodden, Soren said.        
	Replying to another question, he said the cabinet expansion and distribution of portfolios would take place after his government won the vote of confidence. He denied any infighting in the alliance over plum portfolios.         
	The chief minister said his government would take all possible steps for the growth of all languages.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, pro tem Speaker Mahto said the Assembly session will begin on April 4.         
	The Soren government will seek the vote of confidence on January 7.         
	After the trust motion, the governor will address the House on January 8. The House will be adjourned sine die on January 9.

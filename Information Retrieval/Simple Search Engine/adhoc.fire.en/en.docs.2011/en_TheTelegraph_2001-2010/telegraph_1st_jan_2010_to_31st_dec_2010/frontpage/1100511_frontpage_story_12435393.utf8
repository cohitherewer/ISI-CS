The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Himanta champions young doctors cause
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Himanta champions young doctors cause
          DAULAT RAHMAN                                     
	Guwahati, May 10: Assam health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is in sync with a section managing the countrys cricketing affairs.         
	The minister, too, prefers the young over the more experienced when it comes to manning the states hospitals and medical colleges, only to be slammed by the medical fraternity. Responding to an exclusive news report published in Sundays edition of The Telegraph about a large number of senior doctors of the three medical colleges in Assam applying for voluntary retirement scheme, Sarma told this correspondent, We need, like any industrial house, some outflow to accommodate new blood.         
	He said only some doctors who had opened private nursing homes or were busy in serving the private hospitals by ignoring their duties at government hospitals had applied for VRS.         
	The government does not mind giving VRS to these selfish doctors. Rather, the government is going to make an announcement in public that the doctors who are interested in private practice must apply for VRS. We have young and new people who can fill up these places. Considering the fast development and changes in the medical profession, it has become an industry which needs new and enthusiastic persons, Sarma said.         
	But I must mention that if the doctor in question is an experienced person with no private nursing home connections, I will personally approach him to convince him that he should not leave. Both chief minister Tarun Gogoi and myself have sent delegations to Dr J.N. Sarma, head of paediatrics at the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, requesting him to withdraw his VRS application.         
	Sources, in the meantime, told this correspondent that Dr Sarma was adamant about leaving GMCH. Significantly, Dr Sarma is also the institutes staff president.         
	Retired and senior faculty members of GMCH, Assam Medical College and Hospital, Dibrugarh, and Silchar Medical College and Hospital, however, expressed total disagreement with the ministers comment on the health sector being an industry that requires an outflow to make way for new blood.         
	The Forum of Former Medical College Teachers of Assam discussed the news report in a meeting today and urged the state government to introspect on the issue instead of responding with a knee-jerk reaction in the greater interest of medical education and research.                                       
	The president of the forum, Dr Narendra Nath Barman, told this correspondent that it would be grossly inappropriate and incorrect to compare the medical profession with any industrial house. He said it would be a great loss for the states medical institutions if their senior faculty members could not use their experience and expertise gained over decades for the benefit of patients and students.         
	The saying old is gold is very appropriate for the medical profession. There is a heaven and earth difference between new doctors with only theoretical medical knowledge and those who have been in the profession for years and have practical knowledge and experience in terms of treatment and teaching to produce future doctors. Relationship with patients also differs between young doctors and experienced ones, Barman, a former principal of GMCH, said.         
	Bolin Gogoi, former head of the cardio-thoracic department at GMCH, said according to the guidelines of the Medical Council of India, senior doctors such as associate professors and professors should devote 10 per cent of their time treating patients, 20 per cent of their time teaching and the remaining 70 per cent of their time in medical research.         
	I feel the reverse is happening in Assam with doctors looking after patients for more than 70 per cent of their time and teaching for the remaining 30 per cent, with time for research just about out of the question. And then, of course, there is no job satisfaction and frustration in careers of senior doctors. The government must address the issues, Gogoi said.        
	Not surprisingly, apart from those who have applied for VRS, there is a growing number of senior doctors applying for lien to serve in upcoming (central government) organisations such as the North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences in neighbouring Meghalaya, viewed by many as a route to get away from the profession as it exists in the government sector in Assam.        
	The health minister, however, evaded a direct reply on the teaching and research issue and only said the government did not want doctors who go to private hospitals.         
	The Telegraph report on the increasing number of VRS requests among senior doctors, in the meantime, has sent alarm bells ringing.         
	State water resources and labour minister Prithibi Majhi, who is also the chairman of the AMCH governing body, today said he would strongly take up the issue during the next meeting of the state cabinet. As a matter of fact, I will try and take up the issue before the cabinet meeting and will personally take up the matter with the chief minister, he said.         
	Majhi was at the AMCH this morning to attend the foundation stone laying ceremony of a 200-bed mother and child ward building. I have decided to seek the intervention of the chief minister since the matter is serious and desires immediate attention, he said.

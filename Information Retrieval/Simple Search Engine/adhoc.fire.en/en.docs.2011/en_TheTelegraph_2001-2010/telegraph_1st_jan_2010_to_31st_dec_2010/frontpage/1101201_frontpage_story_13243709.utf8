The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | For success in Bengal, teach your children how to throw stones
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                For success in Bengal, teach your children how to throw stones

	Calcutta, Nov. 30: A monolith mounting a last-gasp effort to mobilise support and two parties trying to make their mark today displayed how their calculations and that of citizens need not match to find success in Bengal.        
	Stone-age politics hurled itself back into the heart of Calcutta this afternoon with a Left siege crowning its seven-day programme at Metro Channel and a BJP march igniting a bomb-fuelled streetfight 200 metres from Lalbazar.        
	Not to be left behind, a newfangled Congress ensured that its 2,000 supporters extended the disruption domain to the south in Alipore to protest deteriorating law and order in South 24-Parganas.         
	Large parts of central and north Calcutta, from Girish Park to Theatre Road and Moulali to Strand Road, reeled under the impact of the first two rallies between 1pm and 6pm.         
	If anyone thought it was business as usual in a city known for its rallies, the unusual element crept up in the form of the identity of the perpetrator of violence.        
	The BJP, the supposedly least powerful mainstream political party in the state, put up a show inversely proportionate to its electoral muscle. The 15,000 BJP supporters who marched to the Writers Buildings  apparently to protest price rise  clashed with police near Lalbazar, injuring over 20 law-enforcers.         
	Said a senior official of an industry association: This happens only in Calcutta Here the political parties try to outdo each other in terms of disruptions they cause to people. I dont know why they do such things.        
	The history of politics in Bengal is ripe with answers to this question. The fortunes of the Left parties soared in Bengal as they successfully turned Calcutta into a city of rallies.        
	Faithfully following in the beaten track paved by its ideological foe, the BJP leadership today crowed success without batting an eyelid.         
	In a break from the past, Writers Buildings witnessed above 90 per cent attendance though it was a big rally day.        
	Some attributed the trend reversal to the weakening of the Co-ordination Committee, a CPM-backed employees union. Others linked it to the phenomenon of high attendance on payday in government offices where turnout peaks on the last day of the month.         
	Employees of the cash-strapped state government did not forget payday. But many politicians in Bengal missed the significance of the day, the birth anniversary of scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose, as they hit the streets.        
	Sociologist Andre Beteille, who delivered the 72nd JC Bose Memorial Lecture on the institutes APC Road campus, said: It is sad that calculations of benefits by the politicians and citizens calculations of costs never match.         
	Beteille, who could have reached the venue in 25 minutes from where he was staying in the city, left for the institute two hours ahead of schedule because of the scare of disruptions.         
	BJP state president Rahul Sinha corroborated Beteilles assertion, claiming success for the near-40,000 turnout in the march to Writers programme.        
	Our support base is going up as we are organising such programmes. On August 30, we had organised a demonstration against power tariff hike. Todays programme was organised to protest price rise and we mobilised a bigger turnout, said a proud Sinha.         
	Sinha had seen how a bustling BB Ganguly Street emptied out after some crude bombs went off and BJP supporters and policemen threw stones at each other. People can bear with such disruptions, said a smiling Sinha.        
	Police officers said BJP leaders had promised a peaceful agitation. The attack was deliberate and we found crude bombs People sitting near the dais were the first to attack the force and we arrested 25 people, city detective chief Damayanti Sen said.        
	A section in the police held poor intelligence network also responsible for the mess near Lalbazar. The deployment was more for the Left rally and it was a mistake, said a source.         
	The Left rally to drum up support for the coalition was important enough for the police to lavish attention. Among the 25,000 participants was chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Stakes are so high in Bengal politics today that political parties cannot afford to be rational, summed up sociologist Prasanta Roy.

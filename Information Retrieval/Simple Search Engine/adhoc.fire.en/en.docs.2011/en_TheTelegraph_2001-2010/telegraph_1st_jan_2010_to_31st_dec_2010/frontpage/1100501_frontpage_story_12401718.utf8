                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Agencies locked   in scrap over spy
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                     
	New Delhi, April 30: The big fish is in the net, now the countrys intelligence agencies are fighting over the catch.        
	The quarrel is over who has the right to interrogate Madhuri Gupta, the middle-level diplomat in the Indian high commission in Islamabad who was arrested on Sunday on the charge of spying for Pakistan.        
	Sources said RAW, Indias premier external intelligence agency, had been made to take the backseat after the Intelligence Bureau claimed it had the first right to quiz Gupta as it had raised the alarm about her frequent visits to Jammu and Kashmir in a vehicle with a Pakistani number plate.        
	RAW officials, however, say the IB had been tracking Gupta for more than six months but failed to inform them even when the alleged spy was on their turf.        
	According to the sources, RAW officials are also miffed that their station head in Islamabad, R.K. Sharma, has been implicated in the mess. The officials allege that Sharmas name has been bandied about in the media to discredit the agency.        
	I dont know why they (RAW) havent taken it gracefully. Maybe because news has leaked that RAW officers were involved and they might have to shut shop in Islamabad for some time, former IB joint director Malay Krishna Dhar said.        
	While IB officials are gloating over the fact that they had tracked down a spy who was operating under the noses of RAW officials, the other agency, sources said, was also uncomfortable with the big fish tag the IB has given Gupta.        
	RAW officials claim that a junior officer like Gupta didnt have information that could have been of much value to Pakistans spy agency, ISI.        
	Home ministry sources said RAW officials had met top foreign office personnel to convince them that Gupta didnt do much damage.        
	Sources said the main grouse of the RAW officials was that they should have been kept in the loop. They also allege that the IB conducted the entire operation in secrecy to intentionally malign RAW.         
	A former intelligence official summed up the RAW-IB rivalry. Their reluctance to share information with each other is legendary, the former official said.

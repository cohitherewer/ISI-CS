The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bengal reply to BJP query
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bengal reply to BJP query
          RASHEED KIDWAI AND AJAY SUKUMARAN                      Bachchan in Bangalore                           
	Jan. 23: After Gujarat and Bengal, Amitabh Bachchans Paa has headed south  to win a tax break.        
	Karnatakas BJP-led government today announced a 50 per cent exemption on entertainment tax for the film, which deals with a rare genetic disorder.        
	Among the audience who saw the special screening was chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, who recommended it to moviegoers. It helps us to understand about the rare sickness, the BJP leader said later.        
	The tax relief down south came a fortnight after Gujarats BJP chief minister Narendra Modi, hailed as shahenshah by Bachchan, waived the entertainment levy.        
	The appeal for tax relief is next scheduled to reach Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, a BJP ally, and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan.         
	The pattern has prompted critics of the actor to say that his quest for exemption was showing signs of treading a political path.         
	However, Left-ruled Bengal has also granted tax exemption to the film. The waiver was given because of the noble message of the film, where Bachchan plays a patient afflicted with progeria, a condition in which symptoms resembling aspects of ageing are manifested early.        
	Bachchan, who was in Bangalore today to promote his new film Rann, was quick with his retort when asked if his visits to BJP-ruled Gujarat and Karnataka were not a coincidence. I have been to Bengal also but that doesnt make me a communist, he said.        
	In Bhopal, a source close to Chauhan said the BJP regime would do everything possible in recognition of the actors contribution to cinema. Bhopal, the source added, has special regard for Amitabh. He is its jamai raja (son-in-law).         
	Bachchans mother-in-law Indira Bhaduri has been living in Bhopal for decades and his wife Jaya studied in the citys St Joseph Convent School.        
	Congress leaders wouldnt say much on record but in private many wondered if Bachchan, a former Congress MP-turned Samajwadi Party sympathiser, was trying to look for political backing elsewhere as friend Amar Singhs political fortunes appeared to be on the wane.        
	The leaders say that political patronage can come in handy at a time Amar has alleged vendetta by chief minister Mayavati in Uttar Pradesh. An FIR related to alleged money laundering has been filed in the state, naming Amar, his wife Pankaja and Bachchan. Amar has termed the case politically motivated.

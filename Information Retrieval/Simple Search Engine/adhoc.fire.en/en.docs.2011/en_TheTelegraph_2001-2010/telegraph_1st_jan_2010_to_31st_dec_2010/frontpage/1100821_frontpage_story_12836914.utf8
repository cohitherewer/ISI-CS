          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Jyotiraditya Scindia in Indore on Friday                                  
	Bhopal, Aug. 20: Sundays Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association election, which pits two political heavyweights against each other, has turned murky with the sports bodys two-decade-old financial norms being questioned and feelers being sent across party lines.        
	Kailash Vijayvargiya, a minister in Shivraj Singh Chauhans BJP government, has alleged that the states Gwalior unit receives preferential treatment in financial matters.        
	Gwalior is the turf of current state cricket association president Jyotiraditya Scindia, a Union minister from the Congress, whose bid for re-election is being challenged by Vijayvargiya.        
	In an open letter to all the 255 members of the state association, the BJP minister has alleged that the Gwalior divisional unit has more funds than the state body.        
	Vijayvargiya has alleged that the Gwalior unit, which is packed with Scindia supporters, retained 86 per cent of its earnings from the ODIs it hosted on November 15, 2007, and February 24, 2010, against Pakistan and South Africa.        
	He has said that the unit in his hometown of Indore, in contrast, gave 84 per cent of its earnings from the India-England ODI of November 17, 2008, to the state association. As a result, the state associations earnings from these matches are Rs 2.12 crore and the Gwalior divisions are Rs 2.71 crore, Vijayvargiya added.        
	Reacting to these allegations, former national selector and key Scindia aide Sanjay Jagdale said Gwalior needed the money for its stadium. Gwaliors Roop Singh stadium belongs to the citys municipal corporation; the Gwalior division has it on lease. Besides, it is an old stadium, so a lot of money needs to be spent on its upkeep.        
	Jagdale added that each time Indore held an international match, its cricket (divisional) association received 1,000 free tickets. If the cost of these tickets is converted into actual money, the Indore division has very little reason to complain or talk about preferential treatment for Gwalior, he said.        
	Scindia could not be contacted. The junior Union minister for commerce and industry returned from an official trip to China today and immediately began a door-to-door campaign among the state association members from Indore that accounts for 190 of the state associations 255 members.        
	Late tonight, the Scindia camp sent feelers to Vijayvargiya seeking a compromise. It has offered Vijayvargiya the post of the state cricket association secretary if Scindia is permitted to stay on.        
	At the same time, the Scindia camp is trying to win the support of Indore MP and veteran BJP leader Sumitra Mahajan, who can apparently influence over two dozen votes. Mahajan is a known opponent of Vijayvargiya.        
	Scindias supporters are also counting on the Union ministers proximity to senior BJP leader and Delhi cricket boss Arun Jaitley. Vijayvargiya insists he has Jaitleys blessings, though.        
	Vijayvargiya has also brought Scindias late father Madhavrao into the controversy. He claimed that in 1987-88, when Madhavrao headed the state association, he had unilaterally decided that all international matches in Madhya Pradesh would be held only in Gwalior and Indore.        
	Vijayvargiya has alleged that Madhavrao took neither the associations general body nor its executive panel into confidence while deciding to ignore the claims of all the other cricket centres in the state.         
	In Gwalior, cricket has traditionally been under the direct control of the Scindia camp, so it has been getting preferential treatment. We want to end Gwaliors hegemony, Vijayvargiya has said.

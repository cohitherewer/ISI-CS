The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hazardous abroad, sold in India
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Hazardous abroad, sold in India
          G.S. MUDUR                                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The continued availability of a banned anti-diabetes drug in India has underscored how arbitrary and slow action by the countrys regulators has exposed patients for years to hazardous medicines proscribed or used under severe restrictions in many other countries.         
	Sections of clinical pharmacologists and doctors have long been concerned that medicines discarded by regulators elsewhere because their risks were viewed as outweighing benefits remain approved for manufacture and sale in India.         
	The Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO), the apex drug regulating agency in India, had ordered suspension of the manufacture of an anti-diabetes medicine called rosiglitazone earlier this month after the European Medicines Agency banned it in September amid concerns that it increases the risk of heart attacks. US drug regulators had also ruled that rosiglitazone should be a drug-of-last-choice  when no other drug worked.         
	But the CDSCO order to state drug controllers on October 7 doesnt appear to have seeped down to retail chemists. Some states have told chemists associations to stop selling the drug. But this correspondent could buy two brands of rosiglitazone without a prescription on October 24 from an outlet in Delhi.         
	Experts on drug laws say the CDSCO order by itself without a formal notification is legally invalid. One state drug controller in eastern India said the order was ambiguous about sale of the drug, but drug controllers in Bangalore and Mumbai said they had alerted chemists associations in their states against sales.         
	Weve instructed chemists associations to stop the sale of rosiglitazone and return their stocks to distributors or manufacturers, Prakash Uttarwar, joint commissioner for drugs in Mumbai, told The Telegraph. But there are 70,000 retail chemist shops in Maharashtra  itll take time, he said.         
	A doctor who was a member of an advisory panel that asked the CDSCO to suspend rosiglitazone has said the panel had concerns that abrupt cessation of sales would not give patients time to consult doctors for alternative drugs to control diabetes.         
	Yet, the CDSCOs move against rosiglitazone is in sharp contrast with its slow action on other medicines that have been discarded elsewhere but continue to be manufactured and sold in India, an industry analyst said.         
	A paediatric formulation to treat fever and pain, a decongestant for colds, and a medicine to treat irritable bowel syndrome and constipation are among such drugs.        
	The drugs controller general of India, who is the head of the CDSCO, did not respond to queries from The Telegraph relating to such drugs.         
	A CDSCO official who requested anonymity said that India did not blindly follow US or European regulators. We have set up a pharmacovigilance network of 26 centres to monitor adverse effects of drugs  as far as possible, we would like to use our own adverse events data to decide on such drugs.        
	But experts warn that Indias pharmacovigilance effort lacks reliable data. Pharmacovigilance in India is a joke, said Chandra Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, a journal of drugs. Which doctor in India diligently keeps a record of all drugs consumed by patients over the past seven days when an adverse event is observed?        
	Many see the CDSCOs action  or inaction  on such drugs as arbitrary and non-transparent. An antidiabetic drug, phenformin, discarded by most of the world in 1971 was withdrawn in India 32 years later in 2003  only after lawyers drew a courts attention to its continued sale.         
	But India banned a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, rofecoxib, in December 2004, within months after the original manufacturer of the drug voluntarily withdrew the drug from the market amid concerns that it may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.         
	Gulhati points out that rofecoxib, which had annual domestic sales of Rs 90 crore, was banned quickly while a fever-relieving agent, nimesulide, banned by several countries but with sales worth Rs 200 crore in India, continues to be sold here.         
	Its really unfortunate that much of the information doctors get about drugs comes from company representatives  doctors need to be aware of whats going on with drugs in other countries, said a senior medic in a corporate hospital in New Delhi.         
	A CDSCO official claimed that each time a drug had been withdrawn by foreign regulators, expert committees had determined whether it should continue to be used in India. The official said a panel of technical experts was currently re-assessing at least three drugs  nimesulide, phenylpropanolamine, and tegaserod  but declined to explain why these drugs were selected for re-assessment.         
	Medical experts caution that without a robust pharmacovigilance system in place, adverse reactions that occur after long-term ingestion or even short-term consumption of such drugs may not be picked up by regulatory authorities.         
	It is legitimate to ask why drugs banned elsewhere continue to be available in India, a senior World Health Organisation official said.We need to understand the criteria that (CDSCOs) technical advisors use to take decisions on such drugs.

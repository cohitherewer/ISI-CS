The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Valencia to Valley, money passes 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Valencia to Valley, money passes 
  - With Kashmir on the boil, trail from Spain blips on security radar          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                    
	New Delhi, July 10: Indian security agencies are looking at Spain for reasons other than what Paul the octopus has prophesied but over an issue that apparently has more tentacles.         
	A barely noticeable money trail winding all the way from some Spanish cities and towns to Kashmir has caught the antennae of the security establishment, the channel stoking renewed interest in the wake of the current unrest in the Valley.         
	Information accessed by The Telegraph shows that the money from places like Barcelona and Valencia, known for their football clubs, has reached Srinagar where stone-throwing youths have forced the government to call out the army after several years. The Union home ministry had claimed earlier this week that it had evidence that the stone-throwers were being paid from abroad.        
	The remittances from Spain havent benefited the stone-throwers alone, according to the investigators. They cover the entire spectrum of activities ranging from gunrunning to stone-throwing. You cannot separate stone-throwing from delivery of an AK47, a source said.        
	For more than a year now, home ministry sources said, intelligence agencies have been tracking these remittances through a well-known money transfer agency from Spain to Kashmir.        
	The modus operandi portrayed by security officials has some similarities to the tactics of the Spanish soccer team  picked by the oracle octopus to win Sundays final that has edged past rivals with short, quick passes.        
	According to the Indian investigators, agents of Pakistans spy outfit ISI have been passing small amounts of cash from Spain to receivers in Jammu and Kashmir. The sleuths said the transactions went unnoticed for a long time because the amounts being sent were small. In one transaction, on June 13 last year, as little as Rs 1,800 was sent from Torre-Pacheco, in the Murcia region of Spain, to Jammu.                     
	Six days later, however, the same person sent about Rs 12,000 from Tapiolas near Barcelona to a woman in Srinagar.        
	Sources said several arrests in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu late last year gave sleuths clues to the money trail from Spain and other Mediterranean countries.        
	After intelligence agencies caught on, one person was arrested last year on the charge of receiving Rs 5,000 from an ISI agent from Europe in return for observations that later proved to be information on politics in Kashmir.         
	It was found that the man, whose name security agencies didnt want revealed lest it alerted the ISI agents, received no less than Rs 1.3 lakh last year before being arrested.        
	Investigations also threw up another name, K. Singh (name changed), who intelligence sources said was involved in sending money from places like Barcelona and Valencia to several people in Srinagar.        
	Former police chief of Delhi Ajay Raj Sharma said that over the past few years, a lot of money had passed into terror hands through various channels. Now, hopefully, mechanisms have been devised (to keep track), he told The Telegraph.        
	When money is sent, a unique transaction identity is created and even if fake names are given, the transaction ID, known as MTC number, keeps tabs on remittances. This has helped security agencies track rogue transactions from foreign agents.        
	While the person who received the Rs 1.3 lakh recorded his real name while accepting the money, Singh registered a fake identity and is suspected to be either a Pakistani national or someone with links to that country.        
	Sources said though the cash trail had been unearthed, the racket was yet to be busted. Money continued to flow from these places into the pockets of many associated with the separatist All Party Hurriyat Conference, the sources said.

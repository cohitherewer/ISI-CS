          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, July 22: As many as 121 backward castes from Jharkhand were today included in the central list, 10 years after the state was carved out of Bihar, in a move that will entitle them to reservation benefits in Union government jobs and central educational institutions.         
	Done on the basis of recommendations of the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), this was the first time the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment notified the central list of OBCs with respect to Jharkhand, instilling a sense of belonging among the young people living in the Maoist-affected state being the idea behind the long delayed initiative.         
	Besides, the Union cabinet also approved inclusion of 64 castes from Chhattisgarh and also amended the central list of OBCs with respect to Bihar, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and the Union territory of Daman amp; Diu.         
	The new entrants into the central list would benefit from reservations in direct recruitments in central services and be entitled to financial assistance from the National Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation for skill development.         
	Recognising that Maoists thrived on a sense of alienation among the poor, a majority of whom are OBCs, the government has decided to first address those issues, said a source in the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment.         
	Ironically, the recommendation of the NCBC was pending with the Centre since 2007, the source added, the states political instability standing in the way of it being pursued earnestly.         
	Chairman of the State Commission for Backward Classes Justice (Retd) Loknath Prasad said backward class students belonging to Jharkhand were denied jobs in the central government as well quotas in central educational institutions as they werent included in the central list ever since the new state was created.        
	There are 158 castes in the list of backward classes (114 in extremely backward castes and 44 OBC) in Jharkhand. So, it implies that the inclusion of 37 castes is still pending with the NCBC, said Prasad         
	Often, he said, he received complaints from students who did not get reservations in central government jobs.         
	I often forwarded it to the NCBC for action. The NCBC chairman sent a strong reminder to the ministry only a fortnight back, Prasad pointed out.         
	In fact, several of the 158 castes listed as backward in Jharkhand were among the 131 castes from Bihar who were already in the central list. But they did not get the privilege after Jharkhand was created. It required a separate notification by the Centre for getting them the constitutional privilege after Jharkhand was born on November 15, 2000, said an official in the state commission.         
	The issue of backwards from Jharkhand not getting central government jobs has often been raised in the Assembly. And no doubt todays Union cabinet decision to update the central list was taken with an eye on the coming state elections in Jharkhand.

	Governor M..H. Farook on Thursday allotted portfolios to his advisers Wilfred Lakra and R.R. Prasad, while retaining key departments himself.         
	While Lakra will head 18 departments, Prasad will handle the affairs of 12 departments. The remaining would be looked after by the governor himself till such time a third adviser is appointed. According to a Raj Bhavan official, former chief secretary V.S. Dubey would most likely be the senior-most adviser to the governor and would take charge of the remaining departments.

  - MP minister to contest against scion in cricket poll        RASHEED KIDWAI                            Jyotiraditya Scindia                                        
	Bhopal, Aug. 16: The Scindia camp is facing a stiff challenge on the cricket pitch in Madhya Pradesh after three decades of uninterrupted reign.        
	Kailash Vijayvargiya, a resourceful politician in the mould of Sharad Pawar and the late Pramod Mahajan, has decided to take on Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) elections scheduled for August 22. The MPCA is affiliated to the Board of Control for Cricket in India.        
	The bulk of MPCA voters  190 out of 255  belong to Vijayvargiyas home town Indore. But the Scindia camp is putting up a brave front. He (Jyotiraditya Scindia) will most certainly contest and win, said Sanjay Jagdale, a former national cricket team selector and close Scindia aide.        
	The battle is not easy, because under the MPCA constitution, an incumbent who has completed eight years needs to win by a two-thirds majority.         
	Scindia took over in September 2001, after his father Madhavrao Scindia died. The elder Scindia was closely associated with cricket administration and had served as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.        
	Apart from Jagdale, who enjoys considerable goodwill among MPCA delegates, Jyotiraditya is counting on Shravan Patel, an influential businessman and politician from central India.        
	While Scindia is the Union minister of state for commerce and industry, Vijayvargiya is the commerce and industry minister in Madhya Pradesh.         
	The BJP cabinet minister had shot to fame for publicly backing Pragya, the sadhvi under arrest for alleged involvement in the Malegaon blasts.        
	It is a battle for fair dues for Indore, Vijayvargiya has declared, alleging that under Scindia, Gwalior has been getting undue attention in all cricket-related matters of Madhya Pradesh.         
	Jyotiraditya, who is keen to follow his fathers cricket legacy, is counting on support from another BJP leader, Arun Jaitley. The leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and Jyotiraditya are both part of a BCCI disciplinary committee investigating the role of former Indian Premier League commissioner Lalit Modi.         
	The Scindia camp is hoping Jaitley will prevail upon Vijayvargiya to let him get elected unopposed. In exchange, they have offered to accommodate Vijayvargiya as MPCA office-bearer.         
	But Vijayvargiya discounts the possibility of the central BJP leadership forcing him to backtrack. Confident of victory, he is camping in Indore and hosting lavish dinners for MPCA members while Jagdale looks after Scindias election preparations.         
	AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh is also a player in the MPCA polls. While the former chief minister does not hold any formal cricket post, his influence in Madhya Pradesh can tilt the balance for the contenders. In state politics, Digvijay and Scindia are considered as arch rivals.

	New Delhi, Oct. 15: Rejoicing over a torrent of self-congratulations, Delhi is masking its relief at the end of the Commonwealth Games in a fortnight that scared India with the Ayodhya verdict, the turmoil in Kashmir and the embarrassment of shoddy preparations before a global audience.        
	Basking in the afterglow of the successes is Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who drew the loudest cheers during the CWG closure at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium last night.        
	For a man who is Prime Minister for a second term despite not having contested for the Lok Sabha, it is a measure of how office can translate into popularity rather than the other way round.        
	Manmohans rise in stature through this period is indirectly proportional to that of the team that was tasked with hosting the Games: sports minister M.S. Gill, urban development minister Jaipal Reddy, organising committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi and secretary-general Lalit Bhanot.        
	Less than 24 hours after the curtain went down on the Games, the Prime Ministers Office set up a panel headed by a former comptroller and auditor general to look into the charges levelled against the organising committee. ( )        
	Only Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit has salvaged her reputation with her pallu-tucked-in supervision of the housekeeping. Manmohan was applauded because of the perception that it was he who decided enough was enough and India cannot be any more discomfited on the world stage.        
	Barely two weeks ago, India was on tenterhooks: home minister P. Chidambaram pulled out all the stops, alerted the air force and deployed police and paramilitary forces in 16 towns and cities across the country that his establishment had identified as the most trouble-prone in the wake of the September 30 Ayodhya verdict of Allahabad High Court.        
	Three days later, the Commonwealth Games opened in Delhi amid warnings from intelligence agencies of possible terror strikes. The warnings were sounded even as a torrid summer in Kashmir ranged stone-pelting youths in the Valley against the security forces who opened fire and killed youngsters.        
	Busloads of athletes from as many as 71 countries were landing in Delhi. The first contingents put up in five-star hotels because they found the CWG village unliveable. Through September, the capitals roads were torn, the debris was piling, water was flooding the roads, bridges were breaking and snakes were wriggling in guestrooms.        
	The joke was that Kalmadi had tried to hang himself but the ceiling gave way. Even badminton champion Saina Nehwal whose singles gold finally took India to the second rank in the medals tally said she found the venues wanting.        
	Cut to October 14. Delhi turned up in the stadium to a party that just could not be happening enough. Riots had not broken out, there was no terrorist strike, the street-fighting in Srinagar was abating, even the Maoists kept a lower profile, the athletes were having fun.        
	All the negatives have added up to a huge positive. Then there was the gold rush of the Indian men and women at the Games, a haul rich enough to cast its afterglow on the government of Manmohan Singh.        
	This is a great shame. Until Indians refuse to put up with the often mediocre efforts of their government, some things simply arent going to get any better, wrote Will Heaven, assistant comment editor, in The Daily Telegraph, London. Yes, there were many successes during the Games  Indias record tally of gold medals and the fact that there were no terrorist strikes, for instance  but the Shame Games have also lent weight to many damaging stereotypes about India.        
	In the lead-up to the Games, the shoddiness of the preparations was so apparent and so lengthily commented on in the national and global media that New Zealand and Canada had threatened to pull out. On the eve of the opening ceremony, however, Delhi shored itself up at the cost of its beggars and vendors and with a touch of gloss.        
	The extensive reportage on the poor preparation also drove down expectations to such a level that just the glitch-free opening ceremony was a mood-enhancer. The medals that followed sent pulses racing at the thought of new heroes and heroines  Krishna Poonia in the discus throw for example  who do not wear flannels and pads and gloves and wield bats and hurl balls.        
	For 15 days now, Delhi  and, daresay, India  has held its collective breath.        
	International sports competitions have become branding events for rising powers like China, Brazil, South Africa and India that are muscling into the top tiers of the global economic order. Staging an athletic event is a tool for instilling national pride and for testing the ability of a government to manage a huge, complicated undertaking as the world watches, Jim Yardley reported in The New York Times today.        
	As Kalmadi, booed and jeered, muddled through his speech in the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium last night, it was evident that relief was being passed off as rejoicing.        
	Kalmadi plodded through a thanksgiving list. Who was on it and who was not? Everyone because everyone now wants to claim credit. But even as he stuttered, the news was out that Delhis lieutenant governor Tejinder Singh had complained to the Prime Minister that Dikshit was being given too much credit for cleaning up the Games Village. A week before the Games, every agency was blaming every other because doom was predicted.        
	Such is the way life is in the Third World: failure is expected, it is even natural. Just not failing is enough to claim great success.        
	In the First World  Delhi had but a glimpse in the classy act put up by the Scot performers at the closing ceremony  anything short of perfection in a public function is unacceptable. Smug foreign visitors were also taken aback because they expected the inevitable  failure  to happen. An Australian TV channel claimed it had carried out a sting operation  smuggling fake explosives inside the Village. The sting was exposed as a media fraud.        
	Today, the international media mood is different. The media in Australia, New Zealand and in the UK are mostly impressed. But they do ask questions on where India is headed.        
	The Beijing Olympics, for all its grandstanding and clockwork precision, did little to enhance Chinas image in the world as a humane regime. Instead, it may have even served to embolden the Communist Party and sustain Chinas image as a hard state.        
	Beijings outrage after human rights campaigner Liu Xiaobo was this month named the Nobel Peace Prize winner has served to reinforce the notion that China continues to be undemocratic.        
	Likewise, in successfully resurrecting the Commonwealth Games from the shambles that it was in, Manmohans UPA II has shown how sensitive it continues to be about putting on a show for a global audience.        
	The political capital that it translates to may not be at odds with the image of India as a bumbling behemoth.

	Ranchi, Sept. 2: The first meeting of a nine-member unified command of Jharkhand, constituted to provide an edge to the ongoing anti-Maoist operations as per Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs suggestions, will be held on September 9 and a retired major general rank officer will be chosen shortly to be a key part of the set-up.         
	Home secretary Rajbala Verma told The Telegraph that a notification to set up the unified command, to be headed by the chief secretary, was finalised last month. Now, we are in the process of appointing a major general rank officer who will be part of the command, she added.        
	The Prime Minister mooted the proposal of a unified command at a meeting of chief ministers of Naxalite-hit states on July 14 to bring state forces, the administration, paramilitary forces and a retired army official under a single umbrella to add more bite to the anti-rebel operations.        
	Verma said the Centre had referred a panel of three retired major general ranked officers  M.S. Balhara, A. S. Grewal and Vinay Bhatnagar. We asked them to furnish their work profile and they have responded. One of them will be part of the command, she pointed out.         
	Once appointed, he will be entrusted to oversee operations against the Maoists and also impart training to state forces.        
	The nine-member command will include the chief secretary as chairman and IG (operations) as convenor. Others in the team include development commissioner, home secretary, DGP, IG (CRPF), special branch head, a representative of the Intelligence Bureau, and a retired major general.        
	The home secretary said the command would help the state combat Maoists in a coordinated way. All of us will come on a single platform and will be able to understand each other better, she added.         
	IG (operations) R.K. Mallick said the induction of a senior army officer would help the state forces to upgrade skills. Moreover, the command will clear hurdles that often crop up while executing development schemes in Naxalite-hit zones, he added.        
	Mallick also clarified there was no let up in anti-Naxalite operations across Jharkhand.         
	CRPG DIG Alok Raj said Maoists were beginning to show signs of weakening after the recent surrender of over a dozen hardcore extremists. Most trusted lieutenants of zonal commander Kundan Pahan have either been killed or surrendered, he maintained.        
	He also added that the August 23 life-term sentence pronounced by a fast track court on the member of the CPI(Maoist) politburo and central military commission, Amitabh Bagchi, would also convince others to surrender.        
	Or else the state will bring them to justice, he said.

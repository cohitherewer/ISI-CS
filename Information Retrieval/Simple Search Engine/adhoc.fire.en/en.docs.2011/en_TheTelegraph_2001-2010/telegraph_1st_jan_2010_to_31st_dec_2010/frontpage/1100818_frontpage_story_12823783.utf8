          BARUN GHOSH                            Gurjant Singh. (Jahangir Badsa)                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 17: Leaders of the Sikh community have appealed to political parties not to make Gurjant Singh a pawn, prompting the Trinamul Congress to say it will have no objection if the truck driver is released on bail.        
	Gurjant, who has been accused by Trinamul of trying to murder Mamata Banerjee, has been remanded in 12 days police custody since Thursday.        
	A section of Sikh leaders supporting Trinamul had met Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, at the Sant Kutia Gurdwara in Bhowanipore to bring to his notice the ordeal of Gurjant.        
	Some other community members who support the CPM met Gurjant at Bhawani Bhavan, the CID headquarters where he is being kept, today. We assured him of financial help to fight the case, said Soham Singh, a member of the West Bengal Minority Commission.        
	We always vote for the Trinamul Congress. But we are hurt at the way Gurjant is being subjected to harassment.... We had no complaints about his arrest for rash driving after he had intruded into Mamatadis convoy with his truck. But to re-arrest him on the charges of conspiracy and attempt to murder Mamatadi is not acceptable, said Baljit Singh, a member of the Sriguru Singsabha of Rash Behari Avenue.        
	Baljit Singh said they had lodged a protest with Parthada at the meeting. We shall also call on Mamatadi in a day or two to apprise her of Gurjants ordeal. We are waiting for his family members to arrive, he added.         
	Chatterjee confirmed that the Sikh community members had pleaded with him to reconsider Gurjants case. But we, too, feel that the driver was made a scapegoat by the CPM. In fact, those who had hatched a conspiracy to kill Mamata should be punished, he said.        
	Trinamul MP from Tamluk Subhendu Adhikari, on whose complaint the driver was re-arrested, today said: We will have no objection if the truck driver is released on bail.        
	A Trinamul source said that the party leadership was now keen to wriggle out of the situation and nip in the bud suggestions that a member of a minority community was being targeted.        
	A Trinamul vice-president said several Sikh leaders from Kalighat, Bhowanipore, Rashbehari and Mominpur wanted to seek Mamatas intervention but she was unable to meet them because she was unwell.        
	Virendra Singra, the Congress MP from Sangrur where Gurjants Mauran village is located, said from Delhi over phone that he would write to Mamata protesting against the harassment of a poor person from his constituency. A gross injustice is being meted out to a poor driver from my area, he said.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Petrol prices close to Rs 60 a litre
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Vehicles line up at a petrol pump in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: State-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) will hike petrol prices by Rs 2.96 from midnight tonight, following global crude prices touching $90 a barrel.        
	The other two state-run refiners, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), will hike petrol prices from Thursday.        
	Following todays price hike, a litre of petrol will cost Rs 59.77 in Calcutta, Rs 55.87 in Delhi, Rs 60.31 in Mumbai and Rs 60.40 in Chennai.        
	IOC, HPCL and BPCL are currently losing about Rs 4.70 for every litre of petrol as crude prices have risen to $90 a barrel, the highest since 2008. Every $1 increase in crude prices pushes up the price of petrol by 35 paise a litre.        
	On Monday, India bought crude at $89.34 a barrel. Through December, prices have averaged at $88.47 a barrel against about $79 at the time of last hike in petrol prices on November 9.        
	Since June 25, when petrol prices were deregulated, IOC, BPCL and HPCL have revised rates only four times. On November 9, they had raised petrol price by 34 paise per litre to Rs 56.81 a litre in Calcutta.        
	A smaller hike in diesel rates is likely to be considered by an empowered group of ministers (EGoM) headed by Pranab Mukherjee on December 22.        
	Oil marketing companies are losing Rs 5 per litre in revenues on diesel sales. The EGoM had on June 25 freed petrol prices and decided to make diesel prices market-determined in due course.        
	Diesel accounts for a third of the countrys oil needs. Any hike in diesel prices is a politically and economically sensitive issue as it increases the prices of essential commodities.        
	If prices are not revised, IOC, BPCL and HPCL are likely to end the fiscal with close to Rs 67,000 crore revenue loss on sale of diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene. Oil retailers lose Rs. 272.19 on the sale of every 14.2kg LPG cylinder and Rs. 17.72 per litre of kerosene.        
	Between April and September 2010, IOC, BPCL and HPCL lost revenues of Rs 31,367 crore by selling fuel below cost. So far, the finance ministry has committed to providing only Rs 13,000 crore, although the oil ministry wants about half of the revenue loss to be met by the government.

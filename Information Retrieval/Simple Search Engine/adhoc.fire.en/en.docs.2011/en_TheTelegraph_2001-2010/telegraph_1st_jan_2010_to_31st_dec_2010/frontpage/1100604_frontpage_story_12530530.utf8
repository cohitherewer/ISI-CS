	New Delhi, Jun 4 (PTI): Giving a new twist to the bidding controversy, suspended IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi today claimed that the Twenty20 leagues interim chairman Chirayu Amin was part of the consortium that made an unsuccessful bid for the Pune franchise in March this year.              
	Modi said Aniruddha Deshpande, Managing Director of City Corporation in which Sharad Pawar and his family had 16 per cent shares, made the bid in March for a new consortium which included Amin.              
	 quot;There were three members in the consortium that was part of the bid. They were Aniruddha, Akruti and Chirayu Amin, quot; said Modi, whose suspension saw Amin being appointed as the interim IPL chairman.              
	 quot;Its a fact of life and I cannot change or distort facts. They were the bidders, one cant change that, quot; Modi said.              
	Amin was not available for comments.

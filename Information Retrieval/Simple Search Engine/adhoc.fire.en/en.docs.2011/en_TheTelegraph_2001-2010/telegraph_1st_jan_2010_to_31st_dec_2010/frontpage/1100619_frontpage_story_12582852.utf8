          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Kohima/Imphal, June 18: The All Naga Students Association of Manipur suspended its economic blockade on the two national highways in the state from 4 this afternoon, 69 days after having imposed it.         
	Ansams declaration at the end of a meeting with various Naga organisations in Kohima came on a day that Manipur observes as the Great June Uprising ( ). It also followed the withdrawal of state forces from Jessami in Ukhrul and Liyai Khunou in Senapati in the wake of NSCN (I-M) general secretary Th. Muivah pulling out from near the states border with Nagaland.        
	Though Ansam has lifted the blockade, it would take some time to resume normal supplies with Manipur transporters remaining firm on avoiding the Imphal-Dimapur highway (NH 39).         
	Budha Luwang, the president of Inter-state Bus Owners Association, said buses plying between Guwahati and Shillong would not use NH 39. Truck operators will also skip the highway.        
	Yumnamcha Dilipkumar, the president of United Committee Manipur, said, the decision not to use NH 39 had been taken with transporters organisations. But it is good that the blockade has been suspended because it is in the interest of the people. But the suspension does not make much difference as we are not going to use NH 39.        
	Ph. Devan, a leader of the All Manipur United Clubs Organisation, said Ansam had suspended the blockade because it had realised it was anti-people. We do not feel either happy or sad about the imposition or suspension of the blockade. We are more focused on building our own economy, he said.        
	Transporters and civil society groups of Manipur are angry that Naga organisations impose blockades frequently as if the highways were their fiefdom.         
	Because of the frequent blockades along NH39, the Manipur government is also now more focused on NH 53 (Imphal-Jiribam highway). Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh has already requested the Union home ministry to transfer the maintenance of NH 53 from Border Roads Organisation to the state PWD.         
	The meeting which decided to suspend the Ansam blockade was attended by the Naga Hoho, the United Naga Council of Manipur, the Naga Students Federation, the Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights and the Naga Womens Union of Manipur. Ansam had enforced the blockade against the holding of elections to the autonomous district councils in the hill districts of Manipur.        
	In a joint statement, the Naga organisations said they took the decision to temporarily suspend the blockade in deference to the request of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister P. Chidambaram and leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj.        
	However, the meeting endorsed the United Naga Councils decision to declare the ADC polls in the Naga areas of Manipur as null and void and sever all ties with the state government. It demanded that the Centre make alternative arrangements for the Nagas in Manipur. It also urged the Centre to remove Section 144 CrPC and withdraw state forces from the Naga areas. Condemning the declaration of UNC and Ansam leaders as offenders, they decided that the agitation would continue till the aspirations of the Naga people were fulfilled.        
	The 600-strong Manipur forces withdrawn last night reached Imphal this morning.         
	The Centre has sent six additional CRPF companies to Senapati since yesterday, two of which arrived from Assam today. Once these forces are sent to reopen NH 39, nine CRPF companies will be deployed along its Senapati sector as three companies were deployed at Mao Gate on May 6. However, with Ansam lifting the blockade, there may be a re-think on their deployment.

  - Krishna, Hillary forge close relationship through exchange of gifts          K.P. NAYAR                            US secretary of state Hillary Clinton watches as foreign minister SM Krishna speaks at the                                         
	US-India strategic dialogue reception on June 3        
	Washington, June 20: When Barack Obama arrives in the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan in five months for a ceremonial welcome at the start of his state visit, external affairs minister S.M. Krishna will have the US Presidents secretary of state Hillary Clinton on his arms.        
	In an exceptionally personal gesture underlining the rapport established between the two foreign ministers in the last one year that they have been engaging each other, Clinton gave Krishna a pair of platinum cuff-links with her signature inlaid in gold and the official seal in golden hue of the US state department embossed above it.        
	Krishna gave Clinton an exquisite carving in Rajasthans famous marble with delicate inlays. The exchange of gifts took place during the first Indo-US strategic dialogue in Washington on June 3.        
	The state departments old India hands told The Telegraph that Clinton told her chief of protocol, Capricia Penavic Marshall, in the run-up to Krishnas visit here that she wanted to give him a gift that was personal but also reflected the external affairs ministers personality.        
	Clinton, who has been visiting India since 1995, had observed that Krishna was one of the few Indian politicians who not only wore cuff-links instead of buttons but also had an impressive collection of them.        
	Ambassador Marshall, who has been among the closest aides of the secretary of state since she was her special assistant during Arkansas governor Bill Clintons 1992 presidential campaign, proposed the cuff-links for Krishna as a special gesture.                          
	This is not the first time that Clinton has invested personal time in choosing a gift for Krishna, for whom the Americans now running the administration here have exceptional regard because of his association as a student in the US with John F Kennedys presidential campaign.        
	When Clinton went to New Delhi last year on her first visit as secretary of state, she took a rare copy of JFKs Pulitzer Prize-winning Profiles in Courage, which was autographed by the late Robert F. Kennedy, who wrote the foreword to the book.        
	At that time, Marshall took care to encase the gift in a leather case that itself was made to look like a book with the insignia of the US government and engraving of Clintons full name and the date: July 2009.        
	Krishna gave Clinton a Ganesha in sandalwood from his home state of Karnataka. Clinton is said to have remarked about the gift that she needs the elephant gods large ears to listen to the whole world and assimilate new ideas as secretary of state.        
	Since he took over as external affairs minister, Krishna has made efforts to introduce some imagination into South Blocks process of procuring gifts for visiting foreign dignitaries and reform the system at the ministry of external affairs (MEA).        
	In the case of Clinton, India had to particularly live down a huge embarrassment in the exchange of gifts when her husband made his state visit as President in 2000.        
	Then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave Bill Clinton a copy of Walt Whitmans Leaves of Grass because the MEAs protocol officials who decided on the gift were unaware that the President had given Monica Lewinsky the same book of poetry.        
	When the Presidents affair with Lewinsky dominated American news, passages from Leaves of Grass such as unspeakable passionate love were freely used by Bill Clintons enemies to ridicule him.        
	It did not help the Presidents Indian hosts that some decades earlier, when Bill Clinton was courting Hillary Rodham, he had given her the same book.         
	Vajpayee, himself a poet, not only gave the book but also spoke about Whitmans poetry while aides to the President discreetly looked down and made an effort to hide their blush.        
	Krishnas efforts to change the MEAs gift-buying system have not come a day too soon. Some years ago, a woman deputy chief of protocol, who obviously had insufficient knowledge of mens clothing or Iranian sensitivities, bought neckties for Irans then foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati.        
	In the Islamic Republic of Iran, neckties are disapproved of not only because they are seen as symbols of western style and custom but also because of a perceived association with Christianity since neckties form a cross where their knots are tied at the neck.        
	When Manmohan Singh first met Pakistans General Pervez Musharraf in New York in 2004, Pakistans President thoughtfully gave the Prime Minister an original copy of a mark sheet from Singhs school in Pakistan, but the Indian government had no gift for Musharraf.        
	Gursharan Kaur, the Prime Ministers wife had brought along a painting of old Delhi where Musharraf was born and she asked her husband to give it to Musharraf. As it happened, Pakistans President was thrilled with the gift although it had nothing to do with the governments imagination or thought process in gift-buying.

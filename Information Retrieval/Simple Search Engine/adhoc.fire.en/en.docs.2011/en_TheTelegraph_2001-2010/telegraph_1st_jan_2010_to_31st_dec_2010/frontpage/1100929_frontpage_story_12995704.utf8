  SC clears decks for Ayodhya ruling           OUR BUREAU                                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 28: The Ayodhya judgment will be announced on Thursday afternoon, with the Supreme Court today ending a week of see-sawing tension with a one-line order.        
	The apex court dismissed a petition seeking to defer the title suit verdict after the Centre, taking many by surprise, said it wanted an end to the uncertainty.        
	Tension and uncertainty, however, loomed on another front, prompting the Prime Minister to appeal to all Indians to maintain peace and harmony whichever way the September 30 verdict went.        
	Very unusually, the three-judge bench gave no reason for its ruling.        
	After hearing the arguments advanced, we are of the view that the special leave petition (for deferment) deserves to be dismissed, the bench headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia said, giving its unanimous verdict at 2pm.        
	Within hours, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court announced it would deliver its judgment on the title suit at 3.30pm the day after tomorrow.        
	Although most of the parties to the title suit were against any further delay in the verdict, it was the Centres stand that appeared to have swung the case.        
	Judiciary watchers had yesterday suggested that if the government expressed even the slightest fear that the verdict might lead to unrest and advised further postponement, the court would be likely to go along with it.        
	Giving the Centres views, attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati today said: The preferred resolution to any dispute is a settlement, but the uncertainty which is there cannot continue. There cannot be a state of suspended animation for ever. The matter has to be decided one way or the other.        
	Defeated petitioner Ramesh Chandra Tripathis counsel, Mukul Rohatgi, said the Centres stand did not make any sense. They are saying, We want an amicable resolution but will not do anything (about it). It is neither rational nor logical. The Centre took no stand, he said.        
	Congress leaders had earlier said in private that they hoped the high court verdict would be delayed for a long time, which had raised the possibility that the government might advocate a postponement in the apex court.        
	Some sources today said that after the key parties to the case made it clear yesterday they wanted the verdict now, the Congress and the Centre sensed that Tripathis plea was going to be rejected and decided to make the best of the situation.        
	Besides, they suggested, the Congress wanted to dispel any misgivings among some Muslim organisations that it was trying to delay the verdict, and also ward off Sangh parivar allegations that it was behind Tripathis petition.        
	Although the Congress has welcomed the apex court judgment, many in the party and government were worried about the possible fallout.        
	Talking to reporters, Manmohan Singh referred to the appeal the cabinet had issued over a week ago, which had asked people not to provoke others or express any emotion that could hurt others feelings. The cabinet had stressed that further legal remedies were available.        
	The Union home ministry has identified 32 sensitive locations  four of them in Uttar Pradesh  with a potential for evoking sharp reactions after the verdict.        
	The Centre has kept forces ready at 16 strategic locations close to airports so that they can be swiftly flown anywhere at a moments notice. It has asked all the states, particularly Uttar Pradesh, to remain alert.        
	Not all the 24 parties to the title suit were present in the court today, but those who were opposed to any further deferment, except for Tripathi himself and the Nirmohi Akhara.        
	The Sunni Central Wakf Board, the Hindu Mahasabha and six others urged the court to let the issue be decided once and for all. The Mahasabha said any talk of the consequences of a judgment was dangerous, and that one needed to trust the innate maturity of the Indian people.        
	Tripathis counsel Rohatgi and Sunil Kumar Jain expressed unhappiness at the courts failure to cite reasons for its order.        
	 What the reasons are have not been indicated in the order, nor will they be known in the future, Rohatgi said.

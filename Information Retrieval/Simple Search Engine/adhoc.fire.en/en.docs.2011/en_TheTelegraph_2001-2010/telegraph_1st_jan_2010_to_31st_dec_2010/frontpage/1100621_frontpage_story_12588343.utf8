The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bihar allies on brink
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Bihar allies on brink
                            
	New Delhi, June 20: The crisis in Bihars ruling alliance appeared to be rushing towards the brink as Nitish Kumars deputy Sushil Modi boycotted a public meeting of the chief minister and a similar event was called off.         
	After Nitish returned a Rs 5-crore cheque sent by his Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi, the BJP directed Sushil Modi to stay away from the chief ministers meeting.         
	There may yet be a possibility of preventing a bitter rupture, but that will have to be on Nitishs terms: the BJP should make Bihar out of bounds for Narendra Modi and behave like an obedient junior partner of his Dal (U).

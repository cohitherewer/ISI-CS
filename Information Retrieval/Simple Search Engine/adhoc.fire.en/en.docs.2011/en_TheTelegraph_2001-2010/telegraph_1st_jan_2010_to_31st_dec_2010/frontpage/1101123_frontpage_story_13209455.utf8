	Ranchi, Nov. 22: The clamour for justice for Dhirendra Singhs family dominated proceedings of todays foundation day celebrations of the state Assembly with JVM MLAs trying to put the government on the mat for failing to book guilty policemen for his in-custody death that has pushed the Dhanbad police in a tight corner.        
	As soon as the welcome song and dance drama by schoolchildren were over and the dignitaries were about to settle down on the dais, JVMs Sindri MLA Phulchand Mandal raised the issue by rushing to the dais and asking the government what action had been taken against police officials allegedly involved in the Dhanbad case. Speaker C.P. Singh tried to explain that since todays wasnt an Assembly session for MLAs to ask questions, he would give him an opportunity to speak out later.        
	But, Mandal did not budge from the podium. If the government is reluctant to take action on the case lodged by the deceaseds father on November 17, hereafter, no action should be taken on any case lodged at various police stations of the state, he said, disrupting the function being held inside a special enclosure on the Assembly premises.        
	Among those present on the dais while Mandal launched his diatribe were Governor MOH Farook  he was chief guest  chief minister Arjun Munda, most of his cabinet colleagues and senior bureaucrats.         
	Citing documentary evidence, Mandal alleged the 30-year-olds murder was masterminded by Dhanbad SP and some of her subordinates against whom a case had been lodged by Dhirendras father.        
	Later, when Munda stood up to speak, senior JVM leader Samresh Singh demanded a statement on the controversy, threatening to sit on an indefinite dharna if the state government continued to remain indifferent. Munda promptly accepted his memorandum and persuaded him to sit down. We have spoken to each other on the issue. I am looking into the case, he reminded the JVM leader.        
	I have sought a report from the home department. The case is being investigated. No one is above the law. If the high-handedness of police officials is proved, they will be taken to task, Munda later told newspersons.

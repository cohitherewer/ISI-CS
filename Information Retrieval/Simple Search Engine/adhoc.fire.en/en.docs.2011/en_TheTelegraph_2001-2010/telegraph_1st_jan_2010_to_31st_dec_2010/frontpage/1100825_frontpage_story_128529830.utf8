	Tamluk (WB), Aug 25 (PTI): The truck driver arrested for allegedly making an attempt on the life of Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee was today granted bail by a court here in East Midnapore district.
    Chief Judicial Magistrate Gopal Kumar Dalmia granted the bail to the driver, Gurjant Singh, a native of Sangrur in Punjab, on two sureties of Rs 2,500 each, after it was reported to it that the brakes of the ten-wheeled multi-axle truck had failed.
    Gurjant's truck had hit the escort car of Banerjee, which in turn hit her car at Kolaghat when she was returning here after addressing a rally at Maoist-dominated Lalgarh on August nine.
    Banerjee was flung against the dashboard and suffered injuries in the chest after the escort vehicle impacted her car.

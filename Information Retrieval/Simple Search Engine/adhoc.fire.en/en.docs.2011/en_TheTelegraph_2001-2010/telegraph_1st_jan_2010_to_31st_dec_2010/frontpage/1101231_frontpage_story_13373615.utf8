          OUR BUREAU                              
	Silchar/Guwahati, Dec. 30: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today condemned Tuesday mornings assault on a Mizo girl and reiterated his governments commitment towards empowerment of women.        
	Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an official function, Gogoi said anyone who commits acts that lower or insult the dignity of women would not be tolerated, and added, I have heard about the incident and will look into it. Such incidents must not be repeated in future.        
	On Tuesday morning, three women, including a BJP functionary who has since been suspended, assaulted the Mizo girl who had lost her way and knocked on the BJP leaders door to ask for directions. The attackers were arrested yesterday and released on bail later in the day.         
	The continuing harassment of Mizo girls in different parts of the country, including Silchar and Guwahati, has also spawned resentment among the people of Mizoram.        
	Several persons contacted in Mizoram for their reaction to excesses committed against Mizo women said the gap in mindsets between the Mizos and the people of the other states usually culminate in such incidents.         
	Irene Lalruatkimi, a senior editor at All India Radios Aizawl station, said, As Mizo girls are quite free in their movements and relationships with other people, they very often get exploited and arefleeced.         
	Robert Lalchuuana, a senior journalist, stressed on the need to remove the impression in the other parts of the country that Mizos are aliens.         
	Others were of the view that the state government should make a concerted move to make Mizo women aware of the various pitfalls that await them in other parts of the country.        
	The assault also invited sharp reaction from people of Mizoram based in Guwahati.        
	Jormgini, a Mizo youth, condemned the incident and demanded strong action against those involved. We saw it on TV and the incident was unfortunate. We want the guilty punished, he said.         
	Jilamnapieni, a Mizo girl, said, The incident was shocking. We condemn it whenever a girl from the Northeast is harassed in Delhi; but it is shocking to see a girl from Mizoram being beaten up by people from the region itself, she said.         
	The incident was also condemned by women activists from the Assam, one of whom even apologised to the people of Mizoram for the action of a few misguided elements.

	At a one-and-a-half-hour-long meeting that began at 9am on Wednesday, the state cabinet also took a host of other decisions, apart from announcing the diesel price hike on a proposal mooted by the commercial taxes department aimed at bringing parity of the VAT rate with other states.        
	Special secretary in the cabinet co-ordination department D.K. Saxena said the VAT hke on diesel would fetch the state an additional annual revenue of Rs 150 crore.        
	The new diesel prices will be effective after its notified in a day or two.

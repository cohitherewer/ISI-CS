	Kabul, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Afghan President Hamid Karzai chose a female, Hindu candidate when he voted in todays parliamentary election, two palace officials close to him said.        
	Just two Hindu candidates were on the list of about 600 vying for parliamentary seats in the Afghan capital. Karzais choice could annoy supporters in deeply conservative, Muslim Afghanistan.        
	A string of attacks hit election stations today, killing at least 10 people as the Taliban tried to disrupt a poll that is testing the credibility of the government and security forces.        
	In the worst attack, police said the Taliban killed one Afghan soldier and six pro-government militiamen in a raid on a security outpost next to a polling station in northern Baghlan province.        
	Karazais backers include powerful former warlords who were fielding their own candidates and religious conservatives who are opposed to female politicians and unlikely to be happy that Karzai is backing a non-Muslim.        
	It was Anarkali Honaryar, one palace official told Reuters, giving the name of a female activist who largely relied on Muslim supporters during her campaigning.        
	Hindus and Sikhs lived in Afghanistan and dominated trade long before the advent of Islam in the 7th century. Their numbers shrank over the centuries and tens of thousands of those who remained fled Afghanistan after civil war broke out in 1992, leaving just a few thousand behind.        
	Karzais wife joined the millions of Afghans who did not make it to the polls  although not because of the security concerns or frustration about corruption that kept others away.        
	The couples only child is sick and she did not want to leave him alone, Karzai told a female election worker who later recounted the conversation to a Reuters reporter.         
	The trend for the day was set early when a rocket landed near the US embassy and the headquarters of Nato-led forces in Kabul about three hours before polls opened at 0230 GMT.        
	The Taliban said on their website they had conducted more than 100 attacks during the day.        
	Todays election followed a similar pattern to last years flawed presidential poll, which the Taliban also threatened but failed to disrupt significantly despite scores of attacks.

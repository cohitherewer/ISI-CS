                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Gifts in silk await Obamas
  - karnataka couples scarf can fit into matchbox                                                   
	Sept. 12: Dont be surprised if Barack Obamas Indian hosts slip him a matchbox when he comes visiting in November.        
	No, New Delhi doesnt want the US President to defy his doctors who want him to quit smoking.        
	If such a box is presented to Obama, it will contain no matchsticks but a beautiful, 36in-by-36in silk scarf that an acclaimed weaver from Karnataka has made for the American.        
	Its so fine that it weighs just 30gm and can be folded and put inside a matchbox, said its creator, master craftsman Gurum R. Narayanappa, 69.        
	Michelle Obama will not be left out, either. Narayanappa and his wife Kamalamma, 67, have a gift for Michelle that will no doubt give her bragging rights over her supposed rival in the geopolitical style stakes, French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy.        
	The weaver couple are making a silk sari for her at their home just outside Bangalore. At the standard size of 6.5 metres in length and 44 inches in width, the sari will weigh just 70 grams. A normal silk sari of that size weighs 600gm to 1,000gm.        
	Narayanappa and Kamalamma have a dream: to see Michelle draped in their creation. But will they get to meet the Obamas?        
	I may not get a chance to meet him. For me, meeting him is not important. I will be happy if my gifts reach them, said Narayanappa, winner of many state and national awards for his excellence at weaving silk saris.        
	He said the Central Silk Board and the Karnataka silk minister had assured him that his gifts would be passed on to the Obamas.        
	Narayanappa has already finished weaving the scarf, made from high-quality bivoltine silk. It has golden zari with a temple design. It has been woven in 20 days using silk fibre from just two cocoons, he said.        
	Michelles sari too will sport a temple motif and gold zari, and will be prepared from just three or four cocoons.        
	According to Narayanappa, creating an almost weightless sari with hairline threads requires an eye for detail and a commitment to perfection. I am thankful to God that even at this age, we are blessed with good eyesight, he said.        
	Narayanappa thought of the gifts when he read about Obamas scheduled visit in the newspapers. The craftsman had 10 years ago woven a 6.5m-by-44in silk sari  the same size as the one meant for Michelle  that weighed only 35 grams. It fit into a matchbox.

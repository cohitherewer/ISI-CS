	New Delhi, July 30: A faction of Ulfa and another of the NDFB were not ready for talks with the Centre, home minister P. Chidambaram said here in the wake of the blast in Assams Goalpara district that killed five CRPF jawans this morning.         
	 Chidambaram was speaking at the monthly presentation of his ministrys report card today.         
	The ministry of home affairs has appointed former Intelligence Bureau chief P.C. Haldar as interlocutor for the proposed talks with Ulfa. Haldar is conducting negotiations with the pro-talks factions of the DHD, United Peoples Democratic Solidarity (UPDS) and the NDFB, besides the Meghalaya-based Achik National Volunteers Council (ANVC).        
	 Not all rebel groups have come to the table. One faction of the NDFB and another of Ulfa are against talks, Chidambaram told reporters. Terming todays incident asvery sad, Chidambaram said it was still unclear who perpetrated the attack on the CRPF convoy.

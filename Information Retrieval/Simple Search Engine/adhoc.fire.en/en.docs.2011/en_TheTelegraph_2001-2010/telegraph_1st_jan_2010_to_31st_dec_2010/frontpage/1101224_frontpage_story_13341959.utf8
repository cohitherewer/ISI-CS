          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Dec. 23: Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and finance secretary Chitrabon Hazarika were granted bail by Gauhati High Court in a case this evening while commander-in-chief Paresh Barua claimed that his son had been kidnapped from Dhaka.        
	Rajkhowa is now awaiting the bail order by the designated Tada court here in six cases. The court is likely to pronounce its order on the bail plea tomorrow.        
	Barua, in a statement emailed to the media, said his sons abduction was a tactic adopted by the government to put pressure on him to surrender and to divert him from the ideology and objective of the organisation.        
	We have repeatedly been saying that we will co-operate in holding talks if they are held for a peaceful political settlement of the India-Assam conflict without sacrificing the ideology and objective of the outfit, Barua said, adding that they had co-operated in achieving this through the efforts of the Peoples Consultative Group.        
	We are also co-operating in the recent talks initiative led by jailed Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and other leaders of the group, he said.        
	 Barua added that the outfit would be prepared to continue the armed struggle till the India-Assam political conflict was completely resolved.        
	However, by abducting my son, some agencies are trying to put mental pressure on me to surrender and divert me from the ideology and objective of Ulfa, he added. He did not specify when and from where his son was allegedly abducted.         
	Thousands of Assamese youth who are like my sons have already sacrificed their lives for the cause of the outfit and I am ready to sacrifice my son for the freedom of Assam, he said, indicating that there would not be any compromise on the issue of Assams sovereignty.        
	Jailed Ulfa vice-chairman Pradip Gogoi refused to comment on the issue, saying the outfits publicity secretary, Mithinga Daimary, on parole now, would comment.         
	Daimary could not be contacted over phone. Ulfa deputy commander-in-chief Raju Barua, out on bail now, also refused to comment.        
	A few days back, the outfit had claimed that their two top leaders, Antu Chawdang and Pradeep Chetia, had been picked up from Dhaka on December 13 and their whereabouts were not known.        
	Security officials said they had no information about the alleged abduction of Baruas son.         
	The last known residence of Barua in Dhaka was a four-storey apartment at 25/2 Green Road, Dhan Mandi. He used to stay there with his wife Babita Hazarika alias Anowara Begum alias Sophia Begum and his two sons, Arindam alias Akash Khan and Aiyushman alias Tashim Khan, one of them said.

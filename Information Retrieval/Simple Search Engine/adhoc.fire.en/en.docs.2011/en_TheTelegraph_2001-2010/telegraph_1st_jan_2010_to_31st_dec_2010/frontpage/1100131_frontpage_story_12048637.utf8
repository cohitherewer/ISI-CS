The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | For tween boys, masculinity resides in a spray can

          JAN HOFFMAN                            NEED TO PREEN                                  
	New York, Jan. 30: One bathroom in Stefanie Mullens home in a suburb of San Diego is stocked with enough products to line an aisle in a drugstore.         
	Body wash. Face wash. Exfoliator. Exfoliating wash. Body hydrator. Body spray. Deodorant. Shaving cream. Shampoos and conditioner. Hair gel, of course. All told, 18 different containers.         
	They belong to her sons Noah Assaraf, 13, and Keenan Assaraf, 14. They have been dousing themselves for years. Every day they walk out the door in a cloud of spray-on macho, Mullen said.         
	When boys pile into her car, thats her cue to roll down her window, no matter the weather. The smell drives me nuts.         
	In some respects, theres nothing new about the allure that grooming products and colognes hold for young men, promising to heighten their sex appeal and overall confidence, giving them cover to preen.         
	But in recent years, the products, ostensibly marketed to older teenagers, have reached into the turbulent, vulnerable world of their little brothers, ages 10 to 14.         
	In Calcutta, Naveen Misra, customer care associate and area head, Shoppers Stop, said: Prices of such products are usually not pocket friendly for a 10-year-old. Parents also exercise moderation. A 10-year-old or an 11-year-old boy is not given the option to go and buy. They see their dads getting ready for work and they have the aspiration though. Buying starts from standard IX I think. Deodorants sell most because they usually come for Rs 140 onwards and is within the budget.        
	Mike Dwyer, brand development director for Axe, the bane of parental olfactory nerves, said: Were clear that the Axe target is 18-to-24-year-old guys, but we recognise that we have older and younger users. Hard sales figures for tweens are difficult to come by. Marketers dont have a consensus for what makes up the tween age bracket. Purchases are often made by mothers, simply relieved that their sons are thinking about body odour. And nothing would make older teenager run from a product faster than for its manufacturers to acknowledge that its a must-have among the sixth-grade set.         
	But many psychologists, parents, market researchers and middle-school principals (with drawers full of confiscated spray cans), report a sharp surge in the last few years of the use of grooming products by tween boys.         
	In a December 2007 report on teenage and tween grooming products, Packaged Facts, a market research firm, projected that worldwide retail sales for boys ages 8 to 19 would be almost $1.9 billion.         
	Perhaps more telling: Axe and its ilk have even become essential props in the latest tween novels, like Rosalind Wisemans Boys, Girls and Other Hazardous Materials.         
	The surge is certainly due in large measure to new marketing strategies. While the publics attention will be on testosterone-infused commercials during the Super Bowl next Sunday, these brands have long been attracting boys elsewhere. It has been coming through muscular, below-the-radar tie-ins  on social networking and Web gaming sites and through endorsements by hip-hop stars, pro athletes and extreme-sports daredevils.         
	Boys themselves, at a younger age, have also become increasingly self-conscious about their appearance and identity. They are trying to tame their twitching, maturing bodies, select from a growing smorgasbord of identities  goth, slacker, jock, emo  and position themselves with their texting, titillating, brand-savvy female peers, who are hitting puberty ever earlier.

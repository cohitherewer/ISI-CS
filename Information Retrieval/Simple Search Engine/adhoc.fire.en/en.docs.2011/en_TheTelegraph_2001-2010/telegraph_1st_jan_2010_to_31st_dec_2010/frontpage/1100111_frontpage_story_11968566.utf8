          OUR BUREAU                             The Dalai Lama at a Ladies Study Group programme in Salt Lake, where he prayed for Jyoti Basu. I had met Jyoti Basu in Calcutta as well as in Delhi on various occasions. He is a communist. But regardless of whether he believes in God or not, we should pray for him, the Dalai Lama said.

	Calcutta, Jan. 10: Jyoti Basus general health remained critical today but doctors said the lung infection that had resulted in pneumonia was under control.         
	A hospital source told The Telegraph that the latest culture report on the lung secretion, collected through endoscopy of his throat, showed almost no bacterial infection.        
	The morning medical bulletin said Basu, who has been on sedatives since he was put on ventilator on January 6, was trying to respond to commands.         
	He was making an effort to open his eyes and it was a good sign in the backdrop of the deterioration of his condition yesterday, said A.K. Maity, one of the doctors treating Basu.         
	The doctor, however, added that Basus condition could deteriorate any time.         
	We cannot comment on his recovery as this is the most crucial phase of the treatment. The malfunctioning of several organs needs to be controlled and we have to ensure that more organs are not affected, said a doctor treating the 95-year-old former chief minister.         
	The condition of Basu, admitted to the Salt Lake hospital on January 1 because of pneumonia, had deteriorated on Saturday as infections spread to his kidneys, the central nervous and cardiovascular systems and his liver.         
	His body immunity level is very low because of his age and this remains a worrying factor for us, a doctor said.        
	Three bacterial strains  acinetobacter, pseudomonas and klebsiella  were detected in Basus lungs in the past three days. The doctors had administered antibiotics to weed out the bacterial infections from his system.         
	As of now, there are minimal signs of bacterial infection. But we are continuing with the antibiotic course and other supportive medicines, a doctor said.        
	Apart from pneumonia, Basu is also suffering from systematic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which doctors believe is the reason behind the signs of multiple-organ dysfunction and fluctuating blood pressure.         
	Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri, an expert in microbiology, said the body itself tries to fight the infections  in Basus case the bacterial infections in the lungs  through blood cells and chemicals released from the cells.         
	This response of the body causes damage to tissues in the affected and other organs. Finally, the infection is weeded out from the affected organ in normal people and immunity in the system protects the other organs, said Chaudhuri.         
	Doctors were considering administering steroid but the cortisol (main steroid in the body) test in the morning revealed the amount of natural steroid in body was higher than normal. Another test will be conducted tomorrow, a doctor said.         
	The doctors said that with supportive treatment, the functioning of kidneys and the central nervous system had improved today. There has been urine output today, the creatinine level is normal and there is no need for haemodialysis now. The cerebral oedema, caused by deposition of fluid in the brain, has been reduced with drugs and that improved his senses, a doctor said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | VVIP? Yes; IAF? No
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                VVIP? Yes; IAF? No
          SUJAN DUTTA                      An Agusta Westland 101                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Defence minister A.K. Antony today said the finance ministry had rejected an Indian Air Force proposal to buy mid-air refuellers for its fighter aircraft but had approved the move to buy sophisticated helicopters for VVIPs.        
	All purchase proposals go to the finance ministry, and the finance minister is also a member of the cabinet committee on security (CCS), he said.        
	Unless the finance ministry supports a proposal (for a defence acquisition), the CCS cannot take it up. In that (the mid-air refueller) case, the finance ministry categorically told us that they will not support the proposal in the CCS.        
	For the helicopters, which were evaluated not only by the Indian Air Force but also by the Special Protection Group because of the threat perception, the finance ministry agreed to take it up with CCS. And the CCS took a considered view that in this case we have to proceed, Antony explained.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee was the defence minister before Antony.        
	Air Chief Marshal Pradeep Vasant Naik and his predecessor, Air Chief Marshal (retired) Fali Major, had said that IAF had chosen the Airbus 330 MRTT refueller over the Ilyushin 78 and had proposed buying six of the aircraft.        
	The IAFs refueller squadron now comprises only IL 78. The IAF projected the MRTT as an operational requirement to extend the flying hours and multiply the number of missions of its fighter aircraft. But the finance ministry rejected the proposal on the ground that it was too expensive.        
	The rejection of the IAFs proposal irked European defence companies and the German ambassador to India also voiced his surprise publicly.        
	The government is set to re-tender for refuellers but it has delayed the IAFs tanker modernisation programme by at least another two years.        
	For the VVIP helicopters, the government has chosen the Agusta Westland 101 also a European product because the company is owned by the Italian-origin Finmeccanica  over the Sikorsky.         
	The IAF has projected a requirement for 12 VVIP helicopters for its headquarters communication squadron.        
	The VVIP helicopter deal is likely to be among contracts worth Rs 50,000 crore that the defence ministry is set to sign by the end of the current fiscal year.

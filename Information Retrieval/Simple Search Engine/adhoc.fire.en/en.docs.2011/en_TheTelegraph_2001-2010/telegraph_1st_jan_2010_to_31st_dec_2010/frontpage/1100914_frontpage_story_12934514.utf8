The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rahul in air, Mamata sees cuckoo
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rahul in air, Mamata sees cuckoo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 13: Mamata Banerjee has posed an ornithological riddle for Rahul Gandhi as he prepares to wing his way across Bengal the next three days: just who did she have in mind when she spoke of a seasonal cuckoo today?        
	I am not like the proverbial koel (cuckoo) that arrives in spring and disappears once the season is over. There is consistency in my work as railway minister in north Bengal and my visit to five districts here, Mamata told a meeting after flagging off a string of railway projects at the New Jalpaiguri station.        
	Mamata did not mention Rahul, and her parallels with the ways of nature could be attributed to her innocuous poetic inclinations but for a political factor.        
	Rahul has been visiting Bengal frequently, providing a booster shot to the Congress by stressing on self-respect. He has included several areas of north Bengal, a Congress stronghold where Mamata has been trying to gain a foothold, in his itinerary for Wednesday. Rahul, scheduled to reach Calcutta on Tuesday, is expected to take a chopper from the city to some of the districts.        
	State Congress president Manas Bhuniya said he had high regard for our alliance partner, but if the dig was aimed at Rahul, one should not belittle him hours before his visit to the state.         
	Although it is not clear if she had Rahul in mind while making it clear she is not a seasonal bird, efforts to rejuvenate the Congresss organisation in Bengal have underlined the increasing rivalry between the two alliance partners before next years Assembly elections.        
	Yesterday, at a rally in West Midnapores Sabang, the Assembly seat of Bhuniya, Trinamul leaders one after the other tore into the ally for intending to keep its self-respect intact while going for a seat-sharing deal with Trinamul.        
	The Congress is saying that it wont sacrifice its self-respect while striking an electoral deal with us. What self-respect are they talking about? Beggars cannot be choosers, Somen Mitra, who switched over to Trinamul from the Congress, had said.        
	Last week in Calcutta, Rahul had told Congress leaders not to sacrifice their self-respect for the sake of the alliance.        
	Hours after yesterdays rally, Trinamul all-India president Madan Mitra boasted that a string of programmes that the party has lined up in the coming days would run parallel to those of the Congress under Rahuls stewardship.         
	He cited a demonstration scheduled by Trinamul in Jhargram on Wednesday. The programme coincides with a Congress convention, expected to be attended by Rahul, in the same West Midnapore district.        
	 We shall not yield an inch to the Congress, no matter whether it takes Rahul Gandhis help to inject fresh blood into the beleaguered organisation. The Congress will have to be content with whatever little we offer them because ours is a bigger force in Bengal, said a Trinamul general secretary.

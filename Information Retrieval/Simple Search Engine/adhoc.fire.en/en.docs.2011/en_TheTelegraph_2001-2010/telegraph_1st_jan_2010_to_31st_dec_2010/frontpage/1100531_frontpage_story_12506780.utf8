	Bangalore, May 31 (PTI): A day after a bullet was fired in the ashram of spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravishankar, police today termed it as an quot;incident quot; and said it was not a quot;targeted attack quot; on him.  
	The security of 54-year-old Ravishankar, the founder of Art of Living (AOL), has been beefed up, they said. quot;I do not call it an attack. It is an incident.  
	Whether it was meant at a person or not, we cannot say at the moment quot;, Karnataka DGP Ajaikumar Singh, who visited the ashram, told reporters here.  
	Ravishankar had escaped unhurt yesterday when an unidentified gunman fired at his convoy at his ashram here.Giving details about the firing, Singh said the bullet was fired from about 700 to 750 feet away and so far no body has claimed to have seen the attacker.

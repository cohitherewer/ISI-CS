  - 2012 date for two delayed projects    - Handique flags off Rajdhani special      A STAFF REPORTER                                                 
	Guwahati, March 24: DoNER minister B.K. Handique today said both the Bogibeel rail-cum-road bridge and the Lumding-Badarpur gauge conversion project will be commissioned by 2012.         
	Handiques revelation assumes importance, as this is the first time that such a categorical assurance has come from the Centre over the two projects, one of which, the gauge conversion, had been severely affected by insurgency in the North Cachar Hills district.        
	Flagging off the 2235/2236 New Delhi-Guwahati Rajdhani Express here today, Handique said there were problems earlier on the projects but work is now progressing well and both the projects should be commissioned by 2012.         
	Both the projects have already overshot their original deadlines by two to three years. The Bogibeel rail-cum-road bridge was slated to be commissioned by 2008 and the Lumding-Badarpur gauge conversion project by 2009.         
	The Bogibeel project, which will connect the north and south banks of the Brahmaputra in its upper reaches in the state thus improving communication, was delayed mainly on account of funds not being allocated on time besides non-availability of boulders in the early days. Adverse weather conditions like flood, which is a regular feature in the area, also affected the pace of work.        
	The gauge conversion was affected mainly by militancy with the DHD (J) targeting tracks and trains in NC Hills. Extortion and threats forced firms executing the project to suspend work from time to time. The work has started picking up now.         
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee had said in her budget speech that the Lumding-Badarpur gauge conversion project had been given special priority for expeditious completion. Handique said the railway ministry was working hard to extend connectivity to all the states of the region. There are 11 national projects in the Northeast and the Centre is anxious to complete them on time.         
	The day is not far off when there will be train connectivity between Guwahati and South East Asian countries, he added. He, however, did not provide details as to how it will be done and when.         
	NF Railway general manager Shiv Kumar said 216km of railway lines would be added in Assam this year, which is the biggest post-Independence addition. Of these, 156km have already been added and the rest would be completed soon.         
	This is a big landmark for Assam as no state in the country has been able to make such a huge addition in a single year, he added.         
	Kumar said a consultant would soon be appointed for making Guwahati a world class railway station with an escalator and other facilities. He said the assurances given in the railway budget would help in the development of railways in the region.         
	The new train that was flagged off today will leave Guwahati every Friday and depart from Delhi every Wednesday. It will follow the Guwahati-New Jalpaiguri-Katihar-Muzaffarpur-Varanasi-Lucknow-Moradabad-Delhi route.        
	Guwahati MLA Robin Bordoloi urged the NF Railway to make use of the railway land available in the city.

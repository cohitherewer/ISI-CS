          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          BJP leader L.K. Advani, Opposition leader Sushma Swaraj and other party MPs stage a demonstration in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)    
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: Delhi police have finally zeroed in on the two accused who were involved in raping a 30-year-old BPO employee from Mizoram.         
	Shamshad, 28, and Usman, 30, the two accused, were arrested from Mewat district of Haryana early on Thursday while another gang member surrendered at a local court. Police said the two who were arrested on the basis of sketches were serial rapists.         
	Both Shamshad and Usman were involved in rape cases in the past and also had several criminal records. It was a blind case as we did not have enough clues. It is one of the major cases where we had employed 300 policemen comprising some senior officers, Delhi police commissioner B.K. Gupta said.        
	On November 23 midnight, 30-year-old Rupa, (name changed) from Mizoram, along with a woman colleague, was dropped by the BPO companys vehicle near her rented apartment at Moti Bagh in south Delhi. Four men, who were inside a mini-truck, intercepted them.         
	They kidnapped Rupa at gunpoint while her friend managed to escape.         
	The victim was pushed to the back of the vehicle, raped by the four goons and abandoned at Mangolpuri after almost two hours.         
	Over the past few days, the top brass of Delhi police drew lot of flak from the public for failing to solve the case and came under fire from girls from the Northeast living in the capital who organised a protest rally, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits.         
	Yesterday, leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj had raised slogans inside Parliament and called for the resignation of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit over the deteriorating law and order situation in the capital.         
	Yesterday, the police, who were groping in the dark since the incident, announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for information about the culprits.         
	In May 2005, a 20-year-old Delhi University student was abducted from near the same place. She was pulled inside a car and then gangraped for several hours before being dumped near a gurdwara in Dhaula Kuan. She was also from Mizoram.         
	In the last two years, 40 cases of molestation of women from Northeast were not even registered by Delhi police, alleged members of North East Support Centre amp; Helpline in the capital. In another 20 cases, police have made little headway after taking up the investigation.         
	Almost half the women sexually harassed in the capital are from the Northeast and the recent gangrape of a Mizo woman is only an addition to the list. It tells of a sorry state of affairs of the police force which has failed miserably to protect girls, said Madhu Chandra, spokesperson of North East Support Centre amp; Helpline in the capital.         
	The police commissioner said that they have instructed BPO companies to have a security guard accompany each vehicle while dropping women employees.         
	We will take action if they do not stick to the guidelines, he said. Till November this year, D elhi police have recorded 402 cases of rape.

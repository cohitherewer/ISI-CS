          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 22: A state department has raised the red flag on finalising a Hyderabad-based company for a Rs 253 crore water supply project as it is now under the scanner of the income tax (IT) and vigilance for having bagged rural electrification contracts allegedly at the behest of former chief minister Madhu Koda.        
	The bid of Hyderabad-based IVRCL Infrastructures amp; Projects Limited for revamping the water supply system for the state capital  a JNNURM project  was cleared by the tender committee on February 13 on account of it being the lowest.        
	But now, drinking water and sanitation department (DWSD) secretary P.K. Jojoria has asked the income tax department and state vigilance for a character certificate of the company that has been at the centre of raids conducted by the agencies.        
	I simply wanted to know how far it is correct to award a tender to a company which is in the watch list of the income tax and vigilance. We are waiting for a response from both the agencies, Jojoria said, confirming his move.         
	Both income tax and vigilance, probing money laundering and disproportionate assets cases against Koda to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore, is also looking at the circumstances under which IVRCL bagged a contract for a rural electrification project.        
	Rural electrification projects, initially worth Rs 343 crore, swelled to Rs 466 crore during the tenure of Koda, who is alleged to have received huge kickbacks in exchange of awarding contracts.        
	It is in this backdrop that income tax officials raided properties of several past and present officials of Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) including the likes of S.N. Choudhary (member) P.K. Sinha (chief engineer), V.N. Pandey and H.B. Lal (both former chairmen).        
	IVRCL is already executing two urban water supply projects for Jhumri Tilaiya and Deoghar at an estimated cost of Rs 26 crore and Rs 47 crore, respectively.                                            
	The DWSD is executing the Ranchi project, which aims to cater to over 12.66 lakh residents spread across 175 sq km within corporatation limits, on behalf of the urban development department that monitors JNNURM projects. But now with IVRCL coming up as the lowest bidder, the authorities are in a fix.         
	Minister Chandra Prakash Chodhury, who looks after the portfolio, said his department was weighing the pros and cons before coming to any conclusion.

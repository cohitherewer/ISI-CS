The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ghost petitioner no scare to Koda probe
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Ghost petitioner no scare to Koda probe
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             Madhu Koda: No reprieve                                  
	Ranchi, Sept. 5: Even if CBI isnt able to trace Madhu Kodas missing petitioner, it will not impact the ongoing investigations into the disproportionate assets cases against the former chief minister and some of his erstwhile cabinet colleagues.        
	Durga Oraon, who filed a PIL seeking a CBI inquiry into Kodas unaccounted-for-wealth in September 2008, has never appeared before the court, citing security concerns.         
	However, it was his petition that set the stage for the state to launch a vigilance bureau probe against the former chief minister and now Singhbhum MP.         
	On August 5, the high court ordered the central agency to take over investigations.        
	Legal experts opined that in a PIL, the cause and not the petitioner was important. Hence, it was immaterial whether or not the CBI managed to trace him. Former judge of Jharkhand High Court Vikramaditya Prasad agreed.         
	The facts remain the same whether he is traced or not. Durga Oraon, the person, has set the law in motion and investigations by various agencies have prima facie revealed that Koda and some of his colleagues have amassed illegal assets, he explained to The Telegraph.        
	Suppose Durga Oraon is dead. Still, the case remains the same, he added, explaining that if the investigating agencies had not found any evidence with regard to the disproportionate assets acquired by Koda and his colleagues, the police might have booked Oraon for filing a false case.        
	But this is not the case, he pointed out.        
	Senior lawyer R.K. Anand also said the CBI would take the FIR lodged in pursuance of the high court directive to its logical conclusion. Durga Oraons absence is immaterial now, he maintained.         
	Another legal expert pointed out that some of those named in the FIR have been pleading their case in various courts, including the Supreme Court, not on merit, but alleging that lawyers used a ghost petitioner to blackmail them.         
	In fact, former minister Kamlesh Singhs lawyer was rebuked while he was pleading for his bail in the apex court on Monday and arguing that the petition was filed to blackmail senior politicians and that Durga Oraon was a fictitious person.        
	The Supreme Court is said to have reacted firmly. The high court has been hearing the case for the last 20 months, it said, but nobody bothered to raise the question of Oraons whereabouts. The charges against the counsel cropped up only when the high court was about to hand over the case to the CBI.         
	Singhs lawyer withdrew the petition after hearing the apex courts views. The Supreme Courts comment vindicates the view that the petitioner wasnt important at this stage, pointed out yet another senior lawyer.        
	However, legal experts agreed that Oraons prolonged absence from court ever since he filed the PIL through his counsel Ritu Kumar did point to a systemic failure.        
	The high court has laid out norms to identify a bona fide petitioner  an affidavit has to be sworn in before the oath commissioner and someone who knows the petitioner is supposed to identify him mentioning his full address.        
	In the case of Oraon, a vague address  citing Morabadi  was in the court records. Had I been there, I would have asked the person who identified him to produce Oraon in court or face prosecution, said Justice (retired) Prasad.        
	If the system fails, judgments in criminal cases could fail every other day. A person produced by the public prosecutor as a witness whose evidence leads the court to sentence somebody, could always appear and claim he did not testify. It will be a disaster for the criminal justice system, he added.

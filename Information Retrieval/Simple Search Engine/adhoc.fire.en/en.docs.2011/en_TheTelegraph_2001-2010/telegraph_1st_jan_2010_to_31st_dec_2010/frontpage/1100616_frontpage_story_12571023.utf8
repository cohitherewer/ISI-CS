          AMIT ROY                                              
	London, June 15: Tagore the painter outdid himself but trailed his successors.        
	Rabindranath Tagores 12 paintings fetched 1.6 million (Rs 10.9 crore) at a Sothebys auction today, surpassing his own record here but falling short of the sums raked in by many modern-day painters.        
	The final auction prices did far exceed the pre-sale estimates. But even the combined might of 12 paintings (Rs 10.9 crore) could not outgun the Rs 14.18 crore S.H. Razas Saurashtra yielded in London at Christies less than a week ago.        
	The top grosser among the Tagore dozen  a portrait of a woman with bare arms  was sold for Rs 2.13 crore, higher than his previous record of Rs 98.2 lakh for Death Scene, which was sold by Sothebys in May 2008.        
	But that was still not enough to pull past the days top earner  again Razas Rajasthan that went for Rs 3.51 crore.         
	The relatively low prices also raise a what-might-have-been moment: the Bengal government could have earned some brownie points by bidding for the paintings and bringing them to Tagores home without having had to give an arm and a leg.        
	Suggestions did the rounds that some state institutions took part in the bidding with the blessings of the Union government, which had been requested by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to ensure that the paintings were brought to Bengal. A central culture ministry official was in London over the past few days.        
	Sothebys wont release the bidders names without checking whether they wish to remain anonymous.         
	The 12 Tagore paintings were offered for sale by Dartington Hall, which expressed delight with the proceeds as did Sothebys.        
	But Indar Pasricha, who owns his own gallery in Connaught Street in the West End, put todays prices into context by pointing out that modern and contemporary artists, such as Raza, were attracting higher prices.        
	I thought some of his paintings today would fetch more than 1 million, he said. The highest in the Tagore category today was sold for far less at 313,250.        
	But Pasricha added: However, this is going to open the floodgates. I thought todays Tagore prices were quite reasonable  I consider Tagore to be the most important Indian artist of the 20th century. The paintings are fantastic.         
	The auctioneer, Lord Dalmeny, who is deputy chairman of Sothebys, said Dartington Hall would hold a Tagore exhibition next year and might wish to borrow the paintings it was selling.        
	The market was very confident and there were a lot of private buyers, said Dalmeny after a busy morning.         
	There were several prospective Indian buyers in the auction room but the men and women who take the telephone bids were also kept busy.        
	Among the buyers was a young Bangladeshi businessman, Rajeeb Samdani, who bought Tagores portrait of a man with a beard, for 91,250, as a gift for my wife, Nadia. Samdani, who had flown over from Dhaka, paid using his wifes account since she is a British Bangladeshi.        
	Samdani, who is in food processing, already has one Tagore. I have a soft spot for Tagore. I am very, very happy. I feel Tagore is Bangladeshi, a symbol of unity between the two Bengals.         
	Another buyer was Avijit Lahiri, a London-based cardiologist who had come with a budget of 85,000. Tagores figure in yellow was his when the hammer came down at 110,000, which means he will have to pay 133,250 when buyers premium is included.        
	Passion, he said, asked to explain his purchase. I will have to work for a few more years as a cardiologist.        
	The bard from Bengal found a bidder from Pakistan  Hameed Haroon, the CEO of the Dawn Media Group. Tagore is the genesis of art in the 20th century, for us in South Asia, Haroon told The Telegraph.        
	The man from Karachi had his sights set on No. 21  Untitled (lady with a fan)  but lost out. The pre-sale estimate was 20-30,000, but it finally sold for 85,000. How much was Haroon willing to go up to? 40,000.        
	Haroon hailed the Tagore auction as a great day for Indian art, with prices being aided by a combination of Indian millionaires and buyers for state institutions.

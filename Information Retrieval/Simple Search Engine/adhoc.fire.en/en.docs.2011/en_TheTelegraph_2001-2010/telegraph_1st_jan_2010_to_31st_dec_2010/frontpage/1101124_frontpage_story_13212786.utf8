	Ranchi, Nov. 23: Director-general (DG) of CRPF K. Vijay Kumar reviewed the ongoing anti-Naxalite operations in Jharkhand at a high-level meeting with the state and police brass today and said the offensive would be intensified.         
	The DG also made an attempt to bond with the jawans fighting the Maoists. Immediately after landing in Ranchi yesterday, Kumar went to Jhumra, Bokaro, and then to Garu in Latehar  two of the remotest areas where CRPF companies are stationed. He even spent the night with the forces in Garu. It conveyed the message to the personnel that the top officers are with them, said CRPF IG (operations) Alok Raj.        
	At todays closed-door meeting, which continued for an hour at the state police headquarters, Kumar stressed on speedy development and strengthening of the police apparatus to check the Maoist menace in the state.         
	Promising every help to the CRPF for carrying out the operation successfully, chief secretary A.K. Singh, who was present at the meeting, said: We should work in tandem.         
	Kumar, a Tamil Nadu cadre IPS officer who had played a crucial role in the elimination of sandalwood smuggler Veerappan as the head of Special Task Force, also lauded the successful joint operation carried out by Gumla and Latehar police, CRPF and Cobra from November 19 to 21.         
	He handed over cash prize of Rs 1 lakh to the personnel who took part in the offensive in which a Maoist was killed and ammunition recovered.         
	Later, speaking to mediapersons, the chief secretary said it was a general review meeting. Absence of BDOs and COs was cited as a factor behind non-execution of development plans. They will, henceforth, be compelled to stay at their headquarters once the panchayat bodies are in place, Singh said.        
	DGP Neyaz Ahmed and IG (operations) R.K. Mallick were also present at the meeting.

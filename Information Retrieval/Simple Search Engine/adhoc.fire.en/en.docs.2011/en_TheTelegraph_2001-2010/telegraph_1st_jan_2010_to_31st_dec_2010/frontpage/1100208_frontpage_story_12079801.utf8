                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Heres firm action: Pawar runs to Sena
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                      Shashank Manohar, Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar and Bal Thackeray in Mumbai on Sunday. (PTI)                          
	Mumbai, Feb. 7: The Centre today thundered that the Maharashtra government would take firm action against the divisive agenda of the Shiv Sena.        
	Within hours came the firm action: Sharad Pawar drove up to Bal Thackerays house, carrying along with him flowers, the cricket board chief, a plea to let Australian players take part in the third edition of the IPL and a little-disguised message for belligerent ally as well as price-rise critic Congress.        
	Pawars aides insisted that he went to the Sena bosss lair as a cricket official, not as one of the most senior cabinet ministers in the government that runs the country.        
	Thackerays Sena had vowed not to allow Australian cricketers to play in Mumbai, where the IPL III inaugural match is scheduled on March 12, because of the attacks on Indians in the foreign country.        
	After posing for photographs that show him accepting a bouquet of flowers from Pawar and BCCI president Shashank Manohar, Thackeray has apparently agreed to consider their request.        
	BCCI sources said the cricket board would make an IPL presentation before Thackeray  much like movie stalwarts who humour him before releasing films with controversial content.         
	Pawar had flown in from Aurangabad and driven into Matoshree, Thackerays house in suburban Bandra, with Manohar around 7pm, an hour before schedule. Thackerays son Uddhav, under pressure to prove that his potential for mischief is as high as that of his cousin Raj, had driven down from Pune to be by his fathers side  and in the photo frame.        
	We presented our viewpoint before Balasaheb. We also explained the format of the IPL teams. He agreed to consider the issue in a couple of days, Manohar said.        
	BCCI sources said the cricket establishment was worried that the Australians might not take part in the IPL if the Sena threat hung over their heads, triggering a chain reaction of foreign pullouts.        
	The meeting between Thackeray and Pawar, who is also the president of the Mumbai Cricket Association, came a few hours after the Union home minister declared in Delhi that he was expecting firm action against the Sena for its threats to north Indians.        
	The chief minister of Maharashtra told the gathering (of chief ministers on internal security) that he intends to deal with the divisive agenda propagated by the Shiv Sena and the MNS (Rajs party), Chidambaram said in Delhi. I am confident that the government of Maharashtra will take firm action, he added.        
	If the meeting between a person who issues threats from his home and a senior cabinet minister leaves the Centre squirming, Pawar is unlikely to complain.        
	Pawar has been miffed with the Congress for suggesting that he was to blame for the price rise, while the Sena and the BJP have been sparring over the Mumbai-for-all controversy.        
	An NCP leader said: Pawar Saheb and Balasaheb are very old friends. They have always been there for each other  thats the message.        
	Congress leaders in the state castigated Pawar. They (Pawars party NCP) run a government in this state with us. They hold the home portfolio. Instead of opposing the Senas illegitimate threats, Pawar is prostrating before the Thackerays. It is shameful, said Congress spokesperson and former Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam.        
	Sena claim on SRK        
	On another IPL-related battle  over Shah Rukh Khans expression of dismay at the exclusion of Pakistani cricketers  a Sena leader claimed the actor had sent text messages seeking an audience with the leader. The actors secretary, however, denied the claim.        
	Balasaheb has not decided on meeting Shah Rukh yet, though he has sent four messages through his people, said Sena leader Sanjay Raut.                    WITH DELHI BUREAU INPUTS

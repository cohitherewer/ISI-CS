	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, March 23: Maoists killed two persons, including a policeman, and blew up railway tracks in East Singhbhum and Latehar in the last 24 hours, disrupting railway services in various parts of eastern India as they wound up their two-day bandh against Operation Greenhunt on in several rebel strongholds of Jharkhand.        
	Last night, Maoists targeted the Bhubaneswar-New Delhi Rajdhani Express after blowing up railway tracks near Gaya in Bihar, but hundreds of passengers had a miraculous escape even though 10 coaches had derailed.        
	In Jharkhand, Maoists ransacked a sponge iron company Narsingh Steel in Saraikela-Kharswan district and made an abortive attempt to ambush security personnel who were on their way to the plant. A police constable was killed in an encounter that followed.        
	Train services on Howrah-Mumbai and Bhubaneswar-New Delhi routes were severely disrupted with Maoists blowing up tracks in three areas, namely, Dhalbhumgarh and Bisra  both in the state  and a place between Gidhni and Jhargram in Bengal.         
	At 11.30 last night, rebels triggered a can bomb on the Up line between Dhalbhumgarh and Kokpara. Two hours later around 1.30am, another explosion damaged tracks between the Gidhni and Jhargram railway stations in Bengal.         
	Several trains were halted at various stations because of the blasts. They included Mumbai Mail, Sambleshwari Express, Howrah-Pune Azad Hind Express and Haridwar-Puri Kalinga Utkal Express.        
	Another blast was triggered on tracks between Bisra and Bandamunda close to Rourkela around 1.45am, leading to a goods train being derailed. This meant trains between Chakradharpur and Rourkela were disrupted.         
	While several trains were cancelled or terminated, about half a dozen trains were running late (see chart). Senior railway officials of Chakradharpur division hoped to restore services by tomorrow.        
	In Latehar district, over 150 Maoists carried out two explosions in the Barkakhana-Barwadi railway section. The first was around 10 last night, near pole 175/2 between Mahuamilan and Nindra Halt in Chandwa, around 85km from the state capital.        
	While the side wall of a small railway bridge was damaged, tracks remained unaffected. Only three trains had to be cancelled  Shaktipunj Express, Gomoh-Choupan Passenger and Gomoh-Barwadih Passenger.        
	Another explosion occurred near pole 17/19 between Hehegara and Chipadohar railway stations  about 50km from the spot of the first blast  around 6am today.         
	Latehar SP Kuldeep Dwivedi confirmed the first explosion but said it had been repaired within an hour. He denied there was a second blast, calling it a rumour spread by miscreants who had spread some stone chips near the tracks to make it seem like an explosion.        
	DGP Neyaz Ahmed told The Telegraph that elaborate security arrangements had been made to foil any attempt by Maoists to damage life and property. Baring a report of an explosion in Latehar, there is no information of any other untoward incident during todays bandh, he said.        
	Maoists had called a 48-hour bandh from Monday in Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa, Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and three districts of Maharashtra to protest against the offensive that is on against them in Jharkhand and its neighbouring states, including Bengal.

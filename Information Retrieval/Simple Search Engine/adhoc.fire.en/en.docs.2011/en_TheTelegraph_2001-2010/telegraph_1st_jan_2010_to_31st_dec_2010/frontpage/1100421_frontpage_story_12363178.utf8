  - Bird deaths worry conservationists          PULLOCK DUTTA                                     
	Guwahati, April 20: Villagers in Majuli have jumped in to rescue stork nests destroyed by torrential rain and storms, probably stung by the well-acquainted pain of losing ones home to natures fury.        
	It was a battle against odds that villagers of Majuli have known for years.        
	Every monsoon, they watch their houses toppling into the river that is swallowing the island bit by bit.        
	When rain accompanied by strong winds lashed the island last Sunday, threatening two colonies of storks, the villagers rushed to their rescue.        
	They built artificial nests and safely placed the chicks in them.         
	We are trying our best to save these birds and the people of the island are helping us in our effort, forest beat officer of Majuli, Atul Das, said today.         
	Adjutant storks, both greater and lesser and open bill storks, are listed as endangered under the Wildlife Protection Act.         
	Kushal Mookherjee of Calcuttas Prakriti Sansad, an NGO which deals exclusively with the conservation of birds, and is part of the Indian Bird Conservation Network, said they were very concerned with the destruction at Majuli.         
	The worlds only greater adjutant stork population is in Assam and we cannot lose it. Lets see what we can do from here, Mookherjee said.         
	Both greater and lesser adjutant storks and openbill storks have a large population in Majuli in two separate colonies  one in the heart of Garmurh town and the other at Namkatoni village in Kamalabari. The total estimated population is about a thousand. These birds have been nesting in tall trees in these two areas for several years now.         
	When rain lashed the island on Sunday, nests were damaged and a large number of chicks fell off.        
	While a few died, several were rescued by the forest personnel with help from villagers.         
	We installed a few artificial nests on these trees and the chicks which had fallen off are kept in these. The parent birds will identify the chicks on their own, Das said. The islanders have always had an attachment for birds.         
	A villager even abandoned his house and left it for the storks in Namkatoni village.        
	The birds had built nests on a tall tree in the compound and dirtied the area.        
	He had two options  either chop off the tree or move out. He opted for the latter.         
	Tilak Sharma, former secretary of the Majuli chapter of the Assam Science Society, said people of the island have always loved the birds, especially the migratory variety, which flock to the island in winter.        
	Sharma, who is attached to Bombay Natural History Society, said a movement was started in Majuli about two decades ago to protect birds.         
	We have begun an awareness campaign across the island and today we can claim that we have succeeded, he said.

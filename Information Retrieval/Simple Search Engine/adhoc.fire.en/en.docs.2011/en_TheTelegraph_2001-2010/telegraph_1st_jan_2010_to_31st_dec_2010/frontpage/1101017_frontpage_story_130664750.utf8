                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Water supply to be hit due to closure of Ganga canal
 															      
	Muzaffarnagar, Oct 18 (PTI): Water supply to parts of Delhi, Noida and Agra is likely to be affected following the closure of the Ganga canal for maintenance works, officials said here.
    Water supply to 19 districts of Uttar Pradesh, including Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshar, Aligarh, Etah, Hathras, Firozabad, Mathura, Fatehpur and Kanpur, will also be disrupted due to which the farmers will face shortage of water for irrigation, they said.
    Alternative source of water like tubewells and pump sets can be used by farmers in these areas to meet their irrigation needs during the period, they said.
    The canal, which was closed last night, will reopen on November 1.

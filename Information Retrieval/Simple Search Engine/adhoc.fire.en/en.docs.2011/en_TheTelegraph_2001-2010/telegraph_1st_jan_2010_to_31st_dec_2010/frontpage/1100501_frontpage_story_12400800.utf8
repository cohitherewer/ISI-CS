	April 30: An unexploded World War II bomb has been discovered outside actor George Clooneys Lake Como villa in Italy.        
	The 500lb explosive was discovered 15 yards underwater in Lake Como just in front of the actors 30million euro 30-bed mansion, Villa Oleandra.        
	Bomb squad experts raced to the scene on the shores of the Italian lake in the Lombardy region in the alpine north of the country.        
	The entire town of Laglio surrounding the villa was sealed off while specialist teams of officers disabled the device yesterday (WEDS).        
	As well as the bomb  thought to be an ordinance dropped from a WWII bomber  Italian police said they also found mines and other raw explosives. Clooney, who starred in such films as the Oceans Eleven series and his Oscar-winning role in Syriana, is not staying at the villa at the moment.

          SARAT SARMA                               
	Nagaon, Nov. 23: A Royal Bengal tiger was shot dead today after it killed two persons and critically injured a police officer in Assams Morigaon district.        
	A forest department worker, who had been camping in the area since Monday to capture the animal, however, blamed security guards and an unruly crowd for the death of the feline, spotted yesterday at Habi Barangabari, nearly 100km from Guwahati.        
	This morning, the tiger, which had been preying on cattle in the area over the past week, fatally attacked a 45-year-old, Rusia Khatun, who was working near a paddy field.        
	A police team, led by additional sub-inspector of Borsola outpost Tilak Bora, arrived soon. As the team entered the field with armed villagers, the tiger jumped at Bora, critically injuring him.        
	By this time, a team of forest officials had arrived and launched a search to tranquillise the animal. As the search team cleared the paddy crop, the tiger escaped to an abandoned house, said Bhaskar Choudhury, a vet who was part of the team.        
	The villagers, armed with lathis and sharp weapons, surrounded the house and started throwing stones, forcing the tiger to come out of hiding. A forest official said the tiger attacked a local resident as it tried to flee. Chand Mian succumbed to his wounds later. The policemen then opened fire, killing the animal.         
	The Assam government has ordered an inquiry.        
	Nobody ordered the killing of the tiger, the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Suresh Chand, told The Telegraph. It was spontaneous firing by a policeman.        
	Firoz Ahmed, a conservation biologist, said there should be a protocol for rescuing tigers. You cannot kill tigers just like that.

  - Bokaro man was carrying Maoist literature        PRADUMAN CHOUBEY                                    
	Dhanbad, Nov. 17: A 30-year-old man detained last evening for carrying Maoist literature died early this morning after being hospitalised twice in the course of the night for stomach ache, prompting local residents and Opposition leaders to point a finger at Dhanbad police for the in-custody death.         
	Dhirendra Singh, a resident of Birni Nawadih in Bokaro, was picked up by the sadar police around 6pm yesterday from Court More and taken to Barwaddah police station at 7.30pm for questioning.        
	In damage control mode, officer in charge of Barwaddah police station Sahdev Prasad claimed Dhirendra was inebriated when he was picked up.         
	Hinting that his death could be a result of that condition or some previous ailment, the OC denied any torture in custody.        
	Prasad said Dhirendra complained of abdominal pain at 10.30pm following which he was admitted to Asharfi Hospital around 11.15pm. He was brought back to the police station after some time, but he complained of uneasiness again and was admitted to Pragati Nursing Home at 1am.         
	His condition deteriorated around 4.30am and we decided to rush him to Bokaro General Hospital, said Prasad. But the police had to take him to Patliputra Medical College and Hospital instead as he started vomiting in the vehicle. He was declared brought dead at the hospital.        
	According to police sources, the sadar police picked up Dhirendra from Court More where he had apparently gone to file an affidavit. The police claimed they found him with a stolen motorcycle and some Naxalite literature. He told the police that he had picked up the posters from Mahuda, and Prasad said he was going to be taken there to verify his claim.        
	Today, a rattled district administration ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. Deputy commissioner Sunil Kumar Burnwal said a committee had been constituted to look into the matter, and the post-mortem would be filmed to ensure complete transparency.        
	Principal of Patliputra Medical College and Hospital Arun Kumar Chaudhary said a five-member medical board led by the head of the forensic science department, Dr A. Saraj, had been constituted to conduct the post-mortem.        
	The issue, however, acquired a political colour with Opposition MLAs crying foul. Senior JVM leader and Sindri MLA Phulchand Mandal said an independent probe should be instituted into the case. He asked why a man who was detained by the Dhanbad sadar police was transferred to Barwaddah police station.         
	Later, Mandal, along with party colleague Samresh Singh and Nirsa MLA Arup Chatterjee, sat on a dharna outside Patliputra Medical College and Hospital where the post-mortem was being conducted.         
	Demanding justice for the deceaseds family members, they said they would only withdraw once they received the autopsy report.        
	When contacted, superintendent of police, Dhanbad, Suman Gupta said she would not comment on the incident until the autopsy report was available.        
	Notably, this is the third custody death in the district in the past one year.

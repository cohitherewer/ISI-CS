	Bokaro, Jan. 1: Chief minister Shibu Soren has promised that the long overdue notification for granting second language status to Bengali and Santhali will be issued within the next week, raising the hopes of many on New Years Day.         
	Insisting that necessary orders had already been issued, Soren admitted that this should have happened earlier since more than 65 per cent of the states population spoke the two languages. But, better late than never, said the chief minister who spent the first day of the year at his Bokaro residence with an early morning puja followed by several meetings.        
	In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, Soren spoke on a host of issues that he planned to tackle on a war footing  from inviting Maoists for talks and creating jobs for the youth to Chiria mines and the development of rural areas.        
	He said he would soon be sending invites to top Maoist leaders, asking them to sit for talks. We will solve the problem keeping in mind a fixed time-frame. I am confident that Maoists will grab this offer before its too late, Soren said.        
	On Jharkhand lagging behind others on the industrial front, the chief minister said he would first prepare a list of industries that had shut down to help them reopen. This will help generate employment. I will also try to see that more plants come up in the state, but for that the displaced will have to get their due, he added.         
	Soren said his government would prioritise higher and technical education for which several cities, including Bokaro, would be selected. I will meet MD of Bokaro Steel Plant not only to discuss the problems of the displaced, but also to talk on making Bokaro a technology education hub.        
	On the issue of Chiria mines, Soren said he was in favour of it being handed over totally to Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL).        
	The first step in this direction would be to take away small portion leases that had been handed over to private parties by flouting norms, he said, adding that the cabinet would be meeting soon to ensure that everything was done in a transparent manner from now on.        
	I believe that Chiria mines must be handed over to SAIL as this will help the nations steel industry prosper, Soren reiterated.

	The old boys and girls of St Xaviers College are ready to expand the reach and resources of their alma mater by holding their first international convention at Bangkok this weekend.        
	Beyond Boundaries will see Xaverians from across the country as well as Singapore and Dubai gather in the Thailand capital for two days of serious discussions interspersed with fun. The idea is to bring all the Xaverians together in the institutions 150th year and revive the Xaverian spirit and get their support to pave the way forward for the college, said principal Father Felix Raj.        
	One of the aims behind the event is to raise funds for a 300-seat boys hostel and a 150-seat girls hostel at 219/1 AJC Bose Road, which belongs to the college.         
	The current St Xaviers hostel will shift to the property, leaving 40,000sq ft free on the 30 Park Street campus to house postgraduate departments. We have five postgraduate departments and need five more to apply for university status, said Felix Raj.        
	The Bangkok programme will comprise seminars on the new world economy and power future with green technology, infrastructure, education and IT.         
	There will also be performances by Xaverians Subhen Chatterjee and his group Karma and percussionist Bickram Ghosh as well as the screening of a movie on the alumni, directed by actor and Xaverian Arindam Sil.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, also a Xaverian, will lead a tribute to another Xaverian, Rabindranath Tagore.        
	Nrityargha, choreographed by Sukalyan, will feature actress Swastika Mukherjee. Designer Agnimitra Paul will showcase Indo-ethnic wear with actress Rituparna Sengupta as the showstopper.

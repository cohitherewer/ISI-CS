          SUJAN DUTTA                            Gen. VK Singh (second from left) at the Yodha Shakti exercise in Rajasthan                                  
	New Delhi, May 8: The vice-chief of army staff, Lt Gen. P.C. Bhardwaj, was paradropped near a mock enemy target as the chief, Gen. V.K. Singh, watched and soldiers from one of the most powerful formations of the army concluded an aggressive month-long war game in the Rajasthan desert today.         
	Troops from the Mathura-headquartered 1 (strike) Corps of the army, tasked with penetrating deep into enemy territory in the event of a war in the western theatre, practised night battles with close air support from the Indian Air Force in the exercise named Yodha Shakti (warrior strength), one of the largest summer drills.         
	Yodha Shakti coincided with a Pakistani exercise named Azm-e-Nau (new resolve), involving the army and the air force, that tested Islamabads new military hardware and tactics to thwart multiple thrusts by Indian forces if hostilities broke out.         
	In the Yodha Shakti exercise, elements from the 1 corps were asked to cross barriers and hit at targets in an area simulating enemy territory in peak summer to achieve decisive victory for the nation, an army spokesperson said.         
	The exercise was carried out under the overall supervision of the Jaipur-headquartered south-western army commander, Lt Gen. C.K.S. Sabu.         
	The strike corps  the Indian Army has three such formations (1, 2 and 21)  are integrated forces of infantry, artillery, tank and mechanised units operating with specially designated IAF elements.         
	In the cold start doctrine that the Indian Army has adopted since 2002, the strike corps are envisaged as the front paw of multiple thrusts through the western border from Kutch right up to Jammu. Their role is to make the deepest penetration into enemy territory and hold it as a bargaining chip for political negotiations.         
	The doctrine envisages that the strike corps will come from the rear of defensive formations that will provide it support from the rear and maintain supply lines.         
	Gen. Singh was briefed on the war game through the month by the 1 Corps commander, Lt Gen. A.K. Singh, as the Blue (friendly) forces took the battle into the turf of the Red (enemy) forces.         
	In Yodha Shakti, we tested the co-ordination between the army and the air force. The operations were executed with overwhelming momentum and tempo. State-of-the-art technology provided the cutting edge. The induction of night-vision capabilities in the mechanised forces enables a 24/7 dynamic operational capability, the army spokesperson said.         
	Manoeuvres included heliborne operations behind enemy lines, an assault by paratroopers and airborne maintenance of an armoured division in hostile territory. Vice-chief, Lt Gen. Bhardwaj, is a para commando himself.         
	The spokesperson said the strike corps also experimented with new tactical concepts and force multipliers and recently acquired weapons and surveillance technologies in a digitised environment.

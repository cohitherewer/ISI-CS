The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Brinjal a madhouse hostage

	Feb. 6: High-decibel exchanges on genetically modified (GM) brinjal, potentially Indias first edible biotech crop, have sparked concerns among sections of scientists whether its fate now hinges on emotions rather than science.         
	The last of a series of public consultations called by the Union environment ministry ended today in a packed auditorium at Central College, Bangalore, after four hours of debate, punctuated at times by shouts and sharp verbal exchanges.        
	At one point, a nutritionist called environment minister Jairam Ramesh an agent of Monsanto, the biotech firm, following which both suggested that the other required psychiatric help. I want to talk to people from the health sector. Im sorry, I dont want to talk to health patients. Please leave. Bye. Go to Nimhans, Ramesh told the protester.         
	Ramesh told the gathered scientists, farmers, and non-government organisations that he would announce on February 10 his decision on whether the brinjal should be released for cultivation.         
	Indias apex biotechnology safety regulator  the environment ministrys Genetic Engineering Approval Committee  has already approved the brinjal, modified with a bacterial gene that makes it resist attacks by insects.         
	Some scientists, science policy makers and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar have in recent weeks questioned the need for public consultations, arguing that the GEAC is a technology body and a statutory agency.         
	As far as we are concerned, the safety issue has been resolved, said a senior official with the department of biotechnology. However, there are voices of dissent within the scientific community.         
	Ramesh has justified the consultations on the ground that when issues involving human safety are involved, the government has a right and a responsibility to engage in widespread consultations. Several states, including Bengal, have decided to reject the modified brinjal after advisories from state scientists.         
	By initiating the consultation process, (Ramesh) appears to be casting aspersions on the integrity of the GEAC, said C. Kameshwar Rao, a botanist and executive secretary of the Foundation for Biotechnology Awareness and Education.         
	Rao said science appeared to take a backseat with participants shouting in favour or against the brinjal today. There were ill-informed or mischievous claims from both sides, he said.         
	Biotech proponents say the brinjal will reduce the use of pesticides and increase worm-free brinjal. However, critics believe the brinjal should be tested more rigorously to establish its safety for human consumption.         
	Ramesh has repeatedly asserted that the consultations are intended only to gather views from diverse groups and should not be interpreted as a question mark on the GEAC.         
	Much of the (public) debate has been overtaken by emotions, said K.K. Narayanan, chief executive officer of a biotech company in Bangalore. Were worried that in such an atmosphere, the easy thing to do would be to delay the release.

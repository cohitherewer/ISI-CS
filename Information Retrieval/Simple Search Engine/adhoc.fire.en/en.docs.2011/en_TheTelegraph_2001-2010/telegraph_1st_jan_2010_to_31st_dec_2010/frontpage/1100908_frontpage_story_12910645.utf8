The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Break amp; deny parents right
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Break amp; deny parents right
                            
	The parents of Pronab Mondal, The Telegraphs principal correspondent whose hand was broken by CPM activists last Friday, could not make the trip from their Barasat home to the EM Bypass hospital on Tuesday because of the bandh. Their son had undergone surgery on his fractured forearm on Monday night, and his parents Paresh Chandra Mondal and Renu Mondal had not seen him after that.        
	Paresh Chandra Mondal, a retired BSNL employee, expresses his helplessness as a citizen and a parent trapped in a state of political violence.        
	I am proud my son is a journalist. I am ashamed that I live in a state where the political forces prevent him from doing his job and his parents from seeing him in hospital.        
	On Friday, they broke his left forearm in Pirakata (West Midnapore). On Tuesday, they prevented his mother Renu and me from reaching Apollo Gleneagles, the morning after a steel plate was inserted so that he could hold up his hand again.        
	Today, we know more than ever before that we are all victims of the politics of destruction and disruption.        
	What can ordinary citizens like me do to protest the violence every day, be it by the Maoists or the CPM or someone else? I dont even have the nerve to raise my voice, though I realise it is a shame to live in such perpetual fear.        
	Every civilised country allows freedom to its journalists. But no one from the party responsible for the attack on my son has apologised for his condition, no one has publicly expressed remorse for the plight of his parents.        
	Parents like us are trapped in this cycle of violence.        
	Tuesdays Calcutta was as violent for me as Fridays Pirakata, though there may not have been bloodshed on the road. There was no way I could have reached my son as his post-operation sedatives wore off. There was no way I could reach Renu to her son.        
	The bandh was very successful  there was not a rickshaw on the road near our place (Hridaypur in Barasat). But spontaneous?         
	We are ordinary people. I was in a temple for an evening prayer on Friday when a neighbour asked if I had seen the TV news bulletin. Why? I soon realised.        
	My son was there on the screen, limping into a hospital (in Midnapore town) with his swollen left arm hanging from a sling. I tried to call him but the line was busy. When I got through, he assured me he was all right but for the pain in his left arm. It is getting worse with every passing moment, he said.                    
	An X-ray confirmed that he had suffered a fracture. But he had to stay the night in Midnapore. Travelling after sundown has its own share of risks in that part of Bengal. For us, it was almost a night without end.        
	Mothers tend to worry more than fathers. Renu woke me up several times that night, asking if he was all right. We lay awake wondering, is everyone telling us the whole story? Could his hand actually shield his head? What about the bamboo blows on his back?        
	Theres a war on, for turf. The political parties, whatever their colours, have a single aim  to retain or reclaim turf. We have to live with this because we cannot call a bandh to protest the politics of destruction and disruption or defy a bandh.        
	Pronab was admitted to hospital on Saturday and Renu and I went there every day to be by his side. On Tuesday, we were denied even that right.        
	Yes, the bandh was very successful.

	Calcutta, Sept. 16: Rahul Gandhi today went public with his Bengal theme of self-respect and dignity, fuelling hopes among Congress ranks that the party would stop appeasing its ally and touching what appeared to be a raw nerve in Mamata Banerjee.        
	Mamataji is a senior leader. She has worked with my father. We want to continue our relations with her to oust the Left Front. But we want a partnership of respect and dignity. We will not do so if we are not respected. We have got this elsewhere, Rahul told a media conference in Calcutta today.        
	The comments hours before he wrapped up a three-day tour of Bengal were the first such in public. So far, Rahul had been laying stress on self-respect and dignity at closed-door sessions, following which participants had briefed the media.        
	Todays assertion was made not only in public but it was also much more unequivocal than what was being attributed to him till now.        
	Mamata, who apparently watched the morning media conference on television at her home, did not respond during the day but made some uncharacteristic observations in the evening.        
	Mamata was responding to a question if the Trinamul Congress, which is seen as a one-leader party, has a second line of command at The Statesman Awards for Rural Reporting.        
	The Trinamul leader said: Soniaji is the leader of the Congress party but nobody directs this question towards her because they are the high-class people. Mayavati is also the leader of her party. But nobody raises this question.        
	Mamata made veiled references to dynasty politics. I am lucky I have no family members for my party she said. At least I am proud I am not backing any of my family members. I believe when I am in politics, the public is my family.        
	Mamata is too mature a politician to explicitly tie such statements to Rahuls comments a few hours ago. But if indeed she was reacting to the signs of assertiveness in the Bengal Congress, it would appear she is not taking Rahul lightly and his tour of the state has made her sit up.        
	At the media conference, Rahul reaffirmed another telling comment that was attributed to him yesterday. We want to keep our alliance afloat with Mamataji who has struggled hard in Bengal. But we wont bow our head before anyone, he said this morning.        
	Although Rahul did not mention the states where the Congress has a partnership of respect, it appears that he had in mind the alliance partners in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.                     Rahul Gandhi at the media conference in Calcutta. (Picture by Pabitra Das)      
	Rahuls demand for self-respect and the simultaneous emphasis on maintaining relations with Mamataji are being seen as a step towards preparing the ground for party managers to drive a hard bargain for more seats in next years elections.        
	Its too early to say how many seats of a total of 294 will be offered to us before next years Assembly polls. But Rahuljis emphasis on the partys self-respect and at the same time keeping our relations with Mamataji intact are a tactical approach. It keeps Mamataji happy and raises hopes among party ranks that we would get our due, said K. Keshava Rao, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs.        
	At the media conference, Rahul also displayed his skills at sidestepping potential minefields. Asked if he was continually asking for self-respect and dignity to extract more seats for the party, Rahul said: Being a Bengali, you should know what self-dignity is.         
	Pressed if he felt there was denial of respect from Trinamul, he said: I am not talking about the near past. I am looking forward to the future.        
	On Mamatas differences with the UPA government, Rahul said: To say she has been opposing on all issues is unfair. She has been opposing some or few things. She has a right to her opinion. We are a large party and we are sensitive to many things. But difference of opinion and disrespect are two different things. We have a problem with disrespect.

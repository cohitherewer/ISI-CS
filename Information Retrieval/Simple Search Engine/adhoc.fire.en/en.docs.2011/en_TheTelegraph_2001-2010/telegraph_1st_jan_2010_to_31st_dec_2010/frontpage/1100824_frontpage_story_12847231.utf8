	New Delhi, Aug. 23: Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik today said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had assured him that the clearance process for the stalled Posco project would be expedited.        
	However, the Prime Minister did not make any comment on the Vedanta Alumina complex, which also has been put on hold by the Union environment ministry. Singh has asked the chief minister to discuss the matter with Jairam Ramesh, the Union environment and forests minister.        
	 I told the Prime Minister about the importance of the Posco project for Orissa and the entire country. The Prime Minister assured me that the project will be expedited. On the Vedanta project, the Prime Minister told me to talk to the environment minister, Patnaik told reporters         
	A team of central experts will visit Orissa soon to expedite the Rs 56,000-crore Posco project, Patnaik said.        
	He said the proposed Posco steel plant, which would be biggest foreign direct investment, would create more jobs and bring development not only for Orissa but for the whole country. It is in the interest of the country that the project should be cleared.        
	On the alumina project, the N.C. Saxena committee, constituted by the Centre, had accused the state government of misleading the Union government and letting Vedanta violate the Forest Rights Act. Vedanta, which was permitted to set up a one-million-tonne plant, had been accused of expanding its capacity without environment clearance.         
	Forest minister Ramesh met Patnaik at Orissa Bhavan in the afternoon. Ramesh told me that he will try to hasten the projects, Patnaik said.        
	Our forest secretary will meet Ramesh to expedite the process, Patnaik added. The Saxena committee has said that forest clearance should not be given to the Vedanta project for its expansion project since it could cause serious harm to the forests and biodiversity and primitive tribal groups in the area.        
	 Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to visit Lanjigarh area on August 26 to interact with the tribals who were affected by the Vedanta project. Patnaik said: Rahul is free to visit anywhere he likes.        
	Asked if he sees any threat of any of these companies pulling out owing to delay in clearance, Patnaik said: I hope they dont. Until now, there is no such proposal from their side.        
	Patnaik also told th Prime Minister that 11 tribal villages would be inundated by the Polavaram dam on the Godavari in Andhra Pradesh. The environment ministry has already given clearance for diversion of forest land for the project. The Prime Minister assured me that villages of tribal people will not be inundated, he said.

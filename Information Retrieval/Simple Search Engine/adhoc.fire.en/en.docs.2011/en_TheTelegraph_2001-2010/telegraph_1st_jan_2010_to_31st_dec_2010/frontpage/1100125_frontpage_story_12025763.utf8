	Calcutta, Jan. 24: Prakash Karat, who had scuttled Jyoti Basus chances of becoming Prime Minister, today hailed him as a great example and the countrys greatest communist.        
	Exactly a week after Basus death, party leaders who had ignored his pragmatic politics when he was alive pledged to make him their beacon in their bid for a turnaround after successive poll reverses.        
	He was not the leader of Bengal alone but of the entire country. We have to take inspiration from his great example and follow his path, Karat, the CPM general secretary, told the condolence meeting at Shahid Minar.        
	The eulogy must have provoked among party veterans memories of how Karat successfully led the opposition within the CPM to Basu becoming Prime Minister in 1996, a decision the late communist had called an historic blunder.        
	Karat, who has not contested elections to legislature, made specific references to Basus association with the parliamentary system. In his 55-year career in parliamentary politics, as well as the 23 years as chief minister, he taught us how to serve the people while working in the parliamentary system. He has deepened democracy in Bengal and become an example for the rest of the country, he said.        
	Karat also mentioned the sea of humanity that had submerged the citys streets during Basus last journey on January 19.        
	Although Mamata Banerjee and other Trinamul Congress leaders skipped the meeting, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appeared to have his main rival in mind when he spoke about his predecessors liberal treatment of the Opposition.        
	The Opposition says communists are enemies of democracy. But Jyotibabu proved all through his life how communists could deepen democracy while working in the parliamentary system, Bhattacharjee said. He reminded the audience that the first decision of the first Left Front government in 1977 was to declare a general amnesty for all political prisoners.        
	State Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee, whose participation stood out in contrast with ally Trinamuls absence, praised Basus liberal politics. We lost a real mass leader and a rare personality who was above narrow and vengeful politics. He helped us on many occasions.        
	Mukherjee said Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee could not come because he was preoccupied with the budget.        
	The CPMs Left allies, who have clashed with the big brother over issues like land acquisition for industry, said the front had lost someone who kept the flock together.        
	We have lost the guardian of a joint family. We dont know whether we will get another leader who can carry us together and earn our respect, said RSP leader Kshiti Goswami.         
	Cricketer Sourav Ganguly was among those who paid homage to Basu. The turnout, compared with Tuesdays surge, was low but CPM leaders said the party had left it to peoples spontaneity.

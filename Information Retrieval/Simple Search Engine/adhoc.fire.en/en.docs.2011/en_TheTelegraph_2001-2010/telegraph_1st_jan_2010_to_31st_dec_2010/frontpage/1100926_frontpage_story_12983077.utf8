                                Michelle Obama shares a laugh with Haitis First Lady Elisabeth Preval in Westchester, New York. (Reuters)                            
	New York, Sept. 25: Michelle Obama gave her healthy eating initiative a global showcase yesterday when she welcomed spouses of world leaders to tour a farm north of New York city.        
	Michelle Obama then treated them to a seasonal lunch featuring bounty from the farm and the White House garden. The spouses included Chantal Biya, First Lady of Cameroon, Haitis First Lady Elisabeth Preval and their counterparts from countries around the world, such as Mongolia, Swaziland and Latvia.        
	The group toured the Stone Barns Center, about 25 miles north of New York, which is both a farm and an educational centre working on sustainable farming.        
	The farm shares the premises with one of the most renowned restaurants in the New York area, Blue Hill at Stone Barns, where the women lunched on tomatoes from the White House kitchen garden, eggs harvested minutes earlier from the farms chickens and chicken with ratatouille.        
	Addressing the spouses, Michelle Obama, wearing an appropriately floral print dress, emphasised the importance of children learning directly about the food they eat.        
	Also participating in the days events were children from two local schools, who helped prepare the lunch by harvesting the eggs and collecting herbs.        
	The First Lady told a story about how daughter, Sasha, would not eat tomatoes until she made her own tomato, mozzarella and pesto sandwich in a cooking class at school. Do you know those hair tomatoes? she asked her mother, referring to heirloom tomatoes. Now those are good tomatoes!        
	The days meal was prepared by the restaurants top chef and co-owner, Dan Barber, as well as three White House chefs who flew up for the occasion.

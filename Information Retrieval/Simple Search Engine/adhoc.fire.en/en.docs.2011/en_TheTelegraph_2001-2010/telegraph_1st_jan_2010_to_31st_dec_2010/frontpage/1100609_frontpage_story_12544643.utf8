The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 60 were engaged to murder Madan Tamang: CID
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                60 were engaged to murder Madan Tamang: CID
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 8: Gorkha leader Madan Tamang was hacked to death in public in line with a plot executed by as many as 60 people, according to investigations that have narrowed down to two the number of suspects who might have delivered the killer blow.        
	The probe by the criminal investigation department (CID) has also found that five people formed the core group of attackers that silenced the prominent opposition voice on May 21 near Planters Club in Darjeeling. CID officials also spoke of a mastermind but refused to name any suspect, citing the extremely sensitive nature of the case.        
	The findings strike at the root of the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas claims that the daylight murder was the result of a spontaneous outburst of emotions by common people who wanted Gorkhaland.        
	The Morcha leadership has rubbished the probe which was carried out on the basis of a first information report that names some party functionaries.        
	As the president of the ABGL, Tamang was one of the few voices that had challenged the writ of the Morcha in the hills and occasionally reminded its chief Bimal Gurung that he had failed to deliver the promised Gorkhaland.        
	CID officers investigating the case said Dinesh Gurung and Naresh Thang were entrusted with the task of killing Tamang. Both had apparently hidden sharp weapons under their clothes.        
	We are yet to determine which one of the two, Dinesh or Naresh, actually stabbed Tamang from behind after managing to get close to him, said a CID officer.        
	The name of Dinesh, a Darjeeling town committee member of the Morcha, had been mentioned in the FIR filed by an ABGL leader. But this is the first time Thangs name is cropping up. Sources in Darjeeling said they had not heard of the person before.        
	According to CID sources, at least 60 people were involved in the plot.         
	These men were asked to spread out in the area where the incident took place. They were roaming there pretending to be pedestrians or residents hanging around. Their job was to provide the five men, who were asked to execute Tamang, a safe passage after the completion of the operation by creating confusion, said a CID source.        
	P. Neerajnayan, inspector-general (I), CID, said the agency had specific information about those who had attacked Tamang. They are absconding and our officers are camping in Darjeeling to collect more information and arrest them, he said.        
	Another CID officer said the conspirators appeared to have been taken aback by the retaliation by Tamangs bodyguard. Seven rounds were fired during the attack. The policeman guarding Madan Tamang managed to fire five founds from his revolver and two other armed policemen at the spot fired one round each, the officer said.        
	Three men were injured when Tamangs bodyguard fired. Two of them, Subash Tamang and Prashant Chhetri, were arrested from a Kalimpong nursing home and sent to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital on June 3. They have been arrested and charged with criminal conspiracy.         
	The other injured man, Sangey Yolmo, is admitted to a Siliguri nursing home. The CID is interrogating Suresh Raimaji, a contractor from Darjeeling, who was also arrested on June 3.        
	The CID had earlier revealed that Nickol Tamang, a Morcha central committee member, was at the murder spot as his cellphone was found close to where Tamang was attacked.         
	Addressing a gathering of students at Chowrasta (Mall) in Darjeeling this afternoon, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said the police were hatching a conspiracy to discredit and taint his party by accusing its members of being involved in the murder. A conspiracy is being hatched to derail the movement for Gorkhaland, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dream run for dream romp
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dream run for dream romp

	Had director Christopher Nolan granted Anil Kapoors wish of playing Yusuf in Inception, he would have been fighting his daughter at the box office this week. Because just like the new Bollywood releases for the previous three Fridays, the Leonardo DiCaprio-starrer has posed the biggest threat to Sonam Kapoors Aisha.        
	If the mind-boggling sci-fi thriller has been number one at the US box office three weeks in a row, it has had nothing short of a dream run in Calcutta. For a Hollywood film to book five daily shows at a city multiplex in its fourth week is the stuff of dreams. And to do it when big Bolly films are arriving every Friday, makes it almost surreal, given the poor track record of Holly films in town.        
	Inception has had quite a spectacular run in the city, says exhibitor-distributor Arijit Dutta. Its different and it joggles the mind, something Calcuttans just love. So they have been raving about it, even if they didnt understand it fully. Also, many are watching it more than once, so as to be able to discuss the film and its finer details at get-togethers.        
	When it comes to Hollywood, size does matter for Calcutta. If Titanic did spectacular business on the single screens, in the seven-year multiplex era the city has only lapped up the biggest on offer (see chart).        
	But rarely has a film drowned the big Bolly buzz and ruled the box office like Inception has. The film released on July 16 with Lamha and Udaan. This week, the Bipasha Basu-Sanjay Dutt-starrer is no longer at the theatres and Udaan has just one show each at a couple of plexes.        
	On Friday the 23rd, Inception was pitted against Khatta Meetha and while the Akshay Kumar comedy opened with a bang, it ended with a whimper, with hardly any show to show this week. On July 30, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai was the big Bolly opener but even that couldnt halt the Inception march.        
	And now, in its fourth week, the $160 million movie continues to go houseful on weekend evenings. Even the much-fancied third film in the Twilight series, Eclipse, which released on July 30, has already been eclipsed by Inception.        
	I think this one is going the Avatar way, which went on and on and on, says Rishi Negi, the chief operating officer of Fame, with seven shows of Inception in Week 4. Calcutta is on a par with Mumbai and Bangalore. You cant reduce the number of shows if the collections are so good.        
	No wonder Warner Bros is all smiles. The studio has had big successes like the Harry Potter movies, The Dark Knight and Hangover in the recent past, but Inception has emerged as the best performer ever at the Calcutta box office, says a source.        
	The film has seen the lowest drop for a wide English film this year, adds Denzil Dias, deputy managing director (theatrical), Warner Bros Pictures India. The word of mouth on Inception is unprecedented and a lot of audiences are going back to the cinemas for a second or third viewing.        
	Who dreams at which level, who goes into limbo, who gives the kick, who is dreaming and who is in reality tantalising questions like these comprise common cocktail conversations in Calcutta. It is very rare in this day and age that a movie makes you think and Inception did that from start to finish, says Ballygunge-based cricket commentator Gautam Bhimani.        
	Inception has also become a rage among the young who have been discussing and dissecting the film on Facebook and Twitter, at CCD and Mocha. Its not every day that a film with so much fantasy is made to be so realistic, says college student Akash Ghosh. Every time I saw it, and I have seen it more than a couple of times already, I was left spinning like a top!        
	Calcutta may have contributed just a fraction of the giant $250 million Inception has collected from the international market (barring the US and Canada) but it has given a big boost to English language movies in the city. First Avatar and now Inception Hollywood will only become stronger and stronger at the Indian box office and continue to challenge the Bollywood biggies, sums up trade analyst Amod Mehra.        
	If you still doubt the power of dreams on the city screen, go for a show of Inception, sit through the awe and then wait for the applause at the end. Yes, even in Week 5.

          OUR BUREAU                                              
	July 17: Seven personnel died a bloody death in a Jharkhand CRPF camp last night, falling prey not to Maoists but to a comrade who had apparently cracked under the constant strain of fighting the rebels.        
	Head constable Harpinder Singh, 35, was allegedly drinking in violation of rules and when colleagues threatened to report him, went berserk. He gunned down six persons before being himself shot dead at the camp in Kuchai, some 60km from Jamshedpur, police said.        
	The incident of fragging  Americanism for a soldier killing a colleague  suggests the strain of duty in Maoist zones may be getting as heavy to bear as that in militancy-hit Northeast and Kashmir from where most such fratricides have been reported.        
	Many CRPF jawans are known to take a few swigs to relieve the stress although drinking is banned in camps in Maoist zones, such as the Kuchai camp in Seraikela-Kharsawan district that was set up for long-range patrols.        
	CRPF sources said it all started with a fight between Harpinder and some others over food at the mess, following which assistant commandant Bikau Singh called them to his tent. Bikau found Harpinder drunk and apparently ordered someone to smell his breath, infuriating the head constable.        
	Harpinder rushed to his barracks and came out spraying bullets from his AK-47, killing Bakau and four others. This was around 10pm.        
	The jawans ran helter-skelter. The lights at the camp were switched off, a police source said. For a while, many in the camp thought it was a Maoist attack and took up position. quot;        
	For four hours, the men at the camp tried to persuade Harpinder to surrender but when he killed a sentry atop a watchtower, the others shot him dead around 2am.        
	Sources said 450 bullets were fired and that at one point, the troops had tried to surround Harpinder with armoured vehicles as he tried to rush out of the camp.        
	Fragging is mostly seen among troops who, stressed out by the relentless pressure and long separation from their families, crack when they are denied leave. But Harpinder had returned from a vacation on June 18, CRPF director-general Vikram Srivastava said.        
	He added that although it was yet to be established whether Harpinder had indeed been a victim of stress, his action was an example of what stress could do to jawans.        
	A neighbour from the head constables village of Baba Bakala, about 40km from Amritsar, said: We asked his wife and other family members if Harpinder had complained against his seniors or service conditions while on leave. They told us that despite the tough conditions, he was looking forward to rejoining.        
	Harpinder, who leaves behind a son and two daughters, came from a family used to sending its men to the armed forces and had joined the CRPF nearly two decades ago. He was an introvert, the neighbour said.        
	Compared with the army, stress and frustration are more rampant among the CRPF ranks. The paramilitary forces jawans have no peace postings, which means they may be transferred around from Kashmir to the Northeast to the Maoist belt within a few months.        
	Todays dead include Bi-kau  who took three bullets and died on his way to hospital - M.L. Patil (assistant sub-inspector), I.N. Harinath, P.T. Rao and Jadhav Bhan Singh (head constables) and Vijay Kumar (constable). Sub- inspector Bandhu Oraon, shot through the palm, is in hospital.

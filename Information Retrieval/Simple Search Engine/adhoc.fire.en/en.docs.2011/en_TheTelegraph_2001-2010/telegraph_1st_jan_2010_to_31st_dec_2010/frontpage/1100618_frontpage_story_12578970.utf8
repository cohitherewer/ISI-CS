          NARESH JANA                                               
	Midnapore, June 17: The Maoist hideout busted yesterday had apparently been set up as a staging post for a Shilda-style attack on a police camp nearby to mark the first anniversary of the deployment of joint forces in Lalgarh tomorrow, police have said.        
	The camp belongs to the India Reserve Battalion (IRB), a Bengal force, and is located 4km from the Ranja forest where at least eight Maoists were gunned down in an encounter with the joint forces yesterday morning.        
	The police today identified the eight killed in the encounter. The lone suspect captured alive has been identified as the brother of one of the slain Maoists.         
	The state government complemented its offensive by announcing a welfare package for the Maoist-affected areas and suggesting that surrenders would be encouraged. ( )        
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said maps found from the encounter site showed the route charted by the Maoists to the IRB camp at Changshol (see map). We have found four maps from the Maoist camp which clearly indicate that the rebels had been planning to attack the IRB camp, Verma said. The route had been marked on the maps to explain to the cadres how to get there.        
	Police sources said that a CRPF camp was also located 2.5km away from the forest at Sijua, but it appeared that the Maoists had picked out the IRB camp as it was a softer target.         
	After the manner in which they attacked the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp at Shilda and easily got away with it, it appears that the Maoists had presumed that security would be lax at the IRB camp as well because it belongs to the state police, an officer said.        
	The police said that another reason for targeting the IRB camp was its proximity to the Maoist stronghold of Kolshibhanga in Salboni, which would have made the rebels getaway easier.         
	The Maoists seem to have planned to attack the camp and then disappear into the forests around Kolshibhanga, the officer said. Even if the CRPF personnel from the nearby camp at Sijua had given chase, they would have met with stiff resistance since the Maoists are very strong in that area.        
	The police said the rebels had set up camp in the Ranja forest because there had been no raids there by the joint forces in the past three to four months, lending the area an air of relative safety.        
	There were no raids because we had not received any specific tip-off before Tuesday, another officer said. So, the Maoists thought that the Ranja forest would be a safe launch pad for their attack.         
	The police said that according to information gathered from villagers today, around 20 Maoists had been staying at the camp for the past one month. Around 40 more had joined the camp over the past three to four days in the run-up to June 18, the anniversary of the deployment of the central forces.        
	In the last few days, the amount of food and water that the Maoists were taking from us as well as from the adjoining villages suddenly went up, a villager told The Telegraph. We knew that the number of people at the camp had gone up. But we were not aware of what they were planning.        
	The police said the Maoists had gathered near Duli from nearby Goaltore, Bhalukbasha, Lakshmanpur and Kolshibhanga.

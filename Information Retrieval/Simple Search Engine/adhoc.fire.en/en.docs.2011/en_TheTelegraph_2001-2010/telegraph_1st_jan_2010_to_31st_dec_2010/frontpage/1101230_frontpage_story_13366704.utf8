The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Games plan in tender trouble
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Games plan in tender trouble

	Ranchi, Dec. 29: Luck has always been an estranged lover for Jharkhand as far as the 34th National Games are concerned.        
	Blemished by six postponements, the organising committee for the sporting extravaganza is now finding itself in a fix over catering and transport tenders for 12,000 sportspersons and officials who will be in the state for the fortnight-long event, starting on February 12.        
	Though the deadline to respond to the tenders, floated by the National Games Organising Committee (NGOC), ended yesterday, there have been virtually no takers.         
	Sources attributed this tepid response to uncertainties plaguing the Games in the past. The state has lost its credibility on account of six postponements in three years. Major transport and catering firms are not interested in offering their services, an NGOC office-bearer said, requesting anonymity.        
	According to sources, no one responded to the tender floated for 1,380 vehicles  air-conditioned (AC) luxury cars, AC cars, non-AC cars, AC buses and non-AC buses  which will be required to ferry participants and officials. And just one little-known hospitality firm  Hotel U amp;I, Tirumala  responded to the notice for catering, but did not qualify due to lack of experience in serving such a huge gathering.         
	In 2008, two caterers  Gazal Caterers, Faridabad, and Catering Care, Noida  had responded. However, the principal accountant-general (PAG) had objected to awarding the tender to Gazal caterers.        
	For event management this time, only two firms  Wizcraft International, Mumbai, and Carving Dreams  have responded. The latter has not qualified, as it has no experience in hospitality management. Earlier, the PAG had also objected to payment of Rs 2.59 crore to Wizcraft as mobilisation advance without taking proper bank guarantee.                                       
	In 2008, four companies had responded to NGOCs event management invite. These were Brilliant Entertainment Network, New Delhi, Encompass Event, Gurgaon, and Celebrity management, Kolkata, besides Wizcraft.         
	Special secretary, sports department, Nitin Madan Kulkarni, however, said all would be well within a week. We have approached Tata Motors for transport and it is likely to accept our offer. We are going to take decisions on catering and event management in a week. We may give catering orders to Ghazal if it is ready to provide food at the 2008 rate, he said.        
	Kulkarni claimed that other nitty-gritty had been sorted out. We have engaged a local group for supplying 33 victory stands while the NCC will provide 3,000 volunteers for the Games, he said, adding that Centre-owned Indian Mint Corporation had been requested to supply medals.        
	Besides, we are procuring terraflex (synthetic surface for volleyball and handball events) directly from French company Gerflora at 60 per cent of the cost finalised earlier through tenders. The old rate was pegged at Rs 6 crore, Kulkarni said. Also, we have finalised a hall at the NGOC administrative building for judo, karate and fencing events.         
	The sports special secretary maintained that Jharcraft would provide facilities such as laundry, confectionery, mobile phone recharge, etc.        
	The only problem is choosing a suitable firm for the opening and closing ceremonies as well as daily cultural shows. We have to decide on Wizcraft, which has been mired in controversies, at the NGOC executive council meeting, he said.

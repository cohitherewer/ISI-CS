The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | SC defers Ayodhya verdict
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                SC defers Ayodhya verdict
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: The anxiously anticipated Ayodhya verdict will not come tomorrow, with the Supreme Court deciding to consider giving the reconciliation process another chance so that ordinary Indians are spared the possible consequences of a defeat for one of the sides.        
	A two-judge bench today stayed the verdict, which the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court was to deliver tomorrow, till at least September 28 amid protests from several parties to the case and a difference of opinion between the two judges themselves.        
	On September 28, a three-judge bench will hear an appeal by petitioner Ramesh Chandra Tripathi against the high courts rejection of his plea to put off its verdict on whether the disputed Ayodhya plot belongs to Hindus or Muslims.        
	When some of the parties to the title suit protested that they wanted a verdict now and not mediation, one of the judges, Justice H.L. Gokhale, observed: The people who will suffer most (in case of violence) are those who are not parties to the suit.        
	The court then issued notices to all 24 parties in the title suit to appear on September 28 and explain why a final attempt should not be made for a mediated settlement, as Tripathi had sought. It also issued a notice to the attorney-general, seeking the Centres views.        
	That the Centre would seek a postponement was left in little doubt when it today extended the ban on bulk text messages and MMS clips till September 29 to pre-empt rumours being spread to create tension. However, the wait for the verdict could stretch far beyond September 29 .         
	Justice R.V. Raveendran, who heads the two-judge apex court bench, was at first inclined to dismiss Tripathis appeal. He told Tripathis counsel Mukul Rohatgi that if the judgment was deferred, it would become a festering wound.        
	Dismissing the fears of violence, he said: Why do you assume that the people in this country are so immature? Religious passion will rise if people raise it. If people dont raise it, it will not rise.        
	But Justice Gokhale differed. If anything goes wrong tomorrow, you will be the first to blame us, he told those opposing a deferment. If there are consequences, the ordinary people will have to face it.        
	Justice Raveendran then went along with his fellow judge, saying: (The) tradition of this court is, when one member says that notice be issued and another says that it should not be issued, the notice should be issued.        
	In view of the differences between the two judges, a three-judge bench will hear the case on September 28.        
	On September 17, when the high court rejected Tripathis plea, all the other parties to the case except the Nirmohi Akhara had said a negotiated solution was no longer possible.        
	Both Anoop Chaudhari and Ravi Shankar Prasad, counsel for the Sunni Central Wakf Board and Paramhansa Ram Chandra respectively, today opposed a postponement. Their apparent unity prompted Justice Raveendran to observe sarcastically they should have spent the same energy in finding an agreement on the main case.        
	Prasad alleged Tripathi was a non-serious player who had never appeared in the high court or expressed his views on the title suit. But Justice Gokhale said: This is the first time such a request is being made to this court. Why are you so reluctant?        
	Told the case was likely to come to the Supreme Court (in appeal) anyway, the judge said that by then one party would have lost and another would have won. In such situations, the chances of a settlement become bleak, he said. You expect a better attitude (from the two sides) after the judgment?         
	When Chaudhari claimed another bid at mediation would be an exercise in futility, Justice Gokhale said: Even if there is one per cent chance, time should be given. Chaudhari countered: There is zero per cent chance.        
	But Tripathis counsel said: This is not a private suit between 20 parties. It has wider ramifications for the voiceless majority.... Let there be an attempt.

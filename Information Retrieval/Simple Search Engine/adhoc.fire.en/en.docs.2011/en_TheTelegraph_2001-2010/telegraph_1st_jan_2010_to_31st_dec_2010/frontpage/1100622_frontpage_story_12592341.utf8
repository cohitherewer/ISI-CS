The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Question at 33: Lal or Last Salaam? 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Question at 33: Lal or Last Salaam? 
          SANJAY MANDAL                            Arijit Das (top) and Madhur Chandra. (Pradip Sanyal)                          
	Calcutta, June 21: Arijit Dass first salute could turn out to be Madhur Chandras last.        
	When Chandra raised his arm today to the cadences of Lal Salaam to salute the 33th anniversary of the Left Front government, the 75-year-old could not but wonder if it would be the last time he was doing so on this day since his first over three decades ago.        
	The retired government employee was there outside Writers Buildings on June 21, 1977, when the first Left Front government took oath in front of the Bengal secretariat.        
	Barring once or twice, he has never missed this day.        
	Today, he was joined by the much younger Das who wasnt even born when the Left came to power.         
	For the 20-year-old Das, it was his first Red salute at the fronts annual June 21 celebrations. This is my first time at the Left Fronts celebration, the English honours student from Bally said outside Netaji Indoor Stadium, the venue of todays meet. I am excited to hear Buddhababu speak.        
	After successive Left poll defeats, excitement has given way to resignation for Chandra. They are working hard to regain peoples faith but things are difficult now, said the loyal communist who took a bus from Bhowanipore to reach the stadium.         
	Chandra will go back the same way, as he has done these past 30 years. I dont want this to be the last celebration but my spirits are not high any more.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee sought to talk up the morale of those like Chandra. Theres only a year left, Bhattacharjee told the gathering at the packed hall. Go to the people humbly, admit your mistakes and change for the better. Those who have got hurt need to be brought back to our side.        
	But Chandra had already turned to the past for comfort. I remember those days when Jyoti Babu used to be the main attraction. Promodebabu (Promode Dasgupta) was another charismatic leader. Now the leaders seem to lack that enthusiasm, he said.        
	Standing outside the stadium hall, Chandra remembered the afternoon of 1967 when the CPM held a rally to celebrate the first United Fronts coming to power. There was a huge crowd at the Brigade Parade Ground and, at the end, everybody lit paper torches.        
	But times have changed. Those charismatic leaders, the crowd-pullers, are dead. The young leaders of those days  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Biman Bose  now have grey hair, he said.         
	Whats the remedy? Attract the youths again.

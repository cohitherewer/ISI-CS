	Mumbai, Aug 17 (PTI): Nearly 100 containers that fell into the waters following the collision between two merchant vessels off the Mumbai coast are still missing and two of them are carrying hazardous chemicals.
    "The salvage operation is underway. About 100 out of the total 250 containers are yet to be traced from the waters," Rahul Asthana, Chairman of Mumbai Port Trust, told PTI.
    Two of the missing containers carry hazardous chemicals and efforts are on to locate and retrieve them, he said.
    Two merchant vessels--MSC Chitra and Khalijia-III collided off the Mumbai coast on August 7 causing an oil spill. Several containers from one of the vessels fell into the sea.

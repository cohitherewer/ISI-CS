The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Trinamul uncorks oil alert
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Trinamul uncorks oil alert
          R. SURYAMURTHY                            Mamata Banerjee                                  
	New Delhi, June 8: The Centre could find it hard to go ahead with freeing petrol and diesel prices from government control, analysts said, after the Trinamul Congress spoke out openly against the move today.        
	We are against any hike in (prices of) petroleum products, especially at a time when people have been hit by food inflation, Saugata Roy, junior minister for urban development, told The Telegraph.        
	The comment came a day after the government deferred a hike in fuel prices as several key allies skipped a meeting of an empowered Group of Ministers (GoM) to discuss recommendations of a committee that had suggested freeing up petrol and diesel prices.        
	The government should work out some other solution as any hike in fuel prices affects the people directly, Roy added. Our party is completely opposed to any hike in fuel prices and our leader (railway minister) Mamata Banerjee has conveyed her concerns to the government.        
	Trinamuls blunt opposition is sure to dampen the mood of petroleum minister Murli Deora, who today said market-driven prices were necessary for petrol and diesel to help oil companies cut their losses.        
	State-owned firms IOC, BPCL and HPCL have been losing over Rs 200 crore a day selling fuel below global crude prices. The losses, industry sources have warned, could touch Rs 90,000 crore this fiscal year if the prices remained unchanged.        
	Sources said the Centre was looking at a new date for a GoM meeting to make another attempt to resolve the issue. Analysts, however, said it would be difficult for the Congress-led UPA government to implement the suggestions of the Kirit Parikh committee.        
	The panel had recommended freeing up petrol and diesel prices, which, if implemented, would have resulted in an increase of Rs 3.50 a litre. It had also suggested increasing kerosene and LPG prices by Rs 6 per litre and Rs 100 per cylinder.        
	Sources said free-market pricing of petrol and diesel and a hike in LPG and kerosene prices would increase wholesale price-based inflation by 1.4 percentage points.         
	The annual inflation was 9.59 per cent in April, mainly on account of food prices which have increased by around 17 per cent.        
	Although there is a need to go in for micro-management of petroleum product prices, it would be difficult to ignore the voice of Mamata Banerjee at this juncture. The mandate she has got in the civic polls makes it even more difficult for the Congress-led UPA to push through its decision as Bengal goes to polls next year, N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist with the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said.        
	He said other UPA allies that are facing Assembly elections would also oppose any move to hike fuel prices. They (the government) would wait for the state polls to be over before going ahead, Bhanumurthy said.        
	Sending a clear signal that they were not with the government on the issue, neither Mamata, nor NCP leader and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar turned up for the meeting last evening.        
	Before the meeting, fertiliser minister M.K. Alagiri and telecom minister A. Raja met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who heads the GoM, to convey the DMKs opposition to any move to hike auto fuel prices.        
	Oil ministry officials said the broad consensus at the meeting was that oil firms should be given the freedom to fix petrol prices. But the government should intervene if the oil firms start overpricing.        
	However, the officials said, there was no unanimity on free market pricing of diesel as nearly 20 per cent of the fuel is used by the farm sector.        
	The officials said the oil ministry had proposed a marginal hike in domestic LPG cylinder prices and a notional increase in kerosene prices in its presentation to the GoM.        
	Among the others who attended the meeting were Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia, oil minister Murli Deora and cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar.

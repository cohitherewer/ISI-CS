The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Green shadow over mining proposal
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Green shadow over mining proposal
          AMIT GUPTA                                               
	Ranchi, July 21: Protecting the rich bio-diversity of Saranda, Asias biggest sal tree reserve, is a challenge facing the state and Centre given the many mining proposals featuring the area.         
	Sensing the magnitude of the ecological fallout, the governors advisory council yesterday decided to forward the forest diversion proposal of Jindal Steel amp; Power Limited (JSPL) directly to the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) without making any recommendations of its own.         
	The advisory council acted on a proposal of the state environment and forests department which was reluctant to make a recommendation for non-forest (mining) activity in the reserved forest area that also happens to be an important elephant corridor.        
	Now the Union ministry, at present headed by Jairam Ramesh, would have to decide on the states proposal with regard to JSPL, owned by Congress MP from Kurukshetra Naveen Jindal.         
	JSPLs case is only the tip of the iceberg as prospective investors like ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel, JSW Steel Jharkhand Limited, Essar Steels Jharkhand Limited and others are all awaiting the states nod for their individual mining/prospecting proposals.         
	While JSPL has been eyeing the 537-acre spread of Jaraldaburu in Saranda, which is expected to yield 70MT ore, ArcelorMittal wants an adjoining chunk of 212 hectares in Karampada in the same reserve forest.         
	The West Singhbhum district mining officer has recommended a massive 1,000 hectares for Sajjan Jindal-owned JSW in Ankua, again in Saranda reserved forest area, and another part of Ankua for Tata Steels expansion activities.         
	Yet another portion of Ankua has been recommended by the district mining officer for prospecting by Essar Steel, which would lead to a mining lease claim.        
	Forest laws prohibit non-forest activity in reserved forest areas. So we were in a bind over recommending award of mining lease to JSPL. Ultimately a clearance has to be obtained from the Union ministry, so we forwarded the proposal to the Centre, state environment and forest secretary A.K. Sarkar told The Telegraph.        
	In the same region, SAIL and Rungta Mines Limited have been carrying out mining activities for decades. In the past, the Union ministry has issued mining clearances in reserved forest area.         
	ArcelorMittal general manager (mines) P.S. Prasad said a clearance vis--vis diversion of reserved forest for non-forest use is at the discretion of the Union ministry, but similar proposals have been cleared in the past with riders.         
	The interested mining companies were told to provide equal amount of land for compensatory afforestation, to bear all expenses in executing the task, to modify the mining plan keeping in mind the flora and fauna of the region, among other things. It is mandatory for companies to follow the rules, he said.         
	Between 2003 and 2006, the state on the directives of the Union ministry had framed a proposal declaring about 60,000 hectares in Saranda as inviolate compartments where mining and other non-forest activities were prohibited.         
	The proposal was finalised during the tenure of the then forest secretary Shiv Basant and the then principal chief conservator of forests R.K. Zutshi and was even forwarded to the government for a gazette notification, which never happened.         
	The file lost its way and successive governments recommended mining/prospecting proposals in favour of some or other companies, revealed former legislator Sarayu Roy.

          OUR BUREAU                            A handout picture of Pamela Anderson on the sets of Bigg Boss, draped in a white sari in a way that is unlikely to win the approval of the government committee                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: The government has decided India is grown up enough to have adult television hours  11pm to 5am  without saying so in so many words.        
	The undeclared adult hours were made public on a day Pamela Anderson of Baywatch fame hit the Indian airwaves from a reality show studio.        
	Ironically, the government order restricting telecast between 11pm and 5pm was meant for two specific shows  Bigg Boss 4 featuring Pamela and Rakhi ka Insaaf hosted by Rakhi Sawant.        
	A government committee had yesterday concluded, apparently based on innumerable complaints from viewers, that the two shows are unfit to be watched by children.        
	The good intentions behind the conclusion  it was also prompted by a suicide allegedly linked to the Rakhi show  are unlikely to invite reproach.        
	But the subsequent action of restricting the shows has raised questions whether it is the governments job to decide who should watch what at which time. Besides, the restriction itself has gifted the shows additional and free  publicity that may prompt more children to stay up at night and find out what the government does not want them to see.        
	The channels beaming the programmes, Colours and imagine, have also been ordered to run a scroll saying the respective show is not suitable for children when it is telecast.        
	The scroll and the time band effectively  and probably unwittingly -- means Indian general entertainment television now has the equivalent of an A certificate and a saucy Cinderella (or should it be Pamela) hour.         
	Government officials in New Delhi were queasy about describing the six-hour permissive patch as a sanction for adult television, choosing to describe the move as a crackdown on vulgar content at prime time.        
	It will be interesting to see what kind of entertainment is now offered in the post-11pm slot, said industry analyst Naveen Shukla.        
	The government orders on the two shows followed complaints from several organisations and citizens against abusive language and objectionable content. These two shows are not for universal viewing, a ministry official said.         
	Even re-runs and clippings of the two shows can be telecast only between 11pm and 5am, the order said.        
	In the past, the ministry had issued such directives only to niche channels like FTV or a gaggle of fringe broadcasters. This time, too, the government has banned for seven days from November 22 a Telugu channel, SS Music, for allegedly showing nudity.        
	This is the first time general entertainment channels are being asked to restrict shows within a specific time band.        
	However, the order did not prevent Bigg Boss with Pamela going on air at 9pm today. Earlier in the day, Pamela had told PTI that she was not a fan of reality shows. I love traditional shows like Baywatch. Her comment reflects the distance India has travelled since the traditional Baywatch hit Indian drawing rooms in the 1990s and raised the eyebrows of some social activists.        
	A source in the Colors channel said this evening that it had not yet got any order from the ministry and it would continue the telecast at 9pm till a formal directive was received.        
	The decisions were taken on Monday by an inter-ministerial committee that included additional secretaries from the ministries of home, women and child development, external affairs and I amp;B. The order said the two shows went against good taste and decency.        
	Bigg Boss is not suitable for unrestricted public exhibition, especially at prime time, when a large number of children are watching television, the order said. Participants are often shown quarrelling in the programme and using abusive language.         
	Of Rakhi ka Insaaf, it said the anchor/host uses vulgar and abusive language and that the role of the anchor/host needs to be reviewed by the channel as the language, demeanour and conduct of the anchor in the programme is objectionable.        
	The committee found that participants often reveal intimate details of their relationships, resulting in great embarrassment to the viewers watching the programme along with their families and also to the participants in the show.        
	Rakhi ka Insaaf, which seeks to resolve family disputes of participants, was in the news recently when a 25-year-old from Jhansi starved himself to death within weeks of appearing on the show. His family had alleged that he had stopped eating out of humiliation after Rakhi called him impotent on the show.         
	The restrictions evoked mixed reactions. I think the decision has been hasty and unnecessary. They should have had an open debate before arriving at any decision, said theatre personality Alyque Padamsee.        
	But former Bigg Boss finalist Raja Chaudhury, whose ex-wife Shweta Tiwari is a contestant in season 4, said: The content and the language is getting worse by the day. 9pm is too early a slot for a show like this.

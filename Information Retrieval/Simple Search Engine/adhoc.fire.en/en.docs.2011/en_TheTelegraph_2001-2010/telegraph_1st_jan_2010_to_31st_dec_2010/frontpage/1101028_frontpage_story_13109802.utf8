  - Reliance, Tata Power amp;   others at Munda lunch         AMIT GUPTA                                           
	Ranchi, Oct. 27: As many as 30 companies queued up to partner the state in setting up an over 1,000MW thermal power project in Patratu on a build-own-operate basis for which a final decision would be taken through a tariff based competitive bidding process sometime soon.        
	The companies which responded and attended an expression of interest meet held in a city hotel today included the likes of Adani Power, Tata Power, Jindal Power, JSW Energy, ArcelorMittal, Reliance Power, RAMKY Infrastructures, RPG Enterprises, IL amp;FS Energy, Electrosteel Castings, Bhushan Power amp; Steel, Usha Martin, Essar Power, Lanco Infratech, Nagarjuna Constructions and NTPC, among others.         
	The conference chaired by chief secretary A.K. Singh was also attended by chief minister Arjun Munda who joined the prospective investors at a luncheon meeting that followed in an attempt to inspire confidence among them.         
	We want to set up a new thermal power plant in Patratu where the government has 1,000 acre at its disposal. The plant capacity will either be 1,320MW or 1,980MW. The coal link would be Banhardih coal block in Latehar, which has already been allocated to Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB), Munda told The Telegraph after the meeting.         
	He explained that todays was the first meeting after expressions of interest were invited a month back by the state government that was aggressively looking to better the power scenario in Jharkhand.        
	The proposed Patratu project is to be implemented through international competitive bidding in a tariff-based bidding process, the guidelines for which were issued by the Union ministry of power, and then on a build-own-operate model.         
	The plant will come up in Ramgarh district, about 40km from the capital, close to the old thermal power plant of JSEB at Patratu. As per the plan, the selected developer will enter into a joint venture with JSEB for development of the Banhardih coal block, about 90km from Patratu.         
	At todays meeting, the interested parties were informed that all required infrastructure like rail, road, water and airport connectivity were available close to the site.         
	The prospective investors were also told that adequate land was available with JSEB and required water would be provided from Nalkari reservoir. On their part, the power and construction majors wanted to know the nitty-gritty of the project to be implemented under public-private partnership (PPP) for the first time in the state.         
	In the end, sources said representatives of at least 10 companies showed interest in visiting the Patratu site to assess the ground situation vis--vis availability of land and water.         
	In his welcome address, JSEB chairman Shiv Basant said the state had initiated a speedy capacity addition programme in a bid to achieve self-sufficiency in power and soon the state would require about 5,235MW to meet peak load demand.         
	The entire power generated from the project would be purchased by JSEB.         
	Among the others who attended todays meeting were development commissioner S.K. Choudhary, energy secretary N.N. Pandey, chief executive officer of PFC Consulting Limited N.D. Tyagi and other senior representatives of prospective bidders.

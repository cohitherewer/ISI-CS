The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pranab jab at power-hungry Maoists
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pranab jab at power-hungry Maoists
  - Minister says nothing romantic about gun-wielding rebels out to topple the state        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pranab Mukherjee                                
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: Pranab Mukherjee today showed the governments tough face on the subject of Maoists, saying lack of development was not the main reason for their rise and that policy-making cannot be influenced by romanticism.        
	If you try to simplify the problem by saying that it is because of lack of opportunity and development it is more imaginary than real, the finance minister, a key UPA strategist, said.        
	He played down the governments role in persuading the misguided youth to join the mainstream, arguing this was a job for NGOs and social activists.        
	Mukherjee, who was addressing a conference on Red Corridor amp; Development organised by a Hindi newspaper, agreed that development was necessary to check the rebels influence on the poor.         
	But he described the Maoists themselves as political elements who want to capture power.        
	Lack of development may swell their cadre. But they do not run charitable institutions. They still believe (that) power flows through the barrel of the gun, he said.        
	Development is needed but that cannot change their philosophy. The government cannot allow them to challenge the state. No civilised society can accept this. The state cannot allow itself to be overthrown by a handful of gun-wielding youths.        
	His statements appeared to cut through the maze of views emanating from the Congress in recent months with Digvijay Singh and Keshava Rao criticising home minister P. Chidambarams tough stand against the rebels.        
	Mukherjee said he was not articulating the views of the government or the party. Yet, he was clearly reflecting the position of the state, whose primary responsibility is to enforce the rule of law unlike political parties, which can afford to take a softer stand.        
	His views, though, do not clash with Sonia Gandhis despite her stress on development, for she too has conceded the importance of tough administrative action. If their emphases are different, so are their roles.         
	The policy-makers would reach erroneous conclusions if they allow romantic ideas about Maoism to influence them, Mukherjee said, arguing that the Red Corridor (from Nepal to Andhra Pradesh) was largely a euphemism.        
	Responding to BJP leader Arun Jaitleys criticism of intellectuals who support the Maoists, the finance minister said: At times, to build up a propaganda, or to support a theory, some people create a non-existent multinational exploiting mineral resources. There is no multinational in Bastar, only government agencies are mining.        
	He added: Also, if the police kill, it is described as (an) atrocity and if (a) Maoist kills it is described as justice. It is ridiculous to say so. (The) police has to do its duty. If we tell them to give up arms, they say, The government has arms, so we too would keep arms. They consider themselves equal to the elected government. They dont believe in parliamentary democracy.        
	He hinted that the Maoist belief that power can be grabbed through the gun was mistaken. In the 70s, I thought Naxalism in West Bengal will never come to an end. But it didnt last long, it cannot last long.        
	Speaking before Mukherjee, Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh said the Red Corridor was a dated concept since the journey the Maoists were now planning extended from Dantewada to Delhi. It is not a tribal or forest problem. It is a battle for our democratic existence, for our Constitution. And the tribals are suffering the most as no battle in the world has caused so much displacement.

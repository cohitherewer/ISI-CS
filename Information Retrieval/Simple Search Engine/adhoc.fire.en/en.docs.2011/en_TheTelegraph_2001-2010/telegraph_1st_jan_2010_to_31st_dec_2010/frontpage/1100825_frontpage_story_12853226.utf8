          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 24: Sanjay Bagaria, an absconding director of the charred Stephen Court, was arrested this afternoon from a paper mill guesthouse in Uttar Pradeshs Saharanpur.        
	Sleuths from Bengal and local police officers tracked down key accused Bagaria while he was enjoying a siesta 1,527km from Calcutta. He had apparently been living in the guesthouse, on the road to Dehra Dun from Delhi, since the March 23 blaze that claimed 43 lives.         
	Bagaria had become a proclaimed offender after he failed to respond to a May 18 court notice ordering him to surrender within a month.        
	Although he is one of the three absconding directors of Stephen Court Ltd, the police said his arrest was most crucial for the probe into alleged negligence by the buildings caretakers.        
	Most vital documents of the company bear his signature. We have evidence to prove that he was present in the city when the fire broke out and yet he didnt come to help the victims or the fire tenders, said a senior officer of the four-member Calcutta team in Saharanpur.         
	Seventeen bodies were found on a staircase leading to the terrace whose door was locked. If we or the fire services were informed about the locked door, it would have probably saved some lives. That is why he has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.        
	If the charge is proved, Bagaria could be jailed for 10 years or for life.         
	Bagaria was produced in a Saharanpur court that ordered his transit remand. The police team will bring him to Calcutta tomorrow.         
	Cellphone intercepts and crucial leads from someone known to the family brought the Calcutta team to Saharanpur, about 170km from Delhi, on Tuesday morning.         
	With personnel from the local Sadarbazar police station, they cordoned off the guesthouse around 3pm. Two of us pressed the doorbell. As the caretaker opened the gate, we rushed in. Bagaria was sleeping. He offered us water when we woke him up and introduced ourselves, said station house officer B. Singh.         
	Saharanpur additional superintendent of police Pramod Kumar said: He had been hiding in the guesthouse, owned by a relative, for three-four months.

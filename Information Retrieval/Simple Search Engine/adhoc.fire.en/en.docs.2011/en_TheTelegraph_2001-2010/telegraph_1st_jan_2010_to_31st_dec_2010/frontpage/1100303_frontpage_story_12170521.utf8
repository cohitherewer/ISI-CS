The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CBSE, ICSE exams begin today
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CBSE, ICSE exams begin today
                            
	Over 52,000 students in the state will appear for examinations conducted by the Delhi-based boards from Wednesday. The ICSE and ISC exams will start with English language papers. CBSE classes X and XII exams also start the same day.         
	As many as 39,761 examinees from 296 schools will write the ICSE and ISC exams in West Bengal, said Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE).        
	Nearly 11,000 students from 100 schools will take the CBSE classes X and XII exams, a CBSE official said.        
	From this year, Class X CBSE students will receive grades instead of marks. The grading system will minimise misclassification of students on the basis of marks, eliminate unhealthy competition among students and reduce societal pressure, said a CBSE official.         
	CISCE has introduced a centralised evaluation system this year, which means examiners have to correct answer scripts at designated centres. Earlier, examiners could take answer scripts home for evaluation.

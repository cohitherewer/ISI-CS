The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Soren ready to negotiate for BDO
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Soren ready to negotiate for BDO
          OUR BUREAU                            Prashant Layek                                  
	Ranchi/Ghatshila, Feb. 14: Chief minister Shibu Soren today said he was ready to negotiate with the rebels for abducted Dalbhumgarh block development officer (BDO) Prashant Layeks release only if he received a written list of demands from the Maoists, even as Layeks wife Julie called on him at his Morabadi residence later in the evening.        
	Have the extremists given anything in writing? Soren questioned, when asked if he was ready to consider the demands of the rebels for the release of the kidnapped BDO.        
	If the extremists have failed to give anything in writing, how can we consider their demands, whatever they are? We cannot go by newspaper reports and word of mouth, the chief minister added.        
	The Naxalites have reportedly demanded the release of all villagers arrested by the police in course of anti-Naxalite operations for Layeks release.        
	Deputy chief minister Raghubar Das later in the evening said that the government would appeal to the rebels to release Layek, adding that the government was ready to talk.         
	Layeks wife Julie Bharti called on the chief minister with JVM (P) MLA from Godda, Pradeep Kumar Yadav. Julie is Yadavs elder brothers daughter.         
	Yadav said Julie had received as many as three phone calls from the rebels today, asking her to meet chief minister and press for their demands.         
	The late evening meeting was also attended by deputy chief ministers Raghubar Das and Sudesh Mahto.        
	The state governments dilemma now seems to be whether to accept the rebel demands for release of the abducted BDO or to start an all-out operation against them.         
	While the police did not initiate any operation against the Naxalites today, a day after the kidnapping, top government and police officers, including home secretary J.B. Tubid, director-general of police Neyaz Ahmed, inspector-general of police (south Chhotanagpur zone) Rezi Dungdung and IG (operations) D.K. Pandey, spent the better part of the day at Ghatshila chalking out strategy.         
	The abducted BDO is safe and he is in custody of CPI(Maoist) rebels. We will take every possible step to get the officer released safe and sound, Tubid said this afternoon, after a closed-door meeting with senior administrative and police officers. The meeting was held at the HCL directors bungalow in Maubhandar.                                                         
	Through the media we have come to know about certain terms and conditions of the Naxalites. We will put them before the state government for consideration shortly, said Tubid. He, however, refused to comment on what the state governments reaction could be on the issue.         
	After the meeting, Tubid visited rebel-infested Ghurabandha in Ghatshila sub-division, where Layek was reportedly being held by his abductors. DGP Neyaz Ahmed accompanied him.         
	According to intelligence sources, the abduction was executed by CPI(Maoist) Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) at the behest the outlawed outfits Mayurbhanj-Ghurabandha zonal committee.         
	Meanwhile, the Singhbhum-Kolhan unit of Jharkhand State Administrative Services Association has called for a boycott of work from tomorrow till the BDO was released safely. Ranchi district officials also decided not to go to their respective field offices tomorrow.         
	Rakeshji, the CPI(Maoist) spokesperson of Orissa-Bengal-Jharkhand regional border committee, has reportedly told a section of the media that if the government fulfilled their demand (of release of villagers) they would set free the abducted BDO in presence of reporters, intellectuals and human right activists.

	New Delhi, March 8: The furore in Parliament hasnt stirred Sumitra Gagrai yet but she has reason to celebrate womens empowerment on another battlefield  saving the lives of babies.         
	The 28-year-old mother of two girls is the co-ordinator of a self-help programme for women that has dramatically reduced mortality among babies below one year of age across dozens of villages in Jharkhand and Orissa.         
	The programme, led by a non-government and academic consortium, has reduced neonatal mortality in the participating villages by 45 per cent in the past two years. Instead of improving access to doctors or medicines, the programme merely used local women to talk to self-help groups about maternal and newborn care regularly in village meetings.        
	These women have shown us the power of words in saving newborn lives, said Prashant Tripathy, secretary of the non-government Ekjut which conducted the programme in collaboration with institutions in the UK.         
	Research suggested that the reduced neonatal mortality in these villages did not result from more visits to health centres or consultations with health workers but was because of improved levels of hygiene and newborn care practices.         
	There was a move away from harmful practices such as giving birth in unclean environments and delaying breast-feeding, said Anthony Costello, professor at the Institute of Child Health, London, and a member of the team whose findings appear today in the journal The Lancet.         
	Village women selected as facilitators  and supported by Gagrai  visited some 190 villages in West Singhbhum and Keonjhar and talked about the merits of breast-feeding, wrapping the newborn snugly and boiling a blade to cut the placenta.         
	We first ask the self-help groups whether we can join them, then begin by telling stories  real stories  about how someone lost a baby, Gagrai told The Telegraph. After that, we ask them to think about what might have gone wrong.        
	Gagrai, who lives in West Singhbhums Narangabeda village and is a member of Jharkhands indigenous people called Ho, spends up to 10 days a month riding her scooter to neighbouring villages to promote good care practices.         
	Even women who do not attend the self-help meetings learn through their peers. It is crucial that the women were allowed to think through issues and implement solutions on their own, rather than us telling them what to do, said Ekjuts Nirmala Nair.         
	Jharkhands neonatal mortality rate of 49 per 1,000 livebirths and Orissas figure of 45 are far higher than Indias national neonatal mortality estimate of 39. The new study suggests that womens groups could be an alternative to health-worker led actions.         
	The researchers also observed improvements in the mental well-being of the women in the self-help groups. Tripathy said preliminary data also suggests that the poorest and marginalised among women were also benefiting from the village meetings.         
	We believe this is a model for other poor states that lack adequate health services, Tripathy said. Sometimes, one-to-one communication (between health worker and a mother) doesnt seem to work  in such situations, the womens groups will be an alternative method of getting across health messages.

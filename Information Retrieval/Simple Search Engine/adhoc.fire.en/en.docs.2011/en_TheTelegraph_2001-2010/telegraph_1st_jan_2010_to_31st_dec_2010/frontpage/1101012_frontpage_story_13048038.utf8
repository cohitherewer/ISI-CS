  Let us discus a triple delight...
        ARCHIS MOHAN AND ANSHUMAN ROY                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 11: For each of them, it was no more than a kiloweight of metal and wood and plastic. But what Krishna Poonia, Harwant Kaur and Seema Antil flung tonight into the neon-lit haze of the JLN arena was the weight of measly history.        
	Discus after discus after discus whirled into the face of sullied stereotype and dire prophecy until both lay flattened enough to provide easy plinth for a podium India has never ever boarded at an international sporting gala: Gold, Silver, Bronze.        
	Hook, Line, Sinker. Woman. Woman. Woman.         
	In the crazy clamour that followed their unprecedented triumph, someone from a local radio station rushed up and asked each if they would name a favourite number to play. Anjaana-Anjaani, they chortled in unison, the lead track from the Ranbir-Priyanka starrer. The ladies rock.        
	Milkha Singh, that most prided of our athletes, had almost dared Indians to fetch track and field pride ahead of the Games, if only as an invective against the nations sports bureaucracy. These were pieces of metal flung in his face too; he should have been pleased, injury notwithstanding, to be proved wrong tonight as the formidable trio bludgeoned their way into shining annals.        
	In the aftermath of tonights feat, Milkha sounded duly humbled. It is a historic moment for India. I dont think I will live to see three Indians on the podium again. Frankly, I never hoped to see an Indian winning gold in the Commonwealth Games, but this Krishna has proved me wrong.         
	All were way behind the distance women have thrown that disc  76.8 metres by Gabriele Reinsch of the former East Germany is still the record  but it was good enough for tonights rousing glory. Krishna 61.51 metres, Harwant 60.16 metres, Seema 58.46 metres. Between them, they went where no Indian woman has ever been before.        
	Somebody did suggest at the post-performance media conference that their throwing was well below the world record mark, and that the victory was courtesy the absence of current bests in the discipline like Australias Dani Samuels who withdrew from the Games.        
	It was enough to leave the three formidable women snarling. A medal is a medal is a medal. It is irrelevant whether it comes when we throw the discus 60 metres or 65, said Seema who, at 27, is the youngest of the three.        
	Krishna, who had so far allowed her husband and coach Virendra Singh Poonia to field the more tricky questions, took over. There were enough world, Olympic and Commonwealth champions in the field that we three defeated. You need to check your facts, she retorted.        
	Seema was more forthright. Can Sachin score 200 every time he goes out to bat? Next innings, he gets out for a duck. And does anyone remember what was Milkha Singhs time for that run? asked she, hinting that Milkha was much below the world record when he won that gold in the Commonwealth Games.        
	Krishna, Harwant and Seema  women who are tough as nails, women whose path you should not cross before thinking a little more than twice. Krishna stands taller than her husband Virendra, a former hammer thrower. The other two are no pushovers; you only have to look at their biceps.        
	For Krishna, Virendras support has been crucial. Krishna admitted as much, describing how her husband helped her out during her injuries this past one year.        
	When she called up her son, Lakshya Raj, on Monday morning, the 9-year-old had only one wish. Mama, get a gold for me, Lakshya had said from Jaipur where he stays with his grandparents.        
	This evening, mama Krishna did just that.        
	The 28-year-old discus thrower blazed her way into the books by becoming the first Indian woman to win a track and field gold for India in the Commonwealth Games. Krishna is also the first athlete to win a field gold since Milkha Singhs triumph in the 1958 Cardiff Games.                    
	So, when was the last time India had a clean sweep in athletics? Desperate searches on Google did not yield any result. Then veteran Bahadur Singh Sr bailed the scribes out. India last won all three in the 1973 Asian track and field meet in Manila. Shotputter Jugraj Singh won gold, Gurdeep Singh silver and Bahadur himself the bronze.        
	As a near-capacity stadium stood up for the national anthem, an Indian trio took the podium. I had goosebumps. I cant tell you how I am feeling, Krishna said.        
	Krishnas career started in college in Hisar in the late 90s and then she was out of circulation for three years because of injury. Her son has been staying with her in-laws in Jaipur since he was one and a half, and all the sacrifices have finally yielded result.         
	Last two years, I was training in the US and hardly spent time with my son. Can you imagine what myself and my son must have gone through? she asked. Even today he could not come as his exams are going on, she said.        
	Krishna, who won the gold for her first throw with 61.51, said she was not sure whether her knee would hold up. I felt a jerk. So I was a bit apprehensive about the next throws. Also, I had a back injury, so you know that thing was working at the back of my mind.        
	Seemas medal is the second she has won in the Commonwealth Games. In Melbourne, the discus thrower won a silver. Two medals in two Commonwealth Games is not bad, huh? Seema said. We have shown what we can do. I would like to thank the crowd. They were simply amazing.        
	Harwant agreed her throw was not her best. But I am happy to win the silver, the 30-year-old athlete said.        
	Krishna was a tad upset when asked if the pullout by Dani Samuels helped. Thats the problem with us. Every time we do something well, there will be people looking for negative things.        
	True. Today was about her and her teammates sweep.        
	As Virendra said: Lets talk good things about them today. We will surely see them on the podium during the Asian Games in November.        
	Tall task. But way to go, ladies.

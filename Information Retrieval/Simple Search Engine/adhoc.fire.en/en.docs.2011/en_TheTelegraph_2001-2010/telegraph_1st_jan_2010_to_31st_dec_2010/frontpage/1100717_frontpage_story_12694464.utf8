The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Scandalous label on test criteria of premier science school 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Scandalous label on test criteria of premier science school 
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, July 16: New rules adopted by the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER) this year may have prevented thousands of high-ranking students from even applying for admission, two university professors have said.        
	The IISERs  premier science education institutions in Calcutta, Bhopal, Mohali, Pune and Thiruvananthapuram  offer a five-year integrated masters programme for students who have completed the Class XII exam.        
	But two senior academics have said the IISERs introduced flawed criteria for applications this year that turned the application process into a gamble with luck rather than merit dictating whether students could apply.        
	The IISERs have until now taken in students who qualify in the IIT Joint Entrance Examination or a Young Scientists Scholarship Scheme run by the department of science and technology (DST). This year, the IISERs have opened a third door that allows students to apply on the basis of their Class XII board exam scores. The IISERs will screen these applicants through a test on Sunday.        
	But the IISERs used the top 1 per cent scores from the 2009 board exams, separately for each board, as cut-offs for applications this year instead of scores from the 2010 exams. Nor do the cut-offs distinguish between arts, commerce and science.         
	The critics say year-to-year score fluctuations within school boards may provide some students an unfair advantage and eliminate others from applying because of the differences between the highest scores in 2009 and 2010.         
	What theyve done defies logic  any Class XII student will see this injustice, said Ashwini Nangia, a professor of chemistry at the University of Hyderabad, who had alerted the IISERs about these problems in mid-May.        
	The merged cut-offs could mean that commerce students  who are not eligible to apply to the IISERs at all  who score higher than science students and fall within the 1 per cent category would squeeze science students out.        
	This is scandalous  a top science student may not be able to apply in 2010 because a commerce student scored more marks, said Charanjit Aulakh, a physics professor at Panjab University, Chandigarh.        
	Both Aulakh and Nangia said they had delved into the IISERs application procedure this year as concerned parents. Each has a daughter who has graduated from the Class XII science stream this year.         
	Nangia has tabulated the Class XII results from 2007, 2008, and 2009 across 29 school boards in India and shown that the top 1 per cent scores may shift upwards or downwards by up to 5 per cent.        
	Boards where the highest 2010 marks are higher than the cut-offs from 2009 will allow more students to apply, he said. Any board where the highest marks in 2010 are lower than the cut-off from 2009 will have no students eligible to apply.        
	The Joint Admissions Committee at the IISER said it had used 2009 scores because 2010 scores were not available from school boards. The DST has compiled scores up to 2009.        
	We wrote to a few boards when the 2010 results started coming out to find out about the top one per cent cut-off marks. But most boards did not bother to reply, Swapan Datta, the JAC chairman at IISER Calcutta, said.        
	Datta said the use of a relatively low score such as 60 per cent as cut-off could have swamped the IISERs with tens of thousands of applications. A higher score such as 85 per cent as cut-off could have eliminated all students from certain boards where the highest marks are below that figure. Some state boards have their highest marks in the 70s or low 80s.        
	Our policy gives us representations from all boards, Datta said. There may be other solutions  but we thought this was the best, he said, adding that the rules might be changed next year.        
	Datta said the clubbing of arts, commerce and science streams for cut-offs should not affect science students unless commerce students score higher and fall within the 1 per cent cut-off.        
	Then the science student gets squeezed out, Datta conceded. But our experience is that science students almost always score more marks in the boards.        
	The IISERs have received 900 applications on the basis of Class XII scores for about 300 seats. This is pitifully low  much below initial IISER hopes for 5000 applicants, said Aulakh who is an adjunct faculty member at IISER, Mohali.        
	Both Aulakh and Nangia have said they hope to analyse the IISERs admissions patterns this year  after the DST has compiled the 2010 board marks  and show that their concerns were justified.

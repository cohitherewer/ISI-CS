	Jaipur, Oct. 23: American singer Katy Perry and British comedian Russell Brand got married in a Hindu ceremony tonight on the edge of the Ranthambhore tiger reserve.         
	The bride and the groom, both wearing mehndi as is the custom in Rajasthani weddings, went around the sacred fire as a priest chanted the mantras at Aman-i-Khas, a tented resort that has been turned into a fortress with three-tier security.         
	Folk musicians and snake charmers were at hand to entertain the couples 85 guests, who included singer Rihanna, a close friend of Perry, and rapper P. Diddy. Diddy was expected to perform with Bharatnatyam dancers. Rihanna, the maid of honour, too was due to perform at the wedding.         
	The couple, who had got engaged in Jaipurs Rambagh Palace on New Years Eve, had booked the resorts 10 luxury tents and rooms at the nearby Vanyavilas, run by the Oberoi group, and the Sher Bagh tented camp for their families and friends.         
	The guests are being given a taste of India during the four-day celebrations  tiger safaris in the morning and song and dance, including a performance of the traditional Ghoomar and Kalbeliya dances, in the evening. The couple have hired 13 jeeps and canters for the park safari, sources said.         
	Baajre ki roti, sarson ka saag, gur and rabri added the Indian flavour to the primarily continental wedding feast.         
	Security was tight, with no visitor being allowed into any of the three resorts without verification. Brands guards allegedly beat up a photographer who had managed to track down his guests on a tiger safari yesterday. The traditional mehndi design on the grooms hand was spotted when he was on the tiger safari, sources said.         
	Not even a peep was allowed into the venue, lit up with lamps and colourful lights, where the groom arrived on a horse, escorted by elephants and camels. Brand, 35, was to be turned out in sherwani and churidar, and Perry, 25, in an Indian-themed wedding dress by Lebanese designer Reem Acra.         
	When the couple got engaged, Perry had posted a picture of her mehndi on Twitter, saying Jesus.. I am typing with this one hand... Isnt it lovely? Its Henna!         
	Aman-i-Khas, where the couple are staying, borders the national park 145km from Jaipur that is home to 34 adult tigers, apart from leopards, wild boars and hyenas. So, no loud music or fireworks, forest officials have told them.

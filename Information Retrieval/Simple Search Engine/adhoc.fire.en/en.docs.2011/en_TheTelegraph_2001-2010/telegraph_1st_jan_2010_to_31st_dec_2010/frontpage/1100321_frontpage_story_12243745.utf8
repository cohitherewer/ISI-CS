The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Headleys right to silence
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Headleys right to silence
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, March 20: The guilty plea by terrorist enabler David Coleman Headley in principle allows Indian courts to seek his deposition by video in the trial of Ajmal Kasab, but it also allows the American to refuse to testify or to remain silent after he has sworn as a witness to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.        
	The fine print of Headleys plea agreement which was filed before Illinois district court judge Harry Leinenweber on Thursday says: At a trial, defendant (Headley) would have a privilege against self-incrimination so that he could decline to testify and no inference of guilt could be drawn from his refusal to testify.        
	The same principle applies to any interrogation of Headley by Indian officials on American soil. Under US law, the voluntary presence of an accused during interrogation on a crime or as a witness  either voluntarily or under subpoena  in a criminal trial is deemed as co-operation.        
	However, as part of such co-operation, Headley could repeatedly respond to any question either from an Indian judge or lawyer at Kasabs trial or from Indian officials across the table with the standard answer: On the advice of my lawyer, I respectfully invoke the Fifth Amendment and say no further in the matter or any variation of the same answer accepted under law.        
	The Fifth Amendment, sacrosanct to every American citizen, guarantees the right to everyone  including non-citizens  during any proceeding of a judicial or law enforcement nature on US soil that no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime... nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.        
	The Fifth Amendment was built into the US Constitution to protect people against the abuse of authority in any legal procedure in America.        
	Many Indians recently became familiar with the Fifth Amendment when the Salahi couple, who intruded into the White House state dinner for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last November, appeared at a US Congressional hearing and took refuge in the amendment in their answers to every single question.        
	At one point, a frustrated Congressman asked Tareq Salahi if he wore a tuxedo to the state dinner. Another asked if Salahi was present at the White House during Singhs visit.        
	His separate answers to both questions were that on the advice of his lawyer, he was invoking the Fifth Amendment.        
	Home secretary G.K. Pillai was out of his depth when he claimed yesterday that if there are other offences, which are not covered under the plea agreement, then, of course, extradition is still possible.        
	Headleys plea agreement says that he cannot be extradited to India, Pakistan or Denmark after he is convicted of the various terrorist charges now before the court, including conduct within the scope of those offences for which he has been convicted.        
	Pillai claimed yesterday in support of the continued pipe dreams in the ministry that there are other charges, which do not come under the 12 counts and that there was a basis for David Coleman Headleys extradition on those charges.        
	But by putting in his plea bargain not only the offences for which the American has been charged but also conduct within the scope of those offences as the basis for ruling out extradition, Headley has secured absolute and complete protection against any Indian efforts to get him to Mumbai.        
	Having gone along with the false premise that the US will look after Indias interests  and not solely and vigorously guard its interests alone in this case  the Union home ministry now appears to be engaged in an exercise of deluding itself to justify its policies since the beginning of Headleys arrest.        
	It is clear from Headleys indictment files in Chicago that what the Americans are most exercised about in this case is that the accused aided and abetted the murders of six US citizens who died in the course of the Mumbai attacks. Everything else is secondary.        
	It had been absolute US policy till the September 11 attacks that it considered terrorism as terrorism only when American interests were threatened. Washington has consistently had double standards on terrorism in cases where no American lives, property or interests are involved.        
	Perhaps the most insulting aspect of the plea agreement is that it has quantified the loss from Headleys activities and put it at a mere $1.5 million, subjecting him to a total maximum fine of $3,000,000 ($3 million) twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the offences of conviction, whichever is greater.        
	Having avoided the death penalty, Headley may well be chuckling over another clause in the plea agreement that lets him enjoy a period of supervised release notwithstanding the number of years he is sentenced to after pleading guilty.        
	It may also have been lost on the Union home ministry that India does not have unlimited time to complete the letters rogatory for interrogating Headley or getting him to depose in a trial in Mumbai through videoconferencing.        
	The plea agreement says Headley will be sentenced only after he completes his co-operation with foreign countries, such as India. But no judge in the US will wait, unlike in India with its huge backlog of court cases, and justice delayed is considered here as justice denied.        
	In the past, India has been unable to lay its hands on those it wanted, such as Dawood Ibrahims brother Anees in Bahrain, for instance, because the letters rogatory could not be prepared in time.        
	There have been only three instances in Indias history when the authorities in North Block have been able to successfully extradite anyone to India: Om Prakash Babloo Srivastava from Singapore, Niranjan Shah from Dubai and the Abu Salem-Monica Bedi duo from Lisbon.

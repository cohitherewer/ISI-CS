	New Delhi, Oct 5 (PTI): West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today met Home Minister P Chidambaram and discussed with him the security situation in the state ahead of the Assembly elections early next year.
    During the 30-minute meeting, Chidambaram and Bhattacharjee are believed to have discussed Trinamool Congress' demand for withdrawal of joint forces from Maoist-hit Jangal Mahal area.
    Both the leaders are understood to have discussed the ongoing operation against the Maoists, sources said.
    The chief minister has been strongly backing the joint anti-Naxal operation launched by the Central and state forces in Maoist-dominated areas of West Bengal.
    The ongoing talks with Gorkha Jan Mukti Morcha, which has been spearheading a movement on the demand for a separate Gorkha land comprising Darjeeling and some adjoining areas, also figured in the meeting.

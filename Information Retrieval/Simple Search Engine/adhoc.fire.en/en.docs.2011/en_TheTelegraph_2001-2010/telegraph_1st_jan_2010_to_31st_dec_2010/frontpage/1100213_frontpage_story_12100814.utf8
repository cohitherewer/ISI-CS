	New Delhi, Feb. 12: The capitals countdown to the Commonwealth Games has run into a Rs 11-crore bump.        
	The widow of a man who had once served as former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees private secretary and reportedly survived a plane accident in the 1970s has demanded a Rs 11-crore compensation for his death. The 77-year-old died after falling into a manhole left open during renovation work for the October Games.        
	Delhi High Court has issued notices to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), the Indian Olympic Association and the organising committee of the Games asking them to respond by March 10 to the claim.        
	The claim was made in a public interest petition filed by an NGO on behalf of Trilok Nath Makens widow, Jai Rani.        
	The petition demanded Rs 1 crore as compensation and the rest as punitive damages to the widow of Maken. He fell into the pit, allegedly left uncovered by an MCD contractor installing new streetlights, outside his home in south Delhis Malviya Nagar on August 28 last year.         
	The NGO alleged that the MCD and other authorities had failed to discharge their duties as the manhole had been left uncovered without any warning signs for pedestrians or a barricade. To make matters worse, the area was dark because power had been turned off while the streetlights were being installed.        
	While the work was being carried out by the civic body, the Games organising committee and the Olympic association had a supervisory role as the renovation job was part of the city beautification drive for the sporting event.        
	Maken had stepped out to buy groceries from shops near his home when he fell into the manhole. He did not survive the fall, probably losing consciousness immediately and, therefore, was unable to use his cellphone and seek help. He used to suffer from a chronic cervical problem.         
	The autopsy report had suggested that he died because of the fall. His body had bruises on the head, neck and the left temple. Maken was one of the 17 survivors after a plane with 65 passengers hit power cables while landing and caught fire in May 1973.        
	Moving the petition before a division bench of Chief Justice A.P. Shah and Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw earlier this week, the counsel for the NGO, Criminal Justice Society, said there were several such death traps across the capital but officials had done little to address the problem.        
	The NGO pointed out that in Makens case, Delhi police had registered a case of death due to negligence, but no strong action had been taken so far against senior officials of the MCD except for the suspension of an assistant engineer.

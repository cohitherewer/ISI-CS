The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Email pointer to Times Square bid

          ANDREA ELLIOTT, SABRINA TAVERNISE AND ANNE BARNARD                             Faisal Shahzad                                  
	New York, May 16: Just after midnight on February 25, 2006, Faisal Shahzad sent a lengthy email message to a group of friends. The trials of his fellow Muslims weighed on him  the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the plight of Palestinians, the publication in Denmark of cartoons lampooning the Prophet Muhammad.         
	Shahzad was wrestling with how to respond. He understood the notion that Islam forbids the killing of innocents, he wrote. But to those who insist only on peaceful protest, he posed a question: Can you tell me a way to save the oppressed? And a way to fight back when rockets are fired at us and Muslim blood flows?         
	Everyone knows how the Muslim country bows down to pressure from west. Everyone knows the kind of humiliation we are faced with around the globe.         
	Yet by some measures, Shahzad  a Pakistani immigrant who was then 26 years old  seemed to be thriving in the West. He worked as a financial analyst at Elizabeth Arden, the global cosmetics firm. He had just received his green card, making him a legal resident in the US. He owned a gleaming new house in Shelton, Connecticut. His Pakistani-American wife would soon become pregnant with their first child, whom they named Alisheba, or beautiful sunshine.         
	Four years later, Shahzad stands accused of planting a car bomb in Times Square on a balmy spring evening. After his arrest two days later, on May 3, while trying to flee to Dubai, the few details that surfaced about his life echoed a familiar narrative about radicalisation in the West: his anger toward his adopted country seemed to have grown in lockstep with his personal struggles. He had lost his home to foreclosure last year. At the same time he was showing signs of a profound, religiously infused alienation.         
	But the roots of Shahzads militancy appear to have sprouted long before, according to interviews with relatives, friends, classmates, neighbours, colleagues and government officials, as well as email messages written by Shahzad that were obtained by The New York Times. His argument with American foreign policy grew after 9/11, even as he enjoyed Americas financial promise and expansive culture. He balanced these duelling emotions with an agility common among his Pakistani friends.         
	As Shahzad became more religious, starting around 2006, he was also turning away from the Pakistan of his youth, friends recalled, distancing himself from the liberal, elite world of his father, Bahar ul-Haq, a retired vice marshal in the Pakistani Air Force.         
	And while in recent years Shahzad struggled to pay his bills, it is unclear that his financial hardship played a significant role in his radicalisation. He still owned his home and held a full-time job when he began signalling to friends that he wanted to leave the US.

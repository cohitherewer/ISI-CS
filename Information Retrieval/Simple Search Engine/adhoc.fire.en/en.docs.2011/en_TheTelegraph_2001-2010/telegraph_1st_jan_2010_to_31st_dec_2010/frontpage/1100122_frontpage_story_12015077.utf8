The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Famous four come under deemed glare
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Famous four come under deemed glare
  - Some no longer keen on the label          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                     
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: A law institute headed by the Chief Justice of India, a renowned yoga institute, Bal Gangadhar Tilaks alma mater and Indias premier theatre school risk losing deemed university status despite not figuring among 44 blacklisted institutions.        
	The National School of Drama and the Indian Law Institute  both based in Delhi -- Punes Deccan College and Mungers Bihar Yoga Bharati face government action for not participating fully in a review of deemed universities, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The deemed varsity status of these institutions hangs in the balance because they did not turn up for presentations and cross-questioning despite being issued notices, sources involved with the probe said.        
	Notices for the presentation and cross-questioning sessions followed a detailed questionnaire the review panel sent to all 130 deemed universities across India.        
	The ILI and Deccan College both claimed not to have received notices for the presentation and cross-questioning sessions. The ILI did not respond to the questionnaire.        
	The Bihar Yoga Bharati is understood to have internally agreed to concede deemed university status and may seek affiliation from a state university.        
	The NSD said it did not want deemed university status any more after a committee it constituted recommended that the label was not in the best interest of the institution. This recommendation was communicated to the culture ministry -- the nodal ministry for the institution -- NSD director Anuradha Kapur said.         
	But officials at the culture ministry and the University Grants Commission confirmed that the NSD remained a deemed university.        
	There is an ongoing discussion within the government on what is best for the NSD. But the NSD is, as of today, very much a deemed university, an official said.        
	All 126 deemed universities other than the four responded to the questionnaire as well as participated in the presentation and grilling session of the review initiated last year by human resource development minister Kapil Sibal.        
	The 126 institutions that participated have been divided by the review panel into three categories -- 44 that are unfit for the deemed tag, another 44 that have three years to justify the tag, and 38 that are completely fit.        
	Sources on the review panel dismissed claims that any of the 130 deemed universities could not have received notices on the probe, or could have been unaware of the HRD ministry review. The institutions are likely to be asked first to explain their absence from the face-to-face interaction sessions where they were to argue in favour of retaining their deemed status before the review panel.        
	A second opportunity to present their work before the review panel, and to face up to cross-questioning, is also not being ruled out.        
	But the review team may insist on strict implementation of its findings that only those institutions it reviewed and found fit be allowed to continue as deemed universities.        
	Sources clarified that they have no reason -- apart from the abstention from the review -- to doubt the ability of these institutions as colleges or centres imparting quality education.        
	But, like in the case of Bangalores Christ College -- a deemed varsity listed among the 44 blacklisted institutions -- an excellent college or institute need not be suited to act as a university, they said. Universities are expected to focus on research rather than on undergraduate education at a handful of constituent institutions.        
	We have no intention of escaping from any review. We just did not receive the notices, Dalip Kumar, the ILI registrar, said.        
	V.P, Bhatta, the vice-chancellor of the Deccan College Postgraduate and Research Institute, blamed faulty telephone lines at the college for lack of adequate communication with the government on the review.        
	We replied to the questionnaire but did not receive any notice for the presentation and cross-questioning. Poor communication, probably because of poor telephone connectivity here, is responsible, Bhatta said, echoing the ILI version that his institution had no desire to avoid the review.         
	One of Indias oldest institutions of modern learning, Deccan College was established in 1821 and was affiliated to Pune University till 1990 when it was granted deemed university status.        
	Bihar Yoga Bharati, it is learnt, is likely to concede its deemed university status without subjecting itself to a review.        
	We do not expect to be allowed to continue as a deemed university and are likely to seek affiliation to a Bihar state university, a senior official at the institution said, requesting anonymity.        
	The NSD is the alma mater of actors Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and Seema Biswas among others.

	Mumbai, Sep 28 (PTI): Maharashtra Government today submitted to the Bombay High Court a CCTV footage of Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab assaulting jail staff and opposed his plea for a closed-door interview with his lawyers.
    The high court is hearing confirmation of death sentence awarded to Kasab for his role in the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai in which 166 people were killed.
    The Government counsel Ujjwal Nikam presented the CCTV footage to a bench headed by Justice Ranjana Desai which will view the CD in chambers this evening and pronounce an order tomorrow on Kasab's plea for a legal interview within the sight of security staff but not within hearing distance.
    Nikam told the judges, "The incident occurred on September 1 when Kasab was performing some illegal act and jail staff had to intervene. He (Kasab) assaulted prison officials which is clearly shown in the CD.

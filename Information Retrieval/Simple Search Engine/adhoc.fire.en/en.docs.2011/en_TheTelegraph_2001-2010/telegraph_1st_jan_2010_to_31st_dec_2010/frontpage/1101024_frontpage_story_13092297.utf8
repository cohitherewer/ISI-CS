The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blackout over power dues
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Blackout over power dues
          ARUN KUMAR THAKUR                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 23: As if the uncertainty surrounding the 34th National Games wasnt enough, the headquarters of the jinxed sports extravaganza has been in darkness for over six months because of unpaid electricity bills worth over Rs 4 lakh.        
	Whats worse, the National Games Organising Committee believes it is the state governments responsibility to clear the dues and keep its Morabadi headquarters well lit, even as the state sports department maintains NGOC was a registered body that has to take care of its own commitments.        
	Apart from the NGOC headquarters, the Morabadi cluster houses offices of Jharkhand State Sports Authority, Jharkhand Kala Kendra and Jharkhand Olympic Association.         
	The state sports departments office is also there at the astro-turf complex.        
	However, it is only the NGOC office that is without regular power supply. According to the staff, it manages with a generator thats used when senior officials like the organising secretary or treasurer drop in.        
	NGOC organising secretary S.M. Hashmi said electricity supply had not been disconnected. There must be some local fault that may have caused disruption of power supply. It will be set it right in a day or two, he maintained.        
	As for Jharkhand State Electricity Boards dues, Hashmi claimed the onus of clearing it was on the state government.        
	But, the department of sports countered the NGOCs claims. The NGOC is a registered body and the government has allotted funds to it. The director (sports) is but an ex-officio office-bearer in NGOC. Hence, what is due and what is not is the NGOCs concern, said a spokesperson at the office of the sports director, Anurag Gupta.         
	To explain his stand, he cited the recent instance at the Mega Sports Complex, Hotwar, where JSEB had disconnected supply on October 1 due to unpaid dues. The Mega Sports Complex is under us (the sports department). So, we paid the electricity dues and got the supply restored (after three to four days), he said.        
	NGOC needs to act fast. For, the state government and Jharkhand Olympic Association have written to Indian Olympic Association for fresh dates in January-February 2011 for holding the National Games which has been postponed six times already.        
	If the IOA committee gives a date in January-February, as requested by the state, then the NGOC office will have to start working full time. A generator wont suffice, said a senior functionary who admitted spending little time at the office now because of the power problem.

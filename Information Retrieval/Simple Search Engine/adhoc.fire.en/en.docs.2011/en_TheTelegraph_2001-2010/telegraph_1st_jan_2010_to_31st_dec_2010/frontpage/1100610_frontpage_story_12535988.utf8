The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Drive to catch freshers
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Drive to catch freshers
          SUBHAJOY ROY                            An e-camp at Presidency College. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	All three major parties in the city have turned towards campuses as the admission season gets underway and the civic poll heat starts dying down.        
	The student wings of the parties are missing no opportunity to extend a helping hand to admission seekers in an attempt to swell their ranks.         
	And technology has emerged as the most favoured tool of all camps in their drive to reach out to students.        
	This is the time when you make acquaintance with freshers. They will remember the faces who have helped them during admission, making it easier for us to seek their support later, said an SFI leader.        
	The CPM student wing is running a helpline  22652543  to answer admission-related queries. The helpline is open between 11am and 6pm. We are receiving 1,500 calls a day from across the state, said an activist.        
	The SFI unit in the arts faculty of Jadavpur University has created a website  www.juartssfi.co.cc  which has the numbers of many students. Applicants are free to get in touch with them and know admission details, said an SFI leader from JU.        
	The Trinamul Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) has set up an e-camp on the Presidency College campus to help admission-seekers with online submission of forms.        
	We have installed four computers with Internet connection to help students download or fill up the forms, said Shanku Deb Panda, a TMCP leader. There are many who dont know that Presidency forms have to be filled up and submitted online.        
	The TMCP plans to set up such e-camps in other colleges, too. The organisation has also created an email ID, tmcpstudentshelplinegmail.com, to answer admission queries.        
	For the first time, we are also opening help desks during the JEE counselling. The desks will be manned by students from Calcutta Medical College and Hospital and Jadavpur University, said Panda.        
	The Congress-backed Chhatra Parishad, too, has come up with a helpline  8001404614  which is functional from 3pm to 6pm. Students can also send their queries to wbscphotmail.com and wbstatechhatraparishadgmail.com, said Chhatra Parishad state chief Sourav Chakrbarty.

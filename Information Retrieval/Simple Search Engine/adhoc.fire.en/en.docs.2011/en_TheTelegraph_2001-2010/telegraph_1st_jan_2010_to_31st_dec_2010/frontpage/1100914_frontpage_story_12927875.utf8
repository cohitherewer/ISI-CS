	Fluency in spoken English is a ticket to opportunities in India and the British Council has been providing this ticket through its English Language Teaching Centres in various cities. The centre in Calcutta, which was launched by governor M.K. Narayanan on Saturday, will operate from a new building on the premises of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.        
	Lauding the councils activities in India, the governor said: Teaching English to 700,000 students is a great endeavour. One of the good things that the British did for us is give us English. Now, the two countries are joined by a language. It is heartening to see that the British Council and the British high commission, which had cut down their initiatives in India in the Sixties, are returning today with renewed interest.         
	The council, in the country since 1948, has been partnering the central and state governments and also private corporations for the past three years in Project English, said Ruth Gee, regional director (India and Sri Lanka), British Council Division.        
	Since 2003, we have been working with the West Bengal government on English curriculum reform. We have developed content for TataSky Learning System, which has 7 lakh subscribers, added Gee.        
	The council is also developing material for the HRD ministry and involved in coaching master trainers to spread the learning of the language in India.         
	The centre in Calcutta, the first such off-site facility in the world, will offer language courses for professional and personal development tailored to the needs of Indian learners. It is equipped to teach 600 adult students per term and has 15 locally appointed teachers and an academic manager from the UK, Kristian Dines.        
	Sujata Sen, head, British Council (East), said: In 2003, we shifted from our Shakespeare Sarani address, where we had been for 48 years. That was a watershed year for us. And today we are again opening a centre outside our Camac Street premises.         
	The programme on Saturday ended with a recital by flautist Kate Grace.

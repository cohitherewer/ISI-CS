	Melbourne, Sep 20 (PTI): Australian government today warned of a "high risk of terrorist attack in New Delhi", even as it updated its travel advice for its nationals in the wake of the firing on tourists outside Jama Masjid Mosque in the Indian capital.
    Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) said there is now a "high risk of a terrorist attack" in New Delhi, as the Indian capital prepares for the Commonwealth Games scheduled to start on October 3.
    It said Australians should pay close attention to their personal security at all times.
    According to ABC report, the family of Australian swimmer Nick D'Arcy will travel to Delhi for next month's games despite the security fears.
    The authors of a security risk assessment said there was an 80 per cent chance the games will come under some form of attack from terrorists.

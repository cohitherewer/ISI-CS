  -  Assaulted reporter returns to armed-camp terrain in the guise of a mechanic
                          Armed CPM cadres watch as a party rally approaches Chandri village, on the way to Amjhore, on Thursday		                      
	Dec.3: Three months ago to this date, The Telegraphs principal correspondent PRONAB MONDAL had his left hand shattered by an iron rod wielded by a CPM goon in Buripal village in Lalgarh when he had gone looking for armed party camps in areas recaptured by cadres.         
	Mondals cellphone was snatched, never to be returned, he was threatened with dire consequences if he ever dared to return.        
	In the aftermath of reports on the attack, three lower-rung CPM activists were arrested. They are still behind bars. But the leaders of the group of CPM cadres that attacked Mondal and six other journalists are still roaming free, openly leading processions in the villages of Lalgarh.        
	On Thursday, after recovering from a surgery on his left arm, Mondal returned to Lalgarh, this time to Amjhore village about 20km from Buripal.        
	 But he did not go as a journalist; he went in the guise of a generator mechanic. The armed camps he found here were more menacing than the fortified one he had seen in Buripal three months ago. His account:              
	Stop! Dont move forward!        
	As our motorcycle ground to a halt, five young men, all in jeans and T-shirts, stepped forward and blocked the dirt road.         
	The bulge under their T-shirts, so familiar in Maoist-dominated Jungle Mahal, made it clear they had pistols tucked under their belts.         
	They looked at us suspiciously. We would soon realise that the group was an advance team of CPM cadres that had been deployed to throw a security ring around the area where the party had set up armed camps to thwart attacks by the Maoists.        
	Who are you? Where are you going? one of them asked.        
	My generator-supplier friend, who was riding the bike, and I, in the guise of his mechanic, had set out from Jhargram over an hour ago.        
	Our first stop was Amjhore, still 4km beyond the spot where we had been stopped.        
	We are coming from Midnapore town, lied my generator-supplier friend. We are going to a nearby joint forces camp to inspect some generators there. My mechanic is riding pillion.        
	The youths warily eyed the bag slung across my shoulder. What is inside that bag?        
	I cautiously lowered the bag to the ground. The memory of the beating I had suffered at their hands was still raw and I was taking no chances: the nagging pain in my left arm where a metal plate had been inserted to keep the broken bones in place was a constant reminder.        
	Please come and take a look, I said, slowly opening the bag. There are only some tools to repair the generator set.        
	Two of the youths came forward to inspect the bags contents and, assured that I was telling the truth, waved us through. That my friend was a familiar face in the area may have helped, but that did not stop the youths from barking a warning at us: Dont try any tricks, or you wont return alive.        
	Along the 4km stretch to Amjhore, my friend narrated how about four months ago armed cadres, many of them from outside, with the backing of the joint forces, had recaptured this area, about 30km from Lalgarh town.        
	Even as my friend was recounting the recapture, we came across a makeshift bamboo barricade across the road.        
	It was clearly the gateway to CPM country: red flags were fluttering all over and armed men, many of them with gamchchas shrouding their faces, were diligently checking anyone proceeding any further.        
	Once again my friend told them the story of going to the joint forces camp to repair generators and once again my bag was checked.        
	Then, we were on our way to Amjhore again.        
	We had barely proceeded a kilometre or so when we came across a CPM armed camp: it was the primary school in Kesia village, all decked up with red flags and fortified with sand bags. Around it were bunkers with armed party cadres on duty.        
	Thereafter, all along the 2km road to Amjhore, red flags were fluttering. Another familiar sight: CPM cadres with pistols tucked into their waist belt.        
	At Amjhore, the primary school-turned-CPM camp was similar to the one in Kesia, with the exception that it was ringed by six powerful halogen lights, powered by generators. Six bunkers manned by armed cadres provided additional fortification.        
	This was one of the bigger strongholds of the Maoists as this is one of the bigger villages in the area, explained a man. This is why it is more fortified.        
	A police office later said 86 villages in the area had been recaptured from the Maoists and all of them had fortified CPM camps.         
	At least 150 generator sets have been pressed into service to illuminate the recaptured villages which consume more than 2,000 litres of fuel every day, said a police officer. Most of these armed camps are guarded with Insas and AK-47 rifles.        
	Awed, I requested my friend to quickly return to Jhargram before my real identity got disclosed.         
	I did not want to return to my hospital bed in Calcutta again.

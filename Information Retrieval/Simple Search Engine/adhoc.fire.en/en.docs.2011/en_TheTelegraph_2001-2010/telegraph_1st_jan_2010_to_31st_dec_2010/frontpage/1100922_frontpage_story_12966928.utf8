  Bridge collapse deepens shame          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              The collapsed footbridge (on the ground in front of the crane) in the parking space of the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium (circular frame in the background) in New Delhi on Tuesday.

	New Delhi, Sept. 21: A showpiece hanging footbridge being built outside the main Commonwealth Games venue crashed this afternoon, injuring 27 people and leaving the organisers redder in the face after an eruption of controversies.        
	The collapse of the 90-metre footbridge, which was to connect the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium with the new parking lot for athletes and their families near the stadiums Gate No. 4, is the second mishap in two days, a canopy erected at the stadium falling yesterday and injuring two policemen.        
	The incident happened on a day international officials termed the Games Village filthy and unliveable and bluntly told the organisers to sort out the mess within 24 hours.         
	The Australian advance team found the premises so dirty that they hired the services of a professional housekeeping agency that serves its high commission in Delhi to deep clean the flats. Officials of many countries have decided to stay in five-star hotels in the capital for the time being.        
	With only 12 days to go for the October 3 start of the Games, over 30 labourers were putting a mix of concrete on a section of the bridge in south Delhi when it gave way around 3.20pm. Of the 27 injured outside the stadium, where the opening and closing ceremonies are scheduled, five are critical, PWD minister Raj Kumar Chauhan said.        
	We are not sure whether some labourers are still trapped under the debris. This can be ascertained only after the debris is removed, H.G.S. Dhaliwal, deputy commissioner (south), said.        
	A Delhi government source said the overbridge was being built at a cost of Rs 10 crore by a Chandigarh-based company, PNR Infrastructure Ltd, which had been awarded the contract by the public works department. The agency which was awarded the contract has been blacklisted, chief secretary Rakesh Mehta said.        
	An official said the firm had been set a September 25 deadline to finish construction and the mishap may have resulted from the pressure to work as fast as possible. Construction of the footbridge started one and a half months ago and the agency was given the deadline to complete it by September 25.        
	According to the official, the plan had been to allow participants, their families and other VVIPs living in the Games Village 12km away to use the footbridge to enter the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium after leaving their vehicles in the new parking lot.        
	Bhupinder Paswan, a labourer working inside the stadium, said: For a moment, we thought it was an earthquake because the stadium walls shook.        
	Rakesh, another labourer from Bihar, added: We came out and saw labourers lying on the ground and writhing in pain. The hands and legs of some of them were broken.        
	Rakesh Mishra, PWD chief engineer, said there might have been a fault with the bridge design. A case of negligence has been registered at Lodhi Road police station.        
	Union minister Jaipal Reddy, who heads the group of ministers on the Games, referred to the heavy rain for the past 20 days but officials said weather was unlikely to have been a factor in the collapse.

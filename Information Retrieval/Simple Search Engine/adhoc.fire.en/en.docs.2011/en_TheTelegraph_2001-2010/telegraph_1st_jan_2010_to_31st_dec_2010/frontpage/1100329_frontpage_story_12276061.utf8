The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pradeep Yadav, the Opp. trump card
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pradeep Yadav, the Opp. trump card
          AMIT GUPTA                            OPPOSITION LEADER BY RIGHT: Pradeep Kumar Yadav (46) is an honours graduate (chemistry) from SP College Dumka. He did his BEd from Benaras Hindu University, before joining politics as a student leader in the 90s                                  
	Ranchi, March 28: The designated leader of the Opposition may have been the Congresss Rajendra Prasad Singh, but it was JVM(P)s Pradeep Kumar Yadavs probing questions that put the new government on the mat repeatedly during the month-long budget session.        
	Singh appeared distinctly timid in the face of Yadavs energy and constructive criticism that compelled the JMM-BJP-Ajsu government to go on the defensive with Speaker C.P. Singh often setting him up as an example for other MLAs.        
	I try to get to the bottom of everything. Before and during the budget session, I met several bureaucrats to assess levels of implementation of government schemes. This helped me a lot, Yadav, a three-time MLA, told The Telegraph.         
	When the session started in the last week of February, it was quite apparent that the combined Opposition of JVM (P), Congress, RJD and the Left was divided. But as days passed, the Opposition emerged stronger, thanks to Yadavs informed grilling of ministers and even the chief minister.        
	His question on the mysterious death of a 13-year-old girl, led to the suspension of a police officer at whose residence in Patna the girl was working as a domestic help. Also, his persistence in seeking action against Bundu SDPO Anand Joseph Tigga for having assaulted a bank official of Bihar led to his punishment transfer yesterday.        
	Yadav also dared to question Shibu Soren on his indecision on contesting Assembly elections, leading to a furore in the House with the Opposition finally extracting a comment from the chief minister who said he would come to a decision soon.        
	Yadavs other quality of note was his eagerness to help out ruling party MLAs too. At times, when those in the treasury benches were finding it difficult to put across facts in a cohesive manner, he pitched in.        
	May be thats why even Congress MLAs dont hesitate to appreciate his legislative skills. His body-language and the way of expressing things were good, said senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Kishore. He was always armed with facts and figures, which is his core-competency.        
	The MLA from Poraiyahat (in Godda district) is known to be close to former chief minister Babulal Marandi who formed JVM after severing ties with the BJP. The party, which fought the Assembly elections for the first time in 2009, now has 11 MLAs in the House of 81.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Horror from sky invades home     Pilots die as show goes awry 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND OUR DELHI BUREAU                                                    
	March 3: A trainer aircraft of the Indian Navy lost control during an aerobatics show in the skies over the technopolis this morning and barrelled into a congested residential block, killing both pilots.         
	PTI, quoting a navy statement, said a civilian on the ground had also been killed after being hit by falling debris. But police as well as military hospital sources in Hyderabad refused to confirm the report.        
	Navy chief Admiral Nirmal Verma said the pilots  Commander S.K. Maurya and the co-pilot, Lt Commander Rahul Nair  did not eject. Probably there was no time, maybe they tried to ensure that there was no serious damage to civilian area. The fact is they are no more, Verma said in Bhopal.        
	The question that has foxed aviation experts and which a navy probe has to answer is why the pilots didnt bail out.         
	The cockpit canopy may have got stuck or the pilots may have pushed the button too late trying to pull up or steer the plane away from a populated place. If it is the former, it indicates a serious technical failure like jammed controls.         
	The crash is the second such in the city in the past 18 months and has again raised questions about the safety of people living in the vicinity of the old airport in Begumpet in the heart of Hyderabad.        
	The Kiran Mark-II trainer aircraft  part of the four-plane Sagar Pawan aerobatics team of the navy  failed to pull up from a dive, went into a spiral and hit a three-storey building in New Bowenpally, 3km from Begumpet airport. The jet, of 1960s vintage, was built by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.        
	Since the opening of the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Shamshabad in March 2008, the Begumpet facility has been used only for military training and VIP flights.         
	The planes had taken off around 11.40am from Begumpet as part of a show to mark the India Aviation 2010 expo.         
	The tragedy occurred about 14 minutes into the daredevil display when the planes were breaking away from the formation and going in different directions.        
	Eyewitnesses, many of whom had gathered on rooftops to watch the sky spectacle, said the plane suddenly plummeted. A loud explosion followed and a mushroom cloud of smoke billowed. It was spiralling downwards and then it crashed, said Loth Mallaiah, a resident.        
	The impact was such that chunks of concrete and parts of the plane fell on the ground, crushing three cars.         
	At least four injured persons are being treated in the military hospital at Secunderabad cantonment. Among them are Vijayshree and her 16-year-old son Shyam, who lived on the second floor of the devastated building.         
	Maurya, who hailed from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh, was the deputy leader of his aerial display team and had 17 years experience. Nair, 32, was described by seniors as being among the best.        
	Hyderabad police commissioner A.K. Khan said Maurya was found dead in the aircraft while Nair was flung 20ft away, entangled in an unopened parachute. Sources said the co-pilot may have tried to bail out but failed.        
	Navy chief Verma refused to comment on the probable cause behind the mishap, saying a board of inquiry would look into it.        
	The navy has grounded its entire fleet of 20 Kiran trainer aircraft  12 Mk-I and eight Mk-II planes, all based in Goa.         
	The aerobatics teams of the air force (Suryakiran) and the navy (Sagar Pawan) comprise fully operational fighter pilots who are also qualified instructors with at least 2,000 hours of flying.        
	Todays mishap was a throwback to the one on September 8, 2008, when a Cessna aircraft of the Andhra Pradesh Flying Club crashed into a congested locality near Begumpet airport.

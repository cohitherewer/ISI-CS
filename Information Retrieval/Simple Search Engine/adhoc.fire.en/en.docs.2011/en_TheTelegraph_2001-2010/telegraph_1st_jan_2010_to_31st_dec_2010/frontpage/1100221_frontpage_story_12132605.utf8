  - Faces from Bengal to hog limelight in budget week           SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                   Mamata Banerjee, Kaushik Basu and Pranab Mukherjee                                
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The coming week could well make a case for a nomenclature change of the Indian legal tender from rupee to taka.        
	Bengal is getting set to dictate the roll of the coin like it never ever has. Pranab Mukherjee piping the finance bill and Mamata Banerjee hurtling through her rail proposals is old hat, done and dusted in the lee of the UPAs euphoric return to power last summer.        
	The shape of the rupee, nee taka, comes embossed this year with a never-before Bengali impress.         
	Occupying the splice between the two big budgets --- rail on Wednesday and the finance proposals on Friday --- will be another notable from Bengal: economist Kaushik Basu, who was expressly wooed away from the hallowed recesses of Cornell University last year by the Prime Minister and installed as chief economic adviser to the finance ministry.        
	The forthcoming Economic Survey, the governments oracle document on the nations financial health and direction, will bear the mark of Basus stewardship.        
	Bengal had given the nation two finance ministers before Mukherjees unmatched run (five budgets and an interim presentation between 1982 and 2010) as money master. Shortly after Independence, Jawaharlal Nehru picked economist-planner K.C. Neogi for the job, albeit he held it for just a little over a month.        
	In the mid-sixties, Sachindra Choudhuri had a short, but eventful, stint. It was during Choudhuris tenure that the rupee was devalued  or rationalised  for the first time against the US dollar. Mamata (two rail budgets and an interim presentation between 2000 and 2010) has only one predecessor from the state in Rail Bhawan, the late and redoubtable Abu Barkat Ataur Ghani Khan Chowdhury.                     
	But never has there been such a budgetary concatenation biased on Bengal. Just as there has never been such a ministerial surfeit from the state at the Centre --- eight ministers, two of cabinet rank, and reigning wisdom is that had Mamata been more generous with her own team, there could easily have been three in the cabinet.         
	The closest Bengal came to this was quite some distance behind  in the early 1980s, Mukherjee and Ghani Khan Chowdhury found cabinet berths in the Indira Gandhi dispensation; Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Ajit Panja joined Chowdhury in Rajiv Gandhis government as ministers of state. Mukherjee was dropped by Rajiv and left the Congress for a while to pitch a rebel tent called the Rashtriya Samajbadi Congress.        
	The railway ministry, economic expertise and the finance ministry -- it is an extremely good combination for Bengal. This has never happened before. Pranab (Mukherjee) and Ajit (Panja) might have been there before together but they did not hold such important portfolios, former Bengal chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray said in Calcutta.        
	But even though the opening week of Parliament will become a showcase for stellar Bengalis, be quite sure what is being mounted is no bonghomous display of cohesive economic vision.        
	At least two of those involved --- Mukherjee and Mamata --- have duly complied to the favoured theme of yet another eminent Bengali, Amartya Sen: theyve been playing argumentative Indians over the hows and wherefores of budgetary nitty-gritty in cabinet meetings.        
	Mamata, the story goes, wants to play populist and dole out a no-hike rail budget; Mukherjee is playing hard realist and gavelling her proposed largesse in grounds of economic unsustainability, his purse isnt big enough to accommodate Mamatas munificence.        
	The battling hour is done, though, and the momentous pronouncements of the coming week are already in the works, rolling off security-sealed government presses. When they are unveiled over successive days, the trails of fineprint will all lie under one superscript: Bengal has had the final take on the taka.        
	With inputs from Jayanta Basu in Calcutta

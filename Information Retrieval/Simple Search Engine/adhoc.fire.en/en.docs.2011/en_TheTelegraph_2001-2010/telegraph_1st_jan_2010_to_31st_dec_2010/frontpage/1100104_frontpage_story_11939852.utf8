          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 3: An overcrowded fishermans boat hired by picnickers from Calcutta sank in the Rupnarayan at Kolaghat today, with 18 people, including eight children, feared drowned.        
	Twenty-nine holidaymakers, including 11 children aged six to 11, had piled onto the country boat with a capacity to carry 15-20 people, said eyewitnesses in the East Midnapore town, 60km from Calcutta.        
	Police said the boat overturned after high tide dashed it against a pillar of the Kolaghat rail bridge, causing cracks to appear, but one of the rescued children remembered seeing some of the revellers dancing on the boat too.        
	It wasnt clear how good the boats condition was. This is picnic season and many groups hire fishermens boats across the state for fun rides in the absence of an organised boating industry as in Kerala or Kashmir.        
	The 4pm tragedy caught the government slow on its feet. Coast guards from Haldia and river traffic police from Calcutta began rescue operations only at 9.30pm, when it was already too dark.        
	Mamata Banerjee, who reached Kolaghat tonight with junior shipping minister Mukul Roy, expressed shock that the government could not rush divers from Haldia and Calcutta fast enough. But even if the government had acted quickly enough, it would have taken the divers at least 90 minutes to arrive. A non-swimmer can survive at most 10 to 15 minutes in water, critical care expert Subrata Maitra told The Telegraph.        
	The police said a 62-member group had left Calcutta this morning on a days outing, organised by Kalidas Sporting Club of Ultadanga. Some of them hired the boat for Rs 250.        
	Ganesh Ram, 30, a picnicker, said some fishermen and local people jumped into the river and rescued several capsize victims. Some others swam to the bank.        
	His nephew Kashi Kumar, 6, rescued by fishermen, said his brother Prince, 4, was still missing. We took the boat ride after lunch. Suddenly I saw some people dancing on the boat, which veered towards a pillar of the rail bridge and hit it. Then a crack developed in the boat, he said from his bed at a nursing home in Kolaghat.        
	Relatives of those missing said a police team from Bagnan was present at the site but did not try to launch a rescue.

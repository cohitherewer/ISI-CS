	New Delhi, Nov 1 (PTI): A team of Indian scientists are all set to explore the icy depths of the Antarctic region looking for clues of climate change as part of the first such mission to the South Pole.
    An eight-member team of scientists and vehicle mechanics will brave the icy winds and treacherous terrain to reach the South Pole -- 90 degrees south latitude -- to commemorate the centenary of Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen's feat.
    "This is the first scientific expedition to the South Pole," Earth Sciences Secretary Shailesh Nayak had said.
    It is summertime now in the frozen continent and the highest temperature reaches 13.6 degrees Celsius below zero.

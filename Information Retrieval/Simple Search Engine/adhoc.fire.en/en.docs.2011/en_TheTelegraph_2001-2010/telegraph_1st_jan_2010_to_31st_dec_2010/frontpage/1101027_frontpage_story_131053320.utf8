	Srinagar, Oct 27 (PTI): Cross-border trade between India and Pakistan occupied Kashmir was today suspended for a day in view of protest rallies being held in Pakistan ocupied Kashmir (PoK), official sources said here.
    The trade on Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, which is held every Tuesday and Wednesday, was suspended today after the PoK authorities told the army officials at the Indian Kaman Post about their decision, they said.
    Due to law and order situation in PoK, the trade had to be suspended, they said.
    Yesterday, 49 goods trucks from the Indian side crossed over to PoK, while 14 trucks from the other side arrived at Salamabad Trade Facilitation Centre in Uri sector, the sources said.
    Today 36 trucks from the Indian side were scheduled to cross over the Line of Control but returned after the trade was suspended, they said.

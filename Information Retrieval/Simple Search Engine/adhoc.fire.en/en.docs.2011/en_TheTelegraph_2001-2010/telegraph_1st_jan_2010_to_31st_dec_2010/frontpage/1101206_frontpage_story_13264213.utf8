	Agra, Dec. 5: The debate back home over face veils did not deter the French First Couple from covering their heads at the Fatehpur Sikri dargah this afternoon, although the skullcaps initially refused to fit the President.        
	As the couple bowed before the grave of 16th-century Sufi saint Salim Chishti, Carla Bruni apparently wished for a son from her marriage with Nicolas Sarkozy. At least, thats what the shrines caretaker Peerzada Rais Mian Chishti claimed.        
	The First Lady has a nine-year-old son from an earlier relationship and Sarkozy has three from his two previous marriages. Bruni, who turns 43 this month, has in interviews expressed a desire to be a mother again and said she might adopt a child if age prevents her from bearing one.        
	Bruni and Sarkozy, arms linked, walked barefoot to the dargah on a green carpet laid out for them, and covered their heads before entering. Although the skullcaps the Peerzada had arranged for the men (along with robes for the women) were either too tight or too loose for Sarkozy, the French had fortunately come prepared.        
	The President asked one of his officials to hand him a skullcap they had brought along. Bruni covered her head with a stole.        
	Rais Mian, by virtue of being the Sajjada Nashin or descendant of Salim Chishti, welcomed the couple with a bouquet of roses and guided them around the shrine. He claimed he told Bruni how the dargah grants wishes to the jobless, unmarried and the childless.         
	He narrated to the visitors how Emperor Akbar and his wife Jodha had wished for a son before Salim Chishti and, when the wish was fulfilled, had the dargah built and named their son Salim, later known as Emperor Jehangir.        
	Rais Mian said Bruni told him: Pray for me. I want a son.        
	The Sarkozys placed on the grave a chadar of roses. Bruni also tied a kalava (red thread) on a jali (latticework) inside the dargah so her wish would come true, said the Peerzadas son Arshad Faridi, who is a journalist in Delhi.        
	While the Sarkozys were tying the thread, Rais Mian said, Bruni repeated that she wanted a son. She apparently expressed the wish a third time while leaving.        
	The Sarkozys listened for a while to a Sufi qawwali by Md Aziz Chishti, the shahi qawwal, and then walked to the adjacent monument.        
	Earlier, Bruni and Sarkozy had spent much of the morning gazing at the Taj from their Agra hotel room, having being smitten during the visit last evening.        
	Anticipating a second visit this morning, the authorities had banned tourists from 10am to noon but they lifted the restriction 40 minutes later after learning the Sarkozys werent coming.        
	The couple set out for Fatehpur Sikri, 37km from Agra, in a convoy of two dozen vehicles a little before 3pm and arrived at 3.20. They spent half an hour each at the dargah and the monument.        
	Bruni wrote in English in the visitors book: Thank you so much for the wonderful visit. Sarkozy just signed his name.        
	Yesterday at the Taj, it was Sarkozy who had written in French It represents the civilisation of the East. Unforgettable. Goodbye, while Bruni had just appended her name.

	Mangalore, May 23: One question kept gnawing at my mind during the one-hour flight from Bangalore to Mangalore this morning. Do pilots mutter a special prayer before takeoff the day after a disaster at the airport to which they are flying?        
	Our Kingfisher Red ATR 7250 would be landing on the same tabletop runway where IX 812 had landed 27 hours ago before overshooting and plunging down a forested gorge.        
	The ATR was almost full and had a mixed bag of passengers: Mangalore residents returning from a vacation, a BJP minister headed to a wedding, a bunch of journalists to cover the crash aftermath, and at least three families going to the funerals of yesterdays victims.                  
	Santosh Sequeira, a Bangalorean, was one such mourner  for his cousin Kevin, a Udupi resident who was returning from a holiday in Dubai.        
	He had just written his Class X exams and was looking forward to spending the rest of the holidays with me in Bangalore, he said.        
	Did he feel safe landing on the same runway that had claimed Kevins life?        
	If you have an accident on a particular road, do you stop driving on that road? If you see the highway to Mangalore, this runway is a hundred times safer, Sequeira said.        
	F.M. Abdullah, a timber merchant from Bangalore, meant to attend the funeral of his wifes uncle.        
	I fly at least once a month to Mangalore and have not felt unsafe even once. Even today I feel the same way. My wife, who can be quite sentimental, did not stop me from taking this flight knowing that someone from the family had to be at the funeral. If my wife, who is six months pregnant, feels safe about me flying to Mangalore, how can I feel unsafe? he asked.        
	The same mood seemed to dominate the cabin. The passengers looked absorbed in what they were doing: reading books, listening to their iPods or simply chatting.        
	Even when stewardess Shruti announced the flight would land shortly at Mangalore, there was no hushed silence or fervent prayers.        
	When I mentioned this to K. Sandhya, an education consultant sitting in the row before mine, she smiled.        
	Maybe people get over such shocks pretty easily these days. Maybe the news channels saturate their minds with non-stop coverage of tragedies till they are drained of all emotion, she said.        
	Soon enough, after a 70-minute flight, the plane landed smoothly, almost unobtrusively, as if nothing had happened yesterday. There were no cheers or handshakes on the successful touchdown, as if it was routine stuff. Perhaps I was looking too hard for a story.        
	But my first question got answered soon enough as I sought out the flights pilot, the youngish-looking Abid Sayeed. Did he pray before landing?        
	Sure, I always do, but today I had one extra prayer remembering all those who had died yesterday. Since I am in the profession of transporting people safely, and am responsible for their lives, I always come in with a prayer.        
	So, had Saturdays crash changed his perception of this runway, planting a few ghosts in his mind?        
	Absolutely not. This airport has seen 36,000 successful landings. One landing gone wrong does not change anything.        
	But ultimately it is all in the pilots hands, isnt it, I persisted.        
	Sure, its in the hands of the Pilot who sits above all of us, Sayeed said. He smiled and waved me off towards the ladder.

  - Dispur to float tenders for network capable of providing broadband in villages        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Assam power and industry minister Pradyut Bordoloi lights the inaugural lamp of NICT 2010 in Guwahati on Thursday as AEDC chairman Md Mohibul Haque (centre) looks on. Picture by Eastern Projections                                        
	Guwahati, Sept. 2: Power to the people will have a dual connotation in Assam very soon.         
	Industry and power minister Pradyut Bordoloi today said the state government would soon float tenders to lease out the power distribution network for installing an optical fibre network capable of providing broadband Internet connectivity to the remotest of places.         
	Perhaps it was in the fitness of things that Bordoloi made the announcement during the inaugural function of the two-day NICT 2010, the regions biggest conference on information, communication and technology, which got under way at Vishwaratna Hotel here.         
	We have a very developed power distribution network in the state. If a service provider installs the optical fibre network, hopefully our problems of connectivity will be solved to a large extent, Bordoloi added in his brief address as guest of honour.         
	The project has been tentatively named Optical Power Ground wire.         
	An official with the Assam Electronics Development Corporation (AEDC) said the ambitious project can actually give power in dual sense; both electricity and benefits of information technology to the people.         
	The AEDC implements all IT-related projects of the state government through its nodal agency, AMTRON.        
	 Bordoloi regretted that the statewide area network which envisages networking the entire state, has not been operational because of lack of bandwidth. We have the project in place but what we do not have is bandwidth. Around 4,000 community service centres are not working because of this problem, he said.         
	The service centres were set up by the state government as single-window information centres where the rural community was expected to get information on anything of importance, from weather reports to market prices of different commodities.         
	In fact, the Optical Power Ground wire project has already been successfully implemented in a pilot project at Sualkuchi in Kamrup district.         
	The chairman of the AEDC, Md Mohibul Haque, who also addressed the inaugural function before Bordoloi, said: Another very successful high-end project worth mentioning in front of this august gathering is the broadband over powerline in Sualkuchi...the same has been satisfactorily deployed in the field level here in Assam.         
	Haque gave an overview of the work done by AMTRON in networking the state and putting Assam on the information highway.         
	Addressing the captains of IT industry, Haque said: We have a huge pool of educated and smart youths waiting to explore the world of opportunities. I deeply believe given a level playing field our youths will outshine others in any competition. IT is no exception.         
	He also praised IT minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for his proactive role in promoting IT and IT-related activities. Sarma, who could not attend todays programme, is expected to deliver his speech in the conclave in one of the sessions tomorrow.         
	Addressing the theme session on Enabling the Northeast, Niraj Verma, commissioner and secretary, department of information technology, science and technology, said all the districts in the state would be covered under the e-district scheme very soon. At present only Goalpara and Sonitpur are the two e-districts in the state.         
	The vice-chairman and chief executive officer of Zensar Technologies, Ganesh Natarajan, who is also the chairman of CIIs national committee of IT and IT-enabled services, emphasised skill development to help the state go forward in the information technology sector.         
	Tanmoy Chakravarty, vice-president and global head, government industry solutions unit, Tata Consultancy Services, called for setting up of rural BPOs to harness the skills of rural youths so that overcrowding of the towns can be stopped.         
	In his welcome address, K.K. Mahapatra, organising secretary, described NICT as not just an event that happens every year. It is much more. It is the voice of the people of the region that echoes to the deepest corners of the country where not only do we talk about what we have achieved as a region over the last one year but chalk out our visions for the next few years and so on.         
	He said the Northeasts abundant talent, natural resources, strategic location and tremendous market potential were the fuel which drives NICT.

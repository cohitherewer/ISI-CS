	New Delhi/Mumbai, Nov 10 (PTI): Union Minister Prithviraj Chavan, a technocrat belonging to the politically dominant Maratha community, was today chosen as Maharashtra's next Chief Minister to succeed Ashok Chavan who was axed in the wake of the Housing Society scam in Mumbai.  
	64-year-old Chavan, an affable low-profile Congress leader who entered the hurly burly of politics at the persuasion of Rajiv Gandhi, is likely to take oath as the new head of the Congress-NCP coalition government tommrrow.  
	The announcement of selection of Chavan by the Congress High Command was made by senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee, a day after his predecessor was sacked in the wake of allegations in connection with the Adarsh Housing controversy.   
	Chavan, who is the Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office(PMO) and an AICC General Secretary, will be 22nd Chief Minister of Maharashtra since its inception in 1960.

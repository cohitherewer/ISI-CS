	New Delhi, April 20: The Congress leadership has moved deftly to neutralise NCP boss Sharad Pawars formidable leverage in the cricketing oligarchy on its way to scalping the controversy-ridden IPL commissioner Lalit Modi.        
	It is clear that the IPL has now become a high-stakes political battle in addition to being high-voltage cricketainment. Following the uproar in the Lok Sabha yesterday  demands by members ranged from nationalising the IPL to scrapping it  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself is believed to have sought, and received, a detailed brief on the IPL gamut.        
	The issue needed attention at the top because it had not merely rocked Parliament but created sharp divisions between the UPA allies.        
	Key to the Congresss two-birds-with-one-stone manoeuvre were signals conveyed to Pawar that he was straying from his core area of politics and leaving damaging footprints in the volatile IPL minefield which has already claimed big-ticket victims.        
	The Congress and the NCP have always shared an uneasy relationship, but Pawars overt support to Modi  and possibly other business interests in the backdrop  nearly brought matters to a new flashpoint over the past week.        
	Allegations had surfaced that elements in the IPL had tried to browbeat deep-pocket franchise bidders into withdrawing to favour the Adani group, which wanted an IPL team for Ahmedabad with Modis undercover support.        
	It is not known whether these actors resorted to strong-arm tactics with Pawars knowledge or consent, but it was conveyed to the NCP leader that the aggrieved parties could bring their weight to bear, and his alleged footprints on the murky circumstances before and after the recent auction could return to haunt him in the twilight of his career.        
	But neither the IPL nor Modi, say insiders, appeared worthy enough for Pawar to put his politics  and daughter Supriya Sules future  at stake. Sule herself spoke with eloquent proof of that.         
	Flatly denying that her husband Sadanand Sule had any interests in the Adani bid, Supriya said: I will not respond to insinuations against me, my husband or Prafulbhai (Patel). Present facts and I am ready to fight. The point is we are not interested in the politics of cricket, we are interested in the politics of development.        
	Wise to weigh the adverse implications of his blessings to the Modi group, Pawar grudgingly opted to back off and protect his political fortunes instead.        
	Pawar is believed to have been presented incontrovertible and damning evidence of Modis unsavoury behind-the-scenes operations. Sources said these include details of shifty financial dealings and attempts to scare off franchise bidders he did not want in the IPL.         
	According to one leader, Pawar was presented audio and video proof that Modi had been trying to torment the Kochi consortium, which eventually won its bid but cost mentor Shashi Tharoor his ministerial job. In the light of this, sources said, the Congress leadership bluntly conveyed to Pawar that Modi would have to go.        
	Pawar was in a huddle with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister P. Chidambaram this afternoon at Parliament House, and Congress sources said the burgeoning IPL mess was on the menu.        
	Finance ministry sources, though, denied cricket had come up at the meeting and said it had been called to discuss strategies to counter the BJPs planned assault on price rise through a rally in Delhi tomorrow.        
	Congress sources, however, maintained that party leaders had told Pawar that leads available with government agencies against Modi would be sincerely acted upon, making his continuance as IPL chief untenable.        
	Confronted, Pawar expressed his willingness to rid the IPL of Modi and said he would work out a formula to sideline him although that would not be easy. But he is also said to be opposed to the fishing operation by the income-tax department and other intelligence and enforcement agencies into IPL affairs, arguing that such an inquiry would scare off investors and eventually kill the enterprise.         
	Finance ministry sources indicated, though, that their pursuit was on and they were looking into two aspects of IPL finances  alleged money laundering and tax evasion. The hunt for two key missing files  on the defeated franchise bids by the Adani group (Ahmedabad) and Videocon (Pune)  was also on, they said.         
	These files have mysteriously vanished, and fingers have been pointed at CCTV footage of Laila Mallya leaving an office of Modi in a hotel with a laptop and some documents shortly before the IT sleuths knock on the night of April 15. Laila is stepdaughter of RCB owner Vijay Mallya and works for Modi.        
	Many Congress leaders have joined the chorus for a thorough probe demanded by parliamentarians yesterday. Asked about Pawars support to Modi, his bete noire Vilasrao Deshmukh said: I am not talking about any individual. I am talking about total IPL. Let there be a thorough probe into it.        
	The heavy industries minister added: Whatever has been promised by our finance minister in the House yesterday, let it go on and let there be total transparency.        
	Asked if there was a witch-hunt going on against some individuals involved in the issue, Deshmukh said: There is no reason to believe that.

	Kathmandu, Aug 24 (PTI): A Nepalese passenger plane with 14 people on board, including six foreigners, crashed into the hills in bad weather near Kathmandu this morning shortly after taking off from here.
    The aircraft of private Agni Airlines, carrying 11 passengers and three crew members, crashed near Shikharpur village in Makawarnur district, about 80 kilometers south of Kathmandu.
    The German-built Dornier plane was en route to Lukla, a popular trekking spot in the Everest region of eastern Nepal, from Kathmandu when the incident occurred, the Himalayan Times reported.
    Officials at the police headquarters in Kathmandu said six foreigners were on board the ill fated plane.
    No further details were available.
    Heavy torrential rains since yesterday and fog have been hampering the rescue process.
    The accident site is only accessible by foot, but the route from the nearest town is blocked by a river flooded by monsoon rainfall.

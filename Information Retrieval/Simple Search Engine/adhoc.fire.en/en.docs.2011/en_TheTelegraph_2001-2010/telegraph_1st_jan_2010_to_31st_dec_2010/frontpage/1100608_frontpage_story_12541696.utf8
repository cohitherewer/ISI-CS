The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Did Trinamul ask? 41 say No
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Did Trinamul ask? 41 say No
                            
	What John F. Kennedy preached  ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country  Mamata Banerjee has practised with gusto.        
	But largely without asking her fellow Calcuttans, or at least many of the 76 experts chosen to guide the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Mamatas intention to involve people from all walks of life is refreshing. But many appear to have been in the dark till their names were publicly announced, which leaves them with little option but to accept or be counted as arrayed against the new dispensation.        
	Prompted by the perplexed reactions of some, The Telegraph tried contacting the nominees to verify if their approval was sought before making their names public. Of the 52 people who could be contacted, three said they had been informed of their nominations beforehand, 41 said they were not and eight refused comment.         
	Question: Was your approval sought before your name was included in the committee and made public?

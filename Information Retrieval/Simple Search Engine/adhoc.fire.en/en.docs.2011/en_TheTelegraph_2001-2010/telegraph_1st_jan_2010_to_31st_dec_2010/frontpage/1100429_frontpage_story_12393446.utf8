  - Citu-enforced bandh drives last nail in CMs withering preserve           ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                            A Writers rsquo; Buildings gate locked during Tuesday rsquo;s bandh (picture by Gopal Senapati) and Bhattacharjee                                
	Calcutta, April 28: As he walked down an empty Writers Buildings corridor to his office yesterday, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee presented a bizarre picture  of a chief executive presiding over a vanished job.         
	Still more bizarre was the fact that his own comrades took the job away from him. The image that captured it best was that of the lock that the members of the co-ordination committee of government employees, an affiliate of the CPM, had put at the secretariat gate.         
	Gone were his Do-It-Now cry and his big-bang industrialisation crusade. All he seemed to have been left with was the coming end with a whimper, symbolised in his attending office but having no work to do.         
	If Bhattacharjee found his government had withered away even while he was still in office, it was as much his partys fault as his own.         
	Soon after he led the Left Front to a resounding victory in 2006 on his aggressive development campaign, the chief minister seemed to know where his real challenge lay. It was not so much Mamata Banerjee, who was demoralised after a humiliating election defeat; the biggest challenge for him was to break the shackles of his party and its politics of coercion.         
	In private conversations, he singled out militant party colleagues, especially leaders of Citu, and the partys education cabals, as the biggest enemies of promise. Industrialisation and higher education were two areas he seemed to have identified for his major offensive. If Citu was the main hurdle in industrialisation, party control was the bane of higher education, he would confide to circles close to him.         
	He may have identified the enemies but showed little stamina in fighting them. The result was written all over Bengal yesterday when Citu took the lead in forcing the bandh. For those who have watched CPM-sponsored strikes in Bengal for over four decades, the most remarkable thing about yesterdays show was the ubiquitous presence of Citu on the street.        
	If any further proof were needed to know that the chief minister had lost his battle with Citu, it was there all over the state yesterday.         
	CPM leaders privately argue that they needed to make the bandh a success in order to re-activate party cadres ahead of the coming elections to 81 municipalities in the state. It would be the partys last trial of strength before next years Assembly polls.         
	If yesterdays show was more aggressive than recent Left-organised strikes, it was because the party wanted to tell the cadres that offence was not just the best but the only defence for the beleaguered party.         
	For its sympathisers and the people at large, the message of the bandh was that the party was still alive and kicking.         
	In all this, though, the partys voice  and not the chief ministers  rang aloud. This bandh may have served as the final proof that Bhattacharjee has finally and irretrievably lost himself in his party. He continues to be the chief minister, but he stays only that  sans development, sans industrialisation and sans any work that he wanted to make his own.         
	One last thing carries the stamp of his earlier ambition  the Presidency University bill. He has resisted the pressures of CPM-affiliated government college teachers in order to push it.         
	On the eve of the 2006 Assembly elections, he spoke of his wish to see that at least five colleges are given autonomous status  which would free them from the control of his partys education clique. (As for Presidency College, he even mentioned one teacher, who was a CPM leader, by name, who, he said, runs the college.)         
	But the recent electoral reverses have forced Bhattacharjee to surrender back to the party. For all his bold wishes, he made too many promises with the party, allowing it to eventually thwart his agenda. It may have all begun with the chief minister failing to stand up against the party diktat on the choice of his cabinet in 2006. Even in the best of times, he failed to tell the party that the government was his  and not its  business.         
	If Bhattacharjee is receding into the partys shadows now, he had sowed the seeds by not defying it enough.

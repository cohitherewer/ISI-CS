          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 11: Peoples Committee secretary Manoj Mahato tonight slammed Mamata Banerjee for not mentioning his outfit even once at Mondays Lalgarh rally despite it helping fill the venue.        
	Mahato accused Mamata of campaigning for her party under the guise of her apolitical rally and of making a lot of promises, saying: Does she consider herself a devi, or are we her devotees?        
	He added: We supplied people to the rally but she never once uttered the committees name in her speech. No committee leader was invited to the dais.        
	On Mamatas plea to the Maoists to shun violence and sit for talks, rebel leader Kishan said: Its the state that is resorting to violence. If the government announces a ceasefire, we can temporarily lay down arms and sit for talks.        
	Mahato said about Mamatas assurances to tribals: If shes so concerned, why isnt she protesting land acquisition for the Jindal project?        
	Almost all the land for Jindals steel plant in Salboni, however, was vested. Besides, Mamata didnt give any specific assurance but only defended tribals right to the forest.

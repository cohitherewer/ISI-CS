  - Bush barely mentions nuclear deal in book           K.P. NAYAR                      Bush signs a copy of his book. (AP)                                
	Washington, Nov. 11: First the euphoria, then the letdown.        
	In a 509-page book about his presidency published by George W. Bush this week, only half a page is devoted to India.        
	Decision Points, the book which shared the top news spot on American television during the weekend along with President Barack Obamas visit to India, arrived on bookshelves here on Tuesday.        
	It will come as a shock to those Indians who believe that their country was a top priority for the Bush presidency that of its 195,456 words, the book has a mere 208 words about India.         
	It is a revelation which should put Prakash Karats mind at rest.        
	That in itself may not be the unkindest cut for Indians who supported Bush and have maintained that he transformed Indo-US relations because New Delhi became an anchor of the former Presidents strategic vision for a post-9/11 world.        
	Even those 208 words figure in just three paragraphs only in the context of justifying a visit by Bush to Islamabad after his trip to India in March 2006.                    
	Considering that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spent his entire political capital on seeing through a nuclear deal with the US and risked his very government causing a political earthquake in India, it is somewhat jarring to see that Bush dismisses civil nuclear co-operation with New Delhi in one and a half sentences.        
	Sentiment and any emotional distress apart, the true value of Decision Points for Indians now may be to understand why Obama skirted Pakistan in Mumbai until he was forced address that problem by Afsheen Irani, a 19-year-old student at St. Xaviers College.        
	National interests of nations do not change merely because presidents or prime ministers have changed, and in any case, the core professionals who advise heads of state and government are the same, except a few political appointees at the state department or in the National Security Council in the case of Washington.        
	It is clear from the numerous pages in Decision Points devoted to Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Taliban and al Qaida that the US has been and will be tied to Pakistan by an umbilical cord which no President, howsoever in love with India, can cut in the foreseeable future.        
	The Bush memoir ought to help India to learn to live with the fact that Pakistans critical importance to America will persuade Obama  as Bush did  or his successor to arm, aid and mollycoddle whoever rules in Islamabad, be it a civilian or a man in uniform.        
	Decision Points details the reasons why Bush did so.        
	But reading the former Presidents book side by side with Obamas speeches in Mumbai and New Delhi also throws light on why there has been an unmistakable dehyphenation of India and Pakistan in the White House.        
	India is seen both by Bush and Obama as a growing market for US goods and a potential partner in strengthening Americas economy whose weaknesses can be overcome, albeit in part, by association with India.        
	That demands that Washington does not see its relations with India and Pakistan as a zero sum game. It can be inferred from the book that this is what has happened during the Bush presidency, a policy that is continuing under Obama.        
	What is startling though is that all this understanding comes from the accounts by Bush about what he did or did not do with Pakistan since there are no such reference points on India.        
	The book will be a sobering read for Indias strategic community, the bulk of which actually advocated surrendering New Delhis strategic autonomy in practice, a ganging up of the so-called Asian democracies in an alliance against China and endorsement of anything Bush proposed as President, including missile defence and the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).        
	The PSI would have required India to interdict ships suspected of carrying unauthorised nuclear material, which could have put the country at odds with China or Iran.        
	By not making even a passing mention of such initiatives in an Indian context, it is clear that the Bush administration was selling India a strategic pipe-dream, which was being celebrated in public discourse in New Delhi as the dawn of a new era and as a path to Indias great power status.        
	Naturally, many of these proposals died with the Bush presidency.        
	In a global survey which was conducted when he was at the White House, India was one of only three countries where Bush was popular as president.        
	That love seems to have been unrequited because the former President is almost condescending in a reference to India. I believe India, home to roughly a billion people and an educated middle class has the potential to be one of Americas closest partners.        
	In the only reference to the nuclear deal, Bush writes: The nuclear agreement was a historic step because it signalled the countrys new role on the world stage.        
	Sadly, here again, the nuclear deal is mentioned as a prelude to its impact in Pakistan and why Bush visited Islamabad. The nuclear deal naturally raised concerns in Pakistan, he writes.

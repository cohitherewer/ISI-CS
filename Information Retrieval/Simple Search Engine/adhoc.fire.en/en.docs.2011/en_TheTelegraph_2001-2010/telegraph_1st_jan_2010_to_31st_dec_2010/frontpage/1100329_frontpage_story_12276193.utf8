          ARCHIS MOHAN                            Ronen Sen                                  
	New Delhi, March 28: When it comes to Indo-US ties, diplomacy must begin at home. This appears to be the thinking at the ministry of external affairs, which is unleashing a battery of retired ambassadors on Indias civil society.        
	Their brief is to enlighten students, academics and journalists about New Delhis foreign policy in the 21st century, particularly the importance of the growing Indo-US relationship that many view with apprehension.        
	The former ambassadors are lecturing at leading Indian universities under an outreach programme started by the ministrys public diplomacy division.        
	The first in the series was a lecture on March 20 by Ronen Sen, ambassador to the US from August 2004 to March 2009, at Lucknow University on the evolution of Indias relations with the USA.        
	Former ambassador A.N. Ram has interacted with students and teachers at Banaras Hindu University. Former foreign secretary Lalit Mansingh will speak on Indias foreign policy in the 21st century at Goa University tomorrow.        
	At Lucknow University, Sen, one of the architects of the Indo-US nuclear deal, criticised people who remain frozen in ideological postures of a bygone era and view most India-US initiatives as potential Trojan horses of threats to our sovereignty.        
	Sen said it wasnt just poli-ticians who suffered from this colonial-era mindset  there were bureaucrats, diplomats and even businessmen who viewed Indo-US ties with suspicion.        
	Our relationship with the US is our single most important bilateral relationship today, Sen said.        
	He highlighted how America had helped Indias Green Revolution and aided New Delhi in setting up its first nuclear power station, and how India became the first non-Nato country other than Japan to be supplied a supercomputer by the US.        
	The former ambassador touched on the times when the relationship had touched its lowest point  during the Bangladesh war of 1971 and after the nuclear test in 1974.        
	He lauded George W. Bushs two terms that had led to a fundamental re-orientation of US perceptions of India.        
	Sen said: The most significant, and most controversial, initiative was the India-US civil nuclear agreement. The full extent of the implications of the nuclear deal has still not been realised in our country. This was, to a great extent, due to our poor communication.        
	He hoped the two countries would iron out the remaining wrinkles to implement the deal without foot-dragging.        
	Sen slammed uninformed speculation that the Bush administrations interest in the nuclear deal was driven by commercial considerations.        
	There has also been loose talk of going ahead with contracts for nuclear power reactors with countries such as Russia and France, while proceeding cautiously with the US. This kind of thinking not only betrays bad faith but fails to recognise the close ties between US, French, Russian, German and Japanese firms, Sen said.        
	He advocated participation in the nuclear power sector by both the domestic and foreign private sectors.        
	Sen credited the Bush administration with effectively de-hyphenating Pakistan and India.        
	I am sure that India-US relations will continue to strengthen under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Barack Obama. The relationship will, however, need constant nurturing and care, he said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, March 20: A group of government officials inspecting NREGS projects in Latehar were held hostage by Maoists for over three hours today, apparently to pass on a message to the state government to stop the ongoing offensive against rebels set to be intensified in the bordering areas of Bengal any time now.        
	The incident happened around noon and the state government was in panic as soon as news reached capital Ranchi. Chief minister Shibu Soren summoned the home secretary and DGP and directed them to launch a massive search. The issue was raised in the Assembly as well.        
	Officials were relieved when news of their release reached them by the evening.         
	The search was called off after Latehar police confirmed the release of the group  comprising officials, a driver and others.        
	Nine persons were taken away by Maoists. But, all have been released safely. Further investigations are on, Latehar SP Kuldeep Dwivedi told The Telegraph over telephone.        
	IG (operations) D.K. Pandey described the positive outcome as a fallout of the success of Operation Greenhunt. We will be giving you more such success stories in the coming days, he said.        
	Among the officials in the group were additional collector Shravan Soy, public works department executive engineer H. Bhengra, field officer Adiram Satta, district dairy development officer Vinod Kumar Sinha, national rural employment programme special division officer Saryu Ram and driver Kiran Oraon.        
	Around 12 noon, the group was accosted by five armed men and led into a nearby school building at Bandhwa village, 7km of north of Manika block headquarters in Latehar.        
	According to police sources, during the three-and-a-half hours of their captivity, the Maoists asked the officials to pass on a message to the state government that Operation Greenhunt had to be stopped.         
	Instead, the officials were advised to concentrate more on the efficient implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.        
	While this was on, local villagers informed the police but the Maoists let off the officials before they reached the village school.         
	Both Latehar deputy commissioner Rahul Purwar and Dwivedi who were in the vicinity, went to the school as soon as they heard of the event, but by then, the rebels had left.         
	The two police officers are now camping in the area to gather details.         
	In another positive development, four employees of Vijeta Construction, who had been abducted by suspected JLT rebels  a breakaway faction of Maoists  in Simdega on Thursday, were also released today.         
	But rural development department junior engineer Ranjit Kumar, who was abducted last Wednesday, was yet to be freed.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            MOH Farook                                  
	Ranchi, July 14: Governor M..H. Farook today urged the Centre to provide Rs 100 crore for building necessary infrastructure facilities for the Special Task Force aimed at fighting Naxalism and sought army training for police and paramilitary forces operating in the state.        
	Addressing a conclave of chief ministers of Naxalite affected states, presided over by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the national capital today, the governor also proposed that Ranchi, Khunti and Giridih districts be included in the core group of rebel affected districts comprising Chatra, Palamau, Latehar, Gumla, Simdega, Lohardaga, Chaibasa, Bokaro and Hazaribagh.         
	Farook, who was the first to address the conclave, maintained that state police and central forces were working in tandem. As the number of companies of central paramilitary forces engaged in Jharkhand had increased from 36 to 72, the operations had become more effective.         
	The state has been sanctioned 40 groups of STF, or Jharkhand Jaguars, but so far 18 were operating actively. They were primarily based at rebel zone police stations and operated in association with central paramilitary forces.        
	Farook said Jharkhand was committed to fighting Naxalism. He said he had already ordered school buildings occupied by security forces to be vacated at the earliest.         
	Among the areas of concern was the smooth execution of welfare and development schemes in Naxalite-affected areas.         
	In Ranchi, chief secretary A.K. Singh noted that a positive takeaway from todays meeting was that the Centre agreed to some concessions while implementing schemes according to the geographical needs of the state.         
	We have been told by the Centre that the Union home ministry will function as the nodal department to expedite all development and security related proposals, he said.        
	The Prime Minister, he added, assured the state all possible help. His only concern was that Jharkhand had earned a bad name for wastage of public funds, he said.

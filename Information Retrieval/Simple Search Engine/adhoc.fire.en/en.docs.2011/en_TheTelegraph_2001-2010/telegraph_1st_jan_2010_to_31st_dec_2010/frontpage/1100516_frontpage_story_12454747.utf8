          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shilda, May 15: The four CPM supporters killed by Maoists in battle fatigues had paid for trying to build up support for the ongoing census which the rebels oppose, a fellow villager said today.        
	Chandabila resident Prafulla Goala said he and the four victims had threatened some members of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities with consequences if they came to their village, a CPM pocket, to try and stop census work.        
	Goala said he had slipped out of the village on Thursday night when he recognised a few Peoples Committee members standing behind the disguised Maoists as they led out the four victims.        
	I am lucky to be alive. I escaped when I saw the four men being taken away, he told The Telegraph from an undisclosed location.        
	The Maoists say they are against the census because it is being carried out by a government they want to overthrow.         
	Government officials say the census is crucial to the planning and funding of development, and the rebels dont want development.        
	Goala said Peoples Committee members had been going around Chandabila warning residents against co-operating with the census workers. They threatened census worker Ashoke Kumar Mondal and snatched some papers from him a few days ago just outside our village, he said.        
	The four men killed on Thursday and I had then confronted the committee members and warned them. We also assured protection to Mondal. Its clear the committee members had passed this on to the Maoists.        
	After Thursdays killings, all efforts to carry on the census in the Shilda-Belpahari area have stopped. The census is now stalled in all five Maoist-affected blocks in West Midnapore district.

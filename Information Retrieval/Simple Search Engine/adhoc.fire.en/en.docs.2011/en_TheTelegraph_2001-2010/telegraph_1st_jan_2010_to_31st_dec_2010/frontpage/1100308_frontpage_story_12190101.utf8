          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, March 7: The process of counting people for Census 2011 would begin late in Jharkhand and Bihar because of the impending panchayat and Assembly elections in the respective states.         
	This was revealed during a census orientation programme held for collectors in Delhi on March 4.         
	The meeting, chaired by Union home minister P. Chidambaram, was attended by deputy commissioners of most districts of the state.        
	According to chief secretary Shiv Basant, different time frames have been set for starting the process in different states.         
	I cannot remember the exact date set for starting census activities in Jharkhand, but it will be in accordance with central directives, Basant said.         
	A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the process of listing houses, the first step in any census activity, would start from April 2010 in most states, but would be delayed in Jharkhand by a couple of months. Panchayat elections in the state are expected around May this year.         
	After the process of house listing is completed, the head count would start simultaneously across the country to avoid duplication.        
	For the first time, the task of preparing a National Population Register (NPR) would be taken up. Fingerprints and eye impression of every individual would also be taken for incorporation in the unique identification (UID) programme, said Gumla deputy commissioner Rahul Sharma, who attended the Delhi meet.         
	Deputy commissioners would act as the concerned districts principal census officer. It would be their responsibility to monitor the process that would employ the services of teachers and panchayat employees.                                             
	Meanwhile, in a goof-up of sorts, the state government issued a notification on March 4, naming senior IAS officer Sunil Kumar Burnwal as director, census operations, in the state. However, the post of director, census operations, is decided by the Centre and the state government can only recommend a state cadre IAS officer for the task.         
	When questioned, chief secretary Basant said he had already got the Centres nod in this regard.         
	Interestingly, Koderma deputy commissioner Rajiv Arun Ekka was earlier appointed director, census, and he was yet to be relieved of the post.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Billion-dollar credit carpet for Hasina
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Billion-dollar credit carpet for Hasina
          ARCHIS MOHAN                                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: India today held out to Bangladesh a fulsome bouquet of goodies that included investments, scholarships and electricity. But the prize really lay in the ribbon New Delhi bound it all in  an unprecedented $1-billion (Rs 4,500 crore) credit line meant to boost bilateral ties to never-before heights.        
	The $1-billion credit, double the $500 million anticipated in the run-up to Hasinas visit, represents Indias highest one-time assistance to another country. Sources said that 35 to 40 per cent of the credit could later be turned into a grant, which means that portion need not be paid back. Indias aid to Afghanistan has topped $1 billion but the amount had accumulated in phases through separate announcements.        
	The delegation-level talks between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina lasted over two hours.         
	They signed five agreements, including one on co-operation in power. India committed itself to providing 250MW everyday, substantially more than the 100MW promised in September last year, to energy-deficient Bangladesh.        
	Other agreements included pacts on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, transfer of sentenced persons and combating international terrorism, organised crime and drug trafficking. (See chart)        
	Government sources said these agreements were a precursor to an extradition treaty between the two countries, important if India wants Bangladesh to hand over more fugitives.         
	The deal on the transfer of sentenced persons is bad news for Ulfa, whose leader Anup Chetia had been jailed in Dhaka when Hasinas rival Khaleda Zia was in power, ostensibly to prevent his handover to India.        
	You are no stranger to India, Prime Minister Singh said at the banquet hosted in Hasinas honour. Relations with Bangladesh are of the highest priority for India. India stands ready to be a full and equal partner in the realisation of your vision of social change and economic development for Bangladesh, he said.        
	Singh also lauded Hasinas role in bringing multi-party democracy to Bangladesh.        
	The Bangladeshi Prime Minister recalled the vision of her father and his desire to see peace and prosperity not just in Bangladesh, but the entire region.        
	It was not lost on old-timers that Hasina had landed in Delhi on January 10, exactly 38 years after her father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had visited New Delhi.        
	True to that spirit, Hasina addressed a perception among some Indians that present-day Bangladesh, from where Pakistani-backed terror groups are suspected to have launched attacks on India, does not remember history well.        
	The blood of over 18,000 valiant Indians mingled with the millions of our own, culminated in Bangladeshs independence, and laid the basis of our special friendship, Hasina said.        
	She had earlier in the day assured Singh that her government would not allow Bangladesh to be used for terrorism directed at India.        
	Referring to an agreement for joint commemoration of Rabindranath Tagores 150th birth anniversary in 2011, Singh said: India and Bangladesh are fortunate to have produced some of the finest writers, scholars and artists. The works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam have inspired generations of people. This is a unique asset which binds our people, and which we must preserve.        
	The two sides will set up border haats along the Bangladesh-Meghalaya border and land custom ports on the Mizoram border.         
	Mamata Banerjee and Pranab Mukherjee also took part in the delegation talks.

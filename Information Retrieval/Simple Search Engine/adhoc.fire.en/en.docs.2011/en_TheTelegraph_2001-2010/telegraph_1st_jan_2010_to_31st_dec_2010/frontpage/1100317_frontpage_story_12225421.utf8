                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CM urges filmmakers to defy political censors
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Shah Rukh Khan at the Ficci meet (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, March 16: Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan today asked filmmakers not to yield to parallel political censorship and said his government would ensure there was only one censor, the censor board.        
	The remarks are seen as a strong message against the targeting of film figures by parties like the Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS).         
	Chavans appeal comes a day after 11 MNS activists were arrested for allegedly trying to extort money from producer Ritesh Sidhwani.        
	Speaking at Frames 2010, a three-day conference on the Indian entertainment industry organised by business chamber Ficci, Chavan said his governments efforts to ensure a smooth release for the Shah Rukh Khan starrer My Name Is Khan last month were not political stunts, as alleged by some political rivals.        
	When things go beyond a point, it is the duty of the government and the people to uphold the Constitution and protect the democratic rights of the people, Chavan asserted, without referring to the Sena.        
	Khan, who shared the dais with Chavan, Yash Chopra and Katrina Kaif, thanked the chief minister for providing adequate security to his film and justified his own stand on the issue. The Sena had demanded an apology from the actor for saying Pakistani cricketers should be included in the Indian Premier League. The star had refused, and the film was released amid tight security and strong support from Mumbaikars.        
	The MNS workers arrests, too, were reportedly made after Chavan asked Mumbai police chief D. Sivanandhan to take action.                  Actress Katrina Kaif at the same event. (AFP)      
	Khan, whose MNIK became the first Indian film to be released by Hollywood major Fox Star Studios, urged Indian filmmakers to emulate Hollywood and gave a three-point prescription for globalising Bollywood movies.        
	He said the makers of Indian films could learn a lot from abroad in screenplay-writing techniques, visual effects and discipline. Learning Hollywood screenplay and technology is not about losing the intrinsic quality of our stories. We have to maintain our own cinematic individuality, Khan said in his keynote address.        
	The sooner Indian film-makers realise that screenplay is not an art form, but a science, the faster Indian films would globalise and Hollywood could exchange technologocial knowhow with India, Khan said.        
	On discipline, the actor pointed out that it already exists in other businesses in India, but is woefully lacking in the business of films. This needs to filter down to our own distribution system of films based on their models and the most essential aspect that we need to learn is the science of marketing of films, he said.

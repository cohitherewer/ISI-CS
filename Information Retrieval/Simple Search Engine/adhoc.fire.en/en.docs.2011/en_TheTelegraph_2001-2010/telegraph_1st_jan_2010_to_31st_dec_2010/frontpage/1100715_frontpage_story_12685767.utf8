          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                            Home minister P Chidambaram and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the meeting in Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, July 14: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar proved to be the odd man out at todays meeting of Maoist-affected states as he insisted the rebels were people who had been misled to the path of violence.        
	Nitish, who is facing elections in Bihar later this year, was unabashed about what he thought politically.        
	My views on how to resolve this may be at variance with the perception of some of my other friends present here. Naxalite elements are a part of our society even though they have been misled into following the path of violence, he told the meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	The Janata Dal (United) leaders line of thought obviously clashes with what Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram believe. Chidambaram iterated that the Maoists aimed at seizure of political power through protracted peoples war, starkly opposed to what Nitish stressed.        
	Nitish, keen not to alienate the extremely backward classes and Mahadalits in his state, took on the Centre not only on ideology but also on Bihars federal relationship with New Delhi. His articulation of caution reflects compulsions stemming from a distinct feature of Naxalism in Bihar, where caste hostility often takes the shape of class conflict. The land-owning upper castes had been at war with the weaker sections in Bihar since the sixties.        
	Nitish today said enforcement action alone leads to wider alienation, making heroes out of the leaders of extremist organisations, and to only symptomatic treatment, leaving the underlying disease to reappear more virulently.        
	While the UPA government has blessed Chidambarams two-pronged approach, Nitish claimed to have his own: an integrated approach.        
	Essentially, it means the same thing but the variance was glaring despite the Prime Ministers warning earlier.        
	I must reiterate that we cannot afford to let inter-personal issues come in the way of our strategy to tackle Left-wing extremism. We must be and also appear to be united and one in our resolve and in execution of our strategies, Singh told the chief ministers in his opening remarks.         
	The Prime Ministers apparent premise was that though law and order is a state subject, ramifications of the problem calls for sustained co-ordination between the Centre and states, not only regarding the overall strategy but also on regular operational issues.        
	Singh also said that in case there were issues regarding intelligence sharing or the pattern or nature of deployment of central paramilitary forces, he wanted to hear them.        
	Nitish also wants more districts to be brought under the security-related expenditure scheme for 83 districts and 35 Maoist-affected districts under the focused districts scheme.

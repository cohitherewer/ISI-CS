          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Reddy                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: An angry Opposition today refused to let a cabinet minister speak in the Lok Sabha, probably for the first time in recent memory.        
	Opposition MPs, primarily from the BJP and the Janata Dal (United), shouted down Speaker Meira Kumar who tried her best to ensure that Jaipal Reddy could reply to the charges levelled against the government over alleged corruption in the Commonwealth Games preparations.        
	This happened in zero hour. Sports minister M.S. Gill was not in the House but urban development minister Reddy was keen to respond to the Oppositions allegations of over-spending on stadium renovation, which falls under his jurisdiction.        
	Reddy, a key member of the group of ministers overseeing the Games preparations, got up several times to speak. But MPs led by the leader of Opposition, Sushma Swaraj, said he should speak only after a full-fledged debate on the subject, which could take place anytime next week.        
	Dal leader Sharad Yadav argued the issue was grave and the minister would not be allowed to talk out of it. He was the first to declare that Reddy would not be allowed to speak.        
	Opposition members have in the past shouted during ministers replies or staged a boycott, but they have hardly ever questioned a ministers right to speak. Nor has the Opposition ever dictated the timing of a ministers reply.        
	Ministers usually do not respond to issues raised in zero hour, but the Opposition invariably demands their intervention. The Speaker often leaves it to the minister concerned or the government to decide if they want to reply. Today, Reddy was willing to respond and parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal and his deputy G. Narayanswami defended his right to speak.        
	Bansal asked Sushma if this had ever happened in the House but she insisted that Reddys reply would be heard only after the debate. As the Speakers pleas also fell on deaf ears, she adjourned the House.        
	Meira Kumar later regretted the days development before the media. The government was keen to have Reddy respond because the Opposition had levelled several serious charges of wrongdoing.        
	Apart from NDA members, Gurdas Dasgupta of the CPI, Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party and Basudeb Acharya of the CPM were among those who alleged that public money was being looted and shame brought on the country. Sanjay Nirupam, the lone Congress member to speak, was jeered.

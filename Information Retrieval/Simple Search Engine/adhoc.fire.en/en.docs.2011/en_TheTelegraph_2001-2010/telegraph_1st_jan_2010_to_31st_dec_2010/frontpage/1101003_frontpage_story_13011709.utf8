  - No reason why we cannot take credit for breakthrough with rebels, says Assam CM        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Oct. 2: The ruling Congress in Assam intends to put its efforts to bring militant groups, particularly Ulfa, to the negotiating table high on its report card when it seeks votes for the 2011 Assembly elections.         
	I see no reason why we cannot take credit for success. The AGP could have also brought the militant groups to the negotiating table. Instead, the party did the reverse and tried to contain violence by resorting to cruel means of secret killings. But my government is trying to bring lasting peace to the state and solve the insurgency problem forever, chief minister Tarun Gogoi told reporters on the sidelines of a government function here today.        
	He said his government had been able to convince the top leaders of Ulfa and the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah (DHD-J) to start a dialogue with the government for lasting peace in the state.         
	The chief minister had yesterday wavered on his recent assertion that talks with Ulfa would be held within two months, saying that such things could not be said with accuracy.         
	At the same time, he had dismissed apprehension and doubts that the government would not be able to start the peace talks in real terms with the outfit till Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua sat across the table.        
	The AGP and BJP have been accusing the Congress of playing with peace talks with Ulfa for political gain in next years election. The AGP alleged that the Congress was not serious about solving the problem of militancy in the state.         
	Leaving the judgement to voters, Gogoi said, Let people judge what we have done to restore peace.        
	Asked what strategy would the Congress employ in next years battle for ballots to fight Opposition accusations like the alleged Rs 1,000-crore scam in Dima Hasao (earlier North Cachar Hills), Gogoi said his party would not consider the Opposition weak.         
	But most of the issues the Opposition is raking up against the Congress in view of the ensuing Assembly polls are baseless. In fact, the Opposition has no issue and is thus suffering from frustration and is doing anything to counter the Congress, he said.         
	The chief minister also launched an attack on BJP leader Varun Gandhi, who is now in charge of Assam elections and visiting the state frequently.         
	Varuns visits will not affect the Congress. My party has far better leaders like Rahul Gandhi who is a youth icon and is doing yeomans service to the poor and underprivileged people of the country. Varun is only spreading seeds of communalism, he said.

	Itanagar, May 12 (PTI): Four tourists from Kolkata died and four others injured when a vehicle in which they were travelling fell into a deep gorge in Arunachal Pradesh's Tawang district, police said today.  
	 The incident occurred last night when the vehicle, travelling in bad weather, skidded off the road after crossing the 14,000-feet Sela pass, they said. Three families, all from Kolkata, had hired the vehicle in Bomdila to visit Tawang.   
	Police rescued the injured and took them to Tawang district hospital, where the condition of the driver is said to be serious.  Officials said the injured need to be immediately sent to referral hospitals as the district hospital is not equipped to treat them. The bodies of the dead were sent for post-mortem. West Bengal officials are in touch with district authorities.

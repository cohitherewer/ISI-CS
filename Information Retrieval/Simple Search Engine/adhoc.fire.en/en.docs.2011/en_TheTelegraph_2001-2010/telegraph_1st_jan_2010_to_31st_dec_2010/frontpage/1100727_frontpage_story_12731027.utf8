The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata paints too pretty a picture
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mamata paints too pretty a picture
          OUR BUREAU                                   UNITED ON WALL...            Civic election graffiti of both the CPM and the Trinamul Congress  on a Calcutta wall. (File picture)      ...WHAT ABOUT SCREEN?            A CMC campaign on health insurance for the poor flashes on an electronic display board on Park Street on Monday. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray      
	Calcutta, July 26: Mamata Banerjee today promised to keep poll graffiti off Calcuttas walls but did not spell out how she would build political consensus to kick a habit her own party is addicted to.        
	Colourful graffiti look good during elections but they lose their beauty after getting discoloured. So, we will not allow the use of walls for political graffiti, Mamata said in what could be a significant gesture in changing the face of the city if she intends to follow through on the announcement.        
	Mamata did suggest an alternative to defuse possible allegations of assault on democracy  the usual excuse parties trot out to trample individual freedom and the right of house owners to keep their walls clean.        
	The civic body will set up 50 to 60 boards across the city. They will be at prominent locations and be properly illuminated and a few of them will be electronic boards. All the political parties should use these boards only to communicate their messages. The civic body will collect fees for renting out these boards, she told a meeting of the corporation for distributing health insurance cards to the poor.                
	Mamatas suggestion echoes a campaign run by The Telegraph for years against defacement of walls. The newspaper had also put up boards across the city before the 2006 Assembly polls, requesting political parties to spare walls.        
	If viewed against the backdrop of Mamatas earlier promise of turning Calcutta into a London, todays declaration may come across as part of a bigger plan.        
	But the announcement does not appear to be backed by a thought-out plan as Mamata has passed on the responsibility of protecting the walls to the newly sworn-in civic body.         
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee opted for a politically correct escape route. A decision like this will require political consensus. We will convene an all-party meeting in a month to decide on our next course of action, he said.        
	Consensus is a dirty word in Bengal politics right now. Mamata has refused to be part of any initiative mooted by the Left, which will give the ruling parties the perfect excuse to sabotage an unpalatable moratorium on what has come to be known as walling.        
	 Existing provisions do not allow defacement of government buildings under any circumstances. In the case of private buildings, written consent of the owner has to be obtained. If the norm is flouted, it can invite a fine of Rs 50,000 and a six-month prison term.        
	The provisions, however, remain on paper as most parties choose to ignore the rules.         
	Graffiti is so deeply entrenched in the system that leader of Opposition and Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee told The Telegraph that parties had no choice but to rely on walls.        
	If there was state funding of elections, the question of doing away with graffiti could have been considered. Moreover, walls are the journals of the common people, Partha Chatterjee said.        
	Such romantic notions had spurred him to take part in an all-party meeting before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and protest against the Election Commissions fiat that wall graffiti wouldnt be allowed.        
	Partha Chatterjees misgivings found a sympathetic echo at the other end of the political spectrum, never mind the twain shall not meet on any other issue.        
	Rupa Bagchi, Left Front leader of the Opposition in the CMC, said: The proposal to use boards located at prominent places does not make sense. For example, if we have a political programme in east Calcutta, can a board on Camac Street be of any help?        
	After the 2006 Assembly elections, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took the initiative  with full support from all parties  to repeal an anti-defacement act.        
	However, Mamatas other wish  an end to indiscriminate sprouting of billboards along Calcuttas skyline  has a chance of coming true. She said the billboards were obstructing a proper view of the sky.         
	To fulfil this vision of his leader, mayor Sovan Chatterjee had a clear answer: We will frame a guideline on billboards in Calcutta.

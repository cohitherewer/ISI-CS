  - 7 MPs suspended, evicted
      
	New Delhi, Mar 9 (PTI): The Rajya Sabha today began discussion on the Women's Reservation Bill a day after it was moved in the House for consideration but could not be taken up because of unruly scenes with some members even trying to attack Chairman Hamid Ansari.   
	After three adjournments and suspension and eviction of seven disruptive members, the House took up the debate at 3 PM amid vociferous protests from members of SP and RJD, who were opposing the historic bill and demanding withdrawal of the suspension order.   
	Before the discussion began, the House witnessed an unusual development wherein the Chairman put the Constitution (108th Amendment) Bill, granting 33 per cent reservation to women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies, to voice vote but later called for a debate on it.   
	Ansari put the bill, moved yesterday for consideration, to voice vote as the suspended members, squatting in the well for three hours, refused to budge and continued to chant slogans to disrupt the proceedings. But when the Chairman called for division of votes, members of BJP and Left parties, which are supporting the bill, objected and wanted a debate.   
	UPA ally Trinamool Congress says it will not participate in voting in Rajya Sabha on the Women's Reservation Bill; objects to the way bill was taken up for consideration  
	Meanwhile, marshals were ordered eviction of the suspended members - Subhash Yadav (RJD), Sabir Ali (LJP), Veerpal Singh Yadav, Nand Kishore Yadav, Amir Alam Khan and Kamal Akhtar (all SP), and Ejaz Ali (Unattached), who had yesterday created unprecedented pandemonium and even tried to attack Ansari.

  - Death in the mountains of the northeast          OUR BUREAU                                               
	Silchar, April 2: In the battle between Man and the mountains of the Northeast, the former continues to lose, sadly without seeming to learn a lesson, no matter what the toll in terms of human lives.         
	The latest disaster has come from Assam where three children aged 7, 5 and 2 were crushed to death after the side of a mountain slid onto their house in Cachar, wiping it out. Their parents, Deepak and Supriti Roy, who survived the catastrophe were seriously injured.         
	A torrential downpour  some 26 inches on the rain gauge  over the past few days loosened the earth leading to the tragedy at the reserved forest village of Paglanala under Dholai block in the states Cachar district.         
	In the reckless destruction of mountains  be it in the name of development or the creation of more living space  there have been instances of entire convoys of passenger traffic being stranded in the mountains of the region because of landslides. In one instance in 2006, a busload of passengers on their way to Agartala in Tripura watched helplessly as a new slide carried the giant vehicle into a river in the ravine below. Luckily, they had alighted from the bus moments earlier because of a slide that had occurred earlier.         
	Solutions to the problem, meanwhile, have been few and far between. Apart from widening roads and building guard walls  and these arent always enough to hold back a mountain quite literally on the move  Meghalaya, for example, has built tunnels through mountains, including a 120-metre construction through the Sonapur range in the states Jaintia Hills.         
	But as a senior official in the state government confides: Landslides in other parts of the state continue to be a cause for concern. Often, the concern involves that caused by the death of people who have been buried alive by mountains.         
	In Guwahati, the  Gateway to the Northeast  landslides have claimed scores of lives over the past years. Most hills around the city are unfit for human habitation as they are made up of fragile, loose alluvial soil, says Jiten Malakar, divisional officer of the states soil conservation department.         
	That, though, has not prevented Guwahatis steadily growing population from occupying the citys hills  legally or illegally, with laws such as the Assam Hill Land and Ecological Sites (Protection and Management) Act, a piece of legislation meant to prevent the destruction of hills leading just about nowhere in this mad scramble for land.         
	Some of the primary reasons for landslides in the city hills are loose and fragile soil, lack of vegetative cover, and depredation due to human activities such as encroachment, illegal hill cutting, says Malakar.         
	A survey carried out by the conservation department some years ago found that nearly 3,000 hectares on the citys Kalapahar, Nabagraha, Soonsali, Fatasil, Japorigog and Geetanagar hills were extremely vulnerable to landslides, while about 300 hectares on Nilachal hill (home to the famous Kamakhya shrine), 200 hectares on Jalukbari hill (adjacent to Gauhati University) and 56 hectares on Sarania hill (a thickly-populated area smack in the middle of Guwahati) were categorised as dangerous for human habitation.         
	Worst of all, the Northeasts real rains are yet to set in. The disaster in Silchar, for one, was caused by pre-monsoon showers that have lashed the region over the last few days. The worst then could be yet to come.

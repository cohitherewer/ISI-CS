	Rabi Mondols eyes were closed and hands folded. Standing outside Hare School on College Street, the 32-year-old electrician from Tara Chand Dutta Street was praying.        
	The initial trends are not encouraging. I hope my party maintains the momentum it gained in the Lok Sabha elections last year, muttered the die-hard Mamata Banerjee supporter around 9.30am, when Left Front candidates were going neck and neck with those of the Trinamul Congress.                               M for mania: What Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya defined as ldquo;mob hysteria rdquo; for Trinamul, was evident in mdash; (from left) a car near Nicco Park , a foam shower near Mamata rsquo;s home and a bike brigade in Alipore. (Pradip Sanyal, Amit Datta, Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)    
	An hour later, the picture had changed. A smiling Mondol reached into his trouser pocket. When he brought his hands out, he was holding a fistful of green abir.        
	I bought abir yesterday but did not want to bring it out before becoming sure that my party was going to win the election. Now we are going to celebrate, said Mondol, before blowing a bugle.       
	Hundreds of Trinamul supporters who had been anxiously tracking trends erupted in jubilation at the sound. Huge party flags appeared from nowhere and covered the sky. Slogans like Jidhar Mamata, udhar janta and Thanda thanda, cool cool, jeete gelo Trinamul filled the air.        
	More youths arrived on motorcycles, carrying abir, flags and badges with Mamatas picture and distributed these among supporters.         
	The scenes in south Calcutta, Trinamuls bastion, were no different. The party supporters were celebrating outside every counting centre.         
	Those outside Ballygunge Government School  many were waiting since dawn with party flags and abir  were the most jubilant. The party won all the 11 seats, whose votes were being counted in the school. We have won all the seats in borough VIII. Its a clean sweep for us, yelled Sayan Chakraborty to every familiar face he saw around him.     
	The party workers paraded a man in his mid-40s, wearing a garland of edible oil bottles and packets of cereals. This is to say that the Left Front government is responsible for the price hike and the results reflect that, said Chakraborty.                     
	Trinamul supporters outside Jodhpur Park Girls High School, another counting centre, could scarcely believe the change in the partys fortunes. Last time, we won only two out of the seven seats in borough XII. This time we won six seats in there, declared Pranab Dey, who had been standing outside the school for hours.

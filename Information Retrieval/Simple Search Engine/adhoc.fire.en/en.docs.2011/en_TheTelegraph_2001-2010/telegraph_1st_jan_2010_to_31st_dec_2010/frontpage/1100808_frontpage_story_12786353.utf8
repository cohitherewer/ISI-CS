          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Vijayawada, Aug. 7: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, who went full throttle against the Manmohan Singh government today, chose to spare the Congress in the context of Bengal and instead focused his attack on Trinamul Congress and the Maoists.        
	For the right wing forces, for those who draw their sustenance from imperialism, the bloody violence against the CPM and the Left Front in West Bengal is of no concern. More than 250 members and supporters of the CPM have been killed by TMC-Maoist gangs. The TMC is part of the central government. Such violence and attacks on democratic rights in West Bengal presage an authoritarian trend which bodes ill for the whole country, he said at the extended central committee meeting here.        
	The meeting is being held to discuss the strategy for the Bengal and Kerala Assembly elections next year.         
	The section dealing with Bengal in the draft political resolution that Karat placed at the meeting also did not mention the Congress, and only spoke of the Trinamul-Maoist nexus and attacks on the CPM.         
	Bengal CPM leaders are against blind anti-Congressism. They see Trinamul as their main enemy and want to keep open the option of a tactical adjustment with the Congress. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had, in a recent attempt to divide the Opposition in the Assembly, urged the Congress to help him weed out Maoists.        
	Karat appeared to have made peace with this line for Bengal, while attacking the Congress at the Centre. What the chieftains of big business in the US and India propose, the Manmohan Singh government accepts and implements, he said, and lashed out at the Centre on price rise, food security and the nuclear deal.        
	According to a Bengal CPM leader, Bhattacharjee and the state unit have no problem with Karats anti-Congress line on national issues.         
	After the Lok Sabha elections, the proposed chemical hub project is more than lost. Same is the case with the deep sea port. The nuclear power plant in Haripur is a distant dream So, an anti-Congress line on national issues doesnt bother us. What we needed was a state-specific party line, said a former CPM MP attending the four-day session.        
	Asked about the concession granted to the Bengal unit, a CPM central committee member said: Trinamul is hand-in-glove with the Maoists.         
	They are killing our men and innocent people. Trinamul is supporting the Maoists in places where we have a strong base even after the Lok Sabha election reverses, in order to establish its foothold. Our Bengal party felt this should be highlighted by Karat.         
	The Prime Minister has already declared that Maoists are the biggest menace in our country now. So why should we blame the Congress for such incidents? We want to show the people of Bengal that the Congress and Trinamul have a vast difference of opinion on the Maoist issue and that Trinamul sympathises with killers.

  - AGP prepares to oust Cong in Assam          A STAFF REPORTER                                                 AGP leader Prafulla Kumar Mahanta in Guwahati on Tuesday. Picture by Eastern Projections		      
	Guwahati, Sept. 21: The leader of the AGP Legislature Party, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, today set the agenda for the partys legislators, the thrust of which was to work unitedly, vigorously and with responsibility to implement the partys plans and programmes to oust the Congress from power in next years Assembly elections.         
	The meeting assumes importance as this was Mahantas first since taking over as the AGPLP leader from party president Chandra Mohan Patowary who was conspicuous by his absence because of unavoidable circumstances.         
	After the meeting that lasted for over three hours and was attended by 19 of the 24 MLAs, Mahanta told the media at the packed Assembly canteen that the AGPLP had basically dealt with three issues. The first was to stress on the duty and responsibility of the legislators to ensure that the party line in the run-up to the elections was implemented with earnestness as it was the wish of the people to see a change at Dispur.         
	The second issue was the inter-state border dispute. Given the suffering of the people living in border areas, the AGPLP has decided to send a team to take stock of the situation. Thirdly, the AGPLP has taken strong exception to the implementation of the chief ministers Anna Suraksha Yojana and other welfare schemes by allegedly ignoring the legislators, particularly the Opposition MLAs, in gross violation of their rights.         
	Therefore, we have decided to move the governor and the chief secretary seeking restoration of the rights of the legislators in implementation of the pro-poor rice scheme. As legislators, people seek answers from us but the fact is that legislators, those from the Opposition, have been completely ignored. We want their rights restored, Mahanta said.         
	The former chief minister laid stress to drive home the point that there was no disconnect between the party and the legislators after he took over from Patowary as the leader of the Opposition by virtue of his being the AGPLP leader.                           
	This was underlined by his response to Patowarys absence.         
	The date for the meeting was fixed with his consent. He could not attend as he had some genuine reasons, Mahanta said.         
	Even senior AGPLP members, including Kamala Kalita, Anup Phukan and J.P. Das, toed the same line when asked whether Patowarys presence would have sent the right message to the party workers and supporters.         
	Both the party president and AGPLP leader will be meeting soon to chalk out a future course of action. There is nothing amiss, Kalita said.         
	They pointed to the joint participation of Mahanta and Patowary in the Jana Sanjog rallies as well as the general house meeting yesterday to prove that everything was hunky-dory.         
	The response to the Jana Sanjog rallies has energised the party. More such programmes will be launched in the run-up to the elections. The AGPLP is part of the party. We are under the party and we are all united. As legislators we have a duty to ensure that the party remains strong in our constituencies, Phukan said.

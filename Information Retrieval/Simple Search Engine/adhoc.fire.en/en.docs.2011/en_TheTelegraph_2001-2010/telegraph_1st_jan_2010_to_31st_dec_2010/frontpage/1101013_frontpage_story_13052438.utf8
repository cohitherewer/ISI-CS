          MANINI CHATTERJEE                            PT Usha cups the face of Srabani Nanda as S Geetha, PK Priya and HM Jyothi look on. Usha presented them with the bronze for the womens 4x100m relay at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: The monsoon, late and intense, had finally departed. The open air Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium shone beneath a cloudless autumn sky.         
	It was for the first time in our lives that we  cynical hacks who usually revelled in covering the seedy underbelly of politics and crime  had entered a sports stadium to watch something other than football or cricket. Two of us had not even experienced that.        
	We were not alone. As we pushed and shoved our way into the packed Metro and then stood in serpentine queues to enter the stadium, everyone around us seemed to have come with the same purpose in mind.         
	The Games were coming to an end, it was the last day of events at the showpiece stadium, tickets were sold out for all the high-profile games such as hockey and badminton, and the closing ceremony (if you managed a pass) would offer not sports but a cultural extravaganza.        
	In the run-up to the Games, we had cried ourselves hoarse against the upheaval it had caused the city. Now that the city was gleaming and the mood had changed as sharply as Delhis extreme weather, we just wanted a chance to bask under the floodlights and see a bit of CWG live  expecting nothing more than the buzz that large crowds ignite.        
	And then it suddenly began to rain. First a trickle, then a drizzle and finally a torrent. Of medals.        
	As the stadium erupted in collective hysteria and we found ourselves joining the relentless chorus of India, India, India, it felt like manna from heaven.        
	But the skies had not opened  it was all happening in the field far below us as sweat and stamina, beauty and grace, strength and agility created a joyous alchemy and Indian athletes were picking up medals in practically every sport on show.        
	Like children running from one stall to another at a village mela, we kept shifting our gaze from one event to the other  from men in the far left corner throwing their javelins high into the sky to another barely visible group on the other side of the stadium lithely leaping in the triple jump final; a superb display of pole-vaulting skills to our right and all across the field one race after another 4x100m womens relay and 4x100m mens relay, the 5000m race and then the 1600m relay.        
	Everything seemed to be happening all at once, and the giant screens kept switching from one game to another. Look, my colleague cried, jumping excitedly like a school boy, India might win a medal in javelin.         
	Before I could read the scores on the big screen (yes, there was India somewhere near the top), another pointed to the triple jump  Look, look, look,  that man in blue  he is India.        
	Then the girls came on  4x100m relay. We dont have P.T. Usha or Shiny Abraham any more  dont raise your hopes, I said, showing off my next-to-nothing knowledge about Indian track artistes, but got caught up in the chant Go for it, go for it as our girls steadily increased their pace with each lap.        
	Yes, yes, yes, yes, we are winning  I heard, (by which time I had shut my eyes and crossed all fingers on either hand)  and then the cry: We have won the bronze.                                
	My colleague, overjoyed by last nights discus queens, said: Remember, M.S. Gill had likened the Games to a daughters wedding. And Indias daughters are doing us proud.         
	Almost as if the men had heard it down below, we were treated to a repeat performance  this time it was the mens 4x100m relay and again we won the bronze. We followed that up with two more bronzes  in the mens javelin throw and triple jump.        
	For most of us who had come to see the lights and hear the music and enjoy the carnival, two bronzes were good enough. Two more were much too much. Our voice hoarse from shouting, we sat back to catch our breath and watched the gazelle-like grace of the Kenyan women  winning all three medals in the 5000m race  as though we were connoisseurs of such sublime artistry. There was no emotion involved here, you see, we could afford to be aesthetes.        
	Then our girls were back again  this time in the far more demanding 4x400m relay. Before we knew what hit us, they were catching up and finally (my eyes were even more tightly shut than before, my head in my hands) I heard a deafening sound  neither human nor divine which sounded like GOOOOLLLD!        
	Yesterday, Indian women made history by winning the first gold in a track and field event since Milkha Singh. Today, they went one better  they had won their first gold in a pure track contest.        
	But we werent really concerned with the statistics. We knew little and cared less. What we did know was that we had witnessed something magical tonight.         
	We had not seen a Sachin or a Saina or a Sania  we did not know the names of our winners and would not have recognised them if they had sat next to us in the stadium. You can describe their achievements today with all the adjectives you want  fantastic, glorious, splendid, stupendous. In the end, though, the adjectives are useless, for what they gave us was an ineffable joy.        
	We considered ourselves lucky when we entered the stadium this evening. With the strains of Jana Gana Mana reverberating in the air, we felt blessed as we walked out into the star-spangled night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | At play: English craze
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                At play: English craze
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Language of desperation                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: The slum girl begging on an east Delhi street holds out her hand. Me also English, give me Rs 10, Sarohi says.        
	The preparations for the Commonwealth Games arent limited to the huge constructions at every major junction in the city, they are evident at every street corner.        
	Hail a cab and the driver will try his English on you. Hand an urchin a coin, he is most likely to blurt out: Thank you.        
	And if you are catching a train, brace yourself for at least 15 minutes of broken Hinglish from the oh-so-polite porters trying to direct you to the correct platform.        
	Sarohi and her kind are not part of the razzmatazz of the Games; they are just among the thousands in Delhi who are hoping their chalta hai English would give them that extra edge, er, dollar when the Games kick off in October.        
	The preparations, they say, started months ago.         
	I learnt the language from a bhaiya in our basti who now teaches many of us English at night. Some of the older kids told me that many foreigners will come to Delhi during the Games, and asking them for money in Hindi would be useless, says Sarohi, who is now practising her newly acquired skills on thoroughbred Indians, surprising them into giving her a tenner.        
	She is learning the language along with five of her siblings all of whom are on the streets, earning for their family of nine.        
	The small-time, private spoken-English classes, which had to run on 10-15 students a day, are now overflowing with street children.        
	I had two or three underprivileged children coming to my home for tuition. I mostly taught them Hindi and mathematics. A month ago, this kid came to me and said her father, a cab driver, wanted to learn English so he could interact with the Games tourists, says Sushma Singh, a teacher at a government school.        
	Vijay Babli, a tourist guide who had picked up some English, is cashing in on the demand.        
	I started holding English classes four months ago. Most of my students are beggars and some are tourist guides. I dont charge a heavy fee because I know I am doing them some good. Hopefully they will make good money during the Games, he says.        
	Babli runs his classes in the slums of northwest Delhi and claims to be teaching more than 1,000 children, also training them to identify different kinds of foreign currency.        
	NGOs say that 32 such coaching classes, dedicated only to teaching spoken English, have sprung up in northwest Delhis slums in the past few months. The tutors make Rs 1,000-1,200 a month.        
	The beggars arent the only ones gearing up to make a good impression on firang tourists. The railway ministry launched a project on Tuesday to groom 2,800 porters in the Delhi division for the Games.        
	During their two-hours-a-day, fortnight-long training, the porters will be taught five English sentences every day. Each porter will then teach two colleagues.        
	For visitors to Delhi, the coolies are the first point of interaction. We want every visitor to return with a friendly image of the city, said Ashwini Lohani, deputy regional manager, Delhi division, while launching the programme.        
	The training will include soft skills and courtesy to passengers. The porters will provide foreign and domestic visitors with information on places of tourist interest, taxi fares, the way to the Games stadium and the like. We are also looking at changing their red uniform to something more aesthetic.        
	The government launched a massive training programme in October for taxi and auto drivers at the Haryana Institute of Public Administration, Gurgaon, that includes lessons in personal grooming, courtesy, hygiene and, of course, English. Many cabbies who do not find the class timings convenient are, however, taking private tuition.        
	At the traffic signals and taxi stands, though, all one gets to hear is a smattering of pidgin English. But, as Sarohi says: You speak a little bit, baki sab chalta hai.        
	I dont know if I will remember anything I have been taught for any length of time. Words like thank you and excuse me are the ones I will need the most, says Satvir Singh, a taxi driver who has learnt his English from a local teacher. But dont ask me to speak a sentence, he grins. I not know that, he adds, in English.

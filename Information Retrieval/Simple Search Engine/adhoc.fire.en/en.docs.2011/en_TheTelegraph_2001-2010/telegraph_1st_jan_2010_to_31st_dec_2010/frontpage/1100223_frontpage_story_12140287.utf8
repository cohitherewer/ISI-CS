          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: An Oscar-winning screenplay writer who also directed The Piano has accused one of the organisers of the India International Womens Film Festival (IIWFF) of harassing her and making advances to other women filmmakers in December.        
	Jane Campion, who won the Oscar for the screenplay of The Piano in 1993, has levelled the charge against Bhaskar Deb, the husband of festival director Shyamali Banerjee.         
	A filmmaker from Pakistan, Ayesha Arif Khan, also alleged that she was repeatedly mauled by a drunken Bhaskar and constantly offered alcohol, which she refused.         
	The complaints were made in two letters sent to the office of the minister of state for urban development, Saugata Roy. The letters were forwarded to Delhi police, which said the case was being investigated.        
	I am not the only filmmaker to be badly treated. Many other women experienced rude and even lewd advances from the husband of the festival director and all felt shocked and angry that such a brazen fraud could be allowed to proceed unimpeded by the Indian authorities, Campion wrote in the letter dated December 16, soon after the fifth edition of the festival was over in Delhi.        
	Deb said the allegation was a plot to malign him and the festival. I havent even met Campion. She came on the 15th and disappeared to Jaipur on the 16th. Its all a pack of lies, Deb said.         
	The 55-year-old Campion has also alleged that she decided to be part of the festival because the organisers claimed that the urban development ministry was involved.         
	Deb said the IIWFF had planned to hold the festival in collaboration with the ministry but it backed out at the last minute.        
	The organisers made promises to pay $10,000 Australian for me and my daughters business class tickets on December 16, 2009, which has not been done so far. They behaved very rudely, Campion said.         
	Deb claimed that the IIWFF had promised to pay Campion the money, provided she made appearances at the venue and met the media. She didnt meet anyone and left for Jaipur without telling anyone. A small event like IIWFF couldnt afford to pay her for something she didnt fulfil, he said.        
	Filmmaker Khan said in her letter that on the evening of December 17, Bhaskars friends knocked on the door of my hotel room repeatedly and asked me to join them at a roof-top party. I was asked thrice to give company to various Bhaskar cronies knocking on my door. It was the same show of extreme lechery and drunkenness.        
	Deb said that on December 17, Khan had taken out his daughter for gol gappas and offered to take her to a late-night show of Paa. If she was so upset with me, she should have complained to the police. Why write to the urban development ministry? Campion wrote to my wife too, airing her problems with the IIWFF Why didnt she say I harassed her in that letter? Deb asked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Two more bacteria detected   No change in Basu status

          OUR BUREAU                            Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, who visited Jyoti Basu on Friday morning, created ripples by claiming that the ailing leader had waved at him in the hospital. A member of the medical board said it was not possible for the sedated Basu to wave at someone. His senses are partially active and so he is moving his limbs because of pain or otherwise. The former Prime Minister may have mistaken it as a gesture from Basu, the doctor said. Picture by Biswaroop Dutta                                         
	Calcutta/New Delhi, Jan. 8: Doctors treating Jyoti Basu came across a fresh challenge today when a test report revealed the presence of two more bacterial infections in his lungs.        
	A lung-fluid culture report highlighted the existence of pseudomonas and klebsiella, two varieties of Gram-negative bacilli. These were in addition to acinetobacter, the presence of which the doctors had apprehended earlier.        
	The presence of three bacteria could create complications because of Basus age (95), an expert said. Pseudomonas is a dangerous bacteria not commonly found and is resistant to common antibiotics. Also, three combined bacterial infections can cause complications and will require high doses of antibiotics, said Dhruba Neogi, former director, School of Tropical Medicine, Calcutta.        
	The doctors said the overall condition of Basu, who was hospitalised with pneumonia, remained unchanged. He was still on partial ventilator support.         
	There is minimum inotropic (blood pressure stabilising) required now. He is breathing partly on his own. However, the urine output was irregular during the day but improved in the evening, a doctor said. The amount of sedative has also being reduced.        
	The test report came soon after doctors of AMRI Hospital, where Basu is admitted, and AIIMS, New Delhi, held a teleconference. During the 45-minute discussion, we briefed the AIIMS specialists about his health history, investigations, findings and course of treatment. They told us that it was satisfactory, the doctor said.        
	The AIIMS specialists also agreed that the biggest worrying factors were Basus age and his history of cardiac problems. Last night, Basus heartbeat had become irregular and had to be stabilised with medicine, said an attending doctor. Medicines later stabilised the heartbeat.        
	AIIMS doctors have cautioned that Basus condition remains grim, though not hopeless yet. If he pulls through and recovers completely, it will be a medical feat considering his age and his other underlying health conditions, a source said.        
	AIIMS sources have said pneumonia in geriatric patients is by itself considered a serious illness, and Basus underlying heart condition magnifies the medical challenge of managing the infection.         
	The infection can put a strain on the heart and a strain on the kidneys  this can complicate things, a source said. While doctors try to manage the primary bacterial infection of the lungs with antibiotics, they also have to ensure that other organs such as the heart and the kidneys are not damaged while they wait for the infection to be erased.         
	Which is why the team of AIIMS specialists consulted today included a pulmonologist, a cardiologist, a critical care specialist, a kidney specialist, a gastroenterologist and a neurologist.        
	Geriatric patients on a ventilator carry a guarded prognosis, a source said. In medical circles, guarded prognosis refers to a very serious but not entirely hopeless situation. Patients do occasionally recover with aggressive treatment, he added.

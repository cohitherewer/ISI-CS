The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Golden Asiad, brazen Games
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Golden Asiad, brazen Games
          AVEEK SEN                      Appu, the 1982 Asiad mascot                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: They could be called the Golden Games and the Brazen Games. As the CWG taste-in-the-mouth threatens to turn into an unsavoury mix of greed, sloth, shame, muck and bother, another event that happened 28 years ago is coming to stand for a golden age from which the nation has fallen into its current brazenness.        
	To many, the 1982 Delhi Asiad is beginning to represent everything that the Commonwealth Games seem to have rudely betrayed. And the difference between the two Games  rather, between how they were organised  is a measure of the dubious progress made by the Indian democracy in these three decades.        
	In the last few days, I have been speaking to a number of senior and retired bureaucrats in Calcutta and in North Block, and detected in all of them a combination of hurt, noble contempt, and a somewhat misty-eyed nostalgia.        
	They had all been given immensely difficult responsibilities in the organisation of the Asian Games in the early years of their career, followed by Asiad Vishisht Jyotis after they had discharged them with evident success.         
	So the hurt comes from being left out entirely and made to feel superannuated when another such event is being organised  and upon the very foundations they had helped to build from scratch. Their contempt is for the calibre of the people who have chosen to ignore them and taken their places at the helm.        
	And the nostalgia is for a time when national pride and commitment did not sound like words out of an old-fashioned lexicon of misplaced patriotism. Thank God weve been ignored, said one of them. Imagine working for Suresh Kalmadi after working for Buta Singh. Of course, he added immediately, Not that Buta Singh was, even in those days, what you Bengalis would call a Ganga-washed basil-leaf (his translation of Ganga-jole dhoa tulsi-pata). But how quaint pre-Bofors corruption looks next to privatised and liberalised looting!        
	None of these nostalgic men wanted to be named. But while looking for documents from the times whose passing they rued anonymously, I came upon a slim, out-of-print and forgotten volume called The Asiad Stadia.        
	Published in 1988 by the National Book Trust, it was written by Subrata Basu and Sumit Dutt Majumder. Both members of the Indian Revenue Service then, Basu was director-in-charge of stadium management and Dutt Majumder an under-secretary in the Special Organising Committee (SOC) chaired by Buta Singh. They were both later awarded Asiad Vishisht Jyotis.        
	The book is a detailed account of the high drama of suspense and excitement, agony and ecstasy, of the construction activity in connection with the preparation for IX Asian Games, of how in the end, innumerable engineers, architects and workers emerged as victorious in the battle against time.

	They had two years to build 11 new stadiums and renovate seven existing ones. The authors meticulousness kept reminding me of how the British recorded for posterity everything they were building in the colonies, from capital cities to railways.         
	And indeed, the Olympian audacity of the Asiad lay not in its vaulting budgets but in a vision of history  an idea of India  that saw the new constructions as continuous with Delhis ancient origins while also moving the city towards an unprecedented modernity.         
	This vision was not only civic and technological (flyovers, hotels, housing, colour TV, astroturf), but also epic and mythic, harking back through Nehrus Discovery of India to the Mahabharat.         
	The Indraprastha Stadium, for instance, is an all-time great, in the book, not because it is in league with the Houston Astrodome and the New Orleans Superdome, but because it is located around the same site where the city of Indraprastha was built by the Pandavas about four thousand years ago.         
	Its architect, Sharat Dass, describes how he drew an axis around the Ashok Pillar and selected the central point of the stadium on the axis, so that while coming out of the stadium one would see the pillar against the vastness of the sky.         
	And the race against time that the building of the stadium became was transcended eventually by its circular form, which symbolised the equality of all the spectators seated in it and the Indian philosophy of time and death.         
	But looking back now, what the forgotten builders of the Asiad miss most is not so much this predilection for symbolism as a certain style of governance: a government exercising direct control and tighter vigilance, with a minister heading the SOC, made up of distinct but interlocking and mutually accountable directorates supervised by younger civil servants.         
	This is no vision of a minimal state that hesitates to intrude, but its exact opposite. One senior North Blocker described the CWG mess as a busy chowrasta without traffic signals and policemen. In contrast, the Asiad was policed and motivated relentlessly by a Prime Minister who was always there  instead of being shadowy and silent  either in her own person or in the person of her son, then only an MP without any public office.         
	Rajiv (Gandhi) was christened in the fire of the Asian Games, I was told dramatically. If the Asiad had failed, then his political career would have started with a failure, the bureaucrat said. Victor One was Rajivs code name on the walkie-talkie that he carried as he drove his own car from site to site with hardly any security.         
	It was while recalling how closely he used to work with Rajiv, and how minutely and inspiringly the latter was involved at every level of putting the Games together, that this Delhi bureaucrats nostalgia as well as his criticism of the present mode of non-governance became the warmest: Where is Rahul now? If you have to be dynastic, then why miss the best chance of letting him prove himself? If the government had to intervene in a last-minute attempt to salvage the crisis, why keep itself distant for so long? Was it because the leadership actually had little confidence in India managing to pull the show off that it stayed away from the Games and let the Olympic Association and OC people take over? What does this insecurity and diffidence mean?

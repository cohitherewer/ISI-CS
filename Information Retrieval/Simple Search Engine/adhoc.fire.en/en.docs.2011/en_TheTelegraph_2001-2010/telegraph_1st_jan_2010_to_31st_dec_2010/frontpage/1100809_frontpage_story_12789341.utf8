  - Party leaders feel victimised by state        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 8: The Raj Bhavan is facing flak from an unlikely quarter  the Congress party.        
	The partys state unit has decided to complain to the high command about the Raj Bhavans style of functioning. However, before that, a delegation will meet Governor M..H. Farook on Tuesday to air the partys grievances.        
	The state is under Presidents rule and our opponents claim we are ruling Jharkhand from the backdoor. Yet we are feeling victimised by the state administration, Congress legislature party leader Rajendra Prasad Singh complained.         
	He added that the state unit would take up the issue with the high command if the governor failed to rein in erring officials.         
	Besides, the governor should also dissolve the House and hold elections before the Bihar polls, he said.        
	The party had called a meeting two days ago to draw a strategy on how to deal with Raj Bhavan.         
	Sisai MLA Geetashree Oraon is said to have told party leaders that earlier she was flooded with phone calls. However, now nobody approached her as officials were not listening to politicians.        
	Singh, however, refused to criticise the governor openly and insisted the party had no grudge against Farook or his advisers. We are upset with a coterie of officials who are misleading the governor into taking decisions against public interest, he said.        
	The Congress leader said rural development secretary S.K. Satpathy was misguiding the governor about release of MLALAD funds for schemes recommended before imposition of Presidents rule in June.         
	Most of these schemes are related to installation of hand pumps and digging ponds, which would have helped tackle the drought situation, Singh said, adding that out of 3,600 red card holders at Jaridih block in Bokaro, only 2,100 were getting foodgrains.         
	The Congress also wanted the governor to declare the whole state as drought-hit. Congress leaders from Palamau, headed by Pradeep Balmuchu and Singh, will soon embark on a padayatra to declare the whole of Palamau drought-hit.         
	Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay is also upset that the state urban development department is constructing government buildings on the HEC campus. Since the area is in Sahays constituency and the move will result in displacement of a large number of illegal occupants, it is making Sahay uneasy, said a Congress MLA.        
	There is also more than meets the eye.        
	According to sources, some Congressmen are baying for Dumka deputy commissioner Prashant Kumars blood after he refused to meet Congress district president Shyamal Kishore Singh.                                 
	Similarly, they also want Bokaro SP Saket Singh to be transferred following the arrest of the partys district president Rama Raut on a complaint filed by the Bokaro Steel management.        
	A section of Congress leaders is also upset with the decision to withdraw special privileges to former chief ministers.         
	The decision to hand over cases from Madhu Kodas regime to the vigilance bureau has also not gone down well. As several Congress leaders reportedly benefited during Kodas time, such a move they feel would land them in a soup.        
	However, public opinion is in favour of the Raj Bhavan. The Raj Bhavan is certainly trying to bring the state on the right track. I believe politicians are feeling insecure under Presidents rule, but the general public is happy, said former IMA national vice president Ajay Kumar Singh.        
	Congress MP Ram Dayal Munda also batted for the governor, saying party leaders were trying to hide their own weaknesses. Instead of making a trip to Delhi to lodge a complaint, they should go to the grassroot level and expand the party base, he told The Telegraph.        
	The governor is committed to working in the interest of the public, rising above party politics, a Raj Bhavan spokesman said.

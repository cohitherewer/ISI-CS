The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Brawny Brazil mirrors growth of a nation
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Brawny Brazil mirrors growth of a nation
                                            
	Truly, no World Cup can ever be said to have begun until Brazil have taken to the pitch.        
	Not only is it the talent and matchless technique of whoever happens to be pulling on the inspirational yellow and green, Brazil at the World Cup is also about the samba rhythms and the flags and, yes, the beautiful girls.        
	Brazil, who play North Korea on Tuesday, at the World Cup finals are not merely a football team  such as Germany or Italy or Holland or Argentina  they are an experience.        
	This is the aura of the worlds greatest football nation. This is why so many people in football are looking forward already with a sense of excited anticipation to the finals of 2014, back in Brazil.        
	No matter the immense questions over whether the country will be ready; Fifa secretary-general Jerome Valcke is asked at every media conference  whatever the theme  about whether the Morumbi stadium in Sao Paulo will be ready for the opening match.        
	Brazil will be granted much more leeway for error than, for example, South Africa now. No one will question the samba drums, the whistles, the carnival cacophony and the congo-dancing passion which weaves in among the formal seating as xenophobic visitors deride the vuvuzelas now.        
	This is the magic of Brazil and one reason for the intense interest in their opening fixture against North Korea in the other Johannesburg stadium of Ellis Park.        
	For years Brazils football was about genius without discipline.                          
	Brazil are the only nation to have appeared in every World Cup finals tournament. But, for the first two-and-a-half decades of the event, they were misfits.         
	In 1938, they reached the semi-finals then rested their two best players  Leonidas and Tim  so they would be rested for the final, which a last-four defeat meant they never reached.        
	In 1950, as hosts, they took the lead against tiny neighbours Uruguay in the final match yet lost 2-1, a cause for national mourning; in 1954 they were halted at the quarter-final stage after losing their tempers in a 4-2 defeat by Hungary.        
	That all changed in 1958 and 1962 and 1970 and 1994 and 2002. Brazil are record five-time winners of the World Cup and, whatever may happen in the next four weeks in South Africa, no one can topple that crown.        
	This is a different Brazil from Peles teams of legend between 1958 and 1970. Technique and talent are not enough in the modern game; iron discipline and hard work are essential adjuncts.        
	Dunga personified that as a World Cup-winning captain in 1994 and he insists, as coach, on his team embodying his understanding of the modern game.        
	England manager Fabio Capello recognised the nature of the new Brazil after a friendly in Qatar last November. Afterwards, Capello told me: I have learned from this game. I have learned that Brazil are powerful and strong physically as well as technically. They are disciplined, they rarely give away the ball but when they do they work hard to get it back.        
	Also, they get a lot of men into midfield. You dont see three of their players just standing around in attack any more, waiting for the ball to be sent back to them. In Brazil nowadays they all chase back to regain possession. This is impressive.        
	Dunga attributes the physical presence of his team  for example big Lucio in central defence, wide-shouldered Kaka in front of midfield and powerful Luis Fabiano up front  to Brazils evolving social status on the global stage.        
	He says: What you see now is the result of the great progress Brazilian society has made over the past two or three decades in terms of nutrition, health and education.        
	Brazil represent, to perfection, the Olympic motto: Citius, Altius, Fortius  Faster, Higher, Stronger. Yet, oddly, the Olympic title is the only one which Brazil have never won. Several of the men who will face North Korea were in the squad that lost to Argentina in the semi-finals in Beijing in 2008.        
	A sixth World Cup win, of course, would be more than ample compensation.

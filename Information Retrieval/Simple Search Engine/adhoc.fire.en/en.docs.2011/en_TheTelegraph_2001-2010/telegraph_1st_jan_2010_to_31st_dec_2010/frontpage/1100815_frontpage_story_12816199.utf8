	New Delhi, Aug 15 (PTI): In a firm message, Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh Sunday asked agitating Kashmiri youth to end violence saying it would not benefit anyone even as he offered to carry forward the dialogue process within the framework of the state being an integral part of India.              
	Addressing the nation on the 64th Independence Day against the backdrop of recent unrest in Kashmir, he said the Indian democracy has the quot;generosity and flexibility quot; to address concerns of any group.              
	In his 35-minute speech from the ramparts of historic Red Fort, Singh said India is willing to resolve differences with Pakistan through discussions but the dialogue cannot go far if terrorism emanating from there does not end.

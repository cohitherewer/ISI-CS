	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees dry run at his favourite mission  promoting the information technology industry  ended on Wednesday when he launched an IT park, the first in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area.        
	Our largest IT companies are in Salt Lake Sector V, where 80,000 people work. Around 10,000 employees are working in the Rajarhat area. Then there is the IT park in Bantala. Now we have one in Nonadanga, said the chief minister after laying the foundation stone.         
	He did not mention the aborted projects  the 1,200-acre Bengal Diamond Vedic IT Links, 350-acre IT township at Jagadishpur in Rajarhat, and the 100-acre IT park in Kalyani  that the government had announced with much fanfare.         
	While the IT Links project was abandoned in 2009 following the Vedic Village flare-up, the IT township was scrapped following land acquisition problems. The IT park in Kalyani failed to take off as there were no takers.        
	The 10-acre Nonadanga park, just 10 minutes from Ruby Hospital, is being developed by Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which has provided the land and is aiming to bring investments of about Rs 500 crore initially.        
	This IT park will generate almost 10,000 jobs once it starts functioning, said principal secretary (IT) Siddharth.        
	The last IT park started successfully by the state government was the 130-acre one carved out of the Bantala leather complex in 2006. But even that had been grounded by pollution hurdles till a few months back when Cognizant Technology Solutions began operations there.        
	East Kolkata IT Park will be a major boost after bad luck dogged the IT departments effort for the past two years, said a senior official of a Sector V company who attended the ceremony.        
	Rolta, HSBC Electronic Data Processing India and HCL Infosystems are the three companies that have taken up space at the Park.        
	We are going to set up a software research and development unit here. We will invest Rs 250 crore and expect to generate 5,000 jobs, said Rolta chairman K.K. Singh.        
	A spokesperson for HCL Infosystems said it would set up a centre of excellence that would serve as the companys regional headquarters. Over 1,500 are expected to be employed at the hub.        
	IT minister Debesh Das, Webel chairman N.R. Banerjea, Webel managing director Tamal Dasgupta and Suman Ghosh Hazra, the executive vice president of HCL Infosystems, were present at the foundation stone laying ceremony.         
	The 1,000,000sq ft that will be developed in East Kolkata IT Park will be fully operational in the next two years.

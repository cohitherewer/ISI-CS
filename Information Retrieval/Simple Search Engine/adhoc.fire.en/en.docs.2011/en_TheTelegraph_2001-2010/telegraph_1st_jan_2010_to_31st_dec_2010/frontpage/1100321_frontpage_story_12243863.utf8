	March 20: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has postponed his Malda visit hours after district Congress president Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury said Mamata Banerjee was not welcome at the foundation ceremony on March 26 for an engineering institute named after his brother A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury.         
	A fax message from Special Protection Group director K.M. Yadav to the district magistrate late last night said the proposed visit of the Prime Minister to Malda (West Bengal) has been postponed.         
	On Thursday, Mamata had said she would attend the foundation ceremony where the Prime Minister was also expected.         
	Learning about the postponement, Abu Hashem immediately left for Calcutta from where he took a flight to Delhi this morning to try and persuade the Prime Minister to attend the event as scheduled.        
	The fax message from Delhi did not mention any reason for the postponement of the Prime Ministers visit.        
	Sources in the Prime Ministers Office said the visit was put off because of a meeting scheduled on that day with the Chinese vice-minister for agriculture.        
	Other sources acknowledged that they were aware of the differences between Abu Hashem and Mamata Banerjee but added that they were unsure if the deferment was related to the political tensions between the two. They sounded uncertain whether Singhs visit to Malda would take place before he left for the US on April 11.        
	The postponement of the visit prompted a softening of tone. Abu Hashem, apparently irked because Mamata had cold-shouldered his railway proposals for Malda, had said yesterday: I have made it clear to the Prime Minister that we will not allow her (Mamata) to take political advantage of such a solemn occasion.        
	Today, his brother Abu Naser said: Who said Mamata is unwelcome? This is nothing but propaganda. Mamata is very welcome.        
	Even Abu Hashem said from Delhi: Mamata is welcome to come to Malda. But why does she have to come to my event when she has stopped talking to me after I pointed out to her that Malda had been ignored in the railway budget?

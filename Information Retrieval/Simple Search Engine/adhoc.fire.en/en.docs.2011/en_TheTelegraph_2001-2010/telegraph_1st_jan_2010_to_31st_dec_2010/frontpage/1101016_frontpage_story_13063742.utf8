                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Forum hopes for Ulfa talks by November
  - Six committees set up by Sanmilita Jatiya Abhibartan to submit reports soon          ANUP SHARMA       
	Guwahati, Oct. 15: The Sanmilita Jatiya Abhibartan, a forum of prominent senior citizens, intellectuals and organisations, today said the peace initiative between Dispur and Ulfa was moving in the right direction and some concrete results could be expected by next month.        
	The claim comes in the wake of chief minister Tarun Gogois announcement late last month about talks with the outfit getting off the ground within two months.        
	Now that things are moving in the right direction, we do not have much of a role to play. We are now trying to mobilise public opinion in favour of the talks so that the peace initiative reaches its desired end, a source associated with the forum said.         
	The forum was formed on April 24 this year after holding a convention of individuals and organisations belonging to ethnic communities of the state. Its objective was to prepare a roadmap on the basis of which talks could take place between the two parties, paving the way for lasting peace in the state.         
	The source said they had formed six committees on six key issues concerning the state  on governance and constitution, economic development, financial system and employment, right over land and natural resources, security of indigenous people and infiltration, educational system and human resource development, and rights of the indigenous communities.         
	The committees have almost prepared their reports and we are expecting them to hand it to us by next month, the source said, adding that the forum would hand over the same to Ulfa, which, after perusing the reports and their recommendations, would formally participate in the talks process. Once we submit the reports of these six committees to the outfit, it is up to them and the central and state governments to take the process of holding talks forward, the source said, adding that the forums role would end there. As of now, we see things moving in a positive direction and hope that the talks will take place by next month, he said.         
	A six-member delegation of the forum had also met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Union home minister P. Chidambaram and other central leaders, including those of the Opposition, in New Delhi on June 21 this year and apprised them of the peace initiative.         
	With Dispur not objecting to the release of Ulfa leaders in custody, the forums claim suggests that Gogoi may not be far off the mark when he set the informal two-month deadline for the talks to start.

	London, Aug. 30: Archie Panjabi, the British actress of Indian origin who made her name in Bend it Like Beckham and likes doing Indian things but sometimes its nice to do something not Indian, has done something not very Indian: break through on American television and pick up an Emmy.        
	The 38-year-old won the Best Supporting Actress for The Good Wife, the hit TV show in which she plays an in-house private investigator of a law firm. Just amazing, a delighted Archie said last night in Los Angeles, as she walked up to collect the award, the television equivalent of an Oscar.        
	Working on The Good Wife for me is like a dream come true, Archie, short for Archana, said in an acceptance speech.        
	Although it is rare for people of Indian origin to win an Emmy, it is not unheard of. Waris Hussein, a London-based filmmaker who hails from a Lucknow family, won an Emmy in 1986 for outstanding direction in a variety/music programme.        
	Archie, who lives in London with husband Raj Nihalani, a master tailor with his own bespoke company Imperial Tailoring, told The Telegraph today she was glad ethnicity was not central to her character, Kalinda, in the US legal drama.        
	I started in England, and most of the roles I got were relevant to my ethnicity, first-time winner Archie said. We havent mentioned her ethnicity yet.... I think its the way it should be for young people  to watch television where the characters are from different backgrounds and ethnicity and its not all about their backgrounds.        
	Archie said Kalindas ethnicity wasnt the only thing that remained unclear  her sexual orientation was up for debate too. Normally I get to know my characters extremely well. Kalinda doesnt seem to open up to me, either.        
	So Im as taken aback by her mystery as the audience is, and her sexuality is one thing I still havent figured out. When she does confess to me, I will certainly reveal it, she joked.        
	The actress triumphed over fellow The Good Wife actress Christine Baranski and Mad Mens Elisabeth Moss. She also beat Sharon Gless in Burn Notice, Rose Byrne in Damages and Christina Hendricks, who is in the cast of Mad Men that is set in the world of advertising.        
	As Archie achieved her ambition, husband Nihalani revealed his secret hopes. Id like to get my hands on Amitabh Bachchan, he said, meaning it in the nicest possible way.        
	Nihalani said his plan was to get big Bollywood stars to come to him for their suits and shirts, so he needed to get my hands on them to measure them.        
	Good (Indian) wife that Archie is, she has been more than willing over the years to carry scripts in one hand and suits in the other, loyally delivering the latter to her husbands clients.        
	Many have long considered Archie to be one of the most talented actresses in the UK and, possibly, the most talented of Indian origin.        
	In 2005, she was in a film called A Good Year, an appropriate title because that was a breakthrough year for her. The film, directed by Ridley Scott and based on a book by Peter Mayle, was about an investment banker (played by Russell Crowe) who swaps London life for a vineyard in France.        
	In November that year, Archie was in Jaisalmer and Jodhpur for an Italian film. She was also in The Constant Gardener, based on John le Carres novel and starring Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz.        
	Also in 2005, Archie was in A Very Social Secretary, a television dramatisation of the events surrounding David Blunketts affair with Kimberly Fortier, the American publisher of The Spectator magazine. Blunkett (played very convincingly by Bernard Hill) was Britains home secretary at the time.        
	Critics said Archie was superb as Ashley, a political aide who was a composite of several characters and about the only one sympathetic to a blind man (Blunkett).        
	I like doing Indian things but sometimes its nice to do something not Indian, Archie said.        
	One of her most convincing roles was in a made-for-television UK film, Yasmin, which gives a sympathetic account of a Muslim girl forced by events to become a radical. In Gurinder Chadhas Bend It Like Beckham, she played the older sister of Parminder Nagra, an 18-year-old Punjabi girl infatuated with football.

	Behrampore/Sagardighi, Dec. 15: Pranab Mukherjee was today forced to call off a trip to Murshidabad to attend Mamata Banerjees programme after an IAF chopper they were to fly together in developed a snag.        
	The helicopter may have helped Mukherjee wriggle out of a potentially embarrassing situation at Sagardighi, where Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury had decided to boycott the event at which Mamata was to lay the foundation stone for three railway projects and organised a rail roko.        
	Mamata, however, left for Sagardighi by a special train.        
	Pranabda could not go to Sagardighi today because of a snag in his helicopter. He left for Delhi this afternoon, said state Congress chief Manas Bhuniya.        
	The Behrampore Congress, with the backing of Murshidabad district chief Chowdhury, had lined up the rail roko to push for construction of two flyovers over the tracks and embarrass Mamata. Chowdhury, who has had an uneasy equation with Mamata since the May civic polls, claimed he had not been invited to the Sagardighi event.        
	Sources said with Chowdhury playing difficult, Mukherjee may have run into a situation where there were no Congress workers attending the programme. He may have also faced protests from hostile workers.        
	Chowdhury is the Congress strongman in Murshidabad and where he has refused to attend a programme, it is a message to party supporters to boycott it. So, Pranabbabu would have walked into a programme which is essentially a Mamata show, a Congress leader said.                    
	Chowdhury, who attended a meeting at Khargram, about 35km from Sagardighi, said: I dont know why Pranabbabu didnt come. Ive heard his helicopter developed a technical fault.        
	The IAF confirmed an Mi-17 helicopter was supposed to fly out of the Barrackpore air force base in the morning. But during routine daily inspection, engineers found a snag. So, the helicopter couldnt take off, spokesperson Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani said.        
	Congress sources said Mukherjee had his own compulsions, given the face-off between Chowdhury and Mamata. Pranabbabu has to look after Congress interests in Murshidabad, one of the few strongholds the party has in Bengal, and keep Adhir happy.        
	He is the MP from Jangipur and he has to work with Adhir. He has to see that the Congress gets an honourable share of seats for the next election if there is a tie-up with Mamata. So, one cant really blame him for not attending todays programme, a state party leader said.        
	Sources said Mukherjee may have also realised that the state PCC was backing Chowdhury. Chowdhury is the Congress strongman who has freed the people of Murshidabad from the torture of CPM. We are behind him, said Bhuniya.        
	As expected by Congress leaders, party supporters stayed away from the Sagardighi event. Mannan Hossain, the Congress MP from Murshidabad, showed up but left after learning that Mukherjee was not coming.        
	Some 25 Congress supporters gathered at PWD Maidan, the programme venue, with placards saying insult to Adhir Chowdhury, the captain of development in Murshidabad, will not be tolerated. They too left soon after.        
	Mamata reached Sagardighi around 5pm. I apologise for being late. But I am not at fault. I was supposed to come with Pranabda but he could not come.        
	But you people were waiting. I have not failed to attend any programme where I have promised to attend. I am late but I have come. What can I do? I dont have a helicopter, she said.        
	Pranabda has cancelled his trip. I will not say anything on this matter.        
	According to Calcutta police sources, Mukherjee was scheduled to take an air force helicopter to Sagardighi from the RCTC helipad around 10.50am. We received information that the helicopter, which was supposed to take off from the IAF air base in Barrackpore, suddenly developed a snag and remained unavailable, an officer said.        
	Under the Standard Operating Procedure, if a designated helicopter develops a snag, the ministry concerned will have to inform the defence or the home ministry for an alternative helicopter.        
	The ministry concerned will then get in touch with its closest operational headquarters and find out if any is available and accordingly send a notice to reach the designated location, an official said.

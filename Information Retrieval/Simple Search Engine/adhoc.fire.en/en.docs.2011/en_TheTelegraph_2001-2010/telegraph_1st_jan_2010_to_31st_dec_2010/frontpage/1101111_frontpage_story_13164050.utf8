          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: When Barack Obama repeatedly spoke of the need for shared prosperity, he must have meant the tide of dollars that swelled since the 1990s when Manmohan Singh ushered in economic reforms.        
	America is now looking to tighten the screws on India as it tries to correct what it sees as a terrible skew in trade relations.        
	For over four decades, India has enjoyed the benefit of a trade surplus by exporting goods and services of greater value than that it has imported from the US.        
	But the tilt in favour of India became more pronounced from the 1990s when economic reforms unshackled the country and set the stage for the information technology thrust that brought in more dollars from abroad.        
	According to data available from 1985, barring one occasion, the trade surplus was below $1 billion till 1991, when the reforms got off the ground. The surplus has never dipped below $1 billion since then, although it plunged to $4.7 billion last year from $12.1 billion in 2006 because of the downturn. (See chart)        
	The mounting trade surplus  which means American expenditure on Indian products exceeds Indian spending on American products  has now become a red rag for Washington, especially at a time unemployment there is running at 9.6 per cent.        
	Its even more galling for Obama, who has seen his popularity plummet alarmingly since his election two years ago, to find that 12 of the top 15 countries that trade with the US also run huge trade surpluses with Uncle Sam.         
	In his address to MPs on Monday, Obama had made promoting shared prosperity the cornerstone of future Indo-US relations.        
	Not surprising then that Obama and his administration have decided to use the burgeoning US current account deficit  the broadest measure of trade in goods and services and income and transfer payments  to justify a potent cocktail of fiscal, monetary and trade policy action designed to prop up a stuttering American economy.        
	The US current account deficit swelled to $123.3 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 from $84.4 billion a year ago.        
	After trying to play hardball with China and Germany and failing to force them to trim their massive trade surpluses, the US has decided to hammer down the value of the dollar by printing more cash in the US.        
	With more dollars swilling around in its economy, America will be able to engineer a global exchange rate wobble that will no longer make it attractive for Americans to import goods and services from those countries.        
	In the case of India, the US is using a twin-pronged tactic to correct the trade imbalance.         
	First, it has persuaded India to put together a huge shopping list of weaponry and advanced systems for its armed forces. In tandem, it has tried to cajole Indias airline industry  which has started to claw its way back into profits after a turbulent phase over the past 18 months  to buy more planes from the US.         
	Second, the Obama administration is trying to force the Indian government to tear down its protectionist walls  in areas like retail, for instance  that have served as a bulwark against a tidal wave of imports from the US.         
	Between January and August, India had eked out a $7-billion trade surplus, largely on account of exports of garments, jewellery and software. That figure threatens to cross $10 billion by December.        
	Two-way trade, which amounted to about $36.5 billion last year, is expected to surge to $50 billion next year and could go up to $220 billion over the next 10 years.        
	At current levels, Indo-US trade amounts to less than 2 per cent of total US trade with India ranked 12th on the list of Americas top trading partners.        
	But all that could change very quickly as America begins to press India to buy big-ticket defence products and civilian planes.         
	Boeing estimates that India will spend at least $130 billion on 1,150 jetliners over the next two decades. Aviation sector analysts estimate that at least 50 t0 60 per cent of these orders will go to the Seattle-based giant aircraft-maker.        
	Similarly, Indian defence forces are expected to buy $100 billion worth of hardware over the next 12 years. Analysts say nearly 30 per cent of these purchases could come from the US.         
	Russia is expected to continue to be the largest supplier of defence equipment to india, but the USAs share will also rise, says Anil Bansal, director of National Maritime Foundation.        
	The huge purchase of defence equipment and aircraft did not figure in earlier years of Indo-US trade. It is only recently that India has started looking at the US as a reliable defence contractor. Similarly, its private airline business has started coming of age in this decade.         
	The estimates on aircraft purchase made by Boeing and Airbus are just for jetliners. They do not reflect the increasing orders for private jets, trainer aircraft, mono-planes and what have you that specialised firms in the US would be selling to a growing market of Indian rich and not so rich aviation enthusiasts, says R. Pathak, former Indian Airlines director and aviation sector analyst. Many feel the actual aviation pie could be far larger.        
	Indian exports to the US have been concentrated in a fairly narrow range: garments, jewellery, software and IT products, pharmaceuticals, marine products and engineering goods.         
	India wants to expand the export product base by focusing on automobiles and auto parts but, with the rupee threatening to go below Rs 43 to the dollar over the next few months, Indian manufactures as well as service exports will lose their sheen.         
	The rupee, which has been hardening against the dollar over the past year, touched a six-month high last Thursday when it traded at Rs 44.20 to the dollar, up from a low of Rs 52.06 just 18 months back.         
	The hardening rupee has sparked a deep sense of worry among software and garment exporters.         
	The RBI should intervene right now to halt heavy speculative inflows through the foreign institutional investment route to reduce the currency volatility, which is currently ranging from 10 to 15 per cent, Infosys chief financial officer V. Balakrishnan said recently.         
	Concerned over the rise, the Federation of Indian Export Organisation (FIEO) has already written to the finance and commerce minister seeking their immediate intervention in curbing the appreciation of the currency.        
	Manmeet S. Kohli, a Delhi-based garments exporter to US retail chains, told The Telegraph: We had booked orders at Rs 46 to the dollar. Now, the dollar has fallen to Rs 44 and we feel its going to fall below Rs 43 soon my margins are getting wiped out exports to the US will no longer remain lucrative.        
	Whats even more worrying is that the US is likely to adopt a policy of deliberately reducing the value of the dollar to make itself competitive over the next five years. This would be disastrous for India, added Sudipto Bose, an independent merchant banker.         
	All of this could get even more complicated when India and the US sit down to negotiate a comprehensive economic co-operation agreement covering trade and investments.         
	US Commerce secretary Gary Locke told The Telegraph in an interview on Monday that the idea had been broached. Commerce minister Anand Sharma has also confirmed that talks on such an agreement is on the cards.         
	The US and South Korea  another nation running a huge trade surplus with Washington  are currently in the middle of negotiations on a free trade pact. Ostensibly, the pact will increase two-way trade between them from $80 billion to $100 billion in five years.        
	However, the US is also hoping to use the pact to narrow the $10-billion trade deficit it has with Korea.        
	So, a comprehensive trade pact with the US could bring its own set of troubles.

  - Rukhsana weds guard, falls foul of kin           MUZAFFAR RAINA                                                 Rukhsana      
	Srinagar, June 9: A young woman who became an instant symbol of courage for millions of Indians after she fought and killed an armed militant has become a prisoner in her own house  for marrying someone her parents dont approve of.        
	Not allowed to venture out of home, Rajouri braveheart Rukhsanas only link with the outside world now is her cellphone.        
	My only fault is that I married a man of my choice but my parents are against this marriage. For the past 15 days, I have not been allowed to move out of my home, the 22-year-old, who secretly married her personal security officer Kabir Hussain, told The Telegraph from Rajouri.        
	I am not being allowed to meet my husband, though I am in touch with him through my mobile, she said.        
	A police officer said they would investigate Rukhsanas allegation once a formal complaint is lodged. So far we have not received any complaint from her. She has been living in the police lines since last years incident and I think she is moving freely within the lines, the officer said.        
	Rukhsana shot to fame last September after she and her teenaged brother Aijaz fought armed Lashkar rebels before killing one with his own rifle.         
	The militants had barged into their house in a village, some 45km from Rajouri town in Jammu, and started assaulting their parents.        
	Seeing her parents being beaten up, Rukhsana shook off her terror, hit one of the militants with an axe, snatched his gun and fired at him, killing him on the spot.         
	The dead militant was later identified as Lashkar commander Abu Osama. The other fled.        
	Her bravery won Rukhsana the Kirti Chakra, the countrys second-highest peacetime gallantry award.        
	Fearing that militants might target Rukhsana, the government assigned two personal security officers to guard the family. Last month, she married one of them.        
	For the past eight months, Kabir has been taking great care of me to save me from any possible militant attack, she said. He has endangered his life by marrying me because I am on the hit list of militants, who have warned people not to marry me.        
	A police officer said Rukhsanas parents had a valid reason to oppose the marriage. Kabir is already married and has two kids, and her parents say that if he can desert his first wife, he can do the same with her.        
	Her brother, too, is against the marriage.        
	Rukhsana said her family was against the marriage because they wanted her to marry a cousin. My cousins family used to humiliate me by calling me names. How can I marry in that family? After I got the award, I landed a job, because of which they have developed interest in me, she said.        
	The young woman is now waiting for her maternal uncles return from Delhi tomorrow. He is playing mediator and, hopefully, this issue will be resolved soon, Rukhsana said, but stuck to her stand that she was Kabirs legally wedded wife.        
	If my family continues to oppose the marriage, I will go with my husband, she said.

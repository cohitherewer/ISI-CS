  - Gritty Grandma keeps taking test till she gets licence          CHOE SANG-HUN                                    
	Sinchon (South Korea), Sept. 4: A person could know South Korea for a long time without knowing Wanju, an obscure county 112 miles south of Seoul.        
	And, at least until recently, a person could know a lot about Wanju without ever hearing of Cha Sa-soon, a 69-year-old woman who lives alone in the mountain-ringed village of Sinchon.        
	Now, however, Cha is an unlikely national celebrity.        
	This diminutive woman, known nationwide as Grandma Cha Sa-soon, has achieved a record that causes people here to first shake their heads with astonishment and then smile: She failed her drivers test hundreds of times but never gave up.        
	Finally, she got her licence  on her 960th try.        
	For three years starting April 2005, she took the test once a day five days a week. After that, her pace slowed, to about twice a week. But she never quit.        
	Hers is a fame based not only on sheer doggedness, a quality held in high esteem by Koreans, but also on the universal human sympathy for a monumental  and in her case, cheerful  loser.        
	When she finally got her licence, we all went out in cheers and hugged her, giving her flowers, said Park Su-yeon, an instructor at Jeonbuk Driving School, which Cha once attended. It felt like a huge burden falling off our back. We didnt have the guts to tell her to quit because she kept showing up.        
	When word began spreading last year of the woman who was still taking the test after failing it more than 700 times, reporters traced her to Sinchon, where the bus, the only means of public transportation, comes by once every two hours on a street so narrow it has to pull over to let other vehicles pass.        
	They followed her to the test site in the city of Jeonju, an hour away. There, they also videotaped her in the market, where she sells her home-grown vegetables at an open-air stall.        
	Once she finally got her licence, in May, Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, South Koreas leading carmaker, started an online campaign asking people to post messages of congratulations. Thousands poured in.         
	In early August, Hyundai presented Cha with a $16,800 car.        
	Cha, whose name, coincidentally enough, is Korean for vehicle, now also appears on a prime-time television commercial for Hyundai.        
	Born to a peasant family with seven children but no land, Cha spent her childhood working in the fields and studying at an informal night school. It was not until she turned 15 that she joined a formal school as a fourth grader. But her schooling ended there a few years later.        
	Father had no land, and middle school was just a dream for me, she said.        
	Cha said she had always envied people who could drive, but it was not until she was in her 60s that she got around to trying for a licence.        
	Here, if you miss the bus, you have to wait another two hours. Talk about frustration! said Cha, who had to transfer to a second bus to get to her driving test site and to yet another to reach her market stall.        
	But I was too busy raising my four children, she continued. Eventually they all grew up and went away and my husband died several years ago, and I had more time for myself. I wanted to get a drivers licence so I could take my grandchildren to the zoo.        
	Cha tackled the first obstacle, which for years proved insurmountable: the 50-minute written test consisting of 40 multiple-choice questions on road regulations and car maintenance.        
	She could read and write words phonetically but she could not understand most of the terminology, such as regulations and emergency light, said Park, the teacher.        
	Choi Young-chul, an official at the regional driving licence agency, said: What she was essentially doing while studying alone was memorising as many questions  with their answers  as possible without always knowing what they were all about. Its not easy to pass the test that way.        
	She failed the written test 949 times, but her scores steadily crept up. When she came to them early last year, teachers at Jeonbuk Driving School pitched in, giving her extra lessons, painstakingly explaining the terminology.        
	It drove you crazy to teach her, but we could not get mad at her, said Lee Chang-su, another teacher. She was always cheerful. She still had the little girl in her.        
	It was only last November, on her 950th try, that she achieved a passing grade of 60 out of 100. She then passed two driving skill and road tests, but only after failing each four times. For each of her 960 tests, she had to pay $5 in application fees.        
	I didnt mind, said Cha. To me, commuting every day to take the test was like going to school. I always missed school.        
	Her son, Park Seong-ju, 36, who lives in Jeonju and makes signboards and placards, said: Mother has lived a hard life, selling vegetables door to door and working other peoples farms. Maybe that made her stubborn. If she puts her mind to something, no one can argue her out of it.        
	Her tenacity has struck a chord with South Koreans, who are often exhorted to recall the hardship years after the 1950-53 Korean War and celebrate perseverance as a national trait.        
	The countrys most popular boxing champion was Hong Su-hwan, who was floored four times before knocking out Hector Carrasquilla to win the World Boxing Associations super bantamweight championship in 1977. His feat gave rise to a popular phrase about resolve: Sajeonogi, or Knocked down four times, rising up five.        
	Cha seems to have given new meaning to this favourite Korean saying.        
	On her wall where she hung black-and-white photographs of her and her late husband as a young couple and a watch that had stopped ticking, she also had posted a handwritten  and misspelled  sign that read Never give up!

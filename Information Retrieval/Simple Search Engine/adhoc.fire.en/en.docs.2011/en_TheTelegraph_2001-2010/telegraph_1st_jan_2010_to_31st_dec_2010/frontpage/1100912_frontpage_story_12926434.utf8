  - Lloyds official accused of   multi-million pound racket        AMIT ROY                                          
	London, Sept. 11: A senior executive of Lloyds TSB, a major British bank that has been building up its India links, has resigned citing ill health.        
	But a report today in the Daily Mail newspaper has raised questions about why the executive, Andrew Taylor, 46, apparently channelled substantial funds to companies owned by a couple of his Indian friends.        
	The latter were named as Vijay Bhaskar and Raj Kumar.        
	It was not possible today independently to verify the veracity of the Mail report which appears to suggest that Taylor backed Bhaskar and Kumar for reasons other than commercial.         
	Contacted by the paper, Taylor confirmed that he left Lloyds TSB last month because of ill health but declined to comment further.         
	A spokesman for the bank merely said: We can confirm that we have been investigating allegations of professional misconduct within a small and non-customer facing team based in Bangalore.        
	Embarrassingly for the bank  which is 43 per cent owned by the taxpayer  the alleged multi-million pound racket was going on while Lloyds was sacking thousands of British workers to cut costs, the Mail reported today.         
	So who is Andrew Taylor?        
	His credentials were given when he was one of the speakers at a business conference.         
	Andrew Taylor is the chief operating officer of Lloyds TSB Global Services Pvt Ltd, based in India, his CV said.         
	Andrew joined Lloyds Bank in 1982, it went on. At the outset, Andrews roles involved various placements in branch banking, regional operations and as assistant inspector (internal audit). In 1997, he then moved into project management and process design, to initiate the Customer Service Centre project in Lloyds TSB, working on delivering a back-office model in Lloyds to replicate the TSB operations across the UK. This was followed as the senior project manager preparing the Lloyds TSB branch network for the introduction of the Euro on January 4, 1998.         
	The CV also said From then until 2001, Andrew led key parts of the Lloyds and TSB integration projects, including the development of the Lloyds TSB Counter transaction application, paper clearings systems, and the migration of the Lloyds accounts to the new online real-time banking system. Andrew became head of process and data support in 2002, responsible for the internal procedures helpdesk, online reference material, maintenance of the banks letters and forms library, the Lloyds TSB Group data warehouse, branch and service centre infrastructure data, and interchange application development.         
	It concluded: In September 2004 Andrew undertook an assignment in India to review the small-scale outsource trial in Bangalore which resulted in his agreement to stay indefinitely as head of group operations in India.         
	The CV emphasised: Andrew is an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Bankers (ACIB) and when based in the UK held a place on the British Bankers Association Operations Liaison Board.         
	But the Mail was today trying to suggest there may be personal motives for Taylors largesse.         
	It said the British executive, jointly responsible for more than 2,000 Lloyds employees in India, allegedly installed the two (Indian) employees into well-paid posts in which they were effectively writing cheques to themselves.        
	Taylor, Lloyds head of offshore operations in Bangalore, is alleged to have appointed Bhaskar and Kumar to run the facilities department, responsible for awarding contracts to Indian companies, above more experienced British colleagues, it went on.         
	The two men are alleged to have started paying tens of thousands of pounds to a Bangalore firm called Professional Touch which supplied rented apartments for Lloyds executives, plus driving and cleaning services, the Mail claimed. But unknown to the bank, this company was owned by 29-year-old Bhaskar. All the payments were said to have been sanctioned by Taylor.         
	There are some lurid personal allegations. Taylor was described as being close friends with the men, and to have shared a hotel room with Bhaskar on holiday at EuroDisney. He lavished treats on several male employees, and posed in dozens of photographs with his arms around them, the Mail said.

          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 21: After a visiting central team was convinced that the drought situation in the state was indeed alarming, Jharkhand could now expect a package worth Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 crore to carry out relief work.        
	Within the next fortnight, the state will set up control rooms at various levels to provide prompt assistance to drought victims.        
	A team of experts led by National Rural Horticulture Mission managing director Bijay Kumar arrived in the state on Wednesday to assess the drought situation. The team members met Governor M..H. Farook and senior officials immediately afterwards to gather basic information and thereafter split into two groups and proceeded to different parts of the state to see the ground situation for themselves.        
	The team members returned to the state capital today and met chief secretary Ashok Kumar Singh to air their observations.         
	The central team expressed concern over the spread of malaria in West Singhbhum district. We have directed the deputy commissioner and civil surgeon to immediately take necessary steps. Another team observed that only 75 members were enrolled at a particular diet centre. We have already directed the concerned officials to give food to every woman visiting the centre, whether they are enrolled or not, the chief secretary said.        
	The team is likely to submit its report to the Centre within three or four days, following which the quantum of relief would be decided.        
	The central team stressed on repair of hand pumps and removal of silt from canals, so that irrigation projects could become functional at the earliest. It also advocated expansion of MGNREGS projects to generate more employment opportunities for the poor. Shortage of manpower at most offices reportedly figured in the discussion.        
	In response to the teams observations, the state directed officials on field postings not to go out of their headquarters without getting their leave sanctioned by competent authorities.        
	Replying to a question, the chief secretary said estimates for relief work in eight districts that were declared drought hit in the third phase too has been sent to the Centre today. Accordingly, the state expected a Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 crore package from the Centre. Earlier, disaster management department secretary M.N. Kerketta had said a Rs 2,800 crore package proposal had been sent to the Centre.        
	The central team agrees with what we have said in our earlier reports regarding the drought situation in the state, Singh added.        
	Till August 18, the state received 80.6mm rainfall, against a normal average of 322mm. (See chart)        
	Birsa Agriculture Universitys agriculture physics and meteorology department head A. Wadood said the state did not receive consistent rainfall during the monsoon season. It was more like pre-monsoon showers.        
	Statistical analysis suggested that certain districts received comparatively good rainfall, but not uniformly across the district.         
	Wadood said on June 26, 56mm rainfall was recorded in Kanke block. Near Birsa Munda Airport, the rainfall was only 5-6mm. At Albert Ekka Chowk, there was no rainfall that day.        
	People might argue that Ranchi received 56mm rainfall on June 26, but the entire area did not receive the same quantum of rainfall that day. Monsoon showers are very important for transplantation of paddy crop. Rainfall after August 15 is not going to add considerably to crop coverage. Only the standing crop will benefit, he said.        
	He added that the rainfall pattern in Jharkhand had changed in recent years.                    
	, it was time the state worked out viable alternatives and improved irrigation. He added groundwater recharge and afforestation schemes too ought to be taken up on priority basis.        
	He said farmers in Jharkhand should not opt for paddy cultivation, even if rainfall resumed in the coming days.

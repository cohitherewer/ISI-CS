          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA AMP; RAJESH KUMAR PANDEY                                              
	Ranchi/Dumka, Oct. 10: Chief minister Arjun Munda today allocated portfolios, distributing plum departments evenly among allies after a series of brainstorming sessions with deputies Sudesh Mahto and Hemant Soren for a marathon 36 hours.         
	Of the 42 departments, the BJP and JMM have received 15 each, Ajsu has got 10 and the JD(U) two.        
	Governor M..H. Farook okayed Mundas past-midnight proposal, sent to Raj Bhavan at 12.30am, to allocate portfolios among ministers before heading for Chennai.         
	The chief minister has kept personnel, home, cabinet vigilance, law, energy, roads, public relations, planning and development and registration.         
	Deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto has been given rural development, panchayati raj, National Rural Employment Programme, rural works, water resources, forest and environment, art, culture, sports and youth affairs.         
	The other deputy, Hemant Soren, got finance, commercial taxes, urban development, housing, drinking water and sanitation, civil aviation and mines and geology.        
	According to sources, the delay was caused because the JMM insisted on a swap formula, under which berths allocated to the BJP in the erstwhile Shibu Soren government would come to the JMM and vice-versa.         
	By implication, the JMM wanted energy in Hemants kitty. Also, Sudesh Mahto was not ready to leave claim over roads, a plum department he held under the Soren government. Finally, Hemant was placated with mines and civil aviation departments, which are generally retained by the chief minister, while Sudesh got water resources in addition to all the departments he held under the Soren government, a source said.        
	Interestingly, though the cabinet was expanded on October 8, its JMM configuration was more or less chalked out during the party conference in Dumka on September 20-22, when an 11-member steering committee-cum-advisory council made a debut.        
	Though the move was largely viewed as an attempt to catapult Soren junior, an MLA from Dumka, into prominence within the party, induction of four members from the council  Champai Soren, Hemlal Murmu, Hazi Hussain Ansari and Mathura Prasad Mahto  to the Munda cabinet shows it had more to it than met the eye.        
	While Hemlal Murmu is the new health and parliamentary affairs minister, Mathura Prasad Mahto has land reforms and revenue and food and civil supplies in his kitty.        
	The welfare department has been split into three parts, with first-time JMM minister Champai Soren getting tribal welfare, Vimala Pradhan social welfare and Haji Hussain Ansari minority welfare.         
	Sudesh Mahto, who headed for a pilgrimage to Vaishno Devi, said he was satisfied with what he got. We have to deliver now, he said. Hemant echoed him and stressed on team effort. I am desperate to work in order to redeem the image of Jharkhand, he said.        
	Ansari, however, is upset with minority welfare and co-operatives. In Deoghar today, he said he would assume charge only after talks with Shibu Soren, Hemant and Munda.         
	JMM workers in Deoghar are feeling let down with such (insignificant) departments. They believe their representative has not got due respect in the cabinet, he said.

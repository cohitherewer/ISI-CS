The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Archer novels to get Hollywood treatment
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Archer novels to get Hollywood treatment
          MATTHEW MOORE                            Archer: Wider audience                                  
	Sept. 17: Jeffrey Archers bestselling novels are to be adapted for the screen after the former Tory peer sold the film and television rights to 10 of his books.        
	Hollywood studios are already in negotiations to produce big screen versions some of Lord Archers most popular works including A Matter of Honour, As the Crow Flies and Honour Among Thieves, according to reports.        
	Jeffrey Steiner, the Canadian businessman who has bought the rights, claims that the adaptations could rival the success of the Jason Bourne films, which were based on novels by Robert Ludlum.        
	Lord Archer has sold more than 250 million copies of his novels and short stories around the world, despite the ignominious end to his political career.         
	He was expelled from the Tory party and served two years in prison after being found guilty of perjury in 2001.        
	Steiner, a leading figure in Toronto Conservative circles, said that Lord Archers colourful past added to the appeal of his thrillers. He told The Globe and Mail newspaper: You can call it scandal, or kind of intrigue  that seems to be quite attractive in Hollywood.        
	The contract covers the international film, television and digital rights to up to 10 of Lord Archers novels.        
	Announcing the deal, Steiner said: We look forward to developing these exceptional literary properties across film and television to excite Jeffrey Archers enormous worldwide fan base and new audiences alike resulting in productions with that must-see factor.        
	Lord Archer said: Im enthusiastic to see my novels move toward development as film and digital productions. Like any author, I am keen to see my books made into films, giving me the opportunity to reach an even wider audience.

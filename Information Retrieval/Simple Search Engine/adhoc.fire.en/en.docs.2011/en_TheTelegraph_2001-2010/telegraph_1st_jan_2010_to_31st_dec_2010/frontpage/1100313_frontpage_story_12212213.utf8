  - Back to drawing board in face of fresh challenges          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA AMP; RAJ KUMAR      
	Ranchi, March 12: CRPF DG Vikram Shrivastava has said he was confident that the joint operation with Bengal would be a success a day after he held a meeting with the state police top brass to re-design some aspects of their strategy in the wake of fresh challenges they were exposed to during phase I of the offensive.        
	Shrivastava, who was here along with special DG and commander of the anti-Naxalite task force Vijay Raman, also visited Khunti, 30km from here, to check out the site where the second battalion of CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action) is to be stationed.        
	CRPF DIG Alok Raj told The Telegraph that a CoBRA battalion now stationed in Sindri would be shifted to Khunti soon to join the operations. Another battalion is stationed in Barhi in Hazaribagh district.         
	As of now, Jharkhand has been given two CoBRA battalions that have been specially raised under the CRPF to tackle Maoists. Yet another CoBRA battalion to be stationed in Khunti is now undergoing training.         
	Later, Shrivastava, Raman and Raj also met Governor M..H. Farook to apprise him of the operations.         
	Before leaving for Delhi this afternoon, Shrivastava told reporters at the airport that the Jharkhand police and the CRPF were working in close co-ordination.         
	The operation, which was now going on in limited areas, would gradually be extended to other areas, added CRPF IG C.B.S. Rathore, who along with commandant R.K. Sharma, IG (operation) of Jharkhand police D.K. Pandey and Raj had gone to the airport to see off the two CRPF seniors.        
	At yesterdays two-hour-long review meeting with the CRPF top brass, the police team led by the DGP discussed the fresh challenges that were thrown up during phase I of the joint operations launched on Sunday.        
	The forces had to face drinking water and food shortage at several places, which meant they had to come back to camps regularly. This also affected the operations, pointed out a police officer involved in the operation.        
	Also, since there are no roads in the jungles, the security forces have to trek long distances on foot leaving them exhausted even before reaching their intended destination.        
	Communication, too, was a problem after eight or nine hours of travel with the batteries of police wireless sets running out. Now, the state police and the CRPF are re-designing the strategy to overcome these challenges, he said.

										                      Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh. A PTI picture.                          
	New Delhi, Aug 24 (PTI): In a big blow to Vedanta Resources, Government today rejected environment clearance to its USD 1.7 billion bauxite mining project in Orissa after accepting recommendations of its key panel clearing such ventures.
    Giving reasons for the denial of clearance, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told reporters that "there has been a very serious violation of Environment Protection Act, Forest Conservation Act and the Forest Rights Act.
    "There have been no emotions and no politics and no prejudice involved in this report. I have taken this decision in a proper legal approach," he said.
    The decision came after the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) which had submitted the report to Ramesh after reviewing the suggestions given by the N C Saxena panel seeking ban on the mining project in Orissa's Niyamgiri Hills in view of various violations at the site.

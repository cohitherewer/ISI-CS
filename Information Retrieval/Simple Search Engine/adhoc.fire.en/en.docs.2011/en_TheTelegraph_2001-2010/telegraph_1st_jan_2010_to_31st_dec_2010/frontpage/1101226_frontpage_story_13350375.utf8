                                PITCHING IN				                           
	Dec. 25: First Lady Michelle Obama has surprised children by answering calls to a Santa tracking hotline.         
	The First Lady manned the phones for around 40 minutes for Norad, a US and Canadian military organisation which published online maps tracking Santas whereabouts.         
	Norad says it uses radar, satellites, high-speed digital cameras and fighter jets to track Father Christmas.         
	Its the first time in the 55-year history of the event that a First Lady joined in, said Jamie Graybeal, Norads deputy chief of staff for communications.         
	The Obama family are currently in Hawaii for the Christmas holidays, and while Barack Obama took the children to the beach, his wife was on the telephone to pitch in with volunteers at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.         
	Juliana-Rose Hatcher, aged eight, said: She asked me what I wanted from Santa and I told her an MP3 player, and she said her daughter wants an MP3 player too.         
	Her mother Jennifer said at first they thought it was a joke or a pre-recorded message, but quickly realised: Wow, it really, really is her.         
	Austin Futch, 10, from Memphis, Tennessee, said he quizzed the First Lady about a few things on his mind concerning life in the White House.         
	He wanted to know how it felt to be surrounded at all times by Secret Service agents  not too bad because they are nice guys, Michelle Obama said  and if it was hard being married to the President.         
	No, hes a pretty good guy, she told him, according to a transcript of the calls released by the White House.         
	I mean, its a tough job and sometimes you want to do everything you can to help him, but its pretty easy being married to him.         
	Hes kind of funny  fun to hang out with.        
	Norad Tracks Santa, the official name of the programme, began in 1955 when a Colorado Springs newspaper advert invited children to talk to Father Christmas on a hotline. The phone number was misprinted, and dozens of children called the Continental Aerospace Defence Command in Colorado Springs, the predecessor to Norad.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

  - Randivs deliberate act amounts to match-fixing          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Suraj Randiv during a practice session in Dambulla on Wednesday. Later, Randiv was suspended from Thursdays match between Sri Lanka and New Zealand. (Reuters)                                         
	Aug. 18: Suraj Randiv has admitted that he deliberately bowled a no ball on what turned out to be the final delivery during the India-Sri Lanka ODI in Dambulla on Monday.        
	With the International Cricket Council (ICC) treating the matter as closed, the Sri Lanka off-spinner has got away lightly.        
	Randiv, in fact, should have been investigated for an offence under article 2.1.1 of the ICCs anti-corruption code for players and player support personnel.        
	All because of that no ball, on what became the last delivery, to Virender Sehwag. The vice-captain was then on 99 and while the no ball gave India a six-wicket victory, it prevented him from getting to his 13th hundred in ODIs.        
	Sehwag may have got out on that very delivery, had it been legitimate. Moreover, theoretically, India could have lost the five other wickets without the addition of a run. It would then have been a tie, not full points for India.        
	Randiv, therefore, influenced the result in a big way.         
	The relevant portion of the ICC code reads: Fixing or contriving in any way or otherwise influencing improperly, or being a party to any effort to fix or contrive in any way or otherwise influence improperly the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of any international match or ICC event.        
	Any such conduct invites a minimum ban of five years and the maximum of a lifetime.        
	Yes, Randiv has confessed that hed acted deliberately, which is why weve suspended him for one ODI and docked his fee for the India match, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) secretary Nishantha Ranatunga told The Telegraph.        
	Randiv, as a result, is not available for tomorrows match against New Zealand.        
	Speaking from Colombo late this evening, Ranatunga added: We dont believe corruption is an issue here. There are always lots of possibilities and one may imagine a lot of things. Why talk of an anti-corruption probe? Weve already dealt with the matter.        
	Ranatunga confirmed that Tillekaratne Dilshan had been the agent provocateur. Even he has been let off mildly  just fined his match fee.        
	Clearly, Dilshan has been shown in poor light, hardly the ideal senior for newcomers like Randiv, who made his international debut as recently as last December.        
	The otherwise gifted Randiv has got a wake-up call early in his career. Hopefully, he will learn quickly.         
	We dont want the spirit of the game to be affected and, naturally, dont want our players to harm the reputation of cricket in Sri Lanka, Ranatunga, a younger brother of the iconic Arjuna, pointed out.        
	Towards that end, captain Kumar Sangakkara has been specifically directed to ensure such acts are not repeated.                           
	Initially, an ICC spokesman insisted that no comment would be made. However, within an hour, a media release was issued!        
	Complimenting SLC for acting swiftly and decisively, chief executive Haroon Lorgat said: This is a clear sign that the notion of fair play is still very important to those who love the game and we commend SLC on its commitment to that.        
	As far as the ICC is concerned, it was an unfortunate incident and the matter is now closed.        
	One learns that Alan Hurst, the ICC-appointed Match Referee, had acted moments after the match ended so dramatically.         
	The one-time Australia quick told Randiv that he was very disappointed and, then, bluntly asked Sangakkara if his bowlers behaviour had been deliberate.        
	Sangakkara is understood to have replied in the negative. Perhaps, he did not know. If that really was so, then there is much to be sorted out in the Sri Lanka dressing room.        
	Today, few believe that Sri Lanka, under Mahela Jayawardene, actually won the ICC Spirit of Cricket award for two years in a row (2007, 2008).

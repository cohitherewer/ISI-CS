                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Out to heal, Omar faces fury

	Srinagar, Aug. 5: Omar Abdullahs first attempt to build bridges in restive Kashmir faltered today when he had to beat a hasty retreat after being confronted by a mob at a hospital where he had gone to see injured protesters.        
	The eight-week unrest also claimed first political casualty, with senior Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Muzaffar Hussain Baig sending his resignation to the party.         
	Baig said he was doing so to protest the Centres backing for the Omar government, but sources said party bosses had chided him for criticising the ongoing protests.        
	The twin events came on a day two more people died, one of them in firing, taking the toll to 30 in the past one week. Overall, 48 civilians have died in the eight weeks since the latest flare-up on June 11, most of them in firing by the security forces.        
	The anger against Omar erupted at Srinagars Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences SKIMS), with witnesses saying the crowd that confronted the chief minister had many women who even tried to lunge at him.         
	His security guards kept him out of the harms way and he had to rush out amid pro-freedom slogans. Some men even tried to get close to his chopper, said a Pulwama resident whose brother is in the hospital. Omar chose to fly from his residence to the hospital, only 10km away, to avoid protesters on the way.        
	Minister of state for health Javed Ahmad Dar, who accompanied Omar, denied that people tried to harm Omar. Some women came close and were apparently trying to tell him about their pain. There were certainly pro-azaadi slogans there.        
	A government spokesperson said Omar met the injured and their families. He instructed the SKIMS director to provide the best possible medical care to the affected persons.         
	The PDPs Baig, a former deputy chief minister, said he had sent his resignation to party president Mehbooba Mufti with a request that it be forwarded to the Speaker.         
	Our job as MLAs is to guarantee the security of the people. By endorsing the policies of the Omar government, the Centre has rubbed salt on the wounds of the people, a local news agency quoted from Baigs letter.                   A Kashmiri youth wears a bullet shell as a pendant. (AP)      
	However, PDP sources said Baig had been reprimanded for a statement yesterday in which he appeared to criticise the protests. The sources said by doing so, he had gone against the PDPs line that justified the protests.         
	He has been criticising the protesters and raising some irrelevant issues, a leader said.        
	Today, security forces fired at protesters in Pulwama district, killing a young man, Shabir Malik, and injuring several people.        
	Ghulam Nabi Badyari, 48, a labourer shot and injured at Srinagars Ganpatyar locality yesterday, died this morning. Residents alleged the firing had been unprovoked.        
	A police officer, however, said the security forces had fired when a mob tried to attack a security bunker. Thousands took to the streets after these killings.         
	The fresh deaths came despite a call for peaceful protests from Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani.         
	The police, however, said there were fewer incidents of curfew violation and stone-throwing today, with some people apparently heeding Geelanis call.

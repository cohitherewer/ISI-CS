          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                               
	Mumbai, April 23: Shah Rukh Khan made a delayed entry, Shane Warne decided to leave for Melbourne, Sachin Tendulkar prepared for his 37th birthday party tomorrow while Mahendra Singh Dhoni hung around with friends in Mumbai.        
	But Rahul Dravid made up for their absence at the IPL awards night by draping a sari around a model on stage and Adam Gilchrist and Yuvraj Singh joined a belly dancer in an attempt to copy her moves.        
	Players and owners from almost all franchises cheered on their act at the show amid a buzz that the beleaguered Lalit Modi had decided to step down from the IPL.        
	Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) bosses, who have made it clear that Modi has to go, gave the grand event at the luxury Grand Hyatt hotel in Santacruz a miss.        
	The only BCCI representative present at the event was Modis close friend I.S. Bindra.         
	Eyebrows were raised over the absence of Sachin, who is nursing an injury, and Dhoni. The Indian cricket captain is skipper of the Chennai Super Kings owned by India Cements, whose boss N. Srinivasan is at loggerheads with Modi.         
	Shah Rukh, who was to have co-hosted the show with buddy Karan Johar, kept everyone guessing whether he would turn up given the heat and dust raised by the IPL controversy.        
	But he did eventually land up, around 9pm, in a show of support for old friend Lalit. The superstar was well over an hour late, but made up with a short dance and skit.        
	He flew down from Delhi and went straight to the show, said a Bollywood actor close to Shah Rukh.        
	Apart from Bindra, Sunil Gavaskar was the only IPL governing council member present. Gavaskar was one of the jury members on the IPL awards committee. Ravi Shastri decided to stay away.        
	The controversy cast a shadow over the event with those present keeping a close watch on who was making an entrance and who wasnt.         
	We were supposed to start at 7.30pm. But the hosts had not arrived. Then Karan came. He said Shah Rukh would come in late. After waiting for over an hour we were told that the show should start with Karan as host. Shah Rukh came later and joined in, said a source in Cineyug, the event management and production company owned by Shah Rukhs friend Karim Morani.        
	Sources close to Modi said the IPL chief, who saw the awards night as his swansong, had been initially a tad disappointed at Shah Rukhs delay.        
	He thought SRK had stood him up and was very agitated, said a close aide of Modi.        
	In the end, it all worked out well as most franchise owners, except the Chennai Super Kings Srinivasan, trooped in.        
	Kolkata Knight Riders owner Jay Mehta was there along with Royal Challengers Bangalores Vijay Mallya.                    WITH INPUTS FROM K. KUMARASWAMY

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                      Coming next year                          
	New Delhi, March 26: The human resource development ministry will roll out from 2011 the first of 2,500 public-private partnership schools proposed as exemplars for others, but policy-makers remain divided on how to implement the plan.        
	Steamrolling opposition from the Planning Commission to a proposed PPP model, HRD minister Kapil Sibal today decided to start the schools from next year at a stormy meeting of experts where little consensus emerged, sources said.        
	The final model of PPP investment agreed upon for the schools is crucial because it will provide the template for future collaboration between the government and private partners in school education.        
	The ministry had earlier rejected the plan panels proposal , arguing that it was too loaded in favour of the private partner collaborating with the government. But the commission today argued that the ministrys alternative proposal was unviable and unattractive to private partners, the sources said.         
	Sibal asked three sub-groups of officers and experts to finalise details of the terms of contracts to be signed with private partners, on the curriculum of these model schools and on the regulations that would bind them.         
	The one aspect of the project that was common to both the ministry proposal and the Planning Commissions model is also controversial because it contravenes the Right to Education Act that comes into force from April 1.        
	Both the ministry and the plan panel proposals envisage a screening test to select students for the 2,500 model schools, even though the education act specifically bars any such process.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Continental Airlines, United Airlines to combine operations
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Continental Airlines, United Airlines to combine operations
                            
	Chicago, April 30 (PTI): Continental Airlines and UAL Corporations United Airlines are expected to announce next week that they are combining operations to form the worlds largest airline.        
	Uniteds board is expected to vote on the deal today, which was reached in less than three weeks.        
	Continental directors too are meeting today to review the transactions terms and are expected to vote Sunday, the Chicago Tribune said. The announcement could come on Monday.        
	Continental has already agreed to allow the combined airline to be based in Uniteds home base of Chicago and to retain the United name.        
	The transaction, which is still to be approved by both airlines boards, would be structured as a merger of equals, with neither side paying a premium for the others stock, the paper said.        
	Continental entered into talks with United earlier this month on the condition that new Continental CEO Jeff Smisek head the merged entity, sources said.        
	United CEO Glenn Tilton, 62, is expected to be named non-executive chairman of the new airline and would serve on its board through a two-year transition period.        
	Smisek will name the rest of the management team later.        
	Uniteds reputation was badly battered during its three-year bankruptcy last decade that also damaged the morale of employees, who took steep pay cuts and gave up their pensions to ensure the carriers survival.        
	However, over the past two years, United has placed greater emphasis on pleasing customers.        
	Continental, however, sets the bar for service among large domestic carriers, receiving the highest marks from passengers in Zagats 2009 Airline Survey.        
	The Continental and United brands will likely remain in the market until the carrier receives a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a process that took the recently merged Delta and Northwest Airlines two years to accomplish.        
	Over that time, Smisek and his team plans to work hard to ensure there is a uniform level of service at the new United, a source said.

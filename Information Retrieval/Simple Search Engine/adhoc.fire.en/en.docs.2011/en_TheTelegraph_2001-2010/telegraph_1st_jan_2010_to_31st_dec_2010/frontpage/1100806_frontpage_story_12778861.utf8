	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Comrades of India, click. You have nothing to lose but your mass base and a cyberworld to gain.        
	The usually secretive CPM has decided to webcast live the events at the extended central committee of the party at Vijayawada from Saturday.        
	A live webcast of the events, inaugural session, public meetings of the extended meeting of the central committee of the CPI(M) being held at Vijayawada from August 7 to 10 is being arranged, an email from the party said today.        
	The CPM then went on to make an appeal to netizens to make use of the opportunity. It is similar to television telecast over the Internet. We appeal to all the people, netizens, sympathisers and progressive sections to use this opportunity of viewing it online, the email said.         
	The party has thoughtfully provided the address: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/starconf where live and recorded webcast can be viewed.         
	The bout of digital glasnost has afflicted the CPM at a time the party is facing seemingly insurmountable odds in Bengal and, to a lesser extent, in Kerala.         
	The Vijayawada session is scheduled to take the final decision on the political line to be adopted by the party in the two states, where polls are scheduled next year, and think up ways to reclaim its sliding mass base.         
	No party leader would comment on record why the party, which was at the forefront to oppose computerisation in the country when Rajiv Gandhi mooted the idea, is falling to the charms of technology.         
	But one leader smelt an attempt to attract the petty bourgeoisie in urban areas. The toiling masses obviously do not use Internet, he pointed out.         
	Ironically, the Indo-US nuclear deal, over which the CPM had dumped UPA I, had set the stage for the party to discover the seductive pleasures of the Internet, whose origins can be traced to the American military establishment. A portal was then inaugurated to canvass support for Prakash Karats third front project in association with Mayavati.        
	The third front initiative could not take off because of the disastrous election results, the ripples of which are expected to reach Vijayawada but unlikely to be webcast live.

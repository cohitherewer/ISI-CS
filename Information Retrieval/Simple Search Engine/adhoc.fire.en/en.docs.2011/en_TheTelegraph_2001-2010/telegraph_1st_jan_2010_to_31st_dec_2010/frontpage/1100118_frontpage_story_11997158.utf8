	Calcutta, Jan. 17: The day Jyoti Basu died, Somnath Chatterjee, the former Lok Sabha Speaker, rekindled the debate on his expulsion from the CPM.         
	Chatterjee claimed that Basu had approved of his decision not to step down from the Speakers post as demanded by the party led by general secretary Prakash Karat after the Left withdrew support to the first UPA government on the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	Yes, he told me you must preside over the trust vote. I took my decision (not to step down) after consulting him, Chatterjee told STAR Ananda this evening, referring to the trust motion that the Manmohan Singh government put to vote in the Lok Sabha after the Left pulled the plug.         
	Mourning the death of his father-like guardian, Chatterjee said: I thought he would be unhappy with me after the party had expelled me. But he stood by me during the gravest crisis in my life and tried to console me. I remember when I used to visit him at his residence of late, he used to say jokingly oi je expelled member eshe gachhe, the former Speaker said.         
	He used to love me a lot, although I do not know the reason. I think I was not worthy of so much affection. He was the guiding star in my life, Chatterjee added.         
	He was an amazing personality, a peoples icon and an undisputed leader of the country. He was denied the role as Prime Minister. However, he had later termed the partys decision an historic blunder. He felt we should learn a lesson that one should grab the opportunity when it comes, the veteran said.         
	Although Chatterjee didnt make it clear whether Basu opposed his expulsion or chose to continue as a disciplined soldier of the party, Basu had never come out in support of the partys move on Chatterjee.         
	With Chatterjee being close to Basu as well as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, many CPM leaders like the late Subhas Chakraborty and Shyamal Chakraborty had asked for his return to the party.         
	But the Karat-led politburo is cold to the idea as it wanted Chatterjee to blink first and appeal to the party for readmission. Basus death seems to have reduced the chance of a thaw.

	The subsidence of a VIP thoroughfare in the heart of the city last Tuesday has raised questions about the safety of Metro Railway, the oldest underground railway system in India. Metro spoke to senior officials of the railway for answers               
	Can Metro Railway be affected because of dilapidated brick sewers?         
	No. There is a layer of concrete between the Metro tunnel and the brick sewers. While the sewers are two to three metres below the road surface, the railway tunnel is around 10 metres further down. On many stretches the sewers are not directly above the tunnel.              
	Can the tunnel cave in like the brick sewers?         
	Metro officials are unanimous that there is no chance of the tunnel caving in. According to engineers, water seeps through into some parts of the tunnel but that cannot cause major damage to the structure. The tunnel is built with 2ft thick reinforced cement concrete (RCC), which is designed to support heavy load of vehicles.              
	Does Metro Railway regularly check the condition of the tunnel?         
	The civil and electrical engineering teams regularly check and maintain the tunnel, claimed officials.               
	Is there a possibility of the road caving in because of the tunnel?         
	There is no chance of road subsidence since Metro tunnels are designed to avoid that, said officials.               
	Has there ever been a cave-in caused by the tunnel?         
	Never in the 25-year-old history of Metro Railway.               
	How is Metro protected from the brick sewers?         
	The tunnel is constructed with RCC and the side walls, roof and the ground are all more than 2ft thick. It requires minimum maintenance. To strengthen the tunnel, circular steel strapping with 20mm plates was fixed from inside.

  Mamata charts agenda for governance          ANINDYA SENGUPTA AND DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                                    
	Calcutta, July 21: Wait and Writers shall be ours, Mamata Banerjee today told a multitude of expectant supporters, advocating patience after decades of despair.        
	Thus began a victory-eve countdown to what many see as a foregone coronation, a sort of amplified clearing of throat for a celebratory roar less than a year away.        
	I appeal to all of you to wait for three to four months for the CPM misrule to end. Cant you do that after having tolerated them for 34 years? Mamata asked the lakhs who chorused a deafening yes at the Trinamul Congresss Shahid Divas (martyrs day) rally at Esplanade.        
	Technically, the next government will have to take charge by June 10 next year. But any day after December 10, the Election Commission can decide on its own when to call elections  the probable reason why Mamata is giving only three to four months to the Left government.        
	Clouded in the run-up to the rally by the Sainthia train tragedy, no one would call todays display of crowd-pulling power  in any case meant to be a solemn occasion to mourn the death of 13 persons in police firing in 1993 when Mamata was in the Congress  a coronation.        
	That was the unbearable dilemma for Mamata and her lieutenants this afternoon, certain of victory but unable to declare it yet. Mamata repeatedly reminded the audience the time for celebration had not yet come but she found herself returning frequently to the theme of post-Left governance.        
	Few speakers could resist the temptation to list the reasons why the CPM-led government has to go. As soon as Mamata stepped on the dais, she brought the focus back on the martyrs but could not escape the sense of anticipation washing over the audience sprawled beyond the reach of the eye.        
	Gone was the unmistakable air of exasperation that used to hang heavy over such occasions that had promised many a false dawn.         
	Reverting to a tone she had set soon after the Lok Sabha election sweep, Mamata took to the grassroots a message she had been directing towards industry and other potential investors. Our new slogan is that we will have development, not destruction. Students, youths, farmers, workers are our partners in this development. There should be food and work for all.         
	She was careful not to declare the result before the race. Next year, a change may take place, though I leave it to the wish of the people who are prepared to give the CPM a fitting reply.        
	But her subsequent appeals to state government employees and police  something Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will interpret as a call to disobedience  confirmed that she believed she was on the threshold of taking power in Bengal.        
	Mamata appealed to the state government employees not to sign whatever file is handed to them by the present administration. I have word for all government employees and officers. Dont sign files whenever asked to.        
	She had an appeal for the police too, with an assurance that there would be no vendetta. I am also appealing to the police to co-operate with us. The new government will do whatever is necessary. There will be no vendetta on our part, she said.        
	The Trinamul chief said land deals by the Left government would be reviewed. Illegal land settlements are taking place. In Rajarhat, there have been such instances of illegal land deals. Many people have been put behind bars for no reason. All these will be reviewed, Mamata said.        
	She asserted that her party would celebrate Vijay Divas only after the CPM is evicted from Bengal.

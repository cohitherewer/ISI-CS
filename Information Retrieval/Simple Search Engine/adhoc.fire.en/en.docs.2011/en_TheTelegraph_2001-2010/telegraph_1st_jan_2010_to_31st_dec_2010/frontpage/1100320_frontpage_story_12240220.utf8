The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Half a bat makes full-blast debut
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Half a bat makes full-blast debut
  - Mongoose lives up to expectations on first appearance          OUR BUREAU                                                
	March 19: It looks like half a bat, maybe a toy, but the Mongoose has struck like a cobra.        
	The revolutionary new bat plundered seven sixes and five fours off the 34 balls it faced on its much-awaited IPL debut today, appearing to live up to the claim that it packs more power behind its smaller body than a conventional bat.        
	Exactly 19 balls into the Chennai Super Kings innings, a buzz went around Delhis Feroz Shah Kotla and, possibly, thousands of living rooms across the country. Matthew Hayden, having already hit 19 off nine balls, was changing bats.        
	Out came the odd-looking piece of willow designed by British sports goods company Mongoose, its giraffe-like proportions  long handle and short blade  probably raising a few laughs here and there. By the time it was finished, with 74 runs at a strike rate of 2.18 a ball, the Delhi Daredevil bowlers were certainly not laughing.        
	It looked like a toy in your hands, Hayden was told as he accepted the Man of the Match award.        
	Yes, to many it may look like just half a bat, Hayden agreed, but as we have seen, it packs a lot of power.        
	The Mongoose is said to have a sweet spot more than twice the size of that of a conventional bat, to be lighter and to offer more bat speed (see graphic). Designed specifically for T20, it was expected to be wielded in IPL 3 by the likes of Hayden, Andrew Symonds and West Indian Dwayne Smith.         
	Its anyones guess, though, how much Haydens match-winning 93 off 43 balls owed to the bat and how much to his own skill and strength.        
	A six off Tillekeratne Dilshan was mis-hit, yet the ball sailed over wide long-on. But then, crickets bionic man has not always needed to middle the ball, even with a standard bat, to earn the maximum.        
	His innings ended when a swipe at Amit Mishra dipped at long-on to be caught by Dilshan. Would it, if hit with a conventional bat, have fallen short of the fielder?        
	An air of expectation had built around the bat since its March 11 launch in Chennai, when Hayden called it the ideal bat to play on Indian pitches. He had added: (It) gives the batsman more time to play the pull, hook or cut off a shorter delivery.        
	Its not clear, though, whether the extra-long handle would prove cumbersome when a ball leaps nastily at the batsmans throat. Some experts doubt the Mongooses usefulness on seaming or bouncy wickets and believe it is suited only for T20.        
	Others, like Surrey opener Michael Brown, have been quoted as saying the new bat aids more classical and precise stroke-making.        
	Agrees Marcus Codrington, the bats inventor, who has claimed it would change cricket the way titanium-headed drivers had changed golf and graphite rackets revolutionised tennis.        
	He said: It allows you to hit harder and further without changing the way you play. Even the juniors found it easy to use as the bat allowed them to hit through the line without changing their technique.        
	Not everyone is convinced. Chennai captain Suresh Raina, who watched Haydens innings from 22 yards away, said he too had practised with the Mongoose but I didnt like it.        
	Despite all the changes, the bat conforms to the official MCC standards and can be used in all forms of cricket at all levels.        
	In India, the new bats will be available in two versions: MMI3 super premium and MMI3 premium, priced at Rs 23,000 and Rs 17,000, respectively. Only 40 bats of the first type and 60 of the second would for now be available in the country, through limited retailers in the eight IPL cities. The conventional bats that international players now use cost Rs 15,000-20,000.

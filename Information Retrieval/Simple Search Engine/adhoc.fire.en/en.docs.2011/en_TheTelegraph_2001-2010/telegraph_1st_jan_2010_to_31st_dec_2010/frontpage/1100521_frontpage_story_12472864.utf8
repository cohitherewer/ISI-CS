The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Patience, thy name is Tamluk
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Patience, thy name is Tamluk
										      DEVADEEP PUROHIT IN TAMLUK      Ourtowns -TAMLUK                                
	Change is the signature tune in this season   of municipal polls, 10 days away. If at all change   is lurking around the corner, what does it mean for the towns of Bengal? Have Bengal rsquo;s towns ldquo;changed rdquo; in the past two decades during which the way some of us live has been   transformed for ever?   Beginning today, The Telegraph starts a   10-part series titled Our Towns to try and   capture life mdash; throbbing or otherwise mdash; in the   forgotten provinces of Bengal. We kick off with the town that woke up one day and found itself being called the gateway to Nandigram, the biggest change agent of them all  
	The blazing sun is trying its best to burst Kalinga Adaks patience, piercing his bronzed face with a million pinpricks.  
	For an hour and more, the part-time schoolteacher has held out, standing on the banks of the Rupnarayan and scanning the horizon for the nose of the boat that should bob up along with the waves of the high tide. The boat will take the schoolteacher to Shyampur in Howrah, on the other bank of the river flowing between East Midnapore and Howrah, from Tamluk.         
	An hour thats the standard waiting time, the 20-something Adak sighs, twirling the strap of his jhola seen in abundance in this part of Bengal.                  
	Patience also grows in abundance in this land, perhaps the only relic that has withstood the elements  natural and manmade  that killed a bustling port and a commercial centre in the ancient town mentioned in Pali and Sanskrit literature as Tamralipta, Damalipta and Tamralipi.        
	As the sun beats down and time ticks by, Adak chats up other would-be co-passengers, the naked ghat bereft of a jetty, any shade or a proper staircase. They have to wade through the water to reach the boat  something the uncomplaining young teacher will do today as he had been doing all these years.        
	The stoicism did not desert Tamluk when the world virtually descended on the town three years ago to chronicle an upheaval that changed the course of Bengal politics. Tamluk became the gateway to Nandigram, the staging post to keep track of the tumultuous events that followed the death of 14 people in what came to be known as the March 14 firing.        
	As a bloody battle raged for months 60km away in Nandigram, Tamluk remained peaceful with its 72,000-plus population content with their way of living.         
	From which well is this eternal river of patience springing forth?        
	For some, the gold-tinted past is making the withered present less unbearable. The history of this place is very rich unlike its present. But what pains me more is the lack of effort to let the world know about the rich history, says Kamal Kumar Kundu, former secretary of the Tamralipta Museum and Research Centre. Kundu has written extensively on Tamluks history and cultural heritage.        
	But for those too young to nurse memories, history does not offer a refuge.         
	You dont even have a proper place to take your girlfriend out for a nice evening. We do not have any entertainment options here, rues Nilanjan Paul, a young banker with a private bank. Paul lives in Tamluk but works in the neighbouring industrial town, Haldia, around 40km away.         
	A band of boys, busy in an evening adda session at Hospital More, lists their grouses that range from lack of avenues to pursue professional education to the absence of a modern sports complex.        
	Change indeed is the theme of the elections here as the town prepares to elect representatives to the 146-year-old Tamluk Municipality.        
	 The Left, which has managed to field candidates in only half the 20 seats, wants to change the Trinamul Congress board. Trinamul would like to use the outcome to change the rulers at Writers Buildings.        
	Nobody talks about why Tamluk is not changing even as fast-paced development has changed the face of Haldia. It seems the wheels of change have stopped at Haldia, says Saikat Paria, a student of electronics and communications in Future Institute of Engineering and Management in Sonarpur.                  
	Not that civic elections bread-and-butter issues such as roads are being swept under the carpet. Municipal chairman and Left-turned-Trinamul leader Prithwish Nandy knows that roads  the width of some are less than 10 feet  need to be widened. But he is also aware that trying to resettle people after Nandigram will be suicidal. So he has made his poll plank what Calcutta police had once mastered: offer one-way regulations.        
	An exception to the sense of standstill is the price of land, which has gone up like most other places in Bengal, especially in the wake of Nandigram. Estimates suggest that land price  calculated in decimals here  has galloped to Rs 8 lakh per decimal in parts of Tamluk from less than a lakh just a few years ago. (1 cottah = 2.5 decimals).         
	Tamluks economy revolves around betel leaf trade, with estimates putting the annual turnover between Rs 300 crore and Rs 500 crore. Building bus bodies is another vocation.        
	The business volume in Tamluk has grown, but the quality of life has not improved, says Sudhangshu Bhowmick, who retired as a professor of economics from Tamluk College.         
	If roads cannot be widened for fear of a backlash, no prizes for guessing why no one wants to disturb anything for improving the quality of life.        
	This, in a region that marshalled courage to host a parallel government. The Quit India Movement of 1942 triggered the formation of a series of independent local governments in some parts of the country, like Satara in Maharashtra, Ballia in Uttar Pradesh and Tamluk in Bengal. The Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar (the National Government of Tamluk) was a parallel government with a judiciary and law-and-order machinery.         
	The government functioned from December 17, 1942, to August 8, 1944. It was dissolved on Mahatma Gandhis advice.        
	Another notable change is a mushrooming of banks. As many as 11 new branches of public and private sector banks have come up in Tamluk over the past three years.         
	The people of Tamluk have comparatively a higher savings propensity and the banks are trying to cash in on that, says Bhowmick.        
	Thrift is a virtue sired by patience  the birthmark of Tamluk and many a forgiving town in Bengal.

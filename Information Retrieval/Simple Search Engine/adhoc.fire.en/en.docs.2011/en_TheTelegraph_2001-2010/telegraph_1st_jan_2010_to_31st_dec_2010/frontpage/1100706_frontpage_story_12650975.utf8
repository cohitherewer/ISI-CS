The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP gets free run on Left pitch
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                BJP gets free run on Left pitch

	Calcutta, July 5: The flag that fluttered over Indias bandh capital changed colours for a few hours today.        
	The BJPs saffron-and-green flag was a noticeable presence during the bandh in Calcutta, where the partys protest calls used to elicit response only in a few pockets.        
	But the CPM call for the strike, following which the BJP announced its own separate hartal, gave the latter an opportunity to flex its muscles and claim gains to its base.        
	Abhijeet Chatterjee was taken by surprise this morning when around 50 protesters stopped his car at the VIP Road-Baguiati crossing. I knew that the red-flag brigade could stop me. But I never expected people carrying saffron flags to accost me, said the 39-year-old banker.        
	While the supporters of the Left parties preferred to lie low, the BJP borrowed almost every trick from the pioneers book. Chatterjee said the bandh supporters kept pounding his cars bonnet. He realised they meant business when the windscreen of a truck was smashed. I apologised and went home.        
	BJP supporters gheraoed Tollygunge police station after one of them was arrested for deflating the tyre of a car on SP Mukherjee Road. Our support base in the state is increasing, said state BJP president Rahul Sinha.

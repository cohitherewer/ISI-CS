The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dice favours Sen, not ISI
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dice favours Sen, not ISI
  - Top honour for Calcutta-educated statistician          G.S. MUDUR                                                
	New Delhi, April 10: Baranagar, you lost this game of chance.        
	A Calcutta-educated Indian-American statistician, who as a young man turned away from the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcuttas Baranagar and who has described his life as a march of countless dice, will receive one of the worlds most prestigious awards in his field.         
	Prof. Pranab Sen of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, the US, has been chosen for the 2010 Samuel S. Wilks Award from the American Statistical Association (ASA), the varsity has said. Sen will be the second statistician of Indian origin to receive the award after Calyampudi R. Rao from Pennsylvania State University got it in 1989.         
	Here at Chapel Hill, weve been trying to get the best statistics students from Calcutta University, the ISI, and Pune University  which is also very good in statistics, Sen told The Telegraph in a telephone interview.         
	But Sen is disappointed with the pace of education and research in India on the interface of biology and statistics. Biostatistics in India needs to develop a lot more, he said.         
	Sen, who had been denied entrance to a medical college in Calcutta because he was underage, has played a key role in developing a discipline called non-parametric statistics that finds applications in diverse areas of medicine and biology, including drug assessment, clinical trials and genetic studies.               
	The ASAs Samuel Wilks Award has been given every year since 1964 typically for outstanding and cumulative contributions in the field, statisticians in India familiar with Sens work said.         
	Its very much like a lifetime achievement award, said Partha Mazumder, professor and head of the human genetics unit at the ISI, Calcutta, who has known Sen for many years.         
	Sen studied at Calcuttas Presidency College and got his MSc and PhD degrees in statistics from Calcutta University before leaving for the US and joining the University of North Carolina in 1964. But hes been a regular visitor to India and continues his association with statisticians here  hes a friend of the ISI, Mazumder said.         
	In a poem that Sen pencilled for fellow statisticians a few years ago, he described how chance  throws of dice as he calls it  propelled him towards statistics.         
	He lost his father when he was about 10 years old, and had to depend on relatives to support his education  the first throw of dice.        
	During his final year in high school, he recalled in the poem, his mind was set more on the attractions of roadside games than on school.         
	But he topped the list of school graduation  a second throw of dice. He tried to get into medical school, but could not make it because he was 18 months below the required age for entry.         
	At Presidency, he initially opted for physics and mathematics, but an old friend persuaded him to switch to statistics  a third throw of dice.        
	After his Masters, he sought an assistantship at the ISI, but the pay the position offered would not have helped him support his siblings.         
	Flanked by chancy success, I stood at the ISICAL doorsteps, in quest of an assistantship, for which I was even aptitude tested! he wrote in his verse. Another throw of a dice: I was not selected. Not because of merit, nor of underage, but for not enough money to cover my family need.         
	So he returned to Calcutta University where he spent six years which he has described in his verse as the paradise of my life.        
	Statisticians say his contributions span medicine, genetics and other fields such as environmental science.         
	In medicine, there are many situations where the available data do not reveal any clear distribution of events  non-parametric statistics comes in handy to understand such situations, said P.G. Sankaran, associate professor at the Cochin University of Science and Technology, who himself uses non-parametric statistics.         
	Sen said he had held discussions with the Public Health Foundation of India, a public-private initiative to promote education and research in public health, to introduce intensive training in biostatistics to students in its postgraduate courses. Biostatistics in the public health arena would allow researchers to analyse patterns of diseases and study drug performance.         
	Biostatistics has not been incorporated into the courses to the extent which I would have liked to see  but I have not given up hope yet, Sen said. Im going to talk to the foundation again later this year.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, July 14: The Manipur health department today declared an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in the state and sounded an alert among health institutes and people residing in the affected areas.        
	After issuing a notification, director Y. Yaima asked all hospitals and medical staff in private and government health institutes as well as people, particularly in the four valley districts where the outbreak has been reported, to be on maximum alert.        
	The department declared the outbreak of the disease after 34 of the 40 blood samples sent to the Regional Medical Research Centre, Dibrugarh, and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New Delhi, tested positive.        
	Of the 40 samples, 27 were sent to the Dibrugarh centre. Test results received by the state health department today showed that 24 of the 27 samples had tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. Of the 27 samples sent to Dibrugarh centre, three patients have already died, the director said.        
	The Delhi institute also informed officials at the state health department over phone today that of the 13 samples sent to it, 10 had tested positive, sending alarm bells ringing in the department.        
	Since 34 of the 40 samples tested positive and many more people are reported to be suffering, we consider this an outbreak of the disease. Therefore, we are issuing the declaration, a senior official of the health department told this correspondent.        
	The latest information received by the department says at least 88 patients from Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts have been admitted to four hospitals in and around Imphal city. These are the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, the government-run Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital and two private hospitals.        
	The department has issued guidelines to the hospitals on how to treat patients affected by the disease. The director said since Japanese encephalitis was a viral infection, there was no curative treatment. The only way to deal with the situation was to continue with symptomatic treatment.        
	Officials of the department said since the first report of suspected cases of the disease came last month, fogging had been intensified in the valley areas to kill mosquitoes. Officials of the department have also stepped up an awareness campaign called information education campaign in these areas.         
	The department appealed to people residing in the affected areas not to expose themselves to mosquitoes.        
	Official sources said the disease had been reported once in a while in recent years but this was the first time that an outbreak of such a magnitude had hit the state. They said the department was finalising a strategy to control the outbreak.

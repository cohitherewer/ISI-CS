  - TROUBLE IN LS? HERES A GUIDE TO EVICT MISCHIEF-MAKERS          ZEESHAN JAWED                                                     
	Calcutta, March 10: When Sonia Gandhi sends the womens bill to the Lok Sabha, she may find the advice of Jwala Tiwary more useful than that of her crisis managers who were not sure till she put her foot down yesterday morning how to tame unruly MPs.        
	Congress leaders can find Tiwary at the Ganga Seva Samity Akhara in Chotelal Ghat on the banks of the Hooghly. The guruji knows a trick or two that may come in handy for Lok Sabha marshals, particularly when one of the opponents of the bill is a former wrestler named Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	If you know the right tricks, lifting someone from the floor and throwing him flat is not at all difficult, says the 42-year-old pehelwan, who heads the akhara.        
	Yesterday, marshals in the Rajya Sabha evicted seven MPs but they had a tough time lifting two MPs who used wrestling skills to frustrate the guards initially. As the duo lay on their tummies in the well of the House with their elbows and knees dug in, lifting them became a difficult mission.        
	Told that the marshals had to toil to evict them, Tiwary, in his trademark red loincloth, started to laugh. Arre hum to tees second bhi nahi lete unhe chit karne main (I wouldnt have taken even 30 seconds to throw them flat on the mat), said the guruji, adding that ghissa or bhardwaj tricks could have ended the task faster.        
	The term is ghissa in mud wrestling and bhardwaj in case of mattress wrestling, he said, stealing a glance at his disciples  known as chelas in akharas along the Hooghly.        
	Tiwary said the marshals should have held the MPs tight around the waist while locking their legs to freeze any movement. The pressure on the waist and locking of legs would have forced them to lift their chest.        
	If stubborn MPs who dont have the inside information of Mulayam Singh are thinking they can still rough it out, pay heed to the guruji. Had they tried resisting beyond a point, proper pressure could have broken their waist, said Tiwary, telling his chelas to give a demonstration in the ring.         
	Tiwarys deputy Nandu Pehelwan said many wrestlers use the trick of lying down to avoid being lifted and thrown flat on the floor.         
	They transfer their entire weight to their elbows and knees, leaving no space between floor and body, forcing the opponent to do all the slogging. They do this either when the opponent is relatively inexperienced or they are worn out because of a prolonged duel. Then, finding the right time, they launch the final assault and throw the opponent flat on the floor, Pehelwan said.

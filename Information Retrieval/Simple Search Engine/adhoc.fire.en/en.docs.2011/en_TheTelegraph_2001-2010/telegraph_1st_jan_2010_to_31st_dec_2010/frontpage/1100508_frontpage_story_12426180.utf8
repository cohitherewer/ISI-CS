  - Blow to Anil Ambani as SC rejects claim to lower price          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	New Delhi, May 7: Anil Ambani today lost his battle with brother Mukesh over the price of gas to be supplied to one of his power projects as the Supreme Court upheld the position the government and the older Ambani had taken.        
	The court said the government held assets such as natural gas in trust on behalf of the people. It has absolute powers to fix price, quantity and tenure of gas supply. Any sale by a private contractor (in this case Reliance Industries owned by Mukesh) to another party (Anils Reliance Natural Resources Ltd) has to be within the parameters laid down by the government.         
	It directed the Ambani brothers to renegotiate  in keeping with government policy  the agreement on gas supply they had signed at the time of their split after their fathers death.         
	A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, told Reliance Industries (RIL) to initiate fresh talks with Anils RNRL within six weeks on the terms of what is known as the gas-sharing master agreement. The pact has to be sealed in eight weeks.         
	Anil said he had no immediate plans to seek review of the Supreme Court verdict.        
	RNRL looks forward to an expeditious and successful renegotiation with RILin line with the Supreme Court order, the junior Ambani, who was in court, told reporters shortly after the verdict.        
	P.M.S. Prasad, RIL executive director, revealed: Mukesh said lets put all this behind and focus on the next wave of value creation, the bitterness is not good for either side.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora, whom Anil had accused of siding with Mukesh, said: The Supreme Court verdict upholds the fact that gas belongs to the government and the people.        
	RIL shares jumped to close at Rs 1,033.85, adding Rs 7,500 crore to the companys market capitalisation in an overall depressed market. The Anil Ambani Group companies suffered a combined erosion of over Rs 9,000 crore.        
	The Supreme Court said that the new agreement to be pieced together by the two sides would have to be placed before the company court (Bombay High Court) for necessary orders, setting the stage for another round of protracted negotiations between the estranged brothers.         
	The decision is a sharp jolt to Anils RNRL, which had insisted that RIL sell his company gas from the KGD-6 basin at $2.34 per million British thermal unit.         
	The price was possibly taken as the standard as RIL had quoted it in a bid for a 2004 NTPC tender. That contract could not be concluded because of differences on terms and is now in court.        
	In 2007, the government announced the price of $4.20.        
	Although the brothers agreement precedes this announcement, the court ruled that the family deal was not legally binding on either RIL or RNRL and their shareholders.        
	While two of the judges said the family memorandum of understanding could be the basis for the renegotiation, the third said the talks should be dehors, which means outside the agreement.        
	Anil will not get any gas supplies from RIL until he puts up a power plant, at either Dadri in Uttar Pradesh or Shahpur in Maharashtra.         
	The verdict has virtually stripped him of his entitlement to 28 million standard cubic metres of gas a day, a point that RIL made obliquely.         
	RIL can sell gas only at the price approved by the government and only to the entities who have been allocated gas under the gas utilisation policy, an RIL release said.         
	RNRL has not been designated as a recipient yet because it does not have a plant.

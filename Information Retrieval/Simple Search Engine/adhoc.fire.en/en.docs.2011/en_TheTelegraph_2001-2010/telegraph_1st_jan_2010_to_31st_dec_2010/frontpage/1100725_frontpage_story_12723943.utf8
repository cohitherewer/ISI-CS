  - Wagah land export deal   shuts out India        K.P. NAYAR                                                           
	Washington, July 24: As India and Pakistan wearily eye each other on the next steps in their bilateral dialogue, Islamabad has won a round of the new great game for control of New Delhis strategic backyard.         
	Through a mixture of deft negotiations with Kabul and considerable arm-twisting of Washington, Pakistan last weekend obtained the Hamid Karzai governments approval to an agreement that allows Afghanistans trucks to carry goods to the Wagah border for onward export to India without allowing similar reciprocal facilities for Indian products.         
	The agreement was reached in the presence of US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and America was helplessly forced to congratulate its negotiators on one of the most important, concrete achievements between the two neighbours in 45 years and announce that it represents the most significant bilateral economic treaty ever signed between Afghanistan and Pakistan.         
	Lest anyone should doubt that India would be allowed to send anything to Afghanistan using the logical land route through Pakistan, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani clarified in a statement that it has been agreed that no Indian export to Afghanistan will be allowed through Wagah.         
	Gilani rubbed it in, saying that however, Afghanistan would have the opportunity to export to India under the agreement.         
	The bigger, long-term gain for Pakistan from this agreement is that Kabul has given Islamabad reciprocal rights to export Pakistani products to Central Asia through Afghanistan as the crow flies.         
	When the Soviet Union broke up, India was among the first countries to open embassies in the Central Asian republics, aid the new governments and seek trade and economic co-operation with them under the personal direction of then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao who was acutely conscious of the strategic importance of the former Soviet territories for New Delhi.         
	But these efforts were hamstrung by the absence of access to Central Asia. Pakistan doggedly opposed allowing its territory for Indian goods transit to Afghanistan and onward transport to Central Asia.         
	On its part, Pakistan was also handicapped by its inability to use Afghanistan as a transit route for exports to Central Asia. But the new treaty with Kabul removes that handicap for Pakistan.         
	As part of Raos farsighted initiatives, India opened up new areas of co-operation with Iran and worked jointly with Tehran on an India-Iran-Central Asia-sea-rail link which would have allowed New Delhi to tap Central Asian markets.         
	The link was made feasible at considerable cost and with great fanfare but, subsequently, under pressure from Washington, New Delhi scaled back its engagement with Tehran.         
	It is not that South Block is unaware that Pakistan is incrementally gaining in its objective of realising the dream of its strategic depth in Afghanistan.         
	The ministry of external affairs is also aware that the only option it has to counter Islamabads drive is to return to the arrangements in the 1990s with Iran and Russia to co-ordinate their approach to domestic alliances in Afghanistan.         
	But even last week, US national security adviser James Jones urged Indian leaders across the board on a visit to New Delhi against recent attempts by the UPA government to revive ties with Tehran.         
	For more than a year, the Obama administration has been doing some heavy lifting in both Islamabad and Kabul to reach an agreement on their bilateral transit trade treaty.         
	The Americans and the Nato allies, who value Indias large aid programme in Afghanistan, were keen that there should be some way to reciprocally allow Indian goods in transit to Kabul.         
	This would have reduced Indian dependence on Iran for such transit and considerably increased both the speed and the effectiveness of Indian aid to Afghanistan, minimising the cost of transport as well.         
	But Pakistan negotiated with Afghanistan to produce an agreement which ensured that not an inch was ceded to India in the process.         
	Washington had to go along because of its desire to ensure access to Indian markets for Afghanistans agricultural products, which offers hopes of weaning farmers in that country away from opium cultivation and get them into legitimate agriculture.         
	Besides, Pakistan wants to keep its cards in future negotiations with India so as to be able to dangle the carrot of access to Afghanistan through its land route.         
	But that may be easier said than done. Industry organisations in Pakistan already fear that their government may eventually agree to such access, undercutting them of the advantage of a unique land route for exporting to Afghanistan and Central Asia.         
	The Lahore Chamber of Commerce has asked the government to make public the terms of the agreement, and other chambers this week called for public protests to prevent its final signature and ratification.         
	The treaty poses a dilemma for India. It cannot refuse Afghan goods through Wagah except by risking Kabuls displeasure and accusations of hampering mitigation of Afghanistans grinding poverty.

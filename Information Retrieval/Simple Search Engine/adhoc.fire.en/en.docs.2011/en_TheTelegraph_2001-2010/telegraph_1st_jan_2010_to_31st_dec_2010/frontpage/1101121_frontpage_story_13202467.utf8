The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Barack unpatriotic, says Palin
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Barack unpatriotic, says Palin
          ALEX SPILLIUS                            LAUNCH PAD                                  
	Washington, Nov. 20: Sarah Palin has accused Barack and Michelle Obama of being unpatriotic and suggested that they were racist.        
	The attack is likely to deepen the impression that the former Alaska governor is too divisive a figure to win the presidency.        
	In leaked extracts of her new book, Palin delves into the minefield of racial politics, arguing that the first African American US President is among those who regarded the conservative Tea Party movement as racially prejudiced and who thinks that America is a fundamentally unjust and unequal country.        
	As proof, she dredged up a quote from a 2008 campaign speech in which Michelle Obama said for the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country.        
	Palin went on to say: I guess this shouldnt surprise us, since both of them spent almost two decades in the pews of the Reverend Jeremiah Wrights church listening to his rants against America and white people.        
	Obama remains personally popular despite his Democratic Party allies being heavily beaten in the recent midterm elections.         
	His wife moreover is according to numerous polls the best-liked political figure in the country, thanks to her support for military families and campaign against childhood obesity. In America By Heart: Reflections on Family, Faith and Flag, which is published next week, Palin was choosing a line of attack against the First Lady that most other opponents of the President have abandoned long ago.        
	She characterised the First Lady as only being proud when her husband started winning elections. In full context, Michelle Obamas meaning was that she felt a surge of pride at the way young people were finding hope in the countrys future.         
	The former vice-presidential candidates second book is regarded as a launch pad for a bid for the 2012 Republican nomination, which Mrs Palin this week admitted she was seriously considering.

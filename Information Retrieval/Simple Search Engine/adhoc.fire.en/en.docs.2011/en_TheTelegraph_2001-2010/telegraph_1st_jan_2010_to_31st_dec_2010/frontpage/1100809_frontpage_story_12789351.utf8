The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Karats poll dialectic: defeat not unnatural
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Karats poll dialectic: defeat not unnatural
          J.P. YADAV                                               
	Vijayawada, Aug. 8: If the Bengal CPM was looking forward to some pep talk on a day Mamata Banerjee was preparing to sweep into a zone that has remained beyond the state governments footprints, Prakash Karat would not oblige.        
	Defeat in elections is not something unnatural. We dont judge everything on whether we win or lose elections, Karat declared today in Vijayawada, where the CPM is holding an extended session of its central committee.        
	The general secretary did allow himself a faint smile as he fielded a question whether the string of defeats in Bengal and other states was a reflection of the policies being adopted by the party.        
	Karat then held forth on why the party should take election defeats in its stride, something the leadership that does not contest popular polls can afford to say but not the Bengal unit which is facing daunting odds as next years elections approach.        
	The CPM chief said the party had been witnessing defeats in other parts of the country as well. It looks unnatural with regard to Bengal since we have not lost since 1977, said Karat, who has accommodated some concerns of the Bengal unit by picking out the Trinamul Congress as the main enemy and sparing the Congress in the state.        
	But Karats view on election results was perceived here as a reassertion of his defeatist attitude towards Bengal. Earlier this year, Karat had told British Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm that the CPM felt besieged and beleaguered in Bengal and expected to do very badly in the Assembly elections.        
	Although Karat had later denied having predicted defeat, his latest assertion suggests that for the CPM boss, the heavens wouldnt fall if the party loses in Bengal and Kerala.        
	Party leaders appeared surprised over Karats remarks and feared that it would further dampen the morale of cadres in the poll-bound states. One Bengal leader felt that Karats over-assertive puritanical stand could well be part of his defence mechanism against those who hold him responsible for the poll reverses.        
	Several delegates said Karat appeared to be in a denial mode, refusing to go in for self-criticism and introspection. He is trying to emphasise ideology over electoral politics, said a delegate. He wondered how ideology can be augmented in a parliamentary democracy if the party cannot persuade people to vote for its candidates.        
	Karat feebly acknowledged some mistakes in implementing the political line decided at the last party congress but iterated that the decision to withdraw support to UPA I over the nuclear deal was right. The decision to withdraw support was unanimously ratified by the central committee, said Karat, who, by now, was beaming.        
	If the decision was right, how did the Congress improve its poll performance from 2004? Were the voters wrong then? asked a delegate in private.        
	Some leaders feared that the defeatist approach would push the Left to the fringe of politics. The CPMs isolation finds reflection in the draft political resolution as well.        
	Along with advocating the need to attack the Congress and oppose the BJP, it underscores how even the regional parties are opportunistic. If we shun everyone, we will be left to fend for ourselves. If comrade Surjeet and Jyoti Basu brought us into the centre of Indian politics, Karat is trying to drag us away, said a central committee leader.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 9: In a damage control exercise, the state government today stayed the operation of revenue and land reforms secretarys letter calling for implementing certain provisions of an act that governs land registration throughout the state except Santhal Pargana.        
	The letter issued by revenue and land reforms secretary Santosh Kumar on December 4 to all deputy commissioners  except those in the Santhal Pargana districts  to ensure that Section 46(1) (b) of the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act be implemented with immediate effect and land belonging to ST/SC/backward castes should not be transferred without their (DCs) permission.        
	The letter, which even threatened to take action against registrars if they registered land without DCs permission, sparked a series of protests in Ranchi and several regions of the state, including Dhanbad, disrupting ongoing land registration processes.        
	Today, chief secretary A.K. Singh held a meeting with chief minister Arjun Munda and decided to stay the operation of the letter in view of several loopholes.        
	Whereas the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act talks of putting restrictions on the sale of land belonging to backward classes, the letter speaks of backward castes, said Singh.        
	The chief secretary said the letter did not mention which castes would be covered by the order, leading to ambiguities. Now, the government was awaiting clarifications from the revenue secretary before issuing appropriate orders.        
	Earlier, Kumar clarified that his letter was to implement existing provisions of the act that puts several restriction on registration of land belonging to SC/ST/ backward castes. We have not issued a communiqu about any new law, he said.        
	The restrictive provisions on land transfers had been introduced in the CNT Act in 1947. Though the provision applicable to STs was followed, the law applicable for SCs and backward castes was in a dormant stage. It had been challenged several times, but the Patna High Court had declared it constitutionally valid in 1996.

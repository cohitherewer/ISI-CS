                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Road revamp in rebel hubs
  - Centre to monitor project in 8 districts          AMIT GUPTA                            CRPF jawans with Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee leader Rajesh Kumar Sinha (45), in Ranchi on Thursday. He was rounded up on Wednesday afternoon with arms and ammunition and handwritten accounts of crores in levy collected from Jharkhand and Bihar. (Prashant Mitra)                                        
	Ranchi, Aug. 5: The Centre has okayed a much-needed revamp of 10 roads that link several key towns to rebel-hit interiors of Maoist hubs in as many as eight districts, including Palamau, Latehar, Chatra and East Singhbhum.        
	The Union ministry of surface transport and highways will directly monitor the implementation of the project and has promised to sanction about Rs 200 crore in the 2010-11 fiscal for the roads that have always been neglected since they are not categorised as state or national highways.        
	The roads arent in good condition and they need major repairs. We will soon send cost estimates and detailed project reports (DPR) for individual projects to the Centre, Ram Naresh Raman, the engineer-in-chief of the state road construction department told The Telegraph.        
	The project covers 250km of roads (see chart) in Latehar, Palamau, Chatra, Lohardaga, Gumla, Garhwa, Hazaribagh and East Singhbhum.                    
	In all, the Centre has identified 11 districts of Jharkhand as Maoist-affected and more roads are expected to be taken up for revamp in the next phase.        
	The Union ministry is also in the process of finalising tenders for a Rs 514-crore road revamp project falling under five national highways (NH) of the state. The stretches to be repaired are under NH-75, NH-75 (extension), NH-98, NH-99 and NH-100.        
	These stretches also criss-cross Maoist-affected areas of the state and the Union ministry had sanctioned these projects at the end of the 2009-10 fiscal.        
	We are waiting for a clearance of individual projects from the Union ministry. Once we get the approval we will ensure speedy execution of the project, said Murari Bhagat, the chief engineer of the NH wing of the road construction department.

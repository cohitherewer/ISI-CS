	Calcutta, March 7: What a united Opposition could not do to Pranab Mukherjee in Parliament on his budget proposals, pessimism on Bengal did today as a team led by the Union finance minister lost while trying to defend his home state.         
	Despite Mukherjees passionate defence, the motion of the Desh debate  What India can do today, West Bengal cannot  became the verdict of the house. Desh is an ABP Group publication.         
	Accounting techniques still ruled the mindspace of the finance minister, who presented the Union budget eight days ago, as he weighed the debit and credit sides of Bengals contribution since Independence.         
	The credit side is heavier with the likes of Satyajit Ray and Amartya Sen among others, said Mukherjee, who tried his best to portray a better future for Bengal.         
	Rupam Islam of Bangla band Fossils and Tilottama Majumdar, writer, were on his side, trying to counter the pessimism surrounding Bengal.         
	West Bengal is not outside India. India is the amalgamation of 28 states, their successes and failures. Yes, we might be behind in many things but not in everything, the finance minister said.         
	But the speakers for the motion, scientist Partho Ghosh, academician Chaitali Maitra, and restaurateur Anjan Chattopadhyay, convinced the 100-odd people at a south Calcutta auditorium that Bengal has lost its position of pre-eminence which prompted Gopal Krishna Gokhales statement  What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow.         
	Ghosh clinched it for the motion, sharing real life stories woven with ready wit. We applaud bright students making their names in other parts of the country or the world but we never think about why they run away from Bengal Even my sons dont want to come back, said Ghosh.         
	Maitra highlighted the steady decline in education standards while Chattopadhyay focused on Bengals failure in attracting business.         
	For the last five years, we thought there was going to be a revolution in terms of industry but unfortunately we could not do it. Gujarat could but not us, Chattopadhyay said without mentioning Nanos exit.         
	Mukherjee chose to ignore the Nano punch. But he praised the success in implementing the three-tier panchayati-raj system  the CPMs one of the most talked about claims regarding governance  in Bengal.        
	While Majumdar focused on the rich history of communal harmony in Bengal, Rupam made a valiant attempt to defend Bengal by dropping names  from cricketer Sourav Ganguly to director Rituparno Ghosh.         
	Using the Bangla rock phenomenon, he even tried to argue that trends in Bengal get followed across the country. Where else will you find regional rock music? Here it inspired an entire generation. Now others are following suit. So West Bengal did it first and India later, said Rupam.         
	But all these arguments failed to convince the audience and so when Ghosh said there was nothing to debate about the motion, the house said aye.

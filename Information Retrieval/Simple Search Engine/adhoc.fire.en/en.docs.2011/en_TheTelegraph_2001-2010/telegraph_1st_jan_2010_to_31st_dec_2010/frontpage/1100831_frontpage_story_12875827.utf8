                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Another FIR shock for Koda
          RUDRA BISWAS      
	Ranchi, Aug. 30: Already weighed down by money laundering charges, Madhu Koda was today the subject of another vigilance bureau FIR accusing the former chief minister and a host of senior JSEB officials of accepting kickbacks while awarding rural electrification contracts to a Hyderabad-based firm between 2006 and 2008.        
	Along with Koda, FIRs were also lodged against B.M. Verma, H. B. Lal and B.N.Pandey, all former chairmen of Jharkhand State Electricity Board; S.N. Chaudhary, former JSEB member (distribution); Anand Sagar, former JSEB chief engineer and Niranjan Rai, former JSEB finance controller.        
	Others included Binod Kumar Sinha, close aide of the former chief minister; Abhishek Rajput, the liaison man of IVRCL, the firm that bagged the contracts; D.K.Srivastava, joint general manager and zonal head of IVRCL and other officials of IVRCL.        
	FIRs were today lodged against Koda, three former JSEB chairmen and others, including officials of IVRCL, for causing loss to the state through manipulation of tenders relating to rural electrification projects in Jharkhand, M.V.Rao, IG (vigilance) told The Telegraph.        
	The vigilance bureaus move follows a reference made by JSEB chairman Shiv Basant to the investigating agency on July 25 alleging gross irregularities in finalising rural electrification contracts and pointing to the dubious role of successive chairmen of the state-owned power utility, many of whom had received illegal gratification from the beneficiary company.         
	JSEB had also forwarded a dossier compiled by the directorate of investigation, income tax department, Bihar and Jharkhand, with details of bribes allegedly paid to Koda through Sinha for facilitating the contracts.        
	The dossier, based on searches carried out by the IT department on the offices of IVRCL at Lucknow on October 31 and its Ranchi office on December 23 last year, contains a recorded statement of D.K.Srivastava, joint general manager and zonal head, IVRCL, who was heading company power projects in UP, Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	In his statement, the dossier claims, Srivastava confessed that Rs.11.40 crore was paid to the former chief minister through Sinha prior to finalising the contract.        
	IVRCL had bagged contracts worth Rs 467.12 crore for implementing rural electrification projects under Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana in the districts of Latehar, Garhwa and Palamau.         
	The yojna was to be implemented during the 10th and 11th Five Year Plan in 27,359 villages in Jharkhand covering 29.26 lakh rural households by JSEB, NTPC and DVC at a total cost of Rs 2,662.12 crore.              
	Koda, already facing a CBI probe for amassing assets disproportionate to his known sources of incomes, has also been charged by Enforcement Directorate for allegedly using hawal channels to launder hundreds of crores of rupees to Dubai, Liberia and other countries.               
	The former chief minister was arrested by the vigilance bureau in connection with the disproportionate assets case on November 30 last year and has been lodged at the Birsa Munda Central Jail, Ranchi, ever since.

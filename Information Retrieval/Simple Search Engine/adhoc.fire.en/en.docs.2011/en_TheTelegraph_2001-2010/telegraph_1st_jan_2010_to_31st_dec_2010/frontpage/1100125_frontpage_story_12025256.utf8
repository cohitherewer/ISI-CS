          OUR BUREAU                               
	Jan. 24: Suspected militants of the anti-talks faction of National Democratic Front of Boroland blew up a section of the metre-gauge track at Deka Mising Gaon in Dhemaji late last night while security forces gunned down two militants of the outfit as Assam braced for the Republic Day security challenge.         
	Train services along the section were suspended following the blast that damaged several sleepers and part of a track close to a bridge.         
	The blast has left a crater of around three metres in diameter on the railway tracks. Fortunately, this line is not a busy one and there has been no movement of trains since last evening.         
	Otherwise, there would have been a disaster, a police official said. The Northeast Frontier Railway has suspended running of trains at night across the state from tonight till January 27 fearing subversive attacks.         
	The police have not found any flexible wires or any other article from the blast site to suggest that the explosion was carried out by remote control.         
	The damaged portion of the track was restored this evening.         
	The Dhemaji deputy commissioner, P. Ashok Babu, said all possible measures have been taken to thwart such attacks by militants.         
	Babu and Dhemaji superintendent of police, Satyaraj Hazarika, along with railway officials, visited the blast site this morning.         
	While officials inspected the blast site, security forces gunned down two militants belonging to the Ranjan Daimary faction of the NDFB in two separate incidents in Kokrajhar and Udalguri.         
	In the first incident, an NDFB cadre was shot dead at Sesapani village in Kokrajhar district around 6am.         
	The police said two militants had come to the village to collect money from a villager when security personnel, who were waiting there, shot one of them. Another managed to escape.         
	The extortionists had come to the house of Sunil Mitra and were returning after collecting Rs 5,000 when they came face-to-face with the waiting security personnel. When challenged, the duo tried to escape. One militant died when the securitymen fired at them, a police official in Kokrajhar said.         
	A 9mm pistol and ammunition were recovered from the slain militant, who is yet to be identified.         
	Mitra told the police that this was not the first time that he was forced to pay money to the NDFB.         
	He had earlier paid Rs 20,000 to the outfit. This time, the outfit had demanded Rs one lakh from him, Kokrajhar superintendent of police P.K. Dutta said.         
	In the ongoing operation in Rowta reserve forest, security forces gunned down an unidentified NDFB rebel around 9 this morning.        
	Our operations are still on. We are sure there are more NDFB cadres still holed up inside the reserve forest, Udalguri superintendent of police A.K. Tiwari said.         
	A pistol and ammunition were found on him.         
	IED found: Army recovered an IED while checking a bus at Mahaliapara Chowk in Darrang around 4.30 this afternoon.         
	The bus was on its way to Guwahati from Tangla in Darrang.         
	A source in the army said the bomb was being taken to Guwahati and that the driver, Ismail Ali, doubled as a linkman for Ulfa and ferried bombs for the outfit.

  - Sen joins list with appeal         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Calcutta, July 14: Industries minister Nirupam Sen today struck a virtual farewell note, reminding would-be successors of the folly of Kalidas in an attempt to dissuade them from cutting the development branch.        
	Political parties will come and go. Today, I am in the chair but tomorrow somebody else can be there. We wont remain in power or in the chair forever. We will have to go away, Sen told the Assembly today while participating in the debate on the state industry budget.        
	The prophecy articulated the sense of despondency that has gripped the Left and added another voice to the chorus of doomsday predictions (see chart).        
	Sen went one step further and almost sought to tickle the taste buds of the Opposition to save what he referred to as development projects. Without mentioning Kalidas, he referred to the fabled misadventure that propelled the woodcutter onto the path of unsurpassed accomplishment.        
	But the new set of people who will be taking over should look after the states interest. They are cutting the branch of a tree on which they are sitting. They should not stall development projects now as that would affect the state when they will be in power, he said.        
	The audience he was hoping to reach out to  the Trinamul Congress and the Congress  was not in the House. Both had boycotted the debate.        
	But Sen seemed to find the subject irresistible and made an impassioned plea, returning to the theme of development frequently.         
	Apparently keeping the 2011 Assembly elections at the back of his mind, the minister said the ruling party would accept the verdict of the people but added that politics shouldnt take centre stage in matters of development.        
	We must always think of what the people would get if narrow, partisan politics comes into play and stops development work. Let there be differences of opinion. Let there be debates on how the state will develop. We all will go to the people. We will bow to the wishes of the people and accept their verdict. But please dont indulge in politics when it comes to development. I would have been happy if the Opposition was in the House. But I was deprived of what they would have had to say on the industry budget, Sen told the House.        
	Without going into the details of the electoral debacle the Left suffered at the hands of Trinamul in particular in the recent civic polls, the industries minister said the Opposition was sending wrong messages to prospective investors that all was lost for the state.        
	A venomous campaign has been launched across the state that all is lost in Bengal and that an investor-friendly atmosphere isnt here. This is being done particularly after the election results that have given the Opposition parties an impetus. All these are sending wrong messages to willing investors, said Sen, who once spearheaded Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees industrialisation drive.         
	Sen is considered close to CPM chief Prakash Karat who had yesterday said the Left in Bengal should overcome its weaknesses and shortcomings.        
	Sen suggested that the Opposition was trying to whip up a fear psychosis about the state. They (Opposition) are trying to give such an impression of Bengal to make investors feel scared of landing at the airport. But the reality is that investment in our state has gone up and we hope that it will be upwardly mobile in the years to come.        
	But after the Singur and Nandigram experiences, Sen was quick to add, the policy of the state government was not to set up industry at the cost of farmers interests.        
	Wherever the government is acquiring land, we are discussing with the farmers first, telling them about the compensation and rehabilitation they will get. Moreover, we are concentrating on mono crop and infertile lands. Our policy is not to affect the farmers, he said.         
	Asked to react to the industries ministers remarks in the House, leader of the Opposition and Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee said: For industry to proceed, consensus is required. But the ruling party went in for confrontation. Thats why Singur (the Tata car project) didnt happen. We had asked for the publication of a white paper on which industry got how much land in the state but the government didnt oblige. Now that the whistle has been blown, the industries minister is talking about the possibility of not being in power.

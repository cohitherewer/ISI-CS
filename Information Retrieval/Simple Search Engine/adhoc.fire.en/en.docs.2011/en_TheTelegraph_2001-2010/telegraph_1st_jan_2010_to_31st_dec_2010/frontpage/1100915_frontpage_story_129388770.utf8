	Bhopal, Sept 15 (PTI): Former Hockey Olympian Aslam Sher Khan today called for boycott of the Commonwealth Games as he feels the event is a "colossal waste" for a country like India.
    "I have been told that Rs 28,000 crore have been spent on the games and I feel that this was a colossal waste and nothing else," Aslam told reporters on the day the Queen's Baton for the Games was to arrive in Madhya Pradesh.
    He said that if this money was spent on development of sports in the country, India might well have bagged 28 gold medals in the Olympics.
    Aslam, who is now a Congress leader, said the government should have dismissed the present organising committee which is holding the games and entrusted the task to people with integrity. .

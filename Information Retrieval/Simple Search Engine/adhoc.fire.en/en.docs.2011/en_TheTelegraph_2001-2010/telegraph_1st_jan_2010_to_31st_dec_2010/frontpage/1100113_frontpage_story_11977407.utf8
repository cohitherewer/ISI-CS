The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Palin takes on Fox News job
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Palin takes on Fox News job
          ALEX SPILLIUS                            Thrilled                                  
	Washington, Jan. 12: Sarah Palin has signed on as a commentator with Fox News, fulfilling predictions that she would pursue a career in television after stepping down as governor of Alaska.        
	The conservative star will not have her own show, but will contribute to various news programmes and present an occasional series involving ordinary American heroes.        
	She will, therefore, have time for other pursuits that will keep her name alive as a potential presidential candidate in 2012, but the move will increase speculation that her future lies outside electoral politics.        
	 I am thrilled to be joining the great talent and management team at Fox News, Palin said in a statement posted on the networks website. Its wonderful to be part of a place that so values fair and balanced news.        
	Palin made a surprise resignation as governor in July, 17 months before the end of her first term in office.        
	Her resignation came less than a year after she vaulted to overnight celebrity as John McCains running mate for the Republicans in the 2008 presidential election.        
	The Right-wing Fox News was always her likeliest destination in the media, which she has for the most part disdained for treating her unfairly. The size of her contract with Americas top-rated cable channel, owned by Rupert Murdoch, was not disclosed.              
	The new role will be a return of sorts to her professional beginnings.        
	In the 1980s she worked as a part-time sports newsreader for KTUU-TV in Anchorage.              THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

          OUR BUREAU                            Dark ages: Vehicles stuck in a traffic jam in Rajarhat on Monday evening. Picture by Pabitra Das                                  
	More than 1,000 residents of Mahishgot and Dhalipara in New Town near Salt Lakes Sector V blocked New Town Road for 90 minutes on Monday evening, holding up airport-bound traffic, to protest power cuts and water supply problems.         
	The blockade, on both flanks of the artery, brought traffic to a standstill for several kilometres from 7.30pm. In a chain reaction, vehicle flow on the EM Bypass and in Sector V was also disrupted.         
	As police could not be seen on the stretch even half an hour after the blockade started, many airport-bound passengers caught in the snarl panicked.         
	The blockade was lifted around 9pm, but vehicles crawled on the zip-zap-zoom stretch till around 10pm. There was, however, no report of any passenger missing a flight because of the roadblock.        
	We have had 10 to 12 hours of power cuts daily for the past seven to eight days. The water supply to the area is also irregular. But nobody cares because we are poor, said Asgar Ali, one of the protesters.        
	Metro spoke to Amit Sengupta, who was stuck in the snarl with two of his colleagues in an NGO that has been providing relief in Aila-devastated areas of the Sunderbans. The three were on their way to Sealdah to take a train to return to Canning after meeting a government official in Barasat.        
	We got stuck at 7.15pm. Weve been stuck here for over two hours. We dont know how we are going to get home tonight, said Sengupta.        
	We blocked this important road because we have to draw the attention of those who matter. People might have been inconvenienced, but we too have suffered a lot, added Ali.        
	The protesters ransacked the guards room of East End Cooperative Housing Society, when lights came back on after a power cut.        
	The housing complexes of the rich have all the benefits. They are never made to suffer like us, said Sunil Mollah, another protester.        
	The police had to negotiate with the protesters for several minutes before they agreed to lift the blockade.        
	There is always the danger of such a mob turning violent. In which case, things would have been really hard to control, said an officer.        
	The traffic situation became normal around 10pm, he added.

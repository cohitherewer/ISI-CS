          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The Supreme Court today asked the CBI to probe all telecom licences awarded from 2001 to 2007 and information thrown up by the Niira Radia tapes, delineating the contours of the investigation that will now cover decisions taken by the BJP-led NDA government also.        
	Todays formal order, the first step in the probe being monitored by the court, means that the actions of not just former minister A. Raja but those of his predecessors such as Ram Vilas Paswan, Pramod Mahajan, Arun Shourie and Dayanidhi Maran will come under the CBI scanner.        
	Decisions taken by several senior officials will also be investigated.        
	The court directed the director-general in charge of income-tax investigations to arrange for transcripts of the Radia tapes, which feature purported conversations the lobbyist had with industrialists, journalists and politicians, to be handed over to the CBI.        
	Issuing seven directives to the CBI, Justices G.S. Singhvi and Asok Kumar Ganguly asked the agency to conduct the investigation without being influenced by any functionary, agency or instrumentality of the state and irrespective of the position, rank or status of the person to be probed.         
	The court said it was issuing the instructions to ensure that the agency, in a serious matter like this, conducts a comprehensive and co-ordinated investigation with the Enforcement Directorate without any hindrance.         
	The court asked the CBI to probe issues highlighted in a Central Vigilance Commission report forwarded to the CBI director on October 12, 2009, and the CAG report that prima facie found serious irregularities in the grant of licences to 122 applicants....        
	The agency was asked to lay particular emphasis on the loss caused to the exchequer and register a case, if it had not done so.        
	The court asked the CBI to submit a progress report on its probe on February 10 next year.

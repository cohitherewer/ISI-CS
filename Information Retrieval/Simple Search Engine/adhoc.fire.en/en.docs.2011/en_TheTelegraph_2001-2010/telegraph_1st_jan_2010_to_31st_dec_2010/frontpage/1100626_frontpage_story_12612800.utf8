The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Irritants out of the system, time to deliver
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Irritants out of the system, time to deliver
                            
	Brazil march on. Well, march might be overplaying it; this is a word which conjures up images of honourable armies progressing inexorably towards grand victories.        
	More appropriately, one might say that Brazil rumble on, crunch on, clump on, strong-arm their way on, grumble their way on.        
	Their goalless draw against group runners-up Portugal was not pretty, contained no passages of play of note and offered no glimpse of the style demanded of world champions.        
	But then, coach Dunga made four changes including the enforced use of the journeyman Julio Baptista in place of the suspended Kaka. It was a team built to hold what they had which may appear a surprisingly unambitious strategy for the record five-times World Cup winners.        
	From the 14th minute when Luis Fabiano, instead of attacking goal, attacked his marker Pepe instead, the tenor of the match was set. Kick for kick; pull for pull; push for push; clog for clog.        
	Was there a little, as had been suggested beforehand, of the subconscious resentment of the colonised nation against the old colonisers? Surely not.         
	Perhaps the context of the match compromised the quality of the football. Brazil were through to the second round but needed a draw to stay top of the group; Portugal needed the draw to secure runners-up spot against any strange trick of goal difference to explode from Ivory Coast against North Korea (which it didnt, of course).        
	Playing for a draw is not easy. This is half a result and footballers attuned, trained and focused to go out for every game with only victory in their hearts and minds cannot easily adapt. It is against their creed and their sporting education.        
	These players  from Maicon to Nilmar, from Carvalho to Costa  are winners by nature. That is the reason they have risen through the ranks of the game to reach the pinnacle which is the World Cup finals tournament.        
	All are too young to remember the notorious meeting of the nations at the 1966 finals in England.        
	Any straw poll of fans nowadays will come up with tales of 66 which will feature, high on the list, Eusebios goals and sportsmanship  of the England-Portugal semi-final which went nearly half an hour without a foul.        
	However, this is not the whole tale but merely the last image.        
	Earlier in those 1966 finals Portugal beat Brazil 3-1 in the group stage and, notoriously, kicked Pele out of the competition. The Great Hero being led away, limping under the sad protection of a raincoat, is one of the iconic images of the era.        
	That was not a pretty Portugal side and the full-bloodied physicality they brought to this latest meeting with Brazil was redolent of battles of long ago.        
	Portugal have been nicknamed the Brazil of Europe because of the technical virtuosity of their players; but they also know how to kick, how to irritate and how to foul.        
	The most one can hope is now that both teams have got the irritants out of their systems, they will go on to play the pure, skilful, entertaining football of which we all know both are more than capable.        
	This 2010 World Cup is entering its closing phase; its a historic event for many reasons but, do not let the excitement fool you, not yet for the quality of the football.        
	The game  football as a whole - needs a historic match: Brazil and Portugal are more capable than most of contributing in full measure to such an event.        
	Time to deliver, boys.

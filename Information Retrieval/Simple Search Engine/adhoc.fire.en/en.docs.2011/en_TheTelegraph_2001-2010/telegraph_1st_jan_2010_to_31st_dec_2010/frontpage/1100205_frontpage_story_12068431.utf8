                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Maruti chief to set up IIM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             RC Bhargava                                  
	Ranchi, Feb. 4: R.C. Bhargava, the chairman of Maruti Udyog, has been appointed chairman of the board of governors constituted for the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi.         
	Bhargava, who arrived here today along with IIM Calcutta director Shekhar Chaudhuri and B.B. Chakraborty, will be unveiling the IIM Ranchi plan tomorrow at Suchana Bhavan, the temporary address for the management cradle in Jharkhand.        
	Its just the beginning. Many more things are to be formalised now, he told The Telegraph about Ranchi IMM that will ultimately move to a 200-acre plot in Nagari, around 20 km from here.        
	IIM Calcutta, where Bhargava is also on the board of directors, would be the mentor institute that will hand-hold its new Ranchi sibling through the initial years. It is also expected to help draft the curriculum, course structures and teaching methodology.         
	A 1956 IAS topper, Bhargava joined Maruti Udyog in 1981 and became its second managing director in 1985 (V.Krishnamurthy was the first).         
	Today, Bhargava and his team also visited XISS, SAIL-RDCIS and discussed various issues with chief secretary Shiv Basant.         
	XISS director Alex Ekka called it a courtesy visit. They also wanted some sort of collaboration once the premier business school starts functioning, he added.        
	According to sources, tomorrow Bhargava will announce intentions of beginning courses from the summer for the 2010-2011 academic session. Initially, classes will be held at Suchana Bhavan on Kanke Road near Raj Bhavan from June.        
	But so far, the Nagari plot is yet to be handed over by the state government to IIM.

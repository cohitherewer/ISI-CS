The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Farook glare on state govt
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Farook glare on state govt
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, May 12: Governor M..H. Farook has asked the Shibu Soren government to put on hold senior level appointments and large-scale transfers citing the prevailing political uncertainty in the state.         
	Farook, according to Raj Bhavan sources, called chief secretary Ashok Kumar Singh yesterday and expressed his displeasure at some of the recent transfers of bureaucrats and proposed senior-level appointments, especially that of the chief information commissioner.        
	The chief secretary, according to sources, sent a letter to the chief ministers office today and pointed out that the governor had disapproved of the state governments move to order large-scale transfers and appointments.        
	A three-member committee, headed by the chief minister, had recommended former chief secretary A.K. Basu for the post of chief information commissioner, though the official file was yet to be sent to Raj Bhavan.        
	Besides, the joint secretary in the planning department, Gauri Shankar Prasad, was transferred to Seraikela-Kharsawan as deputy commissioner a couple of days ago.         
	According to sources, transfer of half a dozen deputy commissioners, several SPs, DDCs and other officials were in the pipeline as the government was considering requests from MLAs to have officers of their choice posted in their constituencies apprehending the imposition of Presidents rule.        
	Legal experts, however, said the governors move wasnt constitutional as the Soren government was a legitimate entity since it had not been reduced to a minority.        
	There is no petition pending before the governor for withdrawal of support by the BJP. So, the directive isnt legally tenable, pointed out former advocate-general Anil Kumar Sinha.         
	The political mood in the state was far from upbeat as indications were that the BJP was finding it difficult to make up its mind and had summoned Jamshedpur MP Arjun Munda to Delhi.         
	Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who arrived here today, indicated the negotiations would take more time. It is a complex situation. The decision will be taken after going through all aspects, he said.        
	In the Opposition camp, Union food processing minister Subodh Kant Sahay met JVM chief Babulal Marandi to discuss their role, if any, to avoid Presidents Rule in the state.         
	The Union minister, however, clarified that the Congress was not in a hurry to form an alternative government. We are waiting for the BJP to be further exposed for its lust for power, he said.

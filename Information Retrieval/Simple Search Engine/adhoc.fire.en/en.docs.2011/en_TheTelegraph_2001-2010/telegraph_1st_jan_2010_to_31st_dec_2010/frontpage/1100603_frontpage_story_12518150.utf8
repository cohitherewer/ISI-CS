  Buddha loses popular mandate          ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                                                          
	Calcutta, June 2: Repeating the trend of the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, Bengal has again voted decisively against the Left. The results of the civic polls across the state should leave Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in no doubt that he has lost the popular mandate to rule.         
	The verdict is yet another confirmation of the big political transformation that has been taking place in Bengal since the panchayat polls two years ago. At the centre of the change is the peoples rejection of the Left. And it is growing stronger from election to election.         
	 True, these were civic polls and the voters numbered about 16 per cent of Bengals total electorate. Constitutionally, the government can last one more year. But these arguments do not alter the fact that the verdict has robbed Left rule of its political and moral legitimacy.         
	More than ever before, Mamata Banerjees call for early polls would not only look justified but also have a wider popular appeal. In rejecting the idea for early polls, the CPMs politburo member M.K. Pandhe and Bengal unit secretary Biman Bose were utterly predictable, but that only seemed to highlight the hiatus between the party and the people.         
	The CPMs refusal to accept the peoples verdict and seek a fresh mandate can only strengthen Mamatas resolve to force the issue. For, the people who voted overwhelmingly for her call for change could see in the CPMs refusal a brazen attempt to hold on to power.         
	The massive swing against the Left has been mostly her doing. The results show that her campaign to forge a broad unity against the Left has not only held but also intensified since the 2009 polls.         
	Nowhere was the popular mood stronger than in Calcutta, which has been her primary base for a long time. For all the CPMs campaigns against her over the recent train disaster, her partys alleged links with Maoists and other issues, the people seemed to have settled for just one thing  the ouster of the Left.         
	Mamatas massive victory in Calcutta has few parallels in recent politics in Bengal. Her break-up with the Congress makes it look ever more awesome.         
	But the results have another message that clearly makes Mamatas victory less than complete. She made a clean sweep of Calcutta, but failed to take the rest of Bengal.         
	The difference between Calcutta and the districts for the Trinamul Congress is a striking feature of the results. While Trinamul won Calcutta and Salt Lake overwhelmingly on its own strength, it could get only 25 of the 79 civic boards in the districts. Hidden under that tally is the fact that in at least seven of these municipalities, Trinamuls success was made easier by official or unofficial seat adjustments with the Congress.                    
	An important tale thus hangs by the hung verdict in as many as 29 municipalities. Mamata was confident that Trinamul would form the board in most of these civic bodies and the party may well do so.         
	But that does not change the fact that she could not take the rest of Bengal the way she swept Calcutta. She would need the Congress to form the boards in the hung municipalities. This means that even such a massive wave against the Left is not enough for Trinamul to seize power in Bengal on its own. This may change but it is so at least at this moment.         
	It is entirely possible, though, that many Congress winners will leave the party and join Trinamul to help the latter form the boards. But the results in the districts prove beyond doubt that Mamatas run for Writers Buildings could still be an open question without help from the Congress.         
	As for the Congress, the first look at the results could be somewhat misleading. With the break-up of the alliance, its chances never looked very bright. Mamatas campaign against the Left has always had another significant political angle  the spread of her area of influence had to be at the expense of both the Left and other non-Left parties such as the Congress.         
	It is still unclear how much the Congress vote queered the pitch for Trinamul in the municipalities in the districts where the two parties fought each other. What is clear, however, is that the Congress has held on to its traditional areas of strength, such as Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, Malda, Murshidabad and parts of Burdwan and Nadia. And this too braving the double onslaught of the CPM and Trinamul.         
	While the Left may become yesterdays story, the Congress could be more relevant than Mamata would like to admit. To capture Bengal whenever the Assembly polls take place, she may need the Congress more than the latter may need her because it is she, more than the Congress, who wants to rule Bengal hereafter.

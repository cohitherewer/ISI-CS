                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Quotas untangled, local polls by June
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Ranchi, April 9: Jharkhand is all set to have elected panchayats by the end of June with the state cabinet headed by chief minister Shibu Soren today okaying amendments to the designated act to clear various anomalies on the question of reservation for Scheduled Tribes.         
	As decided earlier, in scheduled  or reserved  areas posts of zilla parishad chairpersons have been reserved for Scheduled Tribes. In non-scheduled areas, Scheduled Castes and backward communities would be granted reservation proportionate to their population.             PANCHAYAT ELECTIONS
      
	DISTRICTS: 24  
	SCHEDULED AREAS: 13
  Ranchi, Khunti, Gumla,
  Lohardaga, Simdega,
  West Singhbhum, East Singhbhum, Seraikela-
  Kharsawan, Dumka,
  Jamtara, Pakur, Latehar,
  Sahebganj districts.
  Also, Sunder Pahari,
  Goraigiri blocks in Godda dist; Bhandaria block in Garhwa; Rabda, Pokharia panchayats under Satbarwa block in Palamau  
	NON-SCHEDULED AREAS: 11 
  Hazaribagh, Koderma, Bokaro, Dhanbad, Giridih, Deoghar, Chatra, Palamau, Garhwa, Godda,
  Ramgarh districts      
	However, the state has decided not to reserve posts of zilla parishad chairpersons for Scheduled Tribes in non-scheduled areas in a move that will no doubt appease sadans, or native non-tribals, who constitute around 64 per cent of the population.         
	The population of tribals is around 26 per cent.        
	Deputy chief minister Raghubar Das said the governor would now be requested to promulgate an ordinance introducing the proposed amendments to the Panchayati Raj Act, 2001, paving the way for the state election commission to announce the schedule.         
	We are committed to smoothly transfer power to the people living in far flung villages, he said.         
	State chief secretary Ashok Kumar Singh maintained that total reservations in non-scheduled areas would not exceed 50 per cent. Also, posts of vice-chairmen or deputy heads would remain unreserved at all the three tiers of the panchayati raj system.         
	He clarified that in non-scheduled areas, reservation for zilla parishad chairpersons may be extended to SCs, OBCs and the general category on rotation. But, it was for the state election commission to take a final call on this. At present, rotational reservation is available in urban civic bodies.         
	Legal luminaries had questioned the justification of extending the benefits of reservation to tribals in non-scheduled areas of the state comprising 11 districts, claiming that by doing so tribals would get three more seats in addition to the 13 reserved seats in scheduled areas.                     
	This meant tribals would end up getting 16 out of 24 seats, working out to 66 per cent reservation going against the mandated ceiling of 50 per cent.         
	But now that the cabinet has okayed the proposed amendments to the act, it is clear that of the 260 blocks, 132 posts of block heads have been reserved for STs. There are 4,562 village panchayats. Of this, 2,071 will be headed by STs.         
	Fifty per cent seats would be horizontally reserved for women. It means, women would be given 50 per cent reservation at all levels and everywhere, Singh explained.         
	In scheduled areas, the posts of prakhand pramukh (block head) and mukhiya (panchayat head) would be reserved for scheduled tribes. But, in the non-scheduled areas, STs, SCs and OBCs would be granted reservations proportionate to their population. Here, too the total reservation limit would not exceed 50 per cent.         
	The state election commission will be requested to appoint observers and begin ground work at the earliest. Our aim is to complete the entire election process by June 30, Singh added.

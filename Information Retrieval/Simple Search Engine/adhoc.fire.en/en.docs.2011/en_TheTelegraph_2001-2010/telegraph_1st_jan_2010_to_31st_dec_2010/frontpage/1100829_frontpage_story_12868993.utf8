	Silli, Aug. 28: The stakes are high but hope floats.        
	For farmers of the Silli-Muri-Angara region of Ranchi district, not far from the state capital, the surrounding hills have proved to be a boon with rainwater flowing into farmlands below to provide one last chance for local residents battling a cruel drought.        
	As a result, farmers have painted the area lush green by planting paddy once again, keeping hopes alive for a good yield in the coming days, provided of course the rain god smiles on them in the coming days.        
	Its a gamble that many are willing to take in the region geologists condescendingly call, remnants of the Chhotanagpur plateau.        
	I finished transplanting paddy on my field a fortnight back. This plot had been left out on which I am transplanting paddy today, said Banmali Mahto of Lowadag village in Silli block, 60km from Ranchi.        
	This year, monsoon has been particularly bad in Ranchi district. While districts like Pakur, Sahebganj, Dumka and Deoghar received rainfall up to 700mm, Ranchi received only around 400mm against an average of 450mm.        
	Average paddy plantation in Ranchi is barely six per cent. However, in some pockets rainfall has been slightly better which has helped in plantation work, said A. Wadood, head of agriculture physics and meteorology department of Birsa Agriculture University.        
	The showers that lashed Ranchi district areas a few days ago has pulled farming families, including women and children, out to the fields again. The natural topography of the area helped and so they made the most of the rainwater.        
	The rainwater from surrounding hills flowed into our land and created several small pools. This water is proving to be the saving grace, said Mahto, the proud owner of a 2-acre plot.        
	Transplanting work with renewed vigour is on in most nearby villages in the Silli and Muri region. Folks at Tutki, Nawadih, Domondih, Mousidih, Lowadih, Pokatangar, Basudih, Chokesereng, Bonta, Jhabri, Etihasa, Silidih, among others, have already completed the exercise.        
	At Basudih, 5km from Lowadag, several small pools of water have been formed in the land. That has meant that over the last few days, hectic farming activities, like tilling and transplanting, have been on.        
	At the villages of Angara block, about 25km from Ranchi near Muri, residents were busy digging out narrow channels in the wet soil to ensure water flowed to the dry areas as well.        
	I am taking a risk. I have transplanted paddy in 8 of my 11-acre plot. But I expect a good yield only if theres good rain in the coming days, said Manai Singh Munda of Bonta village in Silli.

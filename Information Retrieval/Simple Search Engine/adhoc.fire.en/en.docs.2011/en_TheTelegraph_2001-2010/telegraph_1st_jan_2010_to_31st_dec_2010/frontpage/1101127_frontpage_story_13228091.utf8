                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Sonia amp; 80 forgo pay
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                            Sonia Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Congress president Sonia Gandhi and around 80 other party MPs today offered to forgo their daily allowance for the period that Parliament remains paralysed.        
	The no work, no pay line is an attempt to mount moral pressure on the Opposition, which has not allowed the House to function since November 10.        
	Each MP gets Rs 2,000 as daily allowance for attending Parliament. One big reason the Opposition has not boycotted Parliament so far is that members would lose this allowance if they did not mark their attendance.        
	The Congress has 207 Lok Sabha members and 71 Rajya Sabha members.        
	More are expected to follow the example of the 80 who wrote to the Speaker today, saying they had no moral right to claim allowance when Parliament was not working.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal said the Congress president supports and favours their decision.        
	This is, however, their individual decision. They have decided that that they will not take their daily allowance from November 10 till the end of this session on days Parliament remains disrupted. The loss to the exchequer due to disruptions in Parliament is very painful. We should follow the principle of no work, no pay, the minister said.        
	Rahul Gandhi is among the MPs who wrote to Speaker Meira Kumar.        
	However, Congress ministers are not making the offer because they get a separate allowance that is not linked to Parliaments functioning.         
	The BJP dismissed the Congress move as a diversionary tactic. It is a sheer diversionary tactic by the Congress to say no work, no pay. We demand JPC and we will not relent until JPC is announced, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said.

          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                      Lalu Prasad after the budget on Wednesday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Congress offered bouquets, the BJP threw brickbats and the man she succeeded said she was chasing a dream.        
	Former railway minister Lalu Prasad said Mamata Banerjees budget was disappointing.        
	The budget is disappointing. The railway ministrys balance sheet is in poor shape. There is no provision for funds in it and private investment in railway projects is inadequate, PTI quoted the RJD chief as saying.        
	On the public-private partnership initiatives he had introduced as minister in the previous UPA government, Lalu Prasad said private investment in railway projects had suffered because of the global meltdown.        
	Now the situation is even worse for the ministry and all talk of attracting private funding is like chasing a dream.        
	The Bihar leader said many banks as well as companies involved in manufacturing locomotives lost money during the meltdown and unless they were assured of returns, no company would come forward to participate in railway projects. The situation in the ministry is a matter of concern, he added.        
	Lalu Prasad also said Mamata had not taken follow-up action on projects he had started. I had introduced various passenger amenity measures and created new divisions. However, no follow-up action has been taken on my decisions, he said.        
	Ally Congress defended the budget.        
	Party spokesperson Manish Tewari said it was futuristic and a balancing act between immediate needs and long-term plans.        
	Tewari also welcomed the decision not to increase passenger fares.        
	The BJP said Mamata was cheating the people by announcing unapproved projects and focusing on non-railway work such as agriculture, medicine and social welfare.         
	Her announcements in the railway budget are mostly related to activities of other ministries such as agriculture, education and medical, and not about more funds for new railway lines, passenger amenities or modernisation projects, BJP leader Gopinath Munde said.        
	In her last years budget too, her announcements were related to setting up of medical colleges and printing presses, which are not railway activities. This year, too, she has made announcements on social activities, 300 diagnostic centres, motels and parks Munde said at the Parliament premises soon after the budget was presented.        
	It seemed as though she was reading out the railway timetable and not making a budget speech, he added. Not a single project announced last year has been fulfilled by her. So how do we believe her now?        
	Party colleague Ananth Kumar said: The railway budget was a mockery. The railway minister has converted the entire exercise into a comic opera. Its a sad day for railway users and commuters. This budget has only Bengal and all others are left kangal (poor).

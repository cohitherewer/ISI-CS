          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, March 13: Contradictions in the inquest and post-mortem report have strengthened the fake encounter theory in the death of the Shillong jailbreak mastermind Full Moon Dhar. This was disclosed during the hearing of Justice (retd) D. Biswas judicial inquiry commission today.        
	The magistrate, H.S. Deingdoh, who conducted the inquest, presented before the commission that there were four exit wounds and four entry wounds on Dhars body. However, M. Pde, who carried out the post-mortem, had submitted before the commission that there were 11 entry wounds and one exit wound.

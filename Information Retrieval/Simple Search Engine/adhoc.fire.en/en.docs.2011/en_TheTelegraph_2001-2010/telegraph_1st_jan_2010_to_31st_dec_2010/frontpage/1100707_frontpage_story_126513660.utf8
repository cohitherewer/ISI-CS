	Jhargram (WB), July 7 (PTI): Manik Mahto, one of the alleged conspirators of the May 28 Jnaneswari Express disaster, was arrested by police today from Baripada in Orissa's Mayurbhanj district. 	A joint team of West Bengal and Orissa Police arrested him.   
	Mahto, who was a history-sheeter, had fled after the CBI announced a reward of Rs one lakh each for key accused, Bapi Mahto, who was later arrested in Jharkhand, PCPA convenor Asit Mahto and PCPA leader Umakanta Mahto, police sources said.   
	Bapi Mahto, during interrogation, had revealed the name of Manik, who was present at a meeting of the conspirators on the night preceding the mishap that left 148 passengers dead, the sources said. 	Mahto is the eighth person to be arrested in the case, which is being investigated by the CBI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM recoils at Big B bond
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CPM recoils at Big B bond
          CITHARA PAUL                       Modi with Bachchan at the premiere of Paa. (Ajit Solanki)                          
	New Delhi, March 17: The CPM has opposed a decision by the party-led Kerala government to appoint Amitabh Bachchan as its tourism ambassador because the actor had praised Narendra Modi.        
	The state unit of the party fears that the perceived association between Bachchan and Modi could provoke a backlash from minorities in next years elections. The minority community holds considerable sway in several districts of Kerala, where the CPM is fighting anti-incumbency, though on a lesser scale than in Bengal.        
	Bachchan, who is also a brand ambassador for Gujarat, had clarified earlier that he was promoting a state and not any individual. However, the actors generous praise for Modi, who is anathema to the CPM after the Gujarat riots, appears to have prompted the party to put its foot down.        
	The Kerala tourism department has not yet given up hope, though. The gesture was made at a time we were desperately trying to overcome the drop in foreign tourist arrivals because of the global downturn by concentrating on domestic tourists. We all were excited when Big B said yes to our proposal, said a state tourism official. We still hope that everything will work out fine.        
	Some officials and ministers feel they may still be able to turn the party around, provided financial details can be sorted out with Bachchan. Unlike in Bengal where the partys wish is usually treated as a command, Kerala comrades have fashioned a far more pragmatic politics with room for some degree of give and take.        
	However, the partys options appear limited as it had earlier used the excuse of praising Modi for acting against a dissident MP.        
	The Kerala government had set the ball rolling to induct Bachchan after the actor evinced interest in promoting the state in reply to a question during a television interview. Tourism minister and CPM politburo member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan contacted Bachchan who gave his formal assent to be the picturesque states tourism ambassador.        
	By then, the party had woken up to Bachchans encomiums to Modi while he was in Gujarat to promote Paa, a movie that was given a tax break in Left-ruled Bengal too as it deals with a medical condition. I do not agree with anyone who calls me Shahenshah. This title is more apt for Modi; I am nowhere close, Bachchan had said then. The actor showered praise on Modi in a blog, too.         
	The CPM is not amused. Amitabh Bachchan seems to be awestruck by Modi. How can we have a Modi fan as the brand ambassador of a state that has a strong secular tradition? asked a CPM state committee member.        
	The Opposition will surely use Bachchan against us in the coming elections. A single photograph which has Amitabh Bachchan hugging Modi could really put us in trouble, said a party MLA.         
	The CPM leader said the party would never appreciate anyone who is in the fan club of Modi.        
	The party had earlier suspended former MP Abdullahkutty for praising Modis development model. Kutty later contested on a Congress ticket and won.

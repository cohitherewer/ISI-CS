  - Communist icon and US in N-talks, CPM says national interest holds key           ANINDYA SENGUPTA                      A Vietnamese navy officer takes a picture of American destroyer USS John S. McCain in Danang on August 10. (AFP)                                
	Aug. 13: Amar naam, tomar naam, Vietnam, Vietnam. Rhymes nice but somebody forgot to tell Vietnam about Prakash Karat.        
	The communist country and the US are negotiating a nuclear deal  a disclosure that coincided with the CPMs Vijayawada deliberations that endorsed Karats stand on the Indo-US nuclear deal and the subsequent withdrawal of support to UPA-I.        
	The US is in the process of signing an agreement with Cold War foe Vietnam for sharing nuclear fuel and technology on the lines of the 123 Agreement that the CPM chief had opposed in 2008.        
	The Wall Street Journal has quoted US state department spokesperson Philip Crowley as saying on August 8: US and Vietnam are engaged in a 123 negotiation that would involve an agreement on civil nuclear technology. In March, America and Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding on nuclear energy co-operation with the former describing it as an important moment in our bilateral relations.        
	If the communists in India are still bent on stepping up their anti-US rhetoric, their counterparts in Vietnam do not appear that keen.        
	In response to a question, Karat told The Telegraph in Vijayawada: Its true that Vietnam has a long history of communist struggle against the US and its imperialist designs. Our opposition to the Indo-US civil nuclear deal was because of the provisions of the agreement that meant an abject surrender to Americas interests. So, the terms and conditions of the US-Vietnam deal will have to be considered first. It has to be seen whether Vietnam strikes a 123 Agreement that goes against its national interests.                  Karat      
	Much before the communists had taken over Bengal in 1977, it was Ho Chi Minhs Vietnam that had withstood the US invasion in the late 1960s. The Vietnam war became a trophy for the Bengal Left which has never missed an opportunity to showcase how the communists had browbeaten US imperialism.                           
	Years later, slogans such as Amar naam (My name, your name, Vietnam, Vietnam) used to rend the air when CPM cadres championed various causes in the vicinity of the US consulate located on a street the Left government thoughtfully renamed Ho Chi Minh Sarani.        
	On the apparent divergence of views between the communist leadership in India and that in Vietnam on the nuclear deal now, a Jadavpur University professor of international relations said: Of late, Vietnam has progressed rapidly and has a tilt towards the US. Moreover, the current communist leadership of Vietnam has not suffered US imperialism. So, its obvious for them to sign a nuclear deal with America. The CPM may be talking about large national interests but the party is not governing the country. Governance has certain compulsions.        
	The Journal reported that the Barack Obama administration was unlikely to persuade Vietnam to agree to a no-uranium enrichment pledge. Crowley said: If a country decides to pursue nuclear energy and a country decides that it chooses to enrich on its own soil, then we would prospectively work with that country to make sure its programmes would meet all international safeguards and work with the UN nuclear watchdog agency.        
	While withdrawing support on the nuke deal issue, the Left had said: Full civil nuclear co-operation would entail Indias right to technology for enrichment and reprocessing of spent fuel. But the law shows that the US has no intention to sell India such technology.        
	Here also, the USs approach to India and Vietnam appears different. Actually, America now wants to court Vietnam to contain China. Its a ploy to create fissures in the international communist movement, a CPM politburo member said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Six-minute error in crash
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Six-minute error in crash
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            YS Rajasekhar Reddy                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 21: A panel that probed the helicopter crash which killed Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has blamed the pilots, saying they lost six vital minutes searching for the flight manual after being caught in clouds and lost control at high speed.        
	The four-member teams report came nearly five months after the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister had hopped on to the standby but ageing Bell 430 on that September 2 morning as the brand-new Agusta supposed to fly him to Chittoor had been delayed.        
	The government Bell chopper lost radio contact about half an hour after taking off from Hyderabad and crashed over the dense Nallamala forests after it hit a hillock and exploded.        
	The report, submitted to the civil aviation ministry yesterday, claimed that for six minutes the pilots were engrossed in trying to locate the flight manual, which distracted their attention.        
	When they were caught in the clouds and lost altitude drastically, the pilots were busy locating the flight manual, said the report prepared by the panel headed by Pawan Hans Helicopters Ltd CMD S.K. Tyagi.        
	It said the pilots were engrossed for vital six minutes in searching for the relevant checklist from the flight manual. This distracted their attention from the prevailing poor visibility weather conditions outside, thus leading to the loss of situational awareness and the eventual crash         
	The probe panel, set up by civil aviation regulator DGCA, said the pilots apparently took two minutes to locate the flight manual and another few minutes to flip through it. They lost control, resulting in an uncontrolled descent at a very high speed due to entry into severe down draught, a powerful current of air moving downwards during thunderstorms and bad weather.        
	A spokesman for the Andhra Pradesh Aviation Corporation Limited (APACL) said referring to manuals was not necessarily a major blunder. Probably the pilots panicked as they were flying a VIP passenger, the retired pilot added.        
	Asked how the probe team could come to such a specific conclusion that the pilots took six minutes to search for or find the manual, an army aviation pilot said the crew would have referred to the Jeppesen Navigation Manual.        
	The manual, which lays down minimum safety altitudes when flying in poor visibility, is always carried on aircraft.        
	The crash investigators would have checked the time on the cockpit voice recorder when the pilot asked the co-pilot to get the manual and the time at which the co-pilot read out the information. This time interval would have been six minutes, the army pilot said.        
	The pilots would have been blinded as they were trying to gain altitude, and they probably hit the hill without knowing it was so close, a pilot said.        
	Search teams found the wreckage nearly 20 hours after the chopper disappeared from radar screens. Everyone on the aircraft, including Reddys special secretary, his chief security officer and the two pilots, was killed.        
	The probe panel also blamed the crew for instrument flying though their flight plan had been cleared for visual flight rules.        
	Instrument flying condition is when pilots fly primarily with reference to instruments instead of being guided by the visibility outside.         
	What we fail to understand is why the crew flew in instrument flying condition, though the flight plan was cleared for visual flight rules in view of the bad weather conditions, the report said.        
	Sources said the position of the bodies indicated that the late chief ministers security officer may have tried to push him out to safety, though it meant a fall of over 300 metres above the Nallamala forests.         
	The report ruled out a conspiracy behind the crash.

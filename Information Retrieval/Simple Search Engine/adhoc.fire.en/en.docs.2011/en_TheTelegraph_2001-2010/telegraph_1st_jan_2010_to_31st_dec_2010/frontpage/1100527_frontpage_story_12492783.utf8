          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 26: Stick worked where sentiment did not.        
	Engineers and ground staff of Air India today called off a wildcat strike that affected thousands of passengers after a court termed the action illegal and the Centre gave a free hand to the management that started issuing termination orders.        
	The workers rejoined for duty in the evening shift but it will take at least two days for normality to be restored.        
	Around 17 union leaders have been issued sack orders while 15 engineers have been suspended. Sources said 100 more employees could face some kind of action.        
	Such termination orders are usually withdrawn once tempers cool and normality returns. It was not clear how Air India, which had yesterday pleaded with the employees to take into account the hour of crisis that arose from the Mangalore tragedy, is planning to proceed now.        
	However, the mood of the management was unforgiving, possibly emboldened by the support from the government.        
	This strike was illegal. We have to bring in accountability and need to fix responsibility. Whatever action has to be taken, we have to go the whole hog. We do not want to compromise at any cost. We have to come (down) with a heavy hand, Air India chairman and managing director Arvind Jadhav said after the agitation was called off.        
	We want Nacil (Air Indias holding company) to become a professional, accountable and disciplined organisation. We are grateful to the Government of India for backing us, he added.        
	The sources said finance minister Pranab Mukherjee gave the nod to civil aviation minister Praful Patel to take decisive action if needed to end the strike that inconvenienced 13,000 passengers, disrupted over 130 flights and caused a loss of Rs 10 crore over the past two days.        
	An estimated 20,000 engineers and ground staff, or about 60 per cent of the staff strength, were on strike to protest against an alleged gag order and delay in payments.        
	Patel, who also briefed the Prime Minister and the cabinet, told reporters: Irresponsible behaviour like this needs strong action. The Air India management is free to take all appropriate action. The management needs to act adequately and firmly.        
	Soon after, the Air India top brass met union leaders, read out the riot act and issued sack notice to some of them.        
	In the afternoon, Delhi High Court dealt the strike the staggering blow, although the court in Mumbai had asked the airline to return after issuing a proper notice to the workers. The Delhi court directed the unions not to continue with not only the ongoing strike but also another scheduled from May 31.

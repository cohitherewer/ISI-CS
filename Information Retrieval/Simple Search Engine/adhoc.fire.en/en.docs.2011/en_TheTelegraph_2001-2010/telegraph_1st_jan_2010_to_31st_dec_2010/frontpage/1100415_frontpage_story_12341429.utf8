          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, April 14: The Congress leadership tonight asked Shashi Tharoor to clear his name in the IPL controversy or step aside as junior foreign minister till an enquiry cleared his name.        
	Sources revealed that senior Congress leaders felt Tharoor should ideally relinquish office, especially to defuse a likely storm when Parliament resumes its sitting tomorrow, and let the internal enquiry be completed as he can easily be reinstated if proven not guilty.        
	If Tharoor chooses not to resign immediately, the final decision is expected to be taken after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returns from abroad by the weekend.        
	Although senior leaders debated the issue through the day, it was felt that the Prime Minister should take the decision on Tharoors continuance in the ministry. Singh had said earlier in the day: I have heard about these things. I do not have all the facts before me. When I go back, I will get all the facts and, in the light of those, if any action is necessary I think that would be the proper way to proceed.        
	Tharoor is convinced he is innocent and expressed his reluctance to resign without presenting his case before Singh and Sonia Gandhi.        
	But the party leadership is not in favour of brazening out the expected Opposition campaign in Parliament. Congress leaders eventually decided to wait and see if the Opposition attack was manageable. The Left, too, has joined the chorus seeking Tharoors resignation.        
	Congress leaders did not rule out the option of removing Tharoor if a case of ministerial misconduct could be made out.        
	While Sonia called core group members Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony and Ahmed Patel to discuss the issue in the morning, a larger group of senior leaders met at her residence in the evening. Law minister Veerappa Moily and home minister P. Chidambaram also attended that meeting.        
	To a specific question whether the demand for Tharoors resignation will be met, parliamentary affairs minister P.K. Bansal gave an enigmatic reply: Lets see.         
	Bansals cautious response is considered significant as political parties usually reject any demand for a ministers resignation outright.        
	A clearer indication of the deep disquiet in the party came when Mukherjee summoned Tharoor for a meeting late in the night. Defence minister Antony, who, too, hails from Kerala, was also present at the meeting that followed soon after Tharoor said on TV: Resigning would mean Ive given up.        
	Sources said the purpose of this meeting was to hear out Tharoor who protested his innocence.         
	Mukherjee and Antony will report to the Prime Minister on this deliberation when he returns to the country. Sources said neither Sonia, nor Mukherjee, was in favour of sacking Tharoor in the Prime Ministers absence. Tharoor is considered a handpicked choice of Singh.        
	Second-rung leaders are certain that Tharoor will have to exit. If not now, a little later, a leader said.

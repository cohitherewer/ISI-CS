The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wanted: Hartal, the stone thrower
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Wanted: Hartal, the stone thrower
  - Kashmiri protesters drop jihadi aliases, take on secular nicknames           MUZAFFAR RAINA                                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 25: As Kashmir turns from guns to stones, its jihadi lexicon is giving way to a more secular one.        
	If the gun-toting militants preferred to call themselves mujahids (holy warriors), the current protesters refer to themselves as sangbaaz (stone throwers) and to their resistance movement as kani jung (stone-throwing) rather than jihad (holy war).        
	Many stone throwers have adopted secular pseudonyms, either chosen by them or given to them by their peers, in contrast to the militants penchant for aliases from Islamic history, such as Abu Talha, Umar or Khalid.        
	I have picked up no less than 200 stone throwers but have not come across a single name (pseudonym) that is religion-inspired, said the Srinagar North superintendent of police, Showkat Hussain.        
	The officer, who has been battling protesters in Srinagars downtown, the nerve centre of the current resistance, added: I do not find religious boys throwing stones. They generally stay away from it.        
	One reason could be the perceived lack of religious sanction for stone-throwing. Several Islamic scholars, such as Jamiat-e-Ahli Hadees chief Molvi Showkat, have spoken out against the practice.        
	Many of the sangbaaz are clean-shaven, wear trendy clothes and do not fit the profile of a jihadi. Some of them wear masks and avoid even aliases so they can remain faceless and evade arrest, but countless others are known by their nicknames, Hussain said.        
	For example, Veridaath (tragedy), originally Sajad Ahmad Bhat, was once asked by his teacher why he had skipped school the previous day. He replied there was veridaath at his home, and thats how the name stuck to him, the officer said.              
	Similarly, Sannata is a character out of a Bollywood film. The youth would surface near a police station during evenings and hurl abuses at cops. We laid a trap and arrested him. It turned out that he was a Bihari boy whose mother had later married a Kashmiri.        
	Many of the pseudonyms were earned through some act of bravado during stone-throwing, the sangbaaz say.        
	My friends think that my stones are as destructive as poison, said a youth. Now some call me by this name (Poison) and I dont mind.                  
	Stone-throwing is not new to Kashmir but had earlier remained confined to Srinagars old city and towns like Sopore and Baramulla. It became a mass movement during the 2008 Amarnath land agitation.        
	For the security forces, battling the third successive summer of anti-India protests, these stone-throwers are sometimes a bigger catch than militants. The police on Thursday arrested one of the most wanted stone-throwers, Asif, nicknamed Hartal because of his ability to enforce shutdowns.        
	Its all very different from the late 1980s, when militancy erupted in Kashmir. A new jihadi lexicon had then taken root in the Valley, although the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), the first militant group, professed a secular ideology.        
	The mujahids from jihadi groups such as the Hizbul Mujahideen, Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen outnumbered the militants from the JKLF and other secular groups. Many of the jihadis picked up catchy pseudonyms. Hizb chief Mohammad Yousuf Shah is known by his alias Syed Salahuddin, adopted from the name of legendary Muslim commander Salahuddin Ayuubi.        
	Today, the militants strength has shrunk to less than 500 but the stone throwers are believed to number in thousands.        
	The police say they are yet to come across any organisation floated by the stone throwers on the ground, although several such groups have sprouted on the social networking sites.        
	They have names such as Kashur Hathiyar  Kani Jung (Kashmir weapon  stone-throwing), I am a Kashmiri Stone Pelter and the Stone Throwers Association of Kashmir.        
	As these names suggest, there is hardly anything Islamic about them.

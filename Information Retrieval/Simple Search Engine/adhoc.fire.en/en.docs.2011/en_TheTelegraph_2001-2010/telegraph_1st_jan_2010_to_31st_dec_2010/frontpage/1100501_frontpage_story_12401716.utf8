The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rule rush after radiation alarm
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rule rush after radiation alarm
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 30: Delhi Universitys sale of an instrument spewing gamma radiation has stirred the government into formulating guidelines for higher educational institutions to handle all hazardous materials for the first time in India.         
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal has asked the University Grants Commission (UGC) to co-ordinate a nationwide exercise to prepare guidelines for procurement, transport, storage, use and disposal of all material that can prove a health hazard.         
	We must use this unfortunate incident as an opportunity to make sure that something like this is never repeated  not with any hazardous material, Sibal told The Telegraph.         
	He said he would write to other central ministries and the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) seeking their help in identifying hazardous materials used in universities and other higher educational institutions across the country.         
	He will also ask them for their advice on drafting the guidelines, which will cover materials such as fertilisers, chemicals and inflammable and explosive items other than radioactive substances, the minister said.         
	These suggestions will then be passed on to the UGC which in turn will seek comments from universities before experts finalise the guidelines, Sibal said.         
	The guidelines will need to allow for the differences in type and extent of the hazard different materials pose to health, the HRD minister said.         
	Most potentially hazardous materials carry instructions on how they are to be used. Some regulators  like the AERB  already have safety norms for materials they regulate.         
	But there are no guidelines at present for higher educational institutions on how to enforce these instructions and norms while using such materials in laboratories ranging from undergraduate courses to research programmes. There are also no safety guidelines for the procurement, transport, storage and disposal of these materials by higher educational institutions.         
	Delhi University sold a gamma irradiator to scrap dealers who dismantled it, leading to Indias first death due to radiation exposure. Seven others are still recovering from exposure from the radiation.         
	The irradiator contained Cobalt-60, a powerful source of gamma radiations. The university had imported the irradiator from Canada in 1968.         
	The UGC will ask all higher educational institutions to strictly follow safety norms of the AERB and other regulators while the comprehensive new guidelines are formulated, HRD ministry sources said.         
	Sibals move came on a day when DU offered a compensation of Rs 8 lakh and a job to the widow of the man who died of radiation exposure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wanted: role for IPL ladies
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Wanted: role for IPL ladies
  - Teams terminated, Preity and Shilpa face a challenge          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                                      Preity Zinta and   Shilpa Shetty      
	Calcutta, Oct. 11: Shilpa Shettys last role as a leading lady was in Apne in June 2007. Preity Zintas last role as a leading lady was in Heaven on Earth in October 2008.        
	Their roles suddenly scrapped from the annual soap they star together in  the Indian Premier League  the one-time Bollywood queens find themselves without work. At 35, they need the IPL more than the four-year-old IPL needs them.        
	Till a couple of days back, Shilpa and Preity were proud owners  if not on paper, definitely on the ground  of cricket teams that made up one of the fastest growing sports brands in the world. But with the BCCI dropping Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab  because of breach of franchise agreement  from the IPL, the actresses no longer have to jump around the team dugout or in the VIP stands in cricket stadiums across the country, hugging sweaty cricketers or blowing kisses at them.        
	Yes, the oomph factor of IPL, always projected as a heady concoction of cricket and Bollywood, has sure taken a hit but then who can keep the glam out of this game? If not as team owners, a Katrina Kaif or a Deepika Padukone would surely turn up as a brand ambassador or a team mascot. Only Shilpa and Preity will be missing in action.        
	In all her interviews in the last three years, Preity has maintained: I had to choose between managing my IPL team and working in films. I chose cricket over Bollywood. She has even referred to her choice as a gamble, a gamble that has now obviously backfired. No wonder she is shocked.              
	Preitys Bolly brand value has been so low that even her ready film (Jahnu Baruas Har Pal) has no buyers. Says a Mumbai-based trade analyst who doesnt wish to be named: It will be very difficult for her to resurrect her film career now. Its not as if she left on a high, and now theres a whole new breed of younger actresses like Deepika Padukone and Sonam Kapoor who are much more in demand.        
	Shilpas predicament is slightly different. Ever since her Celebrity Big Brother triumph in January 2007, she has aimed for an international career and ignored Bollywood. Although in an interview to The Telegraph she had maintained that she would continue to work in India, that hasnt happened. Even her maiden production hasnt taken off, a yoga DVD and a perfume being her only credit call in the last couple of years.        
	Its not that Bollywood is dying for her to make a comeback, says a filmmaker whos worked with Shilpa in the past. If she has to make her way back as an actress, she may have to do bit roles for starters and, more importantly, not ask for the kind of money she has been asking.        
	Ironically, both Preity and Shilpas first screen hero (in Dil Se and Baazigar), the other Bollywood team owner, Shah Rukh Khan has shifted his focus from the cricket pitch to the movie camera. Ever since IPL 3 got over, SRK has been working hard on his home production Ra.One, and now he is off to Germany to shoot for Farhan Akhtars Don 2. A film with Vishal Bhardwaj is also on the cards.        
	While Shah Rukhs Kolkata Knight Riders is still very much on the IPL pitch, with the tournament  and his friend Lalit Modi under a cloud, King Khan was quick to realise that his business card needs to read Bollywood superstar once again and not IPL team owner. Thats the thin line between X factor and Ex factor  a fact Preity and Shilpa have learnt the hard way. For their calling cards now can only read ex-Bollywood star and ex-IPL team owner.

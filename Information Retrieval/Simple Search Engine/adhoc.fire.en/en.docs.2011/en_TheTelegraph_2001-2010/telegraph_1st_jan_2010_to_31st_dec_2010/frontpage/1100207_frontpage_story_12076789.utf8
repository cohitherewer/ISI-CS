          MARTIN EVANS                            Pachauri at the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit on Saturday. (AP)                                  
	London, Feb. 6: Rajendra Pachauri, the embattled head of the UNs climate change panel, clocked up more than half a million miles of air travel in a year and a half as he travelled the world warning of the global warming threat.        
	On his international missions, Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), called for radical action to stave off environmental disaster. He urged people to eat less meat, pay aviation taxes and even ban giving iced water in restaurants.        
	But in order to get his message across, the former railway engineer created an enormous carbon footprint of his own.        
	Pachauri has been the chairman of the panel since 2002. Documents available on its website showed that in one 19-month period, he clocked up more than half a million miles in the air as he travelled the world on official business.        
	Between January 2007 and July 2008, he took more than 120 long-haul flights and 43 short-haul trips, taking in countries such as New Zealand, America and Fiji.        
	Pachauris trips would have produced 121.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to calculations by ClimateCare, a carbon offset provider. It is estimated that the average Indian produces just over 1 tonne.        
	The international climate change debate has been dominated in recent months by disclosures of leaked emails, suggesting unfavourable data was being suppressed.        
	It also emerged that predictions that the Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035 were out by 300 years. Pachauri refused to apologise over the blunder, claiming he could not be responsible for every word of a 3,000-page report.        
	Most of Pachauris trips involved high-level meetings with world leaders, environmental experts and influential business executives.        
	But in May 2008, he flew more than 6,500 miles from Tokyo to New Haven in Connecticut to collect an honorary degree from Yale University.        
	Speaking last September ahead of the climate change conference in Copenhagen, Pachauri admitted his carbon footprint was significant.        
	He told a UN publication: I really have one area where unfortunately I am guilty of a pretty large carbon footprint, and that is in terms of travel. That is something that unfortunately I cant do anything about because I have to spread the message.        
	I have to go all over the world and I have to convince people that this is a serious problem that we have to address. But in terms of my personal lifestyle, Im very careful about not being consumptive in my habits. Im careful about use of transport in my daily life.        
	A source within the IPCC said: This period was exceptional in terms of air travel and since then Pachauri has significantly cut back, using video conferencing technology where possible for overseas events.        
	Pachauri has faced growing criticism regarding his links to worldwide business interests. He is director-general of the Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri).        
	He has denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest. Speaking on Radio 4 on Friday, he said any money he makes from his consultancy goes back into the Teri research organisation.

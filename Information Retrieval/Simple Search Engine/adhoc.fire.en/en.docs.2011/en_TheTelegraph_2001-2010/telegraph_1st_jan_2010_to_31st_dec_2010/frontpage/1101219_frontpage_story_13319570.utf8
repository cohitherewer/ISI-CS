                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Pahan gives cops the slip in Khunti
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 18: Dreaded Naxalite Kundan Pahan once again managed to give the law the slip when he escaped from an encounter site at Marangburu forest in Arki police station area of Khunti district this morning.        
	Sources said district police chief Manoj Kaushik cordoned off the area after being tipped off that Pahan had taken shelter in Marangburu along with his close associates. However, Pahan too got information about police movement in the area and ordered his men to take position and stop the security forces from proceeding further.        
	The encounter began at 8am and lasted for two hours. Over 800 rounds were fired from both sides. Sources added that the rebels were forced to retreat after the police started lobbing powerful bombs. However, Pahan managed to escape with his arms and ammunition.        
	We demolished their camp and bunkers. We also recovered several items of daily use from the incident spot, Kaushik told The Telegraph.        
	According to intelligence agencies, Pahan has moved base south of Tajna river in Khunti and operates in Kuchai forest of Seraikela-Kharsawan. But with police operations intensifying in that area as well, at times he is forced to venture north of Tajna river, where he still has a clout.              
	The police have apparently worked out a joint action plan to nab Pahan after the panchayat elections got over and adequate forces had been garnered to join the anti-Naxalite operations. Pahan carries a Rs 5 lakh reward on his head and is believed to have engineered several major attacks.        
	The Khunti police today also engaged in a fierce gunbattle with Peoples Liberation Front of India rebels belonging to the Jidin Gudia in Jilingburu forest. The encounter began at about 10.30am and went on for over three hours.        
	Two .315 regular rifles, two country-made carbines, one country-made pistol, 110 live cartridges, half a dozen pouches used for carrying bullets, camouflage uniforms and several other items of daily use were recovered from the spot.        
	We also believe that at least one rebel was killed in the encounter, but we have not been able to recover his body. Tomorrow we will begin search operations again, Kaushik added.

                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                BJP blunts one thorn in Nitish side
          OUR BUREAU                            (From Top) Arun Jaitley, Nitish Kumar                                 
	Patna, July 11: The BJP has given Arun Jaitley complete charge of handling the Bihar election for the party, blunting a thorn in the side of Nitish Kumar but skirting an iron-clad commitment that Narendra Modi would not be invited to campaign in the state.        
	Jaitley, a BJP general secretary who used to run the Bihar elections earlier, today met chief minister Nitish Kumar who was cut up with Ananth Kumar, the official BJP in-charge of the partys affairs in the state, for suggesting that Modi could be invited during the year-end elections.        
	Nitish is keen to protect his minority-friendly credentials and had publicly taken on Modi a few weeks ago.        
	Jaitley, despite his proximity to Modi, has a good rapport with Nitish and had been asked by the BJP leadership to interact with the chief minister. Ananth Kumar, the official prabhari, was asked to have nothing to do with the Janata Dal (United).         
	Jaitley, Bihar BJP chief C.P. Thakur, Ananth Kumar and senior BJP leaders held a closed-door meting with Nitish and Sushil Kumar Modi. All is well in the alliance, Thakur said after the meeting.        
	The alliance is rock-solid and the BJP-Dal (U) would carry out a joint campaign to ensure the return of the NDA in the state, Ananth Kumar told the media.         
	Asked if Modi would campaign, he said: The party will decide who is suitable to campaign after the Election Commission notifies polls.        
	A senior BJP leader added: The NDA in Bihar has never required Narendra Modi to campaign in the state. There is hardly any need for him to campaign in the coming polls.        
	However, sources in Delhi said the tricky issue of Modi campaigning for the polls had not yet been sorted out because a section of the BJP still thought the BJP should not yield to Nitish on this count.        
	NDA sources said the two parties had also begun seat-sharing talks on Jaitleys insistence that they were so important ahead of the elections.         
	The BJP is likely to contest about 100 seats, leaving the remaining 143 for the Dal (U).         
	In the last elections, the BJP had contested 103 seats and the Dal (U) 137. The NDA had supported Independents in the remaining three seats.        
	Jaitley today said it was a social meeting among us and refused to elaborate. Nitish, too, refused to speak to the media. The leaders had dinner together.        
	The BJP-JD(U) alliance will go to the people to showcase development in the state and the establishment of rule of law under the joint stewardship of Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi, Ananth Kumar said.

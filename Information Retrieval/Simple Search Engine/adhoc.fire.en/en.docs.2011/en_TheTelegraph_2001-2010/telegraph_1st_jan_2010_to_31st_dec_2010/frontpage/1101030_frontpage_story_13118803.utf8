          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 29: Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan today admitted his relatives had been allotted flats at the controversy-ridden Adarsh Housing Society high-rise but said these apartments were being surrendered.        
	Chavan, however, denied the high-rise was built on defence land or was meant for Kargil widows. The flats in the 31-storey building have been allotted to bureaucrats, defence officers, politicians and other well-connected people at cheap rates.        
	The chief minister had been praying at Tirupati with his wife when reports appeared that his mother-in-law was allotted an Adarsh flat in Colaba where land prices equal those in parts of downtown Manhattan.        
	At a news conference today, Chavan termed the reports politically motivated, ruled out resigning and claimed two of his relatives were giving up their flats. The possession has not come in yet.... but will be returned today, he said.        
	Documents show that five of the total 104 flats were allotted to Chavans relatives.        
	The beneficiaries were Chavans late father S.B. Chavan (allotment number 91) and four other relatives from his wifes side  mother-in-law Bhagwati Manoharlal Sharma (allotment number 90) Seema Vinod Sharma (No. 73), Madanlal Milkiram Sharma (No. 101) and Jagdish Ambika Prasad Sharma (No. 74).        
	Chavans mother-in-law Bhagwati stayed with him at his official residence and passed away earlier this year.         
	The chief minister referred only to two of the relatives as he said: Distant relatives... if they are eligible, then there is no reason to deny them (flats). Seema Sharma and Madanlal Sharma are distant relatives. Today, they have informed in writing that they have resigned from the (housing) society.        
	The Adarsh flats measure between 625sqft and 1,000sqft (carpet area). Each floor has four apartments  three with two bedrooms and one with three bedrooms.        
	All flats owned by Chavans relatives are 1,000sqft apartments, said Adarsh society member Kanhaiyalal Gidwani, a former legislator who had crossed over from the Shiv Sena to the Congress.        
	Gidwani claimed Vilasrao Deshmukh too owned two flats in the building but refused to give details. Deshmukh was chief minister at the time the allotments were made.        
	Chavans role has been under a cloud, particularly after reports that he had insisted on accommodating civilians in the list of beneficiaries. Adarsh society had reportedly written a letter agreeing to a demand from Chavan to accommodate 40 per cent civilians at a time he was the states revenue minister.        
	The chief minister today denied any role.        
	He added: The land belongs to the state government, based on the collectors records. It was not reserved for war veterans or Kargil heroes.... I wasnt a minister when the land was given to the society.

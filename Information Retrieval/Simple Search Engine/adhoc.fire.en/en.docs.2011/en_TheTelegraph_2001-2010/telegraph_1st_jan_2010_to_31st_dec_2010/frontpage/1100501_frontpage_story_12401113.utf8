The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Soren meets MLAs
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Soren meets MLAs
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             NO ENTRY: The area around chief minister Shibu Sorens residence in Ranchi saw some extra barricades being put up on Friday, two days after his return to the state capital from Delhi where his vote in favour of the UPA in the Lok Sabha cut motion proved suicidal for his BJP and Ajsu-backed government. Since then he has not stepped out of his home. The media, too, has been kept away with son Hemant claiming Soren is unwell. Picture by Manik Bose                                  
	Ranchi, April 30: The stalemate over government formation continued in Jharkhand today with JMM president and chief minister Shibu Soren refusing to go to Delhi to talk to the BJP even as he held a meeting of party MLAs who couldnt agree on the road ahead.        
	The MLAs are said to have expressed their unhappiness over having to bow to the BJP. When Guruji has offered a public apology for his mistake on the cut motion in the Lok Sabha, there is no reason for him to quit. Mafi bhi aur phansi bhi (You cant punish him after accepting his apology), said an MLA.        
	Among the 18 JMM MLAs, three did not attend the meeting. They were Sita Soren, widow of Sorens elder son, Durga, Paulus Surin, the former Maoist who is in jail, and Lobin Hembrom.        
	According to sources, Hemant, accompanied by deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto, human resources minister and party leader Hemlal Murmu and Champai Soren, would leave for New Delhi by a chartered flight tomorrow.         
	Simon Marandi, the MLA from Littipara, however, was adamant on not supporting the BJP and claimed that half of the 18 MLAs were with him. Sita Soren, too, was yet to decide. I am yet to make up my mind, she told The Telegraph from Calcutta.         
	Simon claimed Soren was being held captive in his official residence under the pretext of illness.         
	Simon admitted he didnt have the numbers to split the party. But, we will not let the government run smoothly, he declared.         
	Hemant has been trying on his own to win over the MLAs as he realises that the BJP would not make any formal announcement about an alternative arrangement unless the JMM came out with a letter of support signed by all 18 MLAs.         
	He even held a dinner for the MLAs but four did not turn up. Simon and the three who didnt attend the morning meeting stayed away.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	New Delhi, June 25: The Centre today decided to free petrol prices from state control and raised the prices of diesel, LPG and kerosene in an effort to slash the ballooning fiscal deficit and haul oil refiners back from the brink of financial ruin.        
	The decisions were taken by an empowered group of ministers headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and signalled the governments determination to put its finances in order.        
	Mamata Banerjee stayed away from the meeting in protest, keeping in mind the Bengal Assembly elections that are less than a year away.         
	The price decisions came on a day Prime Minister Manmohan Singh headed to Toronto for the G20 summit. Last year, India had joined other G20 members in agreeing to slash subsidies on auto fuels as part of a global effort to encourage energy conservation.        
	Petrol prices have been raised by Rs 3.65 a litre in Calcutta and will henceforth be market-determined. This means that a surge in global crude prices  currently hovering around $77 a barrel  will trigger an almost immediate revision in pump prices.        
	Diesel prices have been raised by Rs 1.95 a litre in Calcutta. Diesel will also be freed from state regulation eventually, said petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan but refused to set a date by when subsidies would be withdrawn on this critical transportation fuel. A change in the price of diesel has a greater cascading effect on prices across the board.        
	Cooking gas prices are being raised by Rs 36.40 a cylinder while kerosene prices will go up after a gap of eight years by Rs 3 a litre.        
	The price hikes will come into effect from Friday midnight. Several pumps around the country claimed that they had run out of fuel stocks as serpentine queues formed.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora said allies had been consulted. But Mamata said: I will request the government to reconsider the decision to raise the prices of diesel, LPG and kerosene as this will push up the prices of other commodities as well. The DMK ministers circulated a note at the meeting to articulate their opposition to the move.        
	The government chose to bite the bullet because it was no longer in a position to dole out subsidies to state-owned oil refiners.        
	Indias chief economist Kaushik Basu said: I expect an increase of 0.9 percentage points in the monthly inflation figure the bold reform will result in lower fiscal and revenue deficits, cooling inflation in six to nine months.        
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla had recently said that the fiscal deficit would dip to 4.5 per cent of the GDP if auto fuel prices were deregulated and revenues from 3G and broadband spectrum auctions were taken into account. Fiscal deficit for the year to March 2011 had been projected at 5.5 per cent of the GDP in the budget.        
	The government had tried to move towards market-determined prices for auto fuels in April 2002 during the NDA regime. The move was abandoned in December 2003 just before the general election.        
	The victorious Congress-led UPA government took another stab at it in July 2004 when it allowed a price band of 10 per cent either way but had to jettison it when crude oil prices surged.

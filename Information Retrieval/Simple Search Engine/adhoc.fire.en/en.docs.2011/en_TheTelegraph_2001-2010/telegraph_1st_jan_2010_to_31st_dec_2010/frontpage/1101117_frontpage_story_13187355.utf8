The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Anil firm in report
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Anil firm in report
  - Swan tied to Reliance Telecom           JAYATI GHOSE                             Anil Ambani                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Anil Ambani group has been identified as the biggest beneficiary of A. Rajas decisions in January 2008 when the just-resigned minister had doled out a record 122 licences in a single day.        
	A 77-page audit report placed before Parliament today gives a detailed account of how spectrum  radio frequencies that are necessary to provide wireless services like mobile telephony  was allocated.        
	Swan Telecom, which has since morphed into Etisalat DB Telecom, was the real ugly duckling in the spectrum saga and its true antecedents were shrouded in a veil that the report of the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) appears to have pierced.         
	Etisalat, the telecom firm based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), now holds a 45 per cent stake in the company. Its partner is a Mumbai-based realty and hospitality group called Dynamix Balwas. Etisalat has since filed an application with the government seeking to raise its stake above 50 per cent.         
	But when it was incorporated on July 13, 2006, the report says Swan Telecom had concealed the fact that Reliance Telecom Ltd (RTL)  an Anil Ambani group firm  was the real owner of the company.        
	Swan misrepresented facts about its real ownership by claiming initially that Reliance Telecom held only a 9.81 per cent stake in the company.        
	Under telecom regulations, a mobile service provider cannot hold more than 10 per cent in another operator in the same circle. Reliance Telecom held licences in all the 15 circles in which Swan Telecom was eventually permitted to operate.         
	However, the report claimed that the Anil Ambani group had invested in another instrument  redeemable preference shares floated by Swan Telecom at a premium of Rs 999 a share  which completely changed the ownership pattern.         
	As a result, Reliance Telecom held a stake worth Rs 1,002.79 crore in Swan Telecom against the so-called majority shareholder Tiger Traders whose holding was worth only Rs 98.22 crore.        
	Experts agreed that the audit report was right in toting up equity capital along with preference share capital to arrive at the real shareholding structure.                    
	Total shareholding in a company would be calculated as the sum of equity share capital plus preference share capital held in that company. Preference shares can come with or without voting rights, confirmed Raman Chadha, director of Basant Ram and Sons, a 115-year-old chartered accountancy firm.         
	The CAG report said the department of telecommunications had no mechanism to verify the real share ownership structure and ought to have referred the matter to the ministry of company affairs but chose not to do so.        
	In December 2007, nine months after it had submitted its application for telecom licences, Swan Telecom was permitted to submit a revised shareholding pattern. In this application, the company claimed that Reliance Telecom had divested its entire stake in the company.        
	The report said Swan Telecom had all along piggy-backed on Reliance Telecom because it did not meet the minimum capital criterion to obtain a telecom licence on its own steam. Reliance Telecom, which had a net worth of Rs 314 crore, was critical to fulfilling this criterion in its original application.         
	Either way, Swan Telecom should have been tossed out of the ring but wasnt. If Reliance Telecom admitted its connection, Swan would not be eligible for a licence since the Anil Ambani group company actually held more than a 10 per cent stake in it.        
	If it snapped its links with Reliance Telecom, Swan would not meet the net worth criteria and would, therefore, have to be cast aside anyway.        
	Raja and DoT chose to turn a blind eye to this obvious Catch-22-like situation that Swan found itself in.        
	It would therefore appear that Swan Telecom Private Limited  was acting as a front company on the behalf of RTL and their application was in effect against the intent and spirit of the licensing guidelines, the CAG report said.         
	Late in the evening, a Reliance Communications spokesperson said: Our group had no shareholding in Swan Telecom Ltd. (now known as Etisalat DB Ltd) at the time of grant of licence to them or any time thereafter, and that issue is accordingly not relevant to our company.        
	He added: Reliance Communications has always been in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and there has been no violation of our licence conditions at any stage on account of cross-holdings in excess of 10 per cent.        
	But this wasnt the only largesse from Raja. Reliance Communications (R-Com)  another Anil Ambani group company  was allotted start-up spectrum in January 2008 ahead of other operators whose applications were kept pending on the grounds of non-availability of spectrum.        
	R-Com had filed for spectrum under a special dispensation  permission to use dual technology (both GSM and CDMA, the two competing telecom standards). However, it got the spectrum long before its competitors HFCL and Shyam Telelinks.        
	In the Delhi service area, Reliance was allocated GSM spectrum in January 2008. Its competitors  Datacom Solutions, Unitech Wireless Spice Communications, Loop Telecom, and Tata Teleservices  did not get spectrum till September 2010.

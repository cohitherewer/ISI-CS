          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	New Delhi, May 11: India appears to be closing in on Russias position as the worlds third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, nudged in part by lifestyle changes that have swept the country since the nineties.        
	The country has clocked a 52 per cent increase in emissions between 1994 and 2007, a government assessment released today indicates.         
	Indias total emissions climbed to 1.9 billion tonnes in 2007 from 1.2 billion tonnes in 1994, according to the assessment  the first since 1994. Russias 2.2 billion tonnes in 2007 made it the third-largest emitter after China and the US.        
	The estimates do throw up a positive factor  economic growth appears to be outpacing the use of energy  but they also seem to reflect Indias changing patterns of consumption and a shift away from recycling.        
	Municipal garbage and other wastes have the highest annual emissions growth rate  7.3 per cent, compared to 5.6 per cent growth in electricity emissions or 4.5 per cent in transport emissions or 6 per cent in cement industry emissions.         
	Were possibly seeing the effects of changing lifestyles  high consumption, a greater use of waste-generating resources, and less recycling, said Subodh Sharma, a senior scientist in the environment ministry.         
	Municipal solid waste, a potential source of methane  a greenhouse gas  is disposed in most Indian cities through open dumping. The amount of municipal solid waste churned out by Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai, according to the emissions report, has overtaken the population growth rate in these cities. Domestic and industrial wastes also contribute to emissions.        
	The data on transport mirrors the dramatic changes over the past two decades. Emissions from civil aviation have nearly doubled from that in 1994, while road transport accounts for as much as 87 per cent of emissions in the segment.        
	Mamata Banerjee can breathe a little easy: emissions from railways have virtually plateaued.        
	The new estimates from the Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment, a research umbrella supported by the environment ministry, show that electricity and transport account for 52 per cent of the emissions. Industry contributes 22 per cent of the emissions, while agriculture makes up 17 per cent.        
	The exercise involving some 80 scientists from 17 institutions has revealed that Indias forests and croplands are sucking up carbon dioxide, acting as sinks for up to 177 million tonnes of the gas.        
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh said the emissions of the US and China in 2007 were almost four times that of India. Indias 1.5-tonne per capita emission is lower than Chinas 4 tonnes and about 20 tonnes in the US.        
	The assessment suggests India is using less energy now for growth than it did a decade ago. It is noteworthy that the emissions intensity of Indias GDP has declined by more than 30 per cent during 1994 to 2007, Ramesh said.        
	An analyst said the emission figures suggested India had decoupled economic growth from the growth in emissions by a small extent. The economy has been growing at a higher rate than emissions, said Priyadarshi Shukla, a professor at IIM Ahmedabad.         
	Several factors would have contributed to this, Shukla said. Weve had improvements in energy efficiency, there is a greater focus on services-based economy.        
	The new data shows that emissions from agriculture in 2007 have marginally declined from the 1994 levels.        
	The INCCA is expected to repeat its emissions assessment every two years. But Shukla said India should back up its figures through publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals.         
	Ramesh said publications in peer-reviewed journals is very important, and added that the next emissions assessment which is due in 2012 would have more of actual measurements instead of calculations and estimates.

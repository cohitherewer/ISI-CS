The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Oops! Like buddy Bush, a slip here, a slip there
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Oops! Like buddy Bush, a slip here, a slip there
          SUJAN DUTTA                            Bush: An inspiration?                                  
	New Delhi, May 24: But for two Bushisms  the word coined after former US President whose Freudian slips in public events became the butt of jokes  Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs second national press conference here today revealed little about his taciturn personality than was already known.        
	The first slip was in the answer to a question  hastily corrected  on his ability to get a Nuclear Liability Law to the satisfaction of the government and the US to implement the civilian nuclear deal.        
	With regard to the nuclear issue, well, I have no doubt (and here Manmohan Singh sipped from a glass of water) that as far as the nuclear agreement with the US is concerned, it will move forwardwe need this (the Nuclear Liability Law) we have to become a nuclear weapons, er, major nuclear energy power and for this reason we have sent the bill to Parliament, the Prime Minister said.        
	He was quick to find the right word. But the slip of tongue would easily be misinterpreted by critics of the civilian nuclear deal, some of whom allege that India was entering into the pact with the US to boost its nuclear arsenal from domestic resources.        
	The second slip of tongue was towards the end of the news conference when he took a question on how the government was coping with often-contradictory voices emerging from the ministers (P. Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh, Shashi Tharoor).        
	I welcome a dialogue between ministers and we are democracy; we are a country of a billion dollars, er, people and it is important that we should explore and take advantage of diverse opinion that may exist in a country as large, as complex and as diverse as India is, he replied.        
	Coming shortly after he rebutted the suggestion through a question that he was pro-American, wags in Vigyan Bhavan commented slyly that he was seeing American currency in his countrymen.        
	Controversies have rarely dogged the Prime Minister from his utterances at public events. Of the two that have stuck somewhat are his expression of the deep love of the Indian people to George Bush in September 2008 when the US President was really hitting rock bottom in world opinion and, second, his July 2005 lecture at Cambridge University when he said it is possible for an Indian Prime Minister to assert that Indias experience with Britain had it beneficial consequences too.        
	There were probably more gaffes by journalists and more discomfiture among them than in the personality of Manmohan Singh, sitting solitary on the flower-bedecked stage of the vast Vigyan Bhavan auditorium.        
	There were nearly 600 journalists  hierarchically segmented  by the PMO that arranged the conference. The first two rows were reserved for officials and ministers followed by the rows for editors and bureau chiefs. On the same assignment, journalism is usually a great leveler, with the seniormost editor and the juniormost scribe qualifying equally to be reporter.        
	But such ethics were forgotten by a few who made use of valuable time with the Prime Minister to push their own agenda. A foreign correspondent from a Japanese newspaper  one of the lucky few to have been called by the Singhs media adviser Harish Khare to ask a question  chose to use the opportunity to urge Manmohan Singh to speak to the information and broadcasting ministry to make press accreditation cards easier because it took me a long time, 20 minutes, to get into this venue.        
	No less than three journalists actually congratulated the Prime Minister on completing the first year of his second term in office.        
	One of them did so not only on behalf of my newspaper but also on behalf of the people of Tamil Nadu. It was rare to see a reporter appropriating for himself the right to represent the people of a whole state in which other media and journalists are chaotically active as well.        
	Frivolous questions were thrown at him too, just to get a quotable quote. One Hindi newspaper journalist asked what it was like for him to be under the constant gaze of two women, his wife, Gursharan Kaur, and the Congress President, Sonia Gandhi.        
	I am privileged to have advice from Shrimati Sonia Gandhiji and my wife. Both deal with different subjects and I welcome their advice, he said as titters went around the hall.        
	The Prime Minister said he was not looking for a role in the history books. He was asked if he wondered about his legacy  his first term as Prime Minister was overshadowed by the row with the Left and the civilian nuclear deal with the US.        
	Im not really bothered by legacy issues. I have a task to accomplish. I am trying to do that to the best of my ability. For the rest, the legacy or what are the issues for legacy, it is for the historians to pronounce judgements, he signed off.

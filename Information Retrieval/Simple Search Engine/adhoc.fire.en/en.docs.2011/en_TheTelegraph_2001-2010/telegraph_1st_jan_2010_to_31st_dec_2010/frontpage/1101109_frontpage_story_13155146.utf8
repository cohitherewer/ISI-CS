          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                              
	New Delhi, Nov 8: It was a line he had come prepared to draw under the gaze of his Superpower guest from Washington. Employing some of the strongest language yet in relation to Pakistan, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made known today that New Delhi will not engage with Islamabad until it moves away from terror-induced coercion.        
	 He was responding to a question asked of both him and President Barack Obama on the Kashmir question and its shadow on Indo-Pak ties. Singh agreed with Obama in principle that a strong, peaceful and moderate Pakistan was in Indias interest and reiterated his commitment to engaging with the neighbour on all issues including the word-K (desk: not K-word, he said word-K, thanks).         
	Then came his caveat, spoken out in cold, unequivocal terms as Obama looked on: We cannot be talking while the terror machine is active. Once Pakistan moves away from terror-induced coercion, we shall be happy to engage.        
	 This is the firmest conditional closure the Prime Minister has put on dialogue with Pakistan since signing the Sharm al Sheikh agreement, damned by many as a sellout of Indian interests because it was perceived as a concession to Pakistan in the sense that it delinked the dialogue process from the terror issue.         
	Since then, Manmohan Singh has repeatedly clarified that though he is ready walk the extra mile and meet Pakistan more than half way, he will not do so at the cost of Indias security interests.        
	 President Obamas meditated refrain from collaring Pakistan on the terror issue could well have played a role, albeit subtle, in the toughened tone Prime Minister Singh adopted today.        
	 As one foreign office functionary said, We understand President Obamas reasons for restraint, diplomatic as well as strategic, in taking the position that he has on Indian soil.         
	Equally, we think we are right to state our position on the matter forthrightly.        
	Sources indicate that there was a thought-out and specific purpose to the Prime Minister making his statement on Pakistan in Obamas presence. It was to say, in full view of the President, that even though we remain committed to engagement, we are more than unhappy with the progress Pakistan has made on addressing serious grievances on terror.        
	 But if the Prime Minister was trying to send a please begin behaving signal to Islamabad, it was lost in translation. Reacting to the Prime Ministers hardened message, Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmoom Qureshi, issued regulation promises that enjoy little credibility in India. We condemn terror and we do not allow our soil to be used against any country, including India, Qureshi said. Asked whether his government was prepared to dismantle terror groups functioning from Pakistan, he responded from a position of deeper denial: We are facing a situationthere are terror groups in India too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gujarat vs Solapur in Kochi consortium
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Gujarat vs Solapur in Kochi consortium
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI AND RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                        
	April 15: A power tussle has erupted in the Kochi IPL consortium with the Gujarat lobby that holds majority stake claiming to have taken charge of the management.         
	The team had so far been in the hands of Shailendra Gaikwad, a businessman from Solapur with relatively modest credentials compared with the powerhouse owners of the other franchises.         
	Kochi team sources said Harshad Mehta, one of the owners of Rosy Blue Diamond, would be the chairman of the franchise. Keshav T, a representative of the Rosy Blue-promoted Film Waves, has been appointed chief executive officer in place of Shailendra, who, along with cousin Satyajit Gaikwad, had so far been the public face of the consortium.        
	However, Satyajit scoffed at the claim.  
	Shailendra will remain permanent CEO of the consortium. Mischievous elements are spreading rumours that my brother has been removed. As for me, I am spokesperson as of this moment, Satyajit said.        
	Shailendra, who ran an automobile service business and a cricket academy in Maharashtras Solapur, 450km from Mumbai, floated Rendezvous Sports World which was part of the consortium that bagged the Kochi team for a staggering $333.33 million (Rs 1,533 crore) last month.        
	Kochi team sources said the majority stakeholders, a motley bunch of Gujarati businessmen connected by kinship and business interests, decided to take over the reins as they were fed up with the political war raging over Rendezvouss equity distribution.        
	They hold stakes, so they are in the franchise, but contrary to what we decided earlier, they will not run the franchise any more. We will, said one of the Kochi team owners who is a Mumbai-based businessman.                    Income-tax officials at Modis office in Mumbai on Thursday. (PTI)      
	However, Jayant Kotalwar, one of the Rendezvous equity holders, appeared to be aware that a management change was in the offing.         
	Has it been announced? I didnt know it would be announced today. It is better if you speak to Shailendra regarding this, Kotalwar told The Telegraph from the US.        
	The first rumblings within the Kochi team emerged just a little before Parliament convened for the budget session this morning. An IPL source told The Telegraph that under political pressure, the cash-rich industrialists  a set of businessmen operating in Maharashtra and Gujarat  were keen to back an Ahmedabad team and indicated as much to some IPL officials.        
	A little after midday, when The Telegraph got in touch with one of the Kochi team promoters  Gujarat-based businessman Mukesh Patel, who owns a ship-breaking firm called Shri Ram Vessels  he sounded panic-stricken.        
	They are here, the income-tax people. They are running amok through my office. What should I do  I need security. There are politicians behind all this. I fear for my life, shrieked the otherwise reticent Patel.        
	Income-tax sources confirmed they had visited the premises of Parinee Developers, a realty company owned by one Vipul Shah.        
	Parinee holds 26 per cent stake in IPL Kochi and is a special purpose vehicle of Shri Ram Vessels. We need to check the money trail, said the tax official.        
	Around the time the raids were being carried out, Satyajit Gaikwad, the Kochi team spokesman, launched a vicious attack on Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and his BJP colleague Vasundhara Raje, saying the duo were behind IPL boss Lalit Modis opposition to the Kochi team.         
	Satyajit, a former Congress MP from Vadodara, had made overtures to the BJP after his party lost support in Gujarat but had been snubbed by Narendra Modi.        
	Rendezvous Sports has nothing to hide. Some of our franchisees were pressured by powerful people to shift base out of Kochi. It seems Narendra Modi and Lalit Modi have become Modi square. They are trying to target us, Satyajit told reporters in New Delhi.        
	A source in the Kochi team revealed that it was precisely after this that all the stake-holders other than those featuring in the motley Rendezvous group decided to make changes in the team management.        
	Satyajit is a politician. He is not a stakeholder. Who has given him the liberty to speak on our behalf? We are here to do business, not get into a political quagmire. So we decided to take charge of the team affairs and shunt out Shailendra Gaikwad for using Satyajit as spokesperson without our permission, said the Kochi team source.        
	Satyajit later told a TV channel that he was convinced Narendra Modi was not behind the IPL versus Kochi franchise fiasco, but by then the damage had been done.         
	The Gujarat businessmen decided to remove Shailendra as CEO and replace him with Keshav T. He is a representative of Harshad Mehta, one of the owners of Rosy Blue Diamond and an investor in the Kochi IPL.        
	Mehta, who has taken over as chairman of the franchise, heads the Dubai operations of Rosy Blue, among the worlds largest diamond firms with offices in Antwerp and Mumbai.        
	The new management sought to control damage by saying the Gujarat government had extended all help to the consortium.        
	The Gujarat government has been in touch with us and has even offered us stadiums in the state as Kochi does not have a stadium yet. It is very kind. We are in IPL as it is a business  it does not matter whether we are in Kochi or Ahmedabad, said the Kochi source.        
	The placatory noises came hours after Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawars assertion that key members of the Kochi IPL franchise wanted the team to be based in Ahmedabad instead of in the Kerala city.

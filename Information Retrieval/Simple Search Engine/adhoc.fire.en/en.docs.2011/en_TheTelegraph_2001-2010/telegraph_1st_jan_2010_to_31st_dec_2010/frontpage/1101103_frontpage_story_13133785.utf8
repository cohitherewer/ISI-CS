The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tolly trio trek into Maoist mindscape
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Tolly trio trek into Maoist mindscape
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Tara                      Aagunpakhi                      Ghuri                                   
	The Maoist heat in south Bengal has singed the studios of Tollygunge.        
	Three Tollywood directors have gone deep into Maoist territory for their upcoming films, each following a different path. The common ground? The topicality of the subject.        
	If Bratya Basus Tara tacitly supports the rebel war cry with weapons to rid the system of corruption, Subhrajit Mitra in Aagunpakhi looks for the reasons that compel a common man to take up arms and Riingo steers his camera to brutal effect in Ghuri.        
	My film reflects our turbulent times. Tara is my protest against Maoist terror (santrash) as well as the terror unleashed by the joint forces in Lalgarh. Both should stop. I have also shown the internal ideological conflicts within the Maoists and stressed that the resolution is through love for the people. If I have supported the Maoists in any way, I havent done so consciously, said Bratya, a Trinamul sympathiser, who is hoping to get Mamata Banerjee to his films premiere on November 5.        
	If she does attend the screening this Friday, the Trinamul Congress chief is likely to leave the hall with the hint of a smile, as the political barbs in Tara are all aimed at the ruling party. Red flags and clippings of Ganashakti adorn the chamber of a corrupt political leader, who runs a gang of henchmen terrorising para clubs and casting false votes.        
	Bratya blames the police-politician nexus for much of the rot in the system. We have seen corrupt chief ministers and police officers in so many films before. My film is realistic fiction, said the theatre director-turned-filmmaker.        
	Prosenjit and Bratya play rebel leaders in Tara, which also stars Tota Roy Chowdhury and Paoli Dam.        
	For Subhrajit, it was the desire to tell a story of the exploitation of the have-nots that took the shape of Aagunpakhi. Rituparna Sengupta plays a documentary filmmaker caught in the crossfire between the Maoists and police. All the incidents and characters in the film are true. I have shown how people below the poverty line are exploited by the state and society. Also, the two faces of the police  one is sensitive to the Maoist cause but doesnt believe in the philosophy of killing for justice; the other is the indifferent policeman who is not corrupt but resorts to severe physical violence, said Subhrajit, eyeing a December release.        
	Based on Khaled Hosseinis novel The Kite Runner, Ghuri has a fictitious name and place for the rebels, with Riingo piecing together news reports  from child abuse to random killing of informants  to highlight the atrocities carried out in the rebel dens.        
	People are now scared of setting foot in Purulia and I have woven the Maoist problem into the main plot as it is topical. The hero (Joy Sengupta) in Ghuri is a cowardly author who dares to walk into a Maoist den to save a child. But I havent undermined the Maoist cause and the message is of peace and understanding, said Riingo.        
	What does a burning social issue making inroads into the world of commercial films signal? Instead of the whole escapist exercise of romantic films, it is good if mainstream films have a reflection of the reality. The (Maoist) issue is affecting ordinary people and more directors making films on this subject means people will get different kinds of opinions and have the option to come to their own conclusions, said Gopalan Mullick, the head of the department of film studies at St Xaviers College.

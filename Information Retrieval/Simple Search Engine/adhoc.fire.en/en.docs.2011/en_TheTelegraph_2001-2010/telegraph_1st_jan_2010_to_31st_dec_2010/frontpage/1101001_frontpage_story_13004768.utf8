                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                How the three judges ruled
                                            
	How the three judges  Justice Dharam Veer Sharma, Justice Sibghat Ullah Khan and Justice Sudhir Agarwal  ruled on some of the issues relating to the Ayodhya title suit:        
	Was the disputed site the birthplace of Ram?        
	Sharma: Yes.        
	Agarwal amp; Khan: (They did not give a direct answer, but see their answers to the next question.)              
	Have the Hindus been worshipping the disputed site as Rams birthplace from time immemorial?        
	Sharma: Yes.        
	Khan: For a very long time till the mosque was built, it was treated/believed by Hindus that Rams birthplace was situated somewhere in a very large area, of which the disputed premises are a very small part. The belief did not relate to any specified small area  specifically, the premises in dispute  within that bigger area.         
	But sometime after the mosque was built, Hindus started identifying the disputed premises as Rams exact birthplace, or a place wherein the exact birthplace was situated.         
	Agarwal: The birthplace, as believed and worshipped by Hindus, is the area covered under the central dome of the three-domed disputed structure in the inner courtyard on the disputed premises.               
	Was the disputed (demolished) building a mosque?         
	Sharma: It was built against the tenets of Islam, so it cannot have the character of a mosque.         
	Khan: It was built as a mosque by or under orders of Babar. There is no direct evidence that the disputed premises, including the constructed portion, belonged to Babar or the person who built the mosque.        
	Agarwal: Disputed structure was always treated, considered and believed to be a mosque and practised by Mohammedans for worship accordingly.                
	When was the disputed structure built and by whom?        
	Sharma: It was built by Babar, but the year is not certain.        
	Khan: (See Khans answer to previous question.)        
	Agarwal: It has not been proved that it was built during the reign of Babar in 1528. In the absence of any otherwise pleadings and material, it is difficult to hold when and by whom the disputed structure was constructed. This much is clear that it was built before the visit by Joseph Tieffenthaler to Oudh between 1766 and 1771.         
	Was the disputed structure built on the site of a Hindu temple after demolishing it?        
	Sharma: Disputed structure built on site of older structure after demolishing it. The Archaeological Survey of India has proved the older building was a massive Hindu religious structure.        
	Khan: No temple was demolished for constructing the mosque. Mosque was constructed over the ruins of temples. These temples were lying in utter ruins for a very long time before the mosque was built, and some of their material was used in building the mosque.        
	Agarwal: The disputed building was constructed after demolition of a non-Islamic religious structure, that is, a Hindu temple.                 
	Were the idols placed in the building on the night of December 22-23, 1949, or were they there since before?        
	Sharma, Khan and Agrawal: They were placed there on the night of December 22-23, 1949.              
	Were the title suits time-barred?         
	Sharma: Suits of the Sunni Central Wakf Board, Gopal Singh Visharad and Nirmohi Akhara are all time-barred. Only the suit filed on behalf of Ram Lalla Virajman by (the late) Deoki Nandan Agarwal is not time-barred.        
	Khan: (Does not answer this.)         
	Agarwal: Only Sunni Central Wakf Boards suit is time-barred; the others suits are well within the limitation period.                      
	What is the status of the disputed site  the inner and outer courtyard?        
	Sharma: Hindus in general had (sic) the right to worship Charan, Sita Rasoi, other idols and other object of worship (that) existed on the property in suit. It is proved that the outer courtyard was in exclusive possession of Hindus, and they were worshipping there throughout. They were also doing worship in the inner courtyard (in the disputed structure), which cannot be treated as a mosque.        
	Khan: Ram Chabutra and Sita Rasoi came into existence much before 1855, and Hindus were worshipping there. It was very, very unique and absolutely unprecedented that inside the mosques boundary wall and compound, Hindu religious places existed and that worship went on there along with offerings of namaz by Muslims in the mosque.         
	Even though Muslims and Hindus were using and occupying different portions of the disputed premises for the sake of convenience, it still did not amount to formal partition and both continued to be in joint possession of the entire premises in dispute.        
	Both parties have failed to prove commencement of their title. Hence by virtue of Section 110 of the Evidence Act, both are held to be joint title-holders on the basis of joint possession.         
	Agarwal: The disputed building was not used by Muslims exclusively. After 1856-57, the outer courtyard was used exclusively by Hindus and the inner courtyard was visited for the purpose of worship by members of both the communities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM picks 5 with stress   on clawback
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CPM picks 5 with stress   on clawback
          BISWAJIT ROY                                    
	Calcutta, Jan. 31: The CPM today inducted a record five new members into its state secretariat at one go, including the first woman to enter the powerful panel, but failed to keep its promise of grooming a young leadership.        
	The average age of the new members, who have raised the secretariats strength to 18, is 60. The new faces include city unit member Rabin Deb and womens wing leader Shyamali Gupta.        
	The oldest is West Midnapore district committee secretary Dipak Sarkar and the youngest his Howrah counterpart Sreedip Bhattacharya. The fifth member and the third district committee secretary to be inducted is Nripen Choudhury from Murshidabad.        
	Is this an example of grooming a younger leadership? asked a leader from North 24-Parganas.        
	Party state secretary Biman Bose, who had been harping on bringing young and dynamic leaders up the hierarchy, claimed that most of the new members were under 60 and that Bhattacharya was not even 50.        
	The expansion had become imperative because of the death of Jyoti Basu and Subhas Chakraborty and the poor health of some members.        
	The choice of new members underlines the leaderships decision to promote those who would fight the Opposition onslaught and try and retain turf. In what is being seen as a rebuff, not a single berth went to East Midnapore or the two 24-Parganas, where the party had been routed in recent polls.        
	That none of the new members is from north Bengal highlights the partys priority, which is to fight the Trinamul Congress in south Bengal.        
	Party sources said Rabin Debs inclusion came through despite some hiccups because of his skills as an organiser.        
	Sarkar, a professor known for his hard-line approach to the Keshpur-Garbeta turf wars with Trinamul at the turn of the century, had been a long-time contender for a secretariat berth. He was rewarded for his district units efforts to retaliate against the Maoist attacks.        
	Peasant leader Choudhury was elevated apparently because of the Murshidabad units success in wresting the zilla parishad and in curbing Congress strongman Adhir Chowdhurys hegemony.        
	Howrahs Bhattacharya, an engineer by training, is considered an emerging ideologue with organisational skills and tech savvy.        
	Gupta is close to the politburos lone woman member, Brinda Karat, who, along with other women CPM leaders, has been pressing for higher representation of the gender in the still overwhelmingly male-dominated hierarchy.        
	Gupta, however, had earlier been criticised within the party for keeping in touch with satta don Rashid Khan, who has been in jail after a blast in the early 1990s.        
	Complaints of regional imbalance were heard, too. For some, the over-representation of Calcutta  six members including two of the new ones  and Burdwan (four members) reflected the city-centric composition of the state leadership. Minority representation remained confined to one member  Mohammad Salim.

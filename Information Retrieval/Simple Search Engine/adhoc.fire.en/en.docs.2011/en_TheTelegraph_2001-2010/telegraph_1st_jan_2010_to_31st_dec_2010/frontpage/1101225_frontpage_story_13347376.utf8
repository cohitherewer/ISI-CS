The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CBI knocks at 7am
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CBI knocks at 7am
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 24: The moment the CBI team arrived at breakfast, Suresh Kalmadi knew his day was scrambled.        
	The agency today raided the Congress MPs homes and offices in New Delhi, Mumbai and Pune and put him through an eight-hour grilling over Commonwealth Games corruption.        
	They searched the Mumbai and Pune offices of his younger brother Mukesh  also a sitting Congress MP  but left untouched the family business: the Sai Service auto showrooms. The Kalmadi brothers had self-avowedly built their fortune with Sai, the countrys biggest Maruti dealership.        
	We are awaiting our bosses nod before he (Kalmadi) can be arrested. Arresting somebody is the next stage, a CBI officer said.        
	Kalmadi, 66, the Games organising committee chairperson, had just sat down to his first meal of the day when a seven-member CBI team turned up at his Delhi residence at 7am. We requested him to finish his breakfast (before questioning started) and he did, an officer said.        
	The raids come after a recent CBI claim about many incriminating documents having either been destroyed or smuggled out of the organising committee office.        
	Asked if the raid, coming 10 weeks after the Games and four months after the corruption allegations broke, might not be too little too late, a CBI officer replied with a riddle: Seized documents are always incriminating.... In this time of scams and irregularities, everything seems to be incriminating.        
	Sources said the CBI had seized incriminating documents and Kalmadis personal computer.        
	Sleuths also searched Kalmadis 14th-floor flat in Mumbais Worli where his brother Mukesh lives, the family home in Pune, and their farmhouse at nearby Khadakvasla.        
	Kalmadis wife Meera, who was at their Pune home during the 7am raid, co-owns the restaurant complex Bistro with socialite Bina Ramani in Delhis Hauz Khas.        
	But surprisingly, the CBI officials (who came down from Delhi) could not trace Mukesh. They need to question him as he runs the family businesses, a CBI source in Mumbai said. He said the agency knew that Mukeshs son was in Mahabaleshwar today but did not contact him to find out where his father was.        
	Mukesh, 62, has been a Congress Lok Sabha MP for the past decade after spending 12 years in the Rajya Sabha, mostly as member of the erstwhile Congress (Socialist). He was once close to Sharad Pawar.        
	Mukesh had begun his career with a small cafe, Pune Coffee Shop, where he would sit at the counter. Now he owns Bajaj two-wheeler showrooms, the three-star Hotel Sadanand in Pune and two petrol pumps. He is building a commercial complex in Pune. The CBI raided many of these places.

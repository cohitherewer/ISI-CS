          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Sept. 4: Police resorted to a mild lathicharge to disperse a crowd at Bokajan railway station in Karbi Anglong district early this morning.         
	The crowd was protesting against an alleged rape attempt by a Railway Protection Force (RPF) jawan on a 20-year-old on the Delhi-bound Brahmaputra Mail. The jawan, Ram C. Das, has been detained.         
	The train was delayed for over 90 minutes following the incident.         
	Police said Das allegedly tried to gag the victim and drag her to the toilet early this morning when the girl had left her berth.         
	However, she managed to raise a hue and cry following which the other passengers rescued her from the clutches of the jawan, a police official at Bokajan police station said.         
	The girl had boarded the train at Tinsukia along with her younger brother. The duo were on their way to Guwahati.         
	The official said the passengers of the train gathered at the station and started beating up Das till his colleagues extricated him.         
	The passengers did not allow the train to move until the jawan was arrested. We had to use force to control the situation, the official said.         
	The guilty jawan was detained at the station.         
	 Arun Dhadaria, a co-passenger of the 4055 Down Brahamptura Mail, said the jawan had harassed the girl ever since she boarded the train.         
	An elderly woman passenger even offered to share her berth with the girl when she saw the jawan troubling her, Dhadaria said.         
	Around 5.30am, when the girl was on her way to the toilet, the jawan tried to gag her and drag her inside. We came to her rescue, he added.

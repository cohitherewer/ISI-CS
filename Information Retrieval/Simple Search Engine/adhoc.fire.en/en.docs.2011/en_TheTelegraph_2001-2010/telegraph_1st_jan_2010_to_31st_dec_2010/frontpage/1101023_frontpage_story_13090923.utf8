The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Selective shutdown of fans spills out
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Selective shutdown of fans spills out
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 22: Metro Railway had shut down fans that blow fresh air into the tunnel, the outgoing general manager said today hours after The Telegraph reported such a move might have played a role in making people feel suffocated when they were trapped after the derailment on Wednesday.        
	They (the fans) are shut depending on the number of passengers, Amar Nath added moments after saying the ventilator fans were run at all times.         
	The disclosure came around 4pm, an hour after he had been transferred from his post at Metro Bhavan.         
	When the number of passengers is less, we shut them (the ventilator fans), Amar Nath said. We closely monitor the system and these (fans) are regulated depending on the amount of oxygen (in the tunnel).        
	When The Telegraph visited a Metro station last evening at what should be the peak hour, the fans were shut. An official charged with handling the machines had said they were run for half an hour to one hour every day to keep them in working condition. That official at least did not know of any monitoring of oxygen levels.        
	Minutes before on Thursday, the Metro spokesperson had denied that the fans had been shut down. Our entire ventilation system, including the fans, work all the time during the services. There is no question of shutting them down, he said.        
	Metro sources conceded that the move to switch off the fans was aimed at saving power and ensuring they did not diminish the effect of the air-conditioners on the platforms.        
	Power is the single biggest expenditure head for any underground railway and Calcutta Metro is no exception. About 55 per cent of its annual expenditure is on electricity, an official said.        
	But several officials suggested that switching off the fans to save power was not correct. The accident has shown us that the move is not correct, an official said.        
	Lack of oxygen in the tunnel after the derailment could have killed people, critical care experts have said. Many people had been brought out of the tunnel gasping for breath. Two of them had to be taken to hospital.         
	Amar Nath told the news conference today: There are reports about suffocation but the panic among passengers had led to the suffocation.         
	A Metro official, however, said the lack of fresh air in the tunnel had also been exposed when passengers felt out of breath when a train got stalled outside Sovabazar station on October 12.         
	In his last announcement before leaving Metro Bhavan, Amar Nath promised an upgrade of the gasping Metros air-circulation system. A new study to upgrade the ventilation system is undergoing and work is on to install a new heat exhaust system.        
	Kaushik Guha Roy, 43, who was in the derailed train and gasping for breath, said: Why did they have to put so many lives at stake before realising the mistake? I saw so many people pass out. I was myself semi-conscious when I came out.         
	Senior Metro officials went from station to station today to inspect the air supply in the tunnels.         
	The suffocation of passengers also came up at the meetings of a four-member team from Delhi that is in Calcutta to probe the derailment. The delegation of Railway Board officials inspected the damaged rake and the Central station, where the derailment occurred, and spoke to the maintenance staff. The officials have been told to submit a report by Monday.        
	Amar Nath denied that Wednesdays derailment was the first in 26 years. Flashing a sheaf of paper, he said: There were three incidents of derailment earlier. There has been quite a gap between the last derailment and the latest one because of the safety measures adopted by Metro Railway.        
	Several senior Metro officials  past and present  could not recall another instance of a train with passengers jumping rails.
